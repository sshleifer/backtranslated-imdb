The "broken bow" returns us where it all started. Put 150 years into our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This installation of Star Trek franchise is, in my opinion, the first series of "TOS" to feel the sense of wonder, danger and excitement "Let's go where nobody passed." Scott Bakula is perfectly acting as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the whole actor really show genuine respect for the legacy of Star Trek. John Billingslei is Brilliant as an alien Dr. Phlok, and Jolene Blalock is totally cute as a tempting but logical volcanic science journalist T'Pol. Broken Bov is, in my opinion, the best episode of any Trek, and I believe Gene Roddenberri would certainly be proud.
