I watched this film by Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hei Good Lookin), one night at www.afrovideo.org, and I did not see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit that the designs of the characters are a bit rough and unexpected today, but I think it's It's a satire and very, very urban story about Remus's old stories that black American culture was created all the way to the main characters and obviously nodding on Tar Tar and The Briar Patch. These are not stories, but cultural icons that have created black Americans, and I read and love these stories as a white man. I also found an interesting look at the black culture in Harlem in New York in the 1970s. So let's get to the thick film: This film is a live action / animated film, which begins in a live action with a colleague named Sampson (Barri Wahite) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone) trying to help his friend, Randi (Philip Michael Thomas) escaped from prison, but ended up blocking himself in a shootout with the police. While waiting, Randi listens to his colleague Pappi (Scatman Crothers) as he begins to talk to Randy about an animated story about Brother Rabbit, a young newcomer in a big city that rises rapidly from darkness to rule all Harlem; For me, Rabbit, Bear and Fok are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and Preacherman. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and action videos live, the film is a graphic and condemning stereotype satire that prevailed in the 70s? racial, ethnic and otherwise. So, this is another good Bakshi film; and do you need to sweep movies like this under the carpet? pretend they never exist? hmmm ... I think it would be a shame; I think we should watch these films pulled down, and learn about what's happening then, how far from then we are coming.
