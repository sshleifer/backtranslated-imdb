I have to start apologizing because I thought that the first 75-80% of this movie was hilarious. This is mainly due to the performance of Brad Pitt. Spot on. The performance of all the participants was pretty good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in every way. I'm not a giant Pitt fan, but this is one of his best roles ever. Brutal, honest, odorless. All good words to describe this movie. I read the previous review and the person said that the explanation of early violence was not explained. This is explained, but, fortunately, they do not have to enter graphic details to reach their point. I think humor in the first half is perfect for this movie. Underrated.
