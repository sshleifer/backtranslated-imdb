OK I'll be honest, when I first saw the trailer for the program, I thought it was a commercial for a sunscreen product. With all the people walking on the beach. Nevertheless, I decided to watch it, thinking it would be some new show I could laugh at. But I was seriously stunned. From the first 10 seconds of the program I am hooked, why is it on the trees, why is the plane crash, etc.? It is not everyday that there is a performance that combines intelligence, humor, action and uncertainty. But "Lost" manages all of these. With a great acting team, beautiful locations and pretty decent special effects, 'Lost' will catch anyone who turns on, and must be seen for anyone who is sick of raw sitcoms and the shitty reality of TV. Lost on Tuesdays in 10 on Channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
