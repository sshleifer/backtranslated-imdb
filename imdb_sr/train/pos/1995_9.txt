I've just seen it recently, after a period of almost forty years. It's a good thing, especially the extraordinary songs of Lionel Bart. ("Who will buy" with his magic counterpoint, just one of many standouts.) I disagree with another post that condemned his G rating. The rating system, at that time completely new, never intended that G (general) rating meant "completely devoid of conflict." Characterization as inappropriate for children reminds me of the description I once saw The Wizard of Oz: A girl arrives in a strange land and kills the first person she encounters with. Then he goes on a trip with three male escorts and kills again.
