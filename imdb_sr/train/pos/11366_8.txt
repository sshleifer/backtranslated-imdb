Great and unusual drama about hunting for the infamous Russian serial killer Andre Chikatil. The magnificent performance of Stephen Ree, a forensic scientist in charge of the investigation, who considers that the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, especially the old members of the Communist Party who want to keep a closed society. The film has a fundamental theme of the collapse of the communist society, and the progress in hunting the killer is reflected in the advances in social and political changes in Russia, which are subtly transmitted. There is a conflict of old roads and new roads, and they are presented with two views of Reina's superiors (played by Donald Sutherland) and Rea. They are initially polarized, with Sutherland 'high' in the system that looks down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause? To catch a serial killer. Throughout the film, the relationship between the two is developing, and the tension is gradually decreasing until the end of the film Rea and Sutherland, Rea and Sutherland respect each other, the killer is caught and Glasnost symbolically comes. Excellent script. Further credits belong to Sutherland's performance, which is wonderful and compassionate, Jeffrey DeMunn as a killer we despise but can not hate, and Maka Von Sidov, who is utterly convincing as a modest psychologist who risks his reputation to help.
