If the first film of Jean Renoir "Vhirlpool of Fate" first takes to the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of peasantry that will continue to explore, it seems only appropriate that his second film mainly deals with rich and privileged, higher layers and those who try to they turned up. Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great "Great Illusion" and "Game Rules". This is beautifully shot, with a restless camera that fully uses huge dwellings and backstage spaces that dominate the interior of the film, and the performance, though often overloaded, offers some great moments, especially by Verner Krauss Muffat. But the glamorous and spirited Mrs. Hesling, who at first glance seems to be able to give Luiz Brooks to run for her money in vampires, never goes beyond one note, a selfishly silly picture. Perhaps this is partly a problem with the script, which looks mainly for high scores and bitter emotions; Without reading the novel, I am not quite clear whether the elections are well-made or not. However, the differences between Nana's friars are well drawn, and I especially liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo's Vandeuvres - the tragic perception that each of them has its final destiny and their compassion for one another, especially in the scene at the bottom of a huge staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffata, and wondering if violence will break out - this and the other collection of the nonsense of an unemployed rich man gives the film the depth he has. Far from its greatest achievement, and for me is probably the shy overall "Vhirlpool of Fate," this is still worth seeing for Renoir fans or those who are generally interested in a quiet movie theater.
