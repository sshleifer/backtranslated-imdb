I finally set up a DVD for ordering mail so I could find movies that are not available in stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloney, as well as small, often ignored films. This is such a delicacy! Meloni has such a charm in this part. He easily holes in pigeons if you see him only as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is a non-existent middle life, who in various ways strikes the skates, only to find the path to happiness in someone unexpected. The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and the character of Tim Busfield is real, and not over. I have not seen Busfield since the 30th, and it was fun to watch him. But it was all Chris's film. I became such a fan girl again. At first it's a bit slow, I admit. I thought some of the "flashbacks" could be changed. But overall, this movie will delight you - male or female - because it has a sincere, refreshing view of relationships today.
