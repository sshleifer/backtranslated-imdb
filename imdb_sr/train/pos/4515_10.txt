That movie is absolutely fantastic !! If you watch it with your friends, it can be a very nice day ... Obviously you have to know that the movie is silly and very poorly directed and acting (Tomba / Unziker kakav par), and that is probably the worst movie in the world, but you can enjoy in him. We watched him at 19 and it was a very nice evening. The best scenes are the first, when criminals kill Alex's friend, and he tries to behave as desperate, and the result is a comic scene of the first category ... And then when he shows Levi (Antevleva, what name "Palassio di giusstissia" and then the accident The left, which once returns with its car from the road, and a second later, the car is completely empty! What a magic!
