I got this on the screening at the Sundance Film Festival and I was in Aveo over the absolute power this film has. It is an examination of the psychological effects of our brave soldiers who join the army with the hope that they will protect and serve our country with respect, and that our government will take care of it. The film talks about the psychological changes taking place in the training camp as soldiers turn into "killers for their land" and enter the war and the consequences when they return home. It also shows the effect that killing has on the human psyche. She honors Soldiers and never criticizes soldiers unlike other films, but criticizes a system that is not ready and does not care about all the physical and psychological needs of the returned veterans. This film is powerful, mobile, emotional and thoughtful. It is a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades, but also by listening to them and helping to change the way they care about their health and well-being after the end of the kill. Best Film Festival So far, **** / ****
