Another Austrian masterpiece, it deals with the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it is very good. It does not use great exaggerated effects such as American shifts, more focuses on emotional impact. A relatively simple plot by Rebecca Gibnei & Co. it is reviving. Follow the story of a couple buying an old house that was allegedly home to a very old woman who never went out and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things start to happen in the house, and John Adam begins to turn into a missing man, who was actually a mass killer. Recommended. 8/10
