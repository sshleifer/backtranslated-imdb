It might have been better for someone with more experience to do it. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but that's not a great piece of film art. However, this is a wonderful movie. I loved it because the local channels showed it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. From his novels and stories, some pretty bad films were made. (Many like "The Fallen Idol", but I'm not among them. I think I've seen Brighton Rock many years ago and I liked it, but maybe I'm just thinking about a novel.) This is a top class band. Charles Boer, this is not, it's true, it comes across as a Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character - tired, cautious, caring. Lauren Bacall is as attractive as a British girl who screws him up. But the supporters are the best: Katina Pakinou is great. Her performance is a small Grand Guignol, but I attributed it to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we meet for the first time while giving Boyer a lesson in a universal language similar to Esperanto, is excellent - as always. Vanda Hendrik can break the hardest heart. Comes as an early teenager. The guy wants to be helpful. She does her best. I recommend this film. Not without reserve. The reservation is, first and foremost, small. But story and acting hardly can be improved.
