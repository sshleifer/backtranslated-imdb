This western is a different way from most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Vioming to work for Rip Torna at her ranch. How this presents itself as the most interesting part of the Americana. I would prefer to see it on a big screen, not on a tape, but it's worth watching how life returned to the right one. Cinema is great. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell stands out in this movie.
