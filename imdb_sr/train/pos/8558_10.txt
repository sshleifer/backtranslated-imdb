Always enjoy the great acting of Drew Barrimore and her great performance in this film, where she plays a very complicated young girl (Holly Gooding), "skipping parts", 2000, which leaves New York and travels to California and shares a flat with an upcoming writer, George Nevbern, Patrick Highsmith, Far Harbor, '96. Many strange things begin to happen Holly and she wants to find her brother in a mental institution after killing her father. If you look close enough, you will see that Drev Barrimore's mother in real life appears as her mother in this picture. If there was no good acting by Drew Barrimore and George Nevbern, this movie should be seen only at Night Halloween! However, there are certain surprises in KRAJ !!!!
