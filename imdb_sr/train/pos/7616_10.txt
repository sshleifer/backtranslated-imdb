This is an innovative television drama; which easily connects a convincing story, a brilliantly drawn character development, humor, romance and drama in each episode. This is a show singing on its own melody, regardless of whether the audience decided to follow it or not. How many other shows on TV these days boldly change the tone from one season to the next? Where most other best shows on this website have found a working formula that brings viewers and dollars and stuck as a glue for that formula (Prison Break, 24, and Desperate Housevives come to mind) - LOST takes different routes where even after the achievement of this plateau and winning formula, the team of executive producers is courageous enough to fully reflect the shov in order to serve his higher goal of convincing narrative. LOST here is different from normal TV. This is so provocative of conventional TV. And this is why LOST is one of the most advanced and innovative creations of modern television. Forget about the challenges - LESS, it has been, and will always be, to calm your cult after the first and general public. But this is proof that the inventiveness has been given to a fan base that consists of the best audience.
