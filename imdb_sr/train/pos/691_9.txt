I'll come clean. The only reason I found out about this DVD is because Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought it would be ... different, maybe not so good. But I was wrong. After reading what was a few short comments, I was actually excited to see it. I sent a copy as soon as possible and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say I was not disappointed. The film follows Jack's, insomnia, often troubled by the conditions that bring him to doubt in reality and everything in his head. I will not give away what is happening, but I will tell you that a movie can sometimes be terrifying in its realism. The director is fantastic, focusing on what matters to the story, and not letting it lose every moment for fun or thinking. All in all, this great movie 9 out of 10 gives a lot more than what I thought would be short.
