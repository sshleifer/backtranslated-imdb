Yes, I remember this! For many years since I watched it. The story was completely unreal, but still great! What anyone who evaluates and evaluates films should keep in mind what this film aims at. The same goes for the "First Child", which follows a similar pattern. Certain films - like this here - aim only for ordinary and comical nonsense. Such films can not be evaluated from the point of view of a hypercritical critics. Of course, these films lack quality, they lack a sophisticated story, they often lack the acting in the first class, but if they fulfill their basic premise - that's fine. I do not have this movie here on the list of all favorites of all time, but I still thought it was funny, I had some very nice sequences and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is anyway a smart actor.
