Third and in my opinion, the best of the Blackadder series. The only disadvantage is that there is no Lord Percy who was the funniest figure from the previous series, but Prince Regent Hugh Laurie is appropriately crazy about laughter. As a package it's quality through and through with convincing regent sets, extraordinary sarcasm for cutting and the small parts of the wacky, 'macbeth' actors who emerge and Prince Georges 'lucky us' chicken impression, and the missing words from the dictionary of Dr. Johnson. A little comedy was as wise as a funny, fine, unusual observation or line coming into line, but mostly it's screaming.
