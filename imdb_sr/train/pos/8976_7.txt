Starlift is a pleasant and interesting return to all the stellar music images that each studio exhibited during the Second World War. When you have such stars as Gary Cooper, James Cagnei, Doris Dai, Gordon MacRae, Randolph Scott, etc., In film and with such people as Brothers Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jule Stine and Sammy Cahn, it's easy to make a movie . And the shop is not even on the way. What a plot that includes two soldiers, Dick Vesson and Ron Hagerthi, who are trying to get to know Starlet Brothers Starlet Janice Rule using as a trick the fact that both come from Ioungstovn, Ohio and Hagerthi's father was the Rule of the Dentist, as well as half of the city. The schema works well because Louella Parsons soon puts them as an item in its column. Yes, and Louella is in the movie. She must have liked Varner Brothers or Jack Varner more than other studio bosses, as she also used this studio to announce Hollivood Hotel's radio program at the time. But the rest of the plot also touched on real efforts by Ruth Roman to play herself in order to conduct her studies and other shows at the Air Force bases for soldiers and women who leave for Korea. Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and perform in the show at the Travis Air Force Base where a large part of this film was shot. A number of specialties were filmed for Phil Harris talents singing / telling a ballad Watching a stranger, I'm a Texas Rangers with the help and support of Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoi and Garry Cooper. Yes, Cooper looked like he had old old times joking his image. This is the oldest clich√© when you say that they do not do it anymore, but really not because you do not have a studio system that has all these talents by contract. This is one thing about the decline of the old study system that we can complain about.
