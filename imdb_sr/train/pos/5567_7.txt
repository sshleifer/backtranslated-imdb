I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to be fit for television, he was very reckless. ALL ABOUT MEDICINAL PRODUCTS AND EXCLUSIVELY !!! How are they doing, are you wondering? Well, they do not do it well, that's for sure. In any case, instead of the marijuana that Cheech and Chong are supposed to have, they say they have diamonds! However, the characters go around in the smoke of smoke marijuana stoning others on their way without any explanation!
