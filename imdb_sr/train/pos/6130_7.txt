Amazingly good. The acting was fun, the scenario was fun, music was cheesie party, the plot was incredibly fun. This was a fun movie to watch and give your brain a little rest. Parts of the shop and quotes were very creative to me. 7 out of 10. In fact, for what it was, it would have deserved 10 out of ten. You should not compare this to an arthouse movie or a damn movie.
