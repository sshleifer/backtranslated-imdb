In one of her first films, Romney Schneider shines as young Queen Victoria British, as she suddenly put on a throne at the age of 18, learns to rule despite the machinations of politicians, and eventually romances and marries Prince Albert Saxon. Kitschi and camps (though surprisingly true to real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Watching this film about British royal speakers in German contributes to his strange charm. On this front, he wondered why an Austrian film about the English queen was made; but then you remember that in 1954, Austria was still occupied by allied troops, including the British. Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
