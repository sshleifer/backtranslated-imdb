This is better than an average silent movie and still worth seeing if you are a lover of silence. However, if you are not yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few more films before you look at this. This is because the action just seems old-fashioned and it's hard to believe in the spots. But, in spite of that, it's still a good movie and it has kept my interest. The beautiful lady unfortunately clinked to the wrong man and ran away to marry him. The film began five years later after realizing that he was a really brutal thief. Nevertheless, she tries to get the best out of it and does not think about how good a good life was before that jerk entered her life. However, the rent is paid and there is no money, so the lady is forced to look for a job. She becomes a personal tailor for a rich lady whose husband is trying to do business. Unfortunately, the lady they tried to connect with a potential client for dinner can not do it, and the tailor is well paid to be a man. Well, like Cinderella, it's good to clean and the man is in love with her! What do I do now-bearing in mind that she is actually married and that the new boy wants to marry her ?! Well, take a look at the movie yourself to see how everything is solved. I did not like how they treated their husband, as it seemed terribly predictable and clich√©ped. However, when he was on the road, I admire that the film also did not give up the finals in numbers and left the film with several free ends. All in all, a very good movie worth seeing, but certainly not great.
