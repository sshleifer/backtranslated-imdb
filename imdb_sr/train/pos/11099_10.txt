Chase created a real appearance with the Sopranos. Incredible performances, full composition and great music make what became perhaps the best ever. All the acting teams are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini have earned every centimeter of these Emmy. Anyone who doubts this should only take several episodes; especially from the first few seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce, absolutely terrifying, and you still feel that you love him - enchanted by him. Many people I've talked about about Sopranos (who have not seen it yet) will say, "I'm just not a fan of mafia movies / shows." Whatever. Run - do not walk - and take it. The same people usually like "E.R.", but I bet they do not care much about the hospitals ... It's not about the context.
