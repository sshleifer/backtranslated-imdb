Reading some of the comments on the bulletin boards, I expected this film to be completely disappointed - but when I looked at it, I could not stop laughing! It has officially become my new favorite movie. I do not know what's going on here, maybe because a movie of this kind has never been before. I do not have the strength to name another completely feminine comedy. Many comedies will have one or two actresses at the forefront, but there will be many supporting male characters. This was almost ALL of women - with the exception of Seth Meiers, Justin Hartley and a short appearance of Villa Arnett - and she did it. All actresses have delivered very funny performances (especially Missi Pile) from an unusual and cute scenario. women's success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and the violation of gender roles. Although carefree, each of the main characters faces the challenge as their attempts to be more "fun" conflicts with their feminist values ​​and those they know they are. The film missed the theater edition due to its female actor and the lack of a great actor to launch studies, and I have to agree. Everyone I recommended this film loved and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness is not widely accepted and successful. I recommend this film to anyone who has an open mind film or a love for a female comedy.
