Although I suppose this film could lead to a tail like Anti-Vietnam, while I watched it, I did not feel it was the case as much as the film was just a sincere look in the perspective of young boys who were training for the war that the public did not support. ... they showed their fear, their despair, their ride ... all this, in the open, naked. As a soldier, many topics rang in my experience in the military - especially in the training camp. On the whole, this film, although it was shot on a very small budget, looks great, is very well composed, and has great acting and directing. I recommend this film to anyone looking for a great Colin Farrell film. 10/10
