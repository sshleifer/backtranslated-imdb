"Shore Leave" is mostly an average Star Trek adventure. Nothing bad in this episode. I just do not think this is the best picture of what the show has had for fans. It's light and fun, nothing more. However, I am pleased to see that such a TV show has made enough sense to take a break from serious inter-tactical conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to authorize the crew for some free time, and the landing will descend on a planet that looks like a perfect place to rest. As usual, the planet is not as calm as it looks. There are some action and tense moments, but much of the story is a laugh. Good, but unusual.
