Although I do not agree with Bob and Tammy's decision to give up baby Jessie, and that's something I would never do, they tried to do what was best for the baby. The way this film is written, you see yourself wrapping up in a story and wondering what you really believe, from all different aspects. Patti Duke? Antagonist? Almost unknown, as far as I'm concerned. But during the film, she really assures you that she is psychotic, or at least something serious is wrong with her. Her character is meaning "emotionally disturbed". It seems that the film ends quickly, leaving things a bit unresolved. But in addition, this movie is really great. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you just want to refuse and relax and watch something sweet that will make you laugh. But it's a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from the perspective of others and discover something about yourself. Caution: you can even grow while watching this movie! And in the end everything is worth it.
