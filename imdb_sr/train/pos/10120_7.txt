The film begins somewhat like a less hyper-kinetic, more dead or alive pastir: strange underground activities are performed while the police discover the bodies. But when the policeman was killed, one Tatsuhito intertwines ... and when he finds that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get pretty fast. The earlier work of Miike's, the Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with its usual ultraviolet and sadistic sexual acts, although it is not one of its eclectic and glittering parts. Instead, it's a pretty well-developed fiction pulp, while Tatsuhito digs his way through the underworld, a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally acquired organs from Taiwan and holds the almost-brood of young boys (one particular character that kills a policeman at the beginning ). Tatsuhit's brother intertwines in that society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty policeman and use similar violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this dirty empire. What is mostly interesting about this little business is the relationship that Tatsuhito has with her enemy, Wang. Tatsuhito was a Japanese born in China, later returned to Japan and turned away for him. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, and he killed his father and developed a criminal wing in Japan. Wang is also a surprising shakespearean character, which is strange enough, and even less to start pacifying it until the moment when it ends with Tatsuhita. Tatsuhito himself is similarly a tragic figure when he is forced to fight with his lack of ability to control his brother. While it would be rude to claim that Miike's films are successful mainly on their shock values, it is true that it is sometimes easy to lose the trail of how Miike can create bitter, dis-passionate characters. - -PolarisDiB
