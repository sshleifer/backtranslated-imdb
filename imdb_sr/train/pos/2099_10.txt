This is wonderful - wonderful acting, sets, clothes, music - but first of all the story itself. I'm astounded that there's no more review of this movie - certainly one of the best 1980s. It's also a great movie to see in tandem with a large "Random Harvest" that has many same opening crisis - middle, unknown English VVI officer in hospital until the end of the war , suffer from shock shock and complete amnesia without any idea of ​​his name, origin, or wherever he belongs - proves himself to be a very rich man - when he "recovers" he will not remember the years before the war - <br /> < br /> But there movies end up. Thanks to everyone who took part in the film - especially to actors Ian Holmes, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (great and surprising choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. This remains forever.
