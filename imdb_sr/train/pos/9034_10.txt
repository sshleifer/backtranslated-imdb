This film is absolutely BRILLIANT !! Every performance in this film is great, especially Jake Gillenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr. Gillenhaal has a HUGE film career if it will be something. I thought Joe Johnston was an unusual choice as a director because he usually connects with big budget blockbusters (Jumanji, Honei, I cut children). It pulls every scene with a clean class. My favorite scene was where Homer went down the mine and looked into the sky, descending, as all his dreams were, it was wonderful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant, acting films, as well as his big budget block, which is also great. KUDOS !! to everyone involved in this masterpiece!
