I'm glad to see a movie that has seen some of the other directors in the past. I thought the value of production was as great as costumes and bridge items. It was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demon was treated. I agree with some other comments on combat scenes. It was difficult to follow them for a moment. Finally, a moral story. It would be interesting to know that some Japanese people were watching the movie. It's a movie I would like to see again. Some scenes like those in which Benkai and the prince fought on a "psychic" level are well-made. I came out of China thinking about what just happened here. Intensely.
