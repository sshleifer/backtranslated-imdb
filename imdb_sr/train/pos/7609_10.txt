A completely brilliant performance. The second season began where the first one ended, with a lot of mystery. In most, if not in all episodes and mysteries everywhere. The one who made me think and think again. It's really amazing how a writer can come up with all the connections and connect all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the life of the characters in the show so significant. Never be disturbed and I look forward to the new season. Let's hope that more secrets will be discovered and at the same time, more mysteries to be solved. A good selection of actors for this show perfectly matches the characters. I really can not wait to finally discover the secret. I hope you will not spoil the end.
