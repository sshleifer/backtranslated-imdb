When Paris Burning came out, I totally rejected it. I was not in the whole phenomenon of the Virgin and Vogue. I thought there would be camping and nonsense. As far as I'm wrong about this movie. I watched him after the film was full for ten years, and I ran out and bought it. I returned to the time and place of fun and excitement. I felt like I knew all the characters personally. The Eighties were spectacular, and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What a great job! I went online and found out what some of the original members are now doing, but I could not find them. If anyone has any information about any of the bar members, please let me know. Hope to make another documentary. I WAS COMPLETED
