I know this sounds strange to someone born nearly 15 years after the show stopped broadcasting, but I love this show. I do not know why, but I enjoy watching him. I love Adam better. The only disappointing thing is that the only place I found to buy a DVD season was in Germany, and that was only the first two seasons. It's disappointing, but that's fine. I will continue to search online. If anyone has any tips on where to buy others until the 14th season, please email me at darkangel_1627@iahoo.com. I'm already the owner of the first one. The only downside is that DVDs from Germany, they are only played on my portable DVD player and on the computer. Oh well. I still own it!
