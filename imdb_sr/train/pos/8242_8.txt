I watched FIDO on some movie channel and I have to say that I became an instant fan. The film feels like a comic that perfectly captures the look and feel of the 1950's Surrealist, you know for a decade when they danced for Elvis while they were throwing nuclear bombs in the desert just because of it. People were so naive at that time that it was scary and the idea that these clean people would consider them normal to have zombies like pets, it's actually working here. great acting, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerni and a kid. It's a shame that this movie was no bigger hit. It deserves more recognition. Much better than that of Tim Burton or the Shawn team of the dead. Oh well. It's still a classic classic.
