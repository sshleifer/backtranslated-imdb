I saw this movie when I was a kid on television (thank you Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and I had nightmares about it for years after that. The best animators of the National Film Board. Pojar was, in turn, mentor and associate of the great Drouin. If you like Trnka, you should see the "Night Angel". Symbolism is obvious, but skillfully used. Oppositions of beauty and life (plant) are contrasted with the anonymity of the glove. The poor puppet hero was convicted despite the lack of a political agenda. What I remembered most was the feeling of oppression in the decor. A small room where the action takes place is a whole world of character. The invasion by hand is a complete violation of this world. Beautiful and persecuted movie. I found a copy of this and other wonderful short films by Trnke in a public library and he showed it to his children. She must see.
