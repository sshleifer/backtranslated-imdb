The film follows the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni" (can be translated as "The Most Among the People"), written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that has become something like the Bible or a story about Hamlet, very popular and difficult accessible because of its satirical content over the communist regime. It represents the drama of an intellectual humanist, a humanist, in the "red" world. A film full of passion, fear, sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great movie prescription. One of the biggest Romanian films, despite the psychological charge (after all, it's a European film).
