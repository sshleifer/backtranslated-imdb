Somehow I missed this movie when it came out and discovered it last week thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I can not remember another intimate drama film that works so well. Writing is sharp, realistic, tinted, and even restrained. Cinematography and editing are underestimated, but inspired, enabling visual narrative to dominate through marvelous close-ups and framing images, capturing loneliness and alienation in most unforgettable ways. The acting is also wonderful, with all the characters that become painfully real and vulnerable in the most powerful ways that a movie can offer. They reveal their weakest weaknesses with unprotected, raw vulnerability. Real triumph for Roger Michelle and Hanif Kureishi, as well as the rest of the team. Must be seen for serious film lovers.
