Although I really enjoy Jim's latest "serious" performances ("Trumanov shov", "The Man on the Moon"), I always thought that his true genius in physical comedy was. This does not mean that he is a fantastic, talented actor: it seems that such prizes do not like him so much, that he never had a (really deserved) nomination or a reward. Well, any "institution" that nominates for the 11 Oscar bore such as "Titanic" should not be taken seriously. With a review. "The Grinch" is the sweetest, most beautiful, best-acted and cozy film from "Nightmare before Christmas". Both films look very similar, with their highly styled sets and the assumption that someone steals Christmas. Both make their main actors look like villains (one in a higher degree than the other), they both have a strong moral lesson, and both are really fun. is a doll, and Grinch is a human being. But a human being who is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, is so similar to a cartoon film, so unrealistic that he never falls on the road to the film. He can be hilarious, can be a sad soul, can be angry. It lives in a three-dimensional world, where three-dimensional people live. He laughs, laughs, cries, and eventually saves Christmas. This movie I liked to pieces, and I can not wait for it to appear on a DVD. This is one of those movies where you really enjoy 10, 20 years. As timeless.
