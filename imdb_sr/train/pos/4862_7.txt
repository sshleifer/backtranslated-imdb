This musical is extremely mixed, and none of the elements really fit together, but somehow it manages to be mostly pleasant. The plot contains some of the elements of Vodehouse's novel, but none of his virtues, although he is a co-author of the script. The songs, although charming, have nothing to do with this film, and are unusually roughly compressed in the plot, even before the Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen are doing their usual style quite competently, but they lack the tone of the rest of the film for about forty IK points. There are several high points. Reginald Gardiner does a good job remembering that this is a conversation, and stop looting as a quiet actor. There are also several parts of the writing that Vodehouse could only write, although most of the films are felt as the production of one of the Hollywood meetings that he later parodied.
