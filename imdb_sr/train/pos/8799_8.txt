the film is excellent, as is any other international project that includes strong impressions. three of them (Israel, Bosnia and Egypt) were to be cut out. especially a Bosnian clip, which is pathetic for all reasons, and does not contain any original thought or element on its own. everything else is really great, unrecognizable for most Americans, known for the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the clips talk about the misery of people around the world. and, as I see it, there are so many who do not want to fuck him ... Top 5: 1. loach 2. penn 3. inarritu 4. lalouche 5. imamura
