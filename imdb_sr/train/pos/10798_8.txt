First I saw this gem from Joe Sarno ever since, and I have to say that after I saw it, I could never forget Jennifer Velles. At first I thought that the film was moving a bit slower than I would expect for Sarno film, but when Jennifer entered, the first time I saw her anywhere, I sat down and noticed. Her presence in this movie is hard to avoid, and spice up every scene she's involved in. I saw most of Sarah's other films, as well as other films in which Jennifer Velles starred or acted, and I must say that it was both Sarno and Jennifer in their collective. Sarn's direction in this film of adult drama is excellent, and Jennifer has shown (figuratively and literally) acting power that makes this must be seen. The co-stars Rebecca Brooke (called Mari Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both frequent stars of Mrs. Velles, as well as the frequent stars of Sarn's works, turn into convincing performances as adventurous but normal housewives. This film is Sarno Classic.
