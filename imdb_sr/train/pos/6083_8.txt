Brian Dennehi, Bill Pakton, Joe Pantalino and, best of all, Jeff Fahei, all in one movie. Vov is all I can say about it. These are four of the most enthusiastic actors in the business and they work together nicely. It is like poetry in the way they play each other and pour out the natural ability to look like they are best friends for eons, even for filming. The film itself is fine and can be pretty intensive to watch for the first time, and the four stars greatly help in changing abilities. I can not describe how good it was to see Bill Pacton and Jeff Fahey on the screen, the biggest moment when they watched a couple from a distance and filled the vocals themselves, that almost drove me to tears in my eyes. Good movie, great cast, go see. Why? Four words, Fahei, Dennehi, Pakton, Pantalino.
