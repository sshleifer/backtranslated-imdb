Very good, except for the ending that was a great disappointment. The scenario was very good as acting. Visual images were often very grainy, but this was in some way added to the film, because the snow features were in good places that helped create mood for the movie. This effect was destroyed by an extremely incredible ending. I wanted to give this film 8 out of ten, but the ending broke point to 7 because it seemed radically to move away from the first 75 minutes of the film and it seemed rather forced to make filmmakers look smart. This film was, however, much better than films with much larger budgets and seemed to be filmed as a home-based movie with additional equipment. There are not many special effects, but for uncertainty it was very good.
