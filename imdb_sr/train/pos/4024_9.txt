I was very interested in this film. That guessed me to the very end what would happen. One of the better movies about the partition I've seen. Urmila Matondkar is also beautiful. This is one of the most lucrative films I've seen on a partition. It's a little less mainstream than Gadar, and it's really an emotional slide where you start with one thought of what's happening, and go completely on the other side. This is not a typical Bollywood dinner, but rather an artistic film. The best part of this film is not to dehumanize one side of the division of the conflict when it focuses on the story of the other. It does not blame or castrate, it already allows you to draw your own conclusions about things.
