Imagine that you are so upset by the bureaucracy that one man spent 8 years of his life, and that he has a mental breakdown trying to solve the case of mass murder practically alone! The technique of murder is clear, but the government does not want to admit the truth that a monster will destroy dozens of lives. When I think my job is shaken, I only remember the true stories behind this amazing movie. The dedication to the main hero was masterfully shown by Rea. The comical (and almost tragic) relationship between Rea and Sutherland's character has made this one of my favorite films in the last 5 years. Capturing one of the worst mass murderers in history brought me to the edge of my seat. Although it was not so much advertised and spoke as "The Silence of the Lamb", the plot was just as tense. Rent or buy this movie today!
