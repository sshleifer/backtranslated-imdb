This film does not make pretentious efforts to hide its true genre - Camp B film. At first it will tell you that at the beginning is the definition of the camp. It should have had the adjective meaning of cheese. But these two meet in this movie in a way that makes you go, "Hmmmmm ... it's so stupid!" and then you laugh. For example, there is a scene in "Japan of the 16th century", which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of the temple. In the background of the temple there are several tourists looking at the distance in slippers and short trousers. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the act goes from the decent, to the bearable, to my Lord, but this is what makes it funny. You will see some decent actors and then find others really terrible. I have to turn around, because I saw Stephanie Sanchez in a couple of shows and she's great. Her film time, however, was quite short. I also saw Brian Iamasaki in several performances on the islands during my visits and he is also better at the theater than in this film. Anyway, it's a fun movie, if you do not have anything to do on Sunday night.
