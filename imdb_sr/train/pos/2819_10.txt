This movie is a bufoer! and I loved it! "Jackie Chan" and his friend, "cowboy", have made the movie fun, meaningful and just stupid. The film is a rare combination of good and bad fighting and (somehow) wonders and entertainment that grows. Long Shao Ie leads the observer through the daily activities of the young "dragon lord" (so-called because the son of a rich family) and "cowboy", which include the implementation of smart, elaborated ways to avoid learning (with the help of even a household, including a tutor) in pretty boyish (and idiopically interesting) ways to get the affection of a local girl, a competition in "football" (you will see what I think) and the list continues. They are somehow in the midst of a battle to save a consignment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people. The film has its serious moments. But they do not depress, but inspire. The playfulness of the boy is not lost in this exchange, but is actually used against evil. What I really liked in this movie is how it ends. It's not a typical confrontation (which was in itself awesome), but well, you will see. Allow me to say that it really catches the spirit of the film. Silly, witty, meaningful and nostalgic. excellent movie.
