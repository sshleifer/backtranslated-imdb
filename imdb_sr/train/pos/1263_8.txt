I enjoyed this film, it was approved mainly because I enjoy watching Sean Conneri and this has an added advantage as Ed Harris and Lavrence Fishburne are in it. The story has a grandmother seeking Connie's help because her grandson is in jail and says she was wrongly convicted. At first it appears that there may have been some racist aspects of the case, but later it turns out that the main officer for the case was a black man and seems to have done some pretty bad things to hand over the boy's recognition. So the boy tries to point to another killer in the same prison, the one who will be killed. He is also a particularly nasty person, for he takes a lot of joy in what he did, writing relatives of his victims and trying to get people to send them by post. A lot of turns and turnarounds in this, some of them are somewhat unexpected. I enjoyed the image of Sean Conneri who was trying to make sense of the whole temptation. The film also caved on me in areas, especially when you learned what happened at the end. You've got a very good game between Conneri and Harris, Conneri and Fishburne, because everyone is shining well in this. In the end, this is a pretty good uncertainty / thriller.
