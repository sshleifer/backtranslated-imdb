Penny Princess believes that the American working girl Iolande Donlon is the successor to the small kingdom in that triangle, where France, Italy and Switzerland, called Lampidorra, meet. It seems that Lampidorrans owes bills across Europe, and the main occupation of the country is smuggling because of its geography. The American multimillionaire buys this place, but dies before he can take the title. His closest heir is Donlan. But, of course, the property has to go through trials in America and what Lampidorani have to do? Especially since Donlan, who has now become a princess, forbade smuggling. Meet the Race of Bogarde who is on a trip to Switzerland to get acquainted with the cheese industry. Lampidorans seem to have some kind of cheese that is really called Schmeeze. With several strokes on the road, Schmeeze solves all the problems and financial, geopolitical and romantic between Donald and Bogarde. How Schmeeze works, it's a trick for the entire movie. But here are the hints. The lover returns Jack Kruschen maybe he got the secret of Schmeeze when he was busy invoking the VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. In any case Penny Princess is a wonderful blend of British farsi and romantic comedy. Iolande Donlon is again playing a role in which Marilyn Monroe would be inserted that the film was shot on this side of the lake. Dirk Bogarde was well thrown into the part that was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heartbeat, long before anyone other than him suspected of having the acting heads he had. three o'clock in the morning on TCM. But at least I found a reason to be thankful for insomnia.
