In the end, a good film by Modesti Blaise, which not only tells the story, but actually speaks a "true" story. I admit it's a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop on your path and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that this is a story that comes close to the original made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a story just to talk about how Modesty has become the magnificent person she is. It's not a movie that attracts new fans, but a movie that tells the right story. Some things could have been better, but when you can not forget the terrible film from '66. Then it's a magnificent movie. So, are you a fan, then sit down and relax and enjoy the fact that the story is right here with a story that only covers Modesti to tell your story.
