One of the great things about many of the top Chinese movies you can find, if you're lucky, in video stores is that they are a very accurate story about real, true stories. Goodbye, my concubine, car and murderer and this movie are perfect examples. Film makers make a true story and strive to accurately create a film without compromising facts due to dramatic or commercial benefits - a feature of many Hollywood films, and especially Disney movies. In this story we are following in the later years of the famous local street performer called the King of Masks for his mastery in Sichuan Change Art. In addition to losing his only son many years earlier, he is seeking to find a male heir who will continue his rare and dying art in a society that prohibits women from doing such a job. Lord Wang sells the son of a slave merchant. Everything is good, because it is glad to prepare to transfer its art. But the son was eventually discovered as a girl. From there, the story becomes very interesting, with a good performance by Liang of Sichuan Opera - a regional opera style related to the Beijing Opera. Lovers of Forgiveness My concubine should carefully look at the portrait of master Liang as a male play the role of a woman in the Chinese opera. This can help them realize that the players of these female roles were not homosexuals or castrates, but people who are so psychologically conditioned that they do not fully know about their sexuality.
