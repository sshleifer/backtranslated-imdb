An outstanding documentary about the significant achievements of the Association of Women's Lawyers (VLA) from Kumba, Southwestern Cameroon, in the legal protection of the rights of women and children against domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to Shari'a law, one can imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights on women and children. After 17 years of unsuccessful efforts, VLA leaders have recently won several victories, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories. State Prosecutor and Beatrice Ntuba, Senior Judge (President of the Court). They both play in this movie, which can contain spontaneously captured footage, although I imagine that the larger part, if not all, consists of subsequent recreations of actual events for the camera. Four cases are being considered, and all prosecutors are also playing the movie. Two cases involve repeated beating of women, with forced sex in one case; the second involves forced sex on a 10-year-old girl; and another one relates to the repeated beating of a child aged 8 years by aunt. One of the beaten women is also seeking divorce. We monitor cases from investigating appeals to the outcome of the trial. Outcomes in any case are favorable for women and children. The perpetrators receive severe fines and / or fines; Divorce is granted. Aggressive prosecution of a child who has beaten a child shows that these criminal justice officers are truly gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. It is also worth mentioning the respect to which all parties are being treated, including those found guilty. This is a very important and well-made movie. (Interestingly, one of the directors, Ms. Longinoto, also co-directed the 1998 film, Razvod, an Iranian style, dealing with related issues in Tehran). My Rating: B + 8/10
