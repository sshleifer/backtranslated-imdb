I saw this film when it came out and when I was 12 years old :) And I still remember vivid scenes as a hero / hero flees every time he faces danger :) And the best feature of the film was the portrait of a villain! I think that many so-called Action movies copied a lot of "escape scenes" from this movie !! And not only does it impress me when I see such a copy, it always increases my respect for this masterpiece! :) Actors act beautiful. The slow and real development of chemistry c / b hero and heroin was extremely natural and beautifully depicted. As children, we felt that love that developed c / b was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their temptations and troubles together is something that even children can do to understand the value of true love, sacrifice and care. I recommend that every person sees this movie when giving him a chance! - You.
