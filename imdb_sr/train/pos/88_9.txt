This was one of the best movies I saw. The film refers to real life and the way drugs can play a major role. Although this film seems to have been produced from a low budget, I found it exciting to watch. Some may not like the story and say that the script has no direction. However, when a person becomes deeply in drugs as these characters, there is no way of life. I feel that this film is an accurate picture of what could happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptations. Most actors are newcomers in the industry. However, everyone was well pulled out. Everybody seemed to be doing their job well and appropriately engaging in character. I think this movie could be a good tool to use when it comes to a person or a loved one who is involved in a drug and seems to be spinning out of control. This movie could only scare them enough to change their ways.
