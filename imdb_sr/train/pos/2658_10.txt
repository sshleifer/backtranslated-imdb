Kubrick again demonstrated his stunning ability to create the perfect ambience for the film. Mostly through cinema, but also using a genius result, it creates a cold and malevolent tone on the whole film and basically engages the spine from the beginning. Indeed, this impeccable ambience makes The Shining a masterpiece that is in my eyes. Of course it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. Frighteningly authentic view of the mind that is crazy. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be kind, but it's easy to see next to those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. In addition, the actor has the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
