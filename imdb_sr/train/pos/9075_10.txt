I missed almost the entire first season, but when other shows went to the replay, I began to watch. I ended up buying the whole first season off iTunes. This is now one of my favorite comedy shows. Patrick Varburton is the key. His dry sense of humor is constantly rolling. David Spade is ridiculous, but sometimes a little Russell goes a long way. I'm more interested in other members of the acting team (but I'm not saying that he does not add a show). Make yourself a service. If you did not check this, try. If you can catch an episode in which Jeff goes to the sperm bank, you'll see how good this show is.
