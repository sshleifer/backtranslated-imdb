The performances in this film were fantastic. The dialogue was excellent. Jason Patric performed a fantastic performance like "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. Far better than "The Grifters", which was a good movie, this film really remained true to the pulp fiction / film noir, from which the story came. I recommend this film to all fans of noir film.
