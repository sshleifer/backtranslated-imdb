Sleepwalkers are creatures that exhaust the vitality completely from people to survive ... but can only use virgins (not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one who needs to feed his mother Mari (Alice Krige). He goes for the cute Tani (Madchen Amick). Will they escape? On the one hand this is EXCELLENT horror movie. Fast speed, lots of blood and up and fine, distorted sense of humor. There are many references in the joke for horror lovers (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Also, Krause is excellent (who would think he can act after "Return to Blue Lagoon") such as Kirge and Amick. But this film is boring. It's written for Steven King's screen and it's unclear. Moonwaters are never fully explained. Where are they from? Why is that called? Why should a son feed his mother? Why are the cats hated and can kill them? What, after all, is their power (at one point Krause makes the car disappear and changes its color and style!)? Why do they need to feed the life force of people? Why must it be only virgins? Why is the son of sex with Mom? None of these explanations leave a confusing story. It's really terrible, because, on these issues, this is a great horror movie. Excellent makeup and special effects. Fast, bloody and fun. That only the scenario is better. Also a pretty explicit sexual scene between Krause and Krige is arranged (you can say) to get a R rating. I can only give this 7.
