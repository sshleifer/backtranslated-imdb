heres a fun fact, I was a baby in the movie, she's in a crib. :) I'm 19 now. My parents took me to try out a part, we lived in Texas at that time. My parents said that I would cry when I should be happy and that I would be happy if I should cry. I was confused. Strange and funny fact I guess .. and no, I'm not a children's actress. I live in San Antonio, I work on waves. I graduated here in Texas, but I lived most of my life in Mariland. This film is a great film, however, a good concept. I saw him a few times in his short 19 years.
