There are many illnesses born in the mind of a man who received life in modern times. Continuous alertness or collected information in the Pishohoze area has been kept by psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists with enough work to last decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomena are discovered by those who have no knowledge of their medicine or even their existence. This is the premise of the movie titled "Night Lister". She tells the story of a popular radio leader called Gabriel Noon (Robin Villiams), who spent his evenings enchanting her audience with colorful stories about the way of life of Gai. Perhaps because his show loses the authentic veneer, which causes Noon to admit that he is no longer alone. Feeling abandoned by his lover Jesse (Bobbi Cannavale) and his and best friend (Joe Morton), he seeks a shelter in his deepening despair and isolation. It's here, a mysterious voice at night asks for help. The floor should be helpful and reach the desperate voice of a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). Reading the childish painful manuscript describing early life and sexual abuse in the hands of his brutal parents, Podne is fascinated and wants to help. However, things are not what they look like and Noon soon finds himself wrapped up in an elusive and bizarre story that has been torn from a medical nightmare. This film is pure Robin Villiams and was not it Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this can be comical. Instead, this may prove to be one of Villiam's more serious performances. ***
