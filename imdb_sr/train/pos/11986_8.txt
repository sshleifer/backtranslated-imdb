One night I watched 'Speak Easy' and thought it was ok, but there was nothing. Maybe Buster Keaton was strangely telling me to drop me, or the heavy delivery of the leading ladies. The next day I was thinking about the film. I could not get Durante's song out of my head, I tried to remember the first scene of Thelme Todd, I thought that maybe Keaton did some funny fits and a physical comedy. The next night, I watched the scene with Thelma Todd as a wily choir girl who was trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. Very funny scene, great actors, faces, eyes, stupid expressions. I watched another scene, their show opens on Broadway. Buster in his blissful innocence destroys every act. Again I laughed out loud, appreciated Keaton's clowning and skating. The next night I watched the whole movie again, and this time I see it for the first time: It's Stupendous! It's Sensational! It's Sublime! Three great comedians! Todd dances! Durante sings! Keaton talks! Surely this is not a phenomenon ... but there is a lot of laughter in this picture.
