This is a fine musical with the timeless result of one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and the beautiful 'Parisien' atmosphere that gives the film a lot of charm, but in terms of the story .. and it's not really. Or at least not well worked out. And Caron does not work so smoothly. But I liked some dialogues, I liked the scene in Sena, I liked the image of Levant, the colors; and dancing naturally, which is quite magnificent. And 7.5-8 mi seems at the point.
