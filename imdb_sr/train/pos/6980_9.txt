I have to admit, I was one of the skeptics who had prematurely decided this show before they had relatively broad information about it. I decided it would be a cheap spin-off run by Ronald D. Moore holding the stick. I made a mistake! impression on viewers. Accessibility is wonderful! Of course, experienced BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on the development of Cylons before the first war. (58 years before the BSG pilot event). The pilot also allows newcomers, clearly presenting their plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. Do not be mistaken: "Caprica" ​​is not a BSG. Impressive, brainstorming is spanned by provocative, bold and controversial ideas. Casting maintains BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply stunning. Morales's picture of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos's vision of the Villi, provides a wonderful view of Villyam's heroic father. Stolt's presentation by Dr. Graystonea causes many thoughts and questions. If the quality of the pilot is any indication of what is yet to come, RDM and the creative team are ready to continue the BSG's heritage of the first - a television program with another masterpiece created by masterpiece.
