Amazingly well-made for an independent movie, the Insomniac nightmare paints a stunning picture of how it would be to suffer from insomnia. Extremely well written and directed, creates an atmosphere of sleep while the viewer goes through one night in the life of insomnia. In the dominant role of Dominique Monaghan as Jack, we see everything she sees as the long hours of lonely night are withdrawn. Narration is almost hypnotizing, and it is impossible to turn from the starting lines. Fascinating and somewhat disturbing, it shows that someone is dealing with a lack of sleep, balancing on the edge between common sense and madness. Very recommended.
