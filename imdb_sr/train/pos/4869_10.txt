Not for people without a quick mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you do not have one of these, you can not understand it. And if you do not understand, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think Picasso is the name of a Citroen-made car, it's likely that if you see Picasso's picture, you'll just pass by, deciding that it is the work of an street painter. :) So, do not judge before you try to figure it out :) Finally, I think MORA is for everyone with an open mind. My N1 remains the Shavshank Redemption! And remember that all things can not be framed. Because there are things in this world, any frame is simply not appropriate.
