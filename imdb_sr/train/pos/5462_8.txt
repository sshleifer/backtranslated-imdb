First, if you are planning to watch this, make sure to watch the UNCUT version (although it's very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that changed because of censorship), it makes a huge difference. This film talks about a young woman played by Barbara Stanvick, who has been forced into prostitution since her own father since she was fourteen years old. When her father suddenly dies, she is able to go out alone to the world. After reading about Nietzsche's philosophies of life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men by giving her what she wants and leaving them in ruins and desperate for her love. Through the film, it becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative, and the audience begins to wonder if there is any kind of morality. All in all, Babi Face is a very shocking film with obvious sexuality scenes that most people do not expect to see in a black and white film. Although no sexual act is explicitly displayed on the screen, it is very obvious what happens to the camera. I enjoy watching this movie and I believe that most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment if, especially with the value of film shock. I thought while I watched the pacing seemed a bit slower, but I think it's the first time for them to see them in most films. In fact, I think almost all the films I've been watching since the early 30's had some puzzle problems or some parts were not very good. This is probably only the craft of film creativity is not yet fully perfected? It only takes a few years. Compare the 1939 movie and compare it to a movie from the early 30's, and I think you'll see what I mean. it really makes a big difference. Also, all fans of John Wayne will be surprised to see him in this movie before he became known in an unusual role.
