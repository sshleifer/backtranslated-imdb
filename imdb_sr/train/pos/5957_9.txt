The title says everything. I am not a film critic and I will not act like other snobber people who comment on this film. We have a multi-million dollar budget, but the action was very well made, the performance was great and the cinema was great! It seemed like you were all having a good time in this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 because the sound was strong on only one channel, not both, but I guess it may have been a mistake in filming a DVD. other films produced by Brain Damage Films! Dilan O'Leary, an actor and a team, thank you!
