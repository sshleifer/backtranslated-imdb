A boy and a girl are being persecuted by a local warrior because the boy killed (incidentally) the father of the warrior (or whoever he was). And they travel through the nature of Africa's largest areas. The acting in this movie is not so good (except that elephant). But it is a very good adventure and is not very censored, it has blood, meat and nudity (which makes the film a little easier). I give this film 7 for its picture of African nature and its effect.
