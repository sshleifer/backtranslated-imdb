This, along with "Hare Tonic", is one of the best Bugs cartoons, really one of the best Bugs, ever. There are some comments on how Bugs in these cartoons are "basic", which means, I suppose, that it has not yet been fully developed. In fact, I prefer this "basic" version since the mid-40s (Chuck Jones was the best version) which is actually a larger beast size and far more fun than a long-standing version that rises above Iosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. Bugs from the last days have become superfluous and sophisticated to me. Also see Hair Raising Hare (1946) and Rabbit Punch (1948) for great examples of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones.
