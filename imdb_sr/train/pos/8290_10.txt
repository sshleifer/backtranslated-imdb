This is just another example of the absolute genius Gene Wilder. He wrote and acted in this wonderful mystery. Nobody could do it better. The tension was palpable. I would like to see us g. Wilder interferes with others. I enjoyed everything I've ever seen in Mr. Wilder, but I had no idea how real he was when I did not see "Murder in a Small Town" and this sequel. He really has a firm understanding of what the audience wants and how to deliver it in his writing and, of course, in his brilliant acting. His subtle spirituality comes through a peak. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes mysteries and / or film work Gene Wilder. His star becomes brighter and brighter.
