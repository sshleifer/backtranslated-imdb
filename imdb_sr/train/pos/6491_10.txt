Vorld At Var is perhaps the largest documentary series of all time. Historical research is virtually flawless. Even after a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about the Second World War. An intractable historical work involving interviews with some of the most important and fascinating personalities of the war. I recommend it as a learning experience.
