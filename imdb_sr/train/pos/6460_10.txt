If the scriptwriter and director intend to open hearts with a movie that the musician wanted to work with his music, they succeeded with me. The usual human situations have become original, personal and direct, so I personally felt touched by every situation. I believe that I would earn recognition for the power of music in combination with the position of the person who writes the film. Without spoiling, I can say that I was very touched by the approach of film to life. Did you actually cry for something - joy? compassion? Just a deep emotion? for a very long time. I would like to find a way to show it to others. I saw him at the International Film Festival in Seattle.
