Excellent movie. The acting - from a doctor to a sidewalk artist to the head of a prostitute, with very few exceptions, was wonderful; I thought that sonny (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of the lesser known actors. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who could be accused of exaggerating, presented a rather convincing and famous figure. the tranquility of the gustad who speaks of his prayers and life in small apartments. I liked the story of the wall that becomes a sanctuary, and then it breaks down - and the artists take it philosophically. It's great to see good movies on Indian themes.
