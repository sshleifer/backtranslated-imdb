During the entire Pirate Caribbean trilogy, Craze Paramount Pictures really dropped the ball in the renewal of this Anthony Quinn, who directed the movie Cecil B. DeMille and recorded it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the accessories. It's obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Ekecs is blind as blind mice and do not know that they have a really good pirated movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, which would help Crescent Citi once do. again known for Pirate Connections. When Ekecs in Paramount finally comes in with the program and posts this film in digital format, then I will be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures is up to you to take off your movie and return this movie now!
