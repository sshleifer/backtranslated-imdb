No prize can satisfy all people. It is clear that if your favorite movies did not win, you will say that the show was not very good. That's understandable. However, the 74th Annual Academy Award will be remembered for one magical moment of Hollywood history: First Voodoo Allen's performance ever on the Oscars. Allen often refused rewards as self-discipline and meaningless, and never attended - even though he won several award-winning prizes. When the Academy's 74th Academy Awards were prize-winning nations, it still complained about the loss of life in the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York. When it came time to pay tribute to the city of New York, they decided to show a video of great movie moments from the city of cities. Then the speaker simply said: "Ladies and gentlemen, the Oscars director award-winning Dr. Voody Allen." The place has emerged in extremely long ovations. The entertainment industry finally had to applaud a man from New York who usually avoided the Hollywood scene. As the applause sunk, Voodi applied one of his legendary dots to the situation. SOME EVENTS: "Thank you very much - it compensates for track search." "I thought they wanted to return Oscar" he joked. "I panicked because the pawn shop was out of work for years and I had no way to find anything." "But that was not it. Then it struck me - maybe they called me to apologize." Alen also discovered why he overcame his life-long avarice for the Oscar for this special night. "For New York, I would do anything. So I got my clothes and I came here," Allen said. It's a great, great movie city. It was a great, moving and exciting wallpaper for movies and it remains a big, big city. "
