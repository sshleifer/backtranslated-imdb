The 1986 "Spirit" TV film was a pilot for a possible series. However, the creator of the Spirit Vill Eisner did not like the film, and so did not produce any series. I thought it was a very funny movie and that it was caught by a ghostly comedian with a modern reversal. I'm sorry it did not turn into a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was the perfect ghost. Nana Visitor was beautiful Ellen Dolan and would later go to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine nine years later. Perhaps with the release of Frank Miller's version of the Ghost on the big screen, more people will be able to see this rare jewel of the history of the Spirit. It seems that when Hollivood makes a movie from an already established character or idea, someone will inevitably search for previous versions of the property and post it on the video to earn a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas wrapped up the Zorro mask, we managed to get earlier versions of a masked hero on a DVD, such as the big version of Alen Delon from the 1970s (although all the copies I've ever seen poorly edited). Heres hopes that someone will soon announce the TV Adventure of the Spirit on DVD.
