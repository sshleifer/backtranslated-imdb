Barbara Stanvick as a real hot cake, a waitress from the working class (and a prostitute in the hands of her father) who fled to New York and used her female cunning to get a job, went to the mortgage and deposited, and later as assistant secretary to another commander at the bank. A dramatic study of a feminine character who is not scared of rude has not lost his power over the years, while Barbara has acted in a storm (showing a woman who teaches that she is the top actress himself). Putting in her messed-up life a small philosophy of Nietzsche, this lady corrects feelings, but never loses our fascination, our awe. It is open, hard-boiled wide, but not a bitch, nor is it a man-hating man. This girl is herself, and while we wait for her to finally find out about the real values ​​in her life, her journey up and down the ladder of success gives warm, sexy party.
