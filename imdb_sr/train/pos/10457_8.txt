Forget about "religious" movies that have monopolized the television / film market ... this movie has a real feeling. Though it may be considered a film that has cheap emotional attraction, it also has a message of forgiveness and general good morality. However, I did not like lighting in this movie ... for the film dealing with such a topic, it was too bright. I felt that it took away the overall attraction of the film, which is almost unrecognizable sin, but a recognizable actor, and their performances are opposed to this omission.
