This movie is great. If you understand him too seriously, of course you will hate him; however, the amount of "dudes" and "right ons" brings laughter and bad memories about 15 years ago. I like her ability to make me laugh at obvious jokes and stupidity, and her ability to make me want to watch her predecessor, "The Great Adventure of Bea and Ted" (1989). If you are looking for a movie full of multiple jokes, and completely mature humor, do not look at it; However, if you want a movie that is funny and funny, yet intelligent and appealing, you will enjoy it. In fact, I want more of this kind of picture to appear in today's theaters. And hey, Keanu Reeves behaves the way he's parodied like acting ... well ... he does not get much better than that :)
