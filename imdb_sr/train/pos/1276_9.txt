I love this movie. Noir pictures combined with Spillane's absurd character Mike Hammer works miraculously to create a mood and rarely find himself in detective low budget films in the early fifties. It may not be a 'Maltese Falcon', but this film gives its solid contribution to the genre. Spilane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, etc. But his 'ladies' are far above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer, as effectively played by Biff Elliott, is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he meets when investigating the death of a soldier. When the foam finally drops the face, the picture is. It's good to see that the 50's censors did not force filmmakers to miss the last known line. Bona fide lov budget classic.
