This film now appears on digital television at least once a month, I've watched it for a dozen or more times and never stops delighting me. If it was tomorrow, I would have looked back. Such is the art that can be created by Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great actors of the acting profession, helped by the incredible trio Karl Malden, Bob Nevhart and Robert Morley. Not forgetting others in smaller roles. It is a simple story, simply speaking, of a former war prisoner, a sympathetic embezzlement, a struggle and success with the then-modern "technology of the new age", i.e. feelings in the process. Even if it is then (language in the face) incredible, even incredible, the characters are not. No violence, no sex, no bad language, and the best of all is not a terrible method of behavior that is so widespread today. A real lesson to modern film makers about how to make a great performance from, and with, almost nothing ... except exceptional talent.
