There are many things in this episode (just like most Tvilight Zone episodes), such as the incredibly sexist military "uniform" of a woman. And some things are so incredible, as easy access to clean water. However, consider the year when this is done and time, and quickly understand why this episode is as special as you are watching. It has a good sense of hope, something that is missing in many twilight zones, and an interesting female character (despite the fact that it rarely speaks), something rare in the twilight zone. The "Two" is an excellent example of the Twilight Zone, in just over 20 minutes, can pack more emotions and drama than most two hours of movies today. And it's great to see two people who have become American icons so early in their career.
