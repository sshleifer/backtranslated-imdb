I loved this movie. The first time I saw him when I was 20 years old (which was only four years ago) and I enjoyed so much that I brought my copy the next day. The comedy is well-played by all involved. I always have to rewind and return the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area. Also look for father Jason Robards who plays Mr. Retcha. Talent ran into that family.
