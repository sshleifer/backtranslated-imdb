A visual creative epic in an unmistakable style. This movie can not have any different dramaturgy, nor the most creative actors. But who dares to say that this film is not art? I do not support the idea that an important movie must be serious, non-commercial or troubling me with questions. There are even many movies that are similar to these attributes that I like. Bogus Journei, surely, is not one of these films. What you get is pure, excessive creativity with a very positive charge, baby energy. This film does not reflect reality. His friendly-naive and utopian. Imagine the future world described by Rufus - for me it would be a pretty good combination of time to live! Apart from this music; -) Technical, Bogus Jorney is very well made. I always liked the cinema and scenography of this film. Especially at this point Bogus Journei is far above its sign. And the effects are good, and I think most of them are made without cgi. I mostly love good old effects in big budget films. Take care of your 'just another Hollywood movie' from some people's eyes. But I think it's a very charismatic way. The short word in the soundtrack: all the band and orchestral music fit well into the movie. There is no lack of sound design. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to download this track from Winger from the 'station' scene and make Bill and Ted robots in the van. I love the unusual work at the beginning. Allow me to conclude: <br /> <br /> This film is very naive and very imaginative! It's much better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, Kum, Eraserhead or Aguirre - God's wrath. It's absolutely superior to a civilian kane, now an apocalypse or Chris marker sans soleil ... ... is even better than Total Recall ... No way !? Yes, the way! God and Travel Bella and Teda is simply the best film ever made. (which is bigger self-slander) PS: The first part is not a better movie. Bogus Jorney is an extraordinary continuation. Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel! It's not!
