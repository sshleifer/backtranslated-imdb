ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL has a special place in my heart because he introduced me to Ramones. I was too young during the breakup in the mid-70s of the band to be aware of it, even though I had an older cousin who at that time was a big fan. I finally saw RNRHS on television one afternoon in the mid-eighties, when I was fifteen and laughing the whole way. (Is not it the dream of every high school student to destroy his school and blow him up, all ready to sound?) I shot the film after a year or two later and continued to watch Ramones concerts over again, thinking, "Man, these guys break your ass! I check some of their albums! " The rest is history. Twenty years, countless Ramones LP / cassettes / CDs, and three Ramones broadcasts later, they are still one of my favorite bands, and RNRHS still fires me every time I watch it. Now that Joei, Dee Dee and Johnny left us (R.I.P. all), at least we have this movie and the tones of great music to remember them.
