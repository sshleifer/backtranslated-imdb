The psychotic transsexual Bobbi kills the patient (Angie Dickinson) of the prominent doctor (Michael Caine), and then runs a costly prostitute (Nancy Allen) who saw Bobi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) is suspected of having committed a crime and is associating with her son's son (Keith Gordon) to capture the killer. It can be summed up in a few words: it's very sexy (Dickinson) and Allen look great), it's very bloody - with a blood type that is usually reserved for spray films, and the boy is well made. The script writer / director De Palme is fine, but he really takes the back seat for his filming skills. He is very successful at the visceral level and actually I'm involved with these characters. I can see the standard De Palma homage / ripoffs from Hitchcock - at least from one of the Master pictures. And at the top of all this, it's professionally and convincingly cast. This is De Palme's third film with ex-wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies".) By the way, the dancer - who became actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the assistants in production. There's a bit of trivia for you. I would not say that the thriller could be gifted and bloody at the same time, but this picture is pulling it. One of the best things about it is the typically striking music party Pino Donaggio. 8/10
