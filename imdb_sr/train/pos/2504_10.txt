When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was that this movie was more like anime than a movie. The reason is that it involves vampires who work incredible acrobatics. Stops are very similar to the Matrix movements such as moving too fast for bullets and jumping around very far away. Another reason why the movie is good is that wonderful anime faces are working during the movie. The way Gackt makes its faces or just the way it behaves, VERY ANIME. I think it's a really good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ Action in this movie is 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hide are 10). ^ _ ~ If you are fans of Gackt and Hide, you must see it.
