Purple Rain ... what else can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think that all actors are well-chosen. The film had a great story. I liked it! Since I've been watching this movie, I've been stuck in the '80s, and I'm only 13 years old! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died, and he picked up all of his compositions, and Apolonia sat on a staircase with her ears in her hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more romantic. Murphy Brovn also did a great job in the film, he actually acted like himself. I'm so glad to see this movie. The song Purple Rain, beautifully sung, was so sincere. I cried more than once.
