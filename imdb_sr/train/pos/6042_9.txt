Missing movies for rent, I picked up Freebird. I fought through the first third of the film wondering if the rest would be a loss. Fortunately, it really warmed up, and I loved the film very much. In the second half of the film, I laughed and laughed all the time. Fortunately, although CGI parts were included, they were not overstated or overwhelming. But I have to say - all actors have hard European accents, so be warned if you have problems understanding your voices or their cultural humor. I really liked this movie and I have to order myself a copy for my collection.
