A story about four teenage adults who grew up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most diverse head - but she wants to get out of her home with her divorced mother (Salli Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is fighting her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has pre-emptive parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks he is more mature than the others. This is nothing new from what we have seen many times - but this one has a big difference - that's right. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw a video) and I was surprised how real it was. Dialogue, clothes, and attitudes got quite right. Even the main song of the film ("On the radio" Donne Summer) was a big hit before it came out. This film hit me harder than any other teenage movie of that time, because I could understand and treat the characters. I knew girls in high school who were like this! The film is (of course) dated, but it captures the time we will never see again. The performance is good at all points because Foster gives the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well done. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role of girl friends) played more or less realistically a boy. The movie has a well-deserved R score (a lot of drug use and curses), but should be seen by all teenagers. I'm giving him 8.
