I just watched this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival and enjoyed it. Great writing and direction, excellent and convincing interaction between actors, as well as excellent comic timing. This film deals with topics that are universal families and separation. As a result, I can see the European, Asian and American audiences who find the similarities between this film and their own lives. If all this was not enough, it has the potential to be the best underground movie of the year ... someone distributes this to the US, please! Finally: Thank you Maria Flom! It's a really great movie.
