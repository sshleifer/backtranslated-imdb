This is how I feel about the show. I began to watch a show in the reprise in 2001. I enjoy the show, but it had too many mistakes. HATE MICHELLE & JOEI CHARACTERS! Steal stories from old TV shows. They even steal from "Partirdge family". Then in one episode mentioned "The Partridge Famili". Actors play different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Kuinn most of all works this, especially when she played herself in one episode. Michelle's figure CAN NOT take a joke, but then they had this little child acting as a "revenge" for the sisters for their joke. The story lines that came and went in one episode. Joei got a TV show with Frankie & Annette, and never heard about it after that. Danny plays the guitar at once. 1 episode he trains football, 1 episode is a softball / baseball trainer. 1 game & you're out Danni? Jesse & Joei are constantly getting a job REAL FAST without experience. Just in a TV show. I like D.J. & Stephanie signs. I wish Jodie Sveetin learned from Candace Cameron Bure and had a clean lifetime without a drug.
