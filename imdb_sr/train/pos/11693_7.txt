This film is a remake of two films that were much better. Last, the sky can wait, it was great, I suggest you see it. This is not so great. The last third of the movie is not so bad and Chris Rock begins to show some of the comic parties that have brought him to the place where he is today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this film. It's like a really bad "B" movie in which people sound like they're in a bad TV-com-com. Situations are imposed and it's like they're just trying to get the story to end so they can start a real movie. Everything seems real false and editing is just bad. I do not know how they could play this movie like this. In any case, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and then look at it.
