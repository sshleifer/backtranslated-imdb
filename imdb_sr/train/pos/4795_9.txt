Whenever I hear a movie that is advertising because there is no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, my b.s. the detector is extinguished. Usually, such a film is a sentimental nonsense that encourages people who do not want to surprise them, but to confirm that they are superior to us. When David Linch began to come out with such reviews, I was terrified, especially because I was not the admirer of his second "elevated" story, A FREE MAN. For all the amazing pictures and good work in this movie, it seemed to me that he was more interested in preaching than for us. I do not have to worry. STRAIGHT STORY is a fair film, not a saccharine. Most of this is due to the fact that Linch and writers John Roach and Marie Sveenei generally told this simple and simple. There are several homilies that I could do, and the images of the wheat that are read are repeated a bit too much, but these are just interferences. There is no heavy message, there are no sentimental strings that would break our emotions, and without humility toward us and his characters. Instead, they depend on the story to build their own strength, and that's it, so that after the final scene we are truly shaken. He is indeed someone who seems to have lived a lot, but still persists, and in addition to those sermons, the desire to return with his brother is not overly sentimental, for here you can feel someone who lived long and seen too much to keep him long pushed the rage. And he knows that time expires, so he wants to reconcile not only with his brother, but also with his life. Sissi Spacek also works well, working as Straight's daughter. And although I am a city and a suburb, the landscape of Iova and Visconsin is beautifully shot, which makes me one day visit.
