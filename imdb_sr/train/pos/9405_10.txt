While Hollywood has become somewhat stagnated in the years following World War II, England has developed a very productive film industry. In "The Man in a White Suit," inventor Sidney Straton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that never fails. Unfortunately, this means that now some other companies will probably stop working! How can Sidney deal with this and keep her dignity? This is an example of one of the great films in which Alec Guinness appeared before he became Obi Van Kenobi. It is a good view of the overall absurdity of the business world. If you are planning to start any kind of work, consider watching this movie.
