It's nice to see Jorja Fok as a lot of laughs. He also liked to hear her singing. Nice change to see it from the role of CSI / West Ving / ER. The film itself was fun, but it seemed to skip some explanation in many parts. A few characters seemed to be a poor one minute and were happy next, and it was left to your imagination to understand why. Every character was weird, although in some cases I could not wait to see what he would do next or hear what he would say next. This film was not full of screaming people, but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad and find a way to solve them.
