The story of the first broadcast of the TV show "Columbo" is simple: half the successful team mysterious writing is eliminated by another, it puts an invisible mob group, is blackmailed by the fan, removes the fan and in this connection, this is is still one of the funniest in the history of the show, which is of great benefit from the work of late Jack Cassidy and star Peter Falck. In addition to the role directed by young Steven Spielberg, the episode also fills the fate of the future of two stars: Cassidy and Barbara Colby. The two of them share several scenes together and it is fierce that both of them will tragically die within a decade of this shooting, Cassidy in a fire in the apartment and Colby in the hands of the attacker, and yet will be found after more than three decades. Now, both deaths are true lives!
