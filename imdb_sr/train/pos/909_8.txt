I liked this movie. It's another Iash paradise for which you know it will look good on the screen, all the characters are always pretty or very beautiful with one exception that you know it will hide in time to be nice ... Another rule Iash paradise is or hero or heroin; s have only one or none of the parents. Think about all these movies .. MPK Schumann did not have a mommy, HMAPK Salman did not have parents, and the rule is that you are 90% likely to see Alock Natha who is crying ... And the movie is good . At first, it's a bit slow, but it entertains you. There is almost no comedy, but it seems that you smile quite often. The little kid (nephew of the hero) is well placed and delivers very good tape. Actress is very nice, but shy to not get it in real life. in this film there are no big happy families living in BIG home, and I was a good idea and allowed the film to be different from other films. There will be many women who will cry at the end of the film. There is no strong message from this movie, but it's a good watch. If you are married (agreed marriage), the film will remind you of what you've been through. And if you are not, it will let you know and maybe scare you ... </ br>> All in all, a very good movie. There are no big complications, but a very gentle movie, just like the Bollywood classic.
