Many factors make it easy for me to say that I still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made, despite some acting, outdated dialogues, etc. First, there is a scale of imagination in describing Crele, a humanoid race that was born on the planet, now all are dead, who were 1 million years advanced than people on Earth (us), and their technology, especially machines of 8,000 cubic miles. Second, there are musical and sound effects that are inseparable from each other. It creates a ghastly, extraterrestrial feeling, unlike "2001", which had classical classical music. Thirdly, his "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadliest ever conceived, but is based on true science and does not violate the laws of physics and biology. Finally, and most importantly, the Forbidden Planet is the only film that has ever been made to try and, even more incredibly, succeed in making a fair, intelligent and ruthless logical statement about the limits or the ceiling of human development ( or any other biological entity), no matter how long we survive as a species. In other words, it predicts our inevitable fate.
