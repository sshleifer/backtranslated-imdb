Absolutely hilarious. John Watts' Gift to the People He Most Likes (Baltimore) is a weird little thing with a lot to watch and laugh. It's like getting rid of a kitsch museum! I did not laugh so much at the theater of Serial Mum. I loved to see old friends from Dream Day, Sharon Nisep and Susan Love, back in front of Vaters' camera. The actors are simply beautiful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). It uses the best elements of crime from the past of Vaters (especially underestimated polyester) and a host of new surprises. I'm sick, in a wonderful way. Thanks, John!
