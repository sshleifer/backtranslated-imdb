This movie is wonderful. It's always been there. I really think it's better then the house maid falls in love. Walt really came out of him. And music! San is the desire that makes your heart beautiful! What else can you say next to the brilliant! I can not wait for the special edition to come out so it will be great! I can not wait to hear all the erased songs! This movie is so beautiful and smart! That's nice. What about sweet mice! I know that I keep repeating the same things over and over again, but hey, this is a great movie! Voods was great in this beautiful beautiful movie
