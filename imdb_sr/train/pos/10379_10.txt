Plato's race is a funny movie with Gary Busey. He's a pretty unknown movie, so I saw him in a car boot. I thought this was fun, I was right. Garry Busei Platoon Smith's death is a hardcore mercenary who is set to assassinate a mighty Cuban mastermind now on the run of Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends playing Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (expert). what I liked about Plato's running was the way the movie was never boring, maybe the action was done before, but it was still good to play was fun to watch and the action was pretty fun, and especially the peak of Gary Busei seems a good hero of ironic mail he normally plays a bad guy, and Steve Bauer is as good as Plato's assistant even Jeff Speaksman makes a good performance and can not even finish well with Plato's running is a nice effort from the nude image of the movies and I give him 7 out of 10
