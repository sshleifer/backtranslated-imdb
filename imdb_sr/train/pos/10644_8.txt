The second series Why we fight is concentrating on Hitler's capture of Sudetland and beyond, because he leaves Neville Chamberlain and moves to conquer Europe. Apparently the meaning of propaganda in its day, this series during the time test became an informative documentary, and most of the "allied bias" turned out to be a historical fact. The FÃ¼hrer rises on his own petard with confident statements in front of his people and the world as one thing says and works for the other while his army moves to the east. Czechs and Austrians quickly capitulated, but the Poles fought against the heroic fight against big chances. The difference between Hitler's military power and Chamberlain, who waved Munich as a white flag, proclaiming "peace in our time" has to date sustained propaganda qualities. Here, in its original context, it resonates even more strongly as the darkness of the World War appears in Europe, leaving two options, freedom or slavery to the American viewer. In 1943, there was no avoidance of this simple truth, and the Nazi strike gave its own point.
