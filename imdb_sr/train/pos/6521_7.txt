Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this as a good movie. Although details can be "dramatized", the overall history was a good example. In addition, I found the perception of actors that I knew was a real pleasure. Who imagined Ben Cartwright like a coward? I'll leave you the rest of the star. As for the secondary casting, this film (as could be expected from a film made at the end of the thirties) has a lot of fun actor, but the top actor on the right hand of Andrea Jackson Peavey. Perfect touch of comedy. I shoot well, with beautiful ships, and competent acting performances, I recommend this for everyone with a taste for a light camp, or an eye for a double period, set in the wings of America, and made in the period when names, and actors of superior character, were truly pleased to enjoy in.
