Created in 1946 and published in 1948, The Ladi and Shanghai was one of the great films Velles made after returning from a relative exile for making Citizen Kane. Dark, imagined and expressing some early Cold War paranoia, this film is tall as a movie movie. The cinema of this film is filled with Velles's characteristic wonders of strange angles, quick cuts, long panes and malevolent illumination. The use of street street music is the forerunner of the incredible long opening in the Touch of Evil, and mysterious Chinese characters and sequences in the Chinese neighborhood can be regarded as an inspiration, in many ways, to the Roman neighborhood of Roman Polanski. Unfortunately, Velles' obsession is precisely the technical recording of a movie that completely spoils this film. The story of this story is often lost beyond the sometimes incomprehensible disturbance of film techniques. However, despite these criticisms, the story in combination with the beautiful performances of Velles, Haivort and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) make this. movie joy to watch. Orson Velles entails not only an Irish undertaking, but a broken identity as a sincere but dangerous sailor. Rita Haivorth, who was at that time married to Velles, interrupted her usual roles as the goddess of sex and assumed the role of real depth and contradiction. Finally, Glenn Anders is a strange and bizarre portrait or Elsin's partner for husband husbands is nothing more than a classic!
