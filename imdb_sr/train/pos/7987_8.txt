The man on the fire was hot. I love the classic story of good revenge, and it's a better thing to revenge the kidnapping of an innocent girl. The writers have done a great job in this film about building a relationship between Creation (Denzel Washington) and Pete (Dakota Fanning) so that the viewer understands and actually feels that Creasy had to save Pit. It was also a good thing that Creasy was not a type of choir, who was trying to save Pitu through the "real" channels, but he used the tactics of torture and street-mindedness. Some may say, "Torture is wrong regardless," and you may be right, but when you see the pain that Creasy is experiencing for the loss of Pite and the passion for returning, you can not help with Creasy and pull him to be more merciless. There would have been no progress if Creasi used diplomacy to deal with various notorious gangsters and criminals, and he knew it. bad guys. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the film, but actually strengthened it, indicating that Creasy was willing to die in order to return Pitu. His death was noble in fact. Denzel does an excellent job as well as writers. This movie deserves good grades because it was definitely a good movie.
