All right, there are many reviews, what can I add? I will try anyway. The reason for this is my favorite Scrooge for everything. Sets, open-air locations, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. Music is sweet. Supporters are very well made. One of my favorites is the narrator and nephew of Roger Rees. His honest sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas for me. David Varner is also quite convincing Bob Cratchit. His hard life, but he remains positive and dignified. The best part of the course is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some said his portrait was too rough. I could not get along anymore. His exchange at the beginning, while it was cold or raw, was not beyond character. He is a terribly disappointed man whose heart has been hardened by the uncertainties of life and by his lust for wealth. During flashback, it's obvious that he is not all rough. Here we see that there is hope for him. Had he completely disappeared, his partner Marleigh would never come for him. And after all, we did not hope for anybody. I think that's the HUGE part of what Dickens tried to say. When Scrooge looks at his dance with his employer from Belle, you see him laughing with a sad smile saying Belle says he will go through his life "with a smile on my face." Clive Donner was smart enough as a director to allow those moments on the film. Sometimes they leave them on the floor of the assembly. And finally, his conversion is so absolutely filled with joy that screaming me tears of joy every time I see her. His apology to his nephew, Fred, so honest, so mobile, is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of mankind itself. The joy that Freud brings to his wife is so obvious. And the line that brings me every time, "God forgive me for the time I lost." Bravi tutti!
