THE ODD COUPLE (3+ of 5 stars) Like most people, I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive "Odd Couple". Their incredible work on TV shows from the early to mid-70s was a sign of high water for television at that time ... easily surpassing scenic and screen versions of the story. Still, how can you make a mistake with the pair of Jack Lemmon / Valter Matthau? Matthau is in a particularly good form like Oscar. Lemmon gets used to Felix, especially if you've already seen Tony Randall. The scenario is good ... definitely the best Neil Simon. (I will write here that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most drama writers of the American theater.) A madman who needs help to save money for alimony. Their lifestyle arrangement becomes similar to marriage, culminating in some fun typhi and spats. A lot of fun and some great liners.
