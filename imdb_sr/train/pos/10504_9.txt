Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very fun and very cool game for the N64. Bovser is ready for his usual shenanigans (yes, that's a stupid word, but the only one I can remember) and Mario must stop him again. This game is very fun to play and it contains a lot of nostalgia to me. The only bad thing about this is graphics, which is terrible for today's standards, but everything else is pretty good (especially small mini-games that you can unlock). which I recommend to any Mario fan, or any fan platform games. Super Mario Sunshine is winning every day. 9/10 Or: A
