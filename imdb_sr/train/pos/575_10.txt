A great drama with all the areas covered EXCLUDE for the screenplay that was slow and needed to show more relevant scenes such as the Pitt character in conversation with the president, or Pitt to be killed instead of describing it. Removing some useless minutes could make more space for staggering scenes such as those. The withdrawal of the film has kept this all the time, although I see Pitt, the film seems so worth watching. And the styles of the 20th century and Montana will really like ........
