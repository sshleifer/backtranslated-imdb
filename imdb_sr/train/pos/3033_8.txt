Good old black and white Graham Green based people on dangerous moments based on heroic and mysterious things. He was hardly fired from a firearm, or a blow was struck and a hundred times more interesting than a globe that Hollywood today is killing. Bacall, of course, lights up the screen, and Boier is fully engaged. They no longer make such films.
