I usually do not like to realize shoems, especially those who profit from the success of "American Idol". But this one I can live with. Comrades from around the world perform a short routine for connoisseurs scouts, and if they like, they will be sent on a routine for the real audience. . Then, ten or twelve comics who live together in the house and compete in the style of Survivor are selected using comic tactics. Then it will be defined as "Last Comic Standing". I like to stand in comedy, so this must be one of the real shows I should be interested in. Usually some funny comics are selected. They began their careers such talents as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie Mai and Josh Blue. My negative criticism is the fact that there is a possibility that many of these comics have been selected because of their contribution to the reality of the shov drama. At first, they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now they stopped, thank God. And there are many comedians that I felt, they were chosen not because they are funny, but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, etc. when other comics clearly had to beat them. But all in all, it's well-made to realize the shov, who until now considered oxymoron.
