I think that many people have just written this as another of Tom Cruise's strange films (Magnolia, Eies Vide Shut), but Vanilla Ski is definitely his own movie. Many people said it was weird; it's not. It was different and confusing, but not strange. Strange is Stanley Kubrick or Pauli Shore. Truman's show is different. The Matrix or Game is confusing. Unlike Kubrick, this film has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - maybe not immediately, perhaps even today, but it makes sense. Vanilla Ski is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That's the point. The so-called "monsters" appeared there, where critics drew attention. If they tried to "open [their] eyes" as the original Spanish film from 1997, they would see it. And if that's not a good reason to see it, go see it for music. Cameron Crove offers a wonderful soundtrack; It uses it to set the "feeling" - this notorious element missing from many movies. With songs such as The Beach Bois "Good Vibrations" that play on the dramatic and emotional peak of the film, it creates an unusual, but stunning, "real" feeling. A great movie, in its script, music, acting and pictures, Vanilla Ski is, unfortunately, a superficial film criticized by critics to look intelligent. Excellent: A +
