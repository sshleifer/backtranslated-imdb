I saw this as a young naive punk when it was first published. I had a sneaking like a baby while I left the theater, trying not to let anyone see. So, when I saw him again in '07, I knew what to expect and he was ready and filled to get closer to the time he needed. Fortunately, this time I was at home. What I did not remember from my youthful look - or perhaps I did not notice it because of it - was the technical brightness of this film. The use of flashbacks that talk so many stories without resorting to dialogue. A camera that looked like it had put the viewer together with the characters in the scene. Think about opening when Joe crosses the street to the restaurant, the camera stands behind a woman and a child sitting on the bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. The story itself, and characters - evil, sad and brutally real. It's very touching to be drawn so narrowly into a human drama as it is for people who most would probably throw us away. Joe & Ratso could be any of us. It must have been '70 when I saw it. I remember that when I left the theater, I had to find a friendship company. All these years later, I'm glad I did not have it myself alone. This is a wonderful movie.
