One of the best comedians ever. I've seen this show about 10 times and I'll probably watch it at least 100 more times. My friends and family often quoted from this DVD, thought that we did not do anything else but to watch. The starting part of Alcatraz is a bit slow, but either go through it or drive it to where Eddie is on the scene. Watch out for the "Cake or Death" section (Joking about the Church of England) and "Hitler / Paul Pot" part (It's hard to explain, just watch). The best part of the show can be Eddie's face. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eye pencil and eye shadow for probable help, huh?) Fair warning: Eddie has a tendency to throw a lot of four-letter words.
