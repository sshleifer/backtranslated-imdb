The first time I saw it in the cinema when it came out, and the audience was really in a movie that made the experience even more fun. This is a great character figure, many great names in it, and some of them were not as recognized as it is now. I think it's a great idea if you follow one of these actors, or you liked them in other films, to add it to your list. Some of the scenes actually remind me of a kind of comedy like The Birdcage or even The Clue, an unusual spontaneous comedy, with a truly professional delivery of these beloved actors. The film has done a great job to provide you with some insight, perhaps even very realistic, in the culture of daily soap.
