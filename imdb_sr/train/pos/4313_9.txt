The great canyon belongs to a very scanty category: it's a very smart movie, with very clever dialogues and food for thought from everywhere from the beginning to the end. I have the impression that I have never reached a well-deserved rank (and never will) because of my simplicity. This kind of movement requires sensitive observers. It was a pity that IMDb forced me to write ten lines, because this is not in any way necessary in this particular case. In any case, in order to fulfill this request, I will tell you that the weak side of the film, if any, is in the act: not that it is bad, but that it could have been done much better. The exception is for Kevin Kline who was perfect. Go ahead and watch.
