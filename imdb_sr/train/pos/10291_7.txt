After a slow start, BRUCE OF VEGETABLES is a very funny movie that has something positive to say. It was not one of the best performances of Jim Carrei, but he was still fine. Morgan Freeman was right as God. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments. I miss Steve Correll at "DAILY SHOW!" I love the films of director Tom Shadiaca. He worked both LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and THE NUTTI PROFESSOR. In all three and Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedy star and tells the human story. A director who knows comedy, can get the talent he gets, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with her is hard to find. I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three most fun parts of the entire film. I assume that the first few draft scenarios had multiple biblical references, but they were excluded because the producers were scared to offend people. It's bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity. My Rating: 7 of 10
