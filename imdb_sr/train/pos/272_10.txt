I loved him, but he still has nightmares over the hotel manager. The film is well presented, with a selection of actors who carry their roles in the reality of writing. Many scenes captured the imagination and created nail bite. The progress of the situation was wisely written, which led me to believe that the story led only in one direction to find a new turn in what I considered to be obvious. It's a shame that there must be commercials. I told many friends to look further, and I will of course look again. I enjoyed the film's scenography and felt it adds to complications and intrigues. Women and spouses were very realistic. The initial situation is common, but the escalation in the story, which fortunately is presented, is not. Thank you! We look forward to the next films - when?
