I just saw it last night, it was broadcast in the "Passionate Eye" series of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It was recently shown (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival, as well as many others. It's a very important movie. The filmmakers literally came across the story, because they were there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they were found in the middle of the events until the coup took place. They had unprecedented access to events and people, and mostly let the story unfold in the way it is happening. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which is obvious) but are held in the background and instead try to draw attention to events, people, the background and history that led to a coup. As a film, he is not revolutionary in stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that's, I think, the way he should be. What we can see is what really should be 'embedded' journalism. What we see is a remarkable demonstration of a country struggling to achieve democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who is really concerned about his people ... a story of power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests to combine to lead a coup a democratically elected leader ... and an unprecedented approach to the historical event taking place. <br /> <br />
