I recently saw it on the cable channel. The film is excellent; It's one of the few musicals I've ever seen to be scared of light and darkness. It shows some of the brilliant era together with a lot of dirt. Some of the dance sequences are so much that I did not know where to look. One day I will go and see this on the big screen, just to see what's going on. But what really brings this up to the second level is the effect of Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only is a person completely malicious and dangerous, but there are still some, some internal demons. He gave me the impression that if you push him into the corner, he is capable of everything. Almost as if Sikes's character was on the brink of crazy, just waiting for the trigger. I saw Bill Sikes by Robert Nutton from the 1948 movie, and I thought he was just "bad egg," but the performance of Oliver Reed intimidated me in my living room.
