I love this show. Every day I watch all the replay, although I watched them all as 6 times. About two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bines) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. Holly goes to live with Val when their father is transferred to Japan. Val has a perfect life, he has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment in Upper East Side. The emission basically shows all the problems that Vall and Holly are passing through. The main problem is the guys, but another life choice is also responsible. Holly is 16 years old and represents total free spirit, while Val is completely opposite. It is organized and must have a plan to do anything. Other characters include Henry, Vince, Garry, Lauren and Tina.
