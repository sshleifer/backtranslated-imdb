My father was the prison director (now retired) shown in this documentary and grew up in prison life, so my views will be completely different from all the others who watch this film. I'll say this, the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute wonder are fantastic artists and even better people. They were brave enough to A) appear and apologize to this story, B) Enter into the minds and hearts of the prisoners, and C) Do all this responsibly. He is responsible for their art and, more importantly, he is responsible for prisoners and staff of the Complex Luther Luckett. These works should be praised endlessly. Take 170 hours, to HOURS, recordings and be able to cut and reduce up to 93 minutes of riveting is nothing less than extraordinary and they are my highest consideration. I saw this film in circumstances that only a very small number was able to see it. I was shooting prisoners. I was in the same room with these people as they watched their heart spill onto the screen. I saw people crying on television crying in the chair in front of me and letting me tell you, it was a very deep experience. In some cases these people committed horrible crimes, but they nevertheless found ways to try to redeem themselves, even if they consider themselves unacceptable. How much does our courage have to do? How many people could do what they did in such a harsh environment? Watching them reacting to the movie was an experience I am grateful forever, and I will never forget that. I thank the people who allowed me to look at their lives, thank my father for what he did ALL these possible, and I thank Philomath Films for taking the time to pour out his blood, sweat, soul and tears into this project. /> This movie will change everything you think you know about prison life and prisoners in it. "Oz" is not real, television is not real. 'Shakespeare Behind Bars' is.
