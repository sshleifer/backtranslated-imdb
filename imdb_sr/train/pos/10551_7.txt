Sitting, Tiping ?? Nothing is the latest "what if?" offered by Vincenzio Natali, and starring David Hevlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One of them has problems with relationships, he got a job from work (because of problems in connection) and the police are ready to catch him (because of work and connection problems). The other guy is an agoraphobic who refuses to leave outside his home, and he gets a boring guide to a girlfriend who calls her mom to claim she is abused when she does not buy cookies from him. Oh yes, the police are following him, after the mommy scout invites him to arrest him. Man, what kind of day. What if you could all go missing this way? It's the whole premise behind 'Nothing'. Two fools realize, policemen, scouts, cars, lawn, road, everything? disappear. There is nothing but a white space! This is an interesting concept I thought. I also looked at it at that time, 30 minutes passed in the movie, and I still had an hour in the movie. Can two actors do this and entertain us for 60 minutes? Although the actors are trying, 60 minutes of IS is a long time and there is obviously dead air in the places of this film. But two actors, who are long-time friends and directors, have a big repertoire with each other, that it was fun to watch the dialogue and improve the nonsense around them. There are many supernatural elements, but this is more their response to these elements that ultimately make this movie worthwhile.
