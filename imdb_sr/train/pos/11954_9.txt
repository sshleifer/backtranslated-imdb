Excellent movie, enough laughter and action for any audience. Since the last person who published this movie took over to call Voody Allen incestuous and not comment on the movie, here I am. /> The film follows the unexpected duo, Johansson and Allen, who follow the advice given to them by the spirit of the recently deceased English reporter. Their search leads them to the killer's house, and eventually to a somewhat tragic end. But do not let the action deceive you, the movie is really hilarious and the acting is great. It seems that when directors arrive at a certain age, they really correct things. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack seem to be making some of the most meaningful jobs of their career. Also, watching a movie at the Pact Theater, you can only say that people really like Voody Allen and are ready for him to really come back. The second time he was on the screen, the audience shone. There's something about a man and he really shines in Scoop. Check, it's worth a trip.
