I have fully enjoyed this movie, but four things really stand out: the perfect comic team of Sam Raymy and the performance as the man at hand (?), The wonderful characteristic of Alan Arkine, the owner of the camp, and the best of the cinema. Beautiful golden tones of external scenes enters me in a movie like the sunset on the shores of the lake pulls me into my personal memories. Dialogue and mood feel very natural and convincing. Some critics criticize the lack of "deeper" scenarios. For me, this is the shortcoming of this movie. The characters and their problems look real, and that's why I care about what's happening to them. The bottom line is that all parts join together to create a whole that feels right.
