Let's start this review on a positive note - I'm so glad they did not decide to get off with Tony who was shot and make a retrospective season as some people voted. In fact, the creator and writer of this episode, David Chase, did the opposite. We do not really know if Toni will live or die. He is in a coma and his chance to recover is very small. It seemed that this episode was moving very slowly, and the dream that provoked someone, Tony included the wrong identity and cried the Asian monks who slammed the chic out of him, absolutely, unusual. After 45 minutes I got a little sick of all the grief, but that should not be a reason to break this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was still well written and intense. Edie Falco in this episode showed an incredible performance that defined career, while a conflicting woman faced her husband's death. I also found it interesting that AJ left the school and swore to retaliate against Junior, who AJ will most likely not have the ball to retreat. Silvio now plays the boss who opens many door problems in later episodes. And in this episode there were lots of great torments, and I think Vito 'Spider-shooter Pole-smoker' might fall into his death if he continues to be greedy SOB It was not a great episode and disappointed just because Although Tony kills people, we as an audience adore him and we feel that he is our hero of the show. This was a necessary episode for the series, although it was a little snoring that led to the conclusion. Honor for Edie Falco, and David Chase and writers to create this completely original and unpredictable plot. This is the only season 'The Sopranos', in which I have no idea where it will go. I can not wait for an episode next week. My Rating: 7.5 / 10 Best line episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
