The man running is one of those films that would, if supervised, become annoying and depressing even. My advice is to watch it perhaps once or twice a year with a couple of friends and a couple of drinks. In today's climate of TV media dominance and the capitalist regime in society, it really functions as a revisionist social commentary, after the 1980s. Forget it! There are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this movie. Schvarzenegger is at the top of Ben's "Butcher of Bakersfield" Richards, and the inclusion of Bond-belting one liner is fully inspired indeed, while Killian over the camera is the main accent. The stalker design is authentic American and reflects the features seen in the TV show 'Gladiators'. and VVE. The terrible end of the Buzz-saw will cool down all the viewers to the core (as a note of the foot, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is supposedly optimistic shareholder with a bitter sense of humor?) Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen is as great as the accompanying muscles (and Arnies buds are in real life), and even Mick Fleetvood in it! What more can you ask for? I recommend Running Man if you are looking for a great fun action, with great finish and some great characters. Just do not expect education from him (at least for surface value). Quality, I really love him. You will, unless you are an actress. 7/10
