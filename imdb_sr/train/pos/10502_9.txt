one of the most intriguing Mario's that I've ever played. levels are creative, there are fluid controls and good graphics for your time. There are a lot of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels become frustrating, and if you omit some of the difficult levels and you still need to do more to fight the boss, it can be bored. The second objection is the angle of the camera; Although most of the time works pretty well, in certain situations it can be pain. if your big fan was mario; this is for you. Even if you do not adore it, I would recommend this one. It's a great game, and getting what you need can take a while, but it's very satisfying. good for playing at short time intervals. it will almost certainly keep your interest; it certainly has mine!
