I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I did not know who some of the actors were, and I did not know that the film would turn out to be different from the way it was shown. Of course, I loved that. Varren Beatty plays Detective Dick Tracy from the 1930s who is fighting crime and who goes to the biggest mafia bosses in the city. This time, Big Boi Caprice (Al Pacino) has killed a very powerful man and goes to take over the city with his girlfriend Singer Behind Mahonei (Madonna) with a look at Traci. It gets worse because the new criminal is attacking and the worst part is: this criminal has no faces. He or she is very unknown. In addition, famous villians returned from a comic book collection. I thought this film was very vibrant and creative. It was fun and fun to watch, especially as a child. Varren Beati was the same as James Bond from the 1930s in the way Dicka Tracy played. The composition of the ensemble includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headley, Villiam Forsithe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O Ross, Tommi Lee Jones, Mandi Patinkin, Charles Durning. Plus More! Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and fun is a movie for the family to enjoy. Take my word for it.
