And I absolutely love Isabelle Blais !!! She was so cute in this film, and she was very different from her role in Quebec-Montreal, where she looked more like a man eating. I think she should have been nominated for Jutro. I mean, Sivlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was far superior, IMO. Pelletier did a great job for his first release, and I noticed he sneered into several of his friends from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Gui A. LePage and Andre Ducharme. It was fun to see them in this, I did not know it would appear. I do not think I have seen a romantic comedy from Kuebeck that I did not like, and this one is as good as anything else I had the pleasure to see. And if you are in countries and you are wondering how to get a copy of DVD, varcharbault.ca delivered it to me in less than a week.
