Read Eric's review again. He perfectly described my feelings for this film so louder than I ever could. I'm just writing here to further encourage you to look for it and see it. I saw it many years ago on television, I mean the IFC. It's such a unique movie that I do not like to make comparisons. It is filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the merciless bay of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not Durango in Mexico (from John Wayne's films), but a truly shabby and wild place. Now I need to find a novel to check the original location of the story. Like the location, this film is weird and wild, beautiful and weird and absolutely not for everyone. It's a kind of production that almost motivates me to study a movie. I did not actually forget this movie, it is indelible. However, over the years, I have forgotten about its existence. I do not know anyone who saw it, I never read it, nor did I see any reference to it. Erendir is such an unusual name, I even forgot my title. Well, I'm going to ask for a copy now. ** Since then, I have become a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Markuez, and therefore I am sorry that I have not read it before. In relation to MsMith's comment below; The film was filmed in Mexico, but the author is Colombian and in no way commented on the history of Mexico or Mexico, although Marcus now lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. I'm still desperately trying to find a copy of this movie for my library. I liked the movie? You must read the story and then everything else written by Garcia Markuz. And, by the way, the original location in the story was Colombia.
