Despite Disney's best efforts, this is a pretty funny movie about dreaming your dreams. I was surprised that it was not too sentimental for me; this movie was played fairly. Dennis Kuaid was very, very good in the role, which speaks something for a sports film. I can not remember how many sports movies there were some strange things that bother me; Everyone is watching the role here. This film is surprisingly good, and I anticipate it will be surprising, because it is a G-rated movie that does not require viewers to stop thinking. Ebert on the contrary, this film is a success.
