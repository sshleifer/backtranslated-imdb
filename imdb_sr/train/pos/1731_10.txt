The era of sexualization film of the late sixties and early seventies began with the granting of free nudity in mainstream movies and ended with the legalization of hardcore pornography. The greatest years were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most liked and talented actresses of that time was Monika Gail, who had a small but fanatical cult follower. She was actually able to act, unlike many who had fulfilled the main roles of these movements, and her subsequent points proved this. And her seemingly intentional appearance pale into darkness at the moment when her career flew only enhances her mysticism. Garry Graver, Director, was also a talent; probably too talented for a sexploitic genre, and his skill, combined with the presence of Monica Gaile's screen, makes Sandra, Creation of a Woman, a pleasant experience. The film never pulls and you do not have to press the finger on the fast-forward button.
