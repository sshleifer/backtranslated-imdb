I must say, Clive Barker's Undiing is by far the best horror game ever made. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Castlevania games, but none of them won the pure pleasure with which this game deals with its terrible elements. Barker is good at what he does, which is the attribution of horror to our world, and this shows that his hand is obvious everywhere in this game. Even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Full of lush visual effects and ample atmosphere to shake a stick, Undiing is a game that will win in my books as the best title of horror. I wish this came to the console system, but unfortunately, poor sales on the computer reduced it to the root.
