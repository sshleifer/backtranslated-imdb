This film echoed me with two levels. As a child, I was evacuated from London and planted with reluctant hosts in a village village. As I avoided the bombing and had experiences that produced valuable memories (for example, listening to slavuja singing a dark night for the first time) and enjoying life I could never have in London, I missed my family and worried about them. Tom is an old man whose wife and child both died and lives alone in a small village. As an old man who is now without a woman whose children have married and live far away in another province, I am sometimes alone once again. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very strange ideas about raising a child. Since deep love has developed between Tom Oakley and this young boy, Tom searches for him and finally saves him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story there is great tension, because because of some bureaucratic reign, it seems that a child will lose someone who has developed a love affair with him.
