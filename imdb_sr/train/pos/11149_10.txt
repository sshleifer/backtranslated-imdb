Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides to leave his little life in Texas and make him big in a big city. Women are there for questioning and men are mostly "tutti-fruttis". Broadly speaking, he comes to New York, is not ready for a series of humiliating calamities he experiences, one up from the other. In the midst of this chaos, he is acquainted with Rica's "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a man who looks like a homeless man and lives in a seemingly condemned building. There are not many stories while MIDNIGHT COVBOI is a vignette series that is destined to bring not only Joe Buck's things in the City but also an inter-cut for his past and to show us in shock cuts and semi-psychedelic sequences the dream of his past: his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt) who was raped in a gang, his abandonment by her mother, and his apparent abuse by his grandmother, who also had the habit of pushing men for money. The air of pessimism dominates the movie almost from the beginning, since Nilsson plays through the introductory reward with his deceptive floral "Everibodi's Talking"; we think that even as long as we want Joe to finally realize his seal in the City, the odds are high, but they will not end up working for cash prizes in the dead end - shown in a master record from his outer spot later in the movie while looking at the man how he works in the dishwasher dish into the kitchen of the national kitchen through the window and sees herself. We know from the view in his eyes that he does not want to end this way. The dark story of broken hopes, John Schlesinger creates horrible pictures of lost souls at the end of the sixties and the center, the prevailing friendship between the two men as they struggle to make some sense in their lives amid the uncomfortable comfort of dignified life. There is an implicit conception that they may have been lovers - Ratso has given his hand to hug Joe on the party scene, and their ultimate embrace in the end definitely points to this - but that's basically a movie that manages to survive literally, to death, and bring a kind of hope, Joe, who eventually appears to be much changed in Florida, is older, wiser.
