I've always enjoyed movies that show life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no complication, and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Runs Through It" is the perfect name for this film (and the novel by Norman Maclean). The life of ebbs and flows like a river, and it has its own rugged points, but it's a wonderful journey. His story has a nice feeling that perfectly fits the picture. As a director, he is restrained and calm, and records some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly well as brothers. I do not know how to describe the performances of Tom Scerritt and Brenda Blethin, except that they really feel real. "The river passes through it" is a wonderful movie. 8.6 from 10
