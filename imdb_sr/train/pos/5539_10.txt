When I first watched this movie, it was a copy taken and the title was / was Caged Terror. I still own a tape, and I admit it, I've watched it many times from the beginning to the end! The film is an extremely small budget and dialogue is often unintentionally fun! I have arrived a few of my friends to watch this and we had a great laugh from the horrible scenario. The movie refers to a couple, (remember that it was early in the 1970s, so they are too hip-hop!) They go to a weekend camp in what I think was supposed to be in New York. They have a hilarious dialogue after catching and eating fish, and the girl mourns the death of a fish and eats it! The guy came back with something stupid about eating fish and now he was part of them, and he leaves; "And that's a wonderful man!" A hard man, really tough! LOL! In any case, a couple of Vietnamese veterinarians come together, one of those who play flute, I believe. (In any case they are music guys!) The guys are obviously attracted to the girl and when the couple show themselves hostile, they end up terrorizing during the night. The guy ends up in a hen house, and he has to watch his girlfriend delighted. In fact, by the end of the night, she seems to have pretty much got into it, and when she comes in the morning, the guys leave, and the girl and the boy can leave. Apparently, a man has learned a lesson on how to deal with people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this film to anyone who wants a damn good laugh! He never loves me anyway! If I could find this on a DVD and replace an old copy, I would actually buy it again, it's a classic camp! You have to love these things!
