It's rare to find the film flawless. It's really one of the best acting films I've ever seen. Each dialogue line can be interpreted in several ways, distinct from each of the three main characters. The film permeates the inner network of motivations and double crosses that capture you and refuse to let them go. Add to this that the slow romance between Kevin and Faie is as movable as anything that has ever been devoted to celluloid and you have ingredients for a perfect movie. He shows romantic movies such as "Titanic" as banal clich√©s. If you are looking for a movie to watch while folding the underwear, that's not it. You have to devote to this film. You can not hold a conversation while you run into a room and exit from it. This film requires your attention. Treat him with the respect you deserve and get a lot of it. Unless you think that "Titanic" is the biggest movie ever.
