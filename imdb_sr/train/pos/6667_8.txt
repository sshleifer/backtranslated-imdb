OK. There are people who should not see this movie. 1) Do not see it if you do not like satirical or black humor. 2) You do not like being offended by The Vatchmen. 3) Do not see him if you want a serious superhero movie. Others, run, do not walk, see _Mister Men_. Funny, that's weird, it's a wonderful sendup of every bad superhero known to a man. The occasional jolts of junior humor do not ruin the zero-sum fun of Jeanne Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hanka Azari, as well as several funny minor parts of Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (It's nice to see Louise Lasser get the job.) I laughed until the end. Totally frivolous, a bit strange, but - good.
