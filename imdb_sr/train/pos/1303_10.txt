Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker reunite to play all their songs 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "Cream". These were the psychedelic days of England and America, and they looked like this: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues, and that was usually a good thing. Well, these guys are now 60 years old and still can sing and play at a high level. how this awesome DVD concert disc shows us. I was always very familiar with Clapton, of course, who was never in the center of attention, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, and I have not seen one of them for decades. They were surprised. When he was young, Baker was so thin that he looked like a hasty deadly death. Now it looks healthy, in shape, and drumming was solid. Bruce looked a bit exhausted, but his voice was excellent, as he always felt pleasure in those old songs. This is great stuff and they come from guys who know what they are doing. Some people have criticized this show because they were low. I do not agree with that. I have no objection. The concert sounded very good. The second song, "Spoonful," was an extraordinary, peak of the concert for me. Highly recommended.
