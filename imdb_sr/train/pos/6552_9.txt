Usually, Emma Roberts does not like me so much, but after seeing Nancy Drew, I have somehow changed my mind. Actors in films have made it all exciting and entertaining. Most of the time you watch a mysterious movie you can solve it before the middle of the show, but in this movie it's like you're actually there. Traces must fit in until you finally understand the whole crime. I'm still stunned as she discovered it. The whole movie was really smart and the people who watched him liked the movie too. Clothes was my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I do not think there will be any more such a film until a sequel comes out. I give him nine because the popular girls did not really look like they were right, but they still laugh at me. It was a really great movie and a big mystery. I definitely recommend that I watch it.
