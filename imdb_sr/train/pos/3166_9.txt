This show has come to date. Initially everyone in the acting crew from Erica to Fez, all were new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just look at what they achieved. They stayed in the show and it was a success. His one of the best shows ever made and her most amusing sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see the end, but if they finish this show, I hope God finishes the series with one of the biggest bugs he has ever had any finals of the season. I do not care if the whole season is crap because it saves all the fuel for the last episode. Go down, swing, beat the last blow. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they leave, let everyone know how it will end up, like on Friends, and let the finals be huge. I say that Donna and Eric are married, I say that Hide and Kelso fought and became friends again, I say that something interesting happens between Fez and Jackie because Fez is trying so long, but of course he will not succeed. ONLY CLOSE THE LARGE TIME SERIES! This 70th show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hide, I wish I had friends. You are the best! 10/10 Brands: 10/10 ...
