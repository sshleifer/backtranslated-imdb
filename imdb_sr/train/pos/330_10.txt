I am Italian, and when I recently looked at this film, I was stunned by his beauty: for the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can appreciate it with the mind and the feelings of adults. Now I understand that this was the masterpiece of a special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini, etc.), Until then, the missing. Hollywood epic movies are good ... for fun. Maybe this Odyssey did not have an English version because it's not funny enough ... it's not suitable for the public and cocaine. Still suitable for Homer Pathos and existentialist thinking. In Italy recently released very good DVD version: INTEGRAL, with great colors. You can find it in some shared files, but only in Italian and without subtitles. Too bad: the dialogues and voices of this film are remarkable.
