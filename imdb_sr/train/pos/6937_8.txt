This thrilling Western one twisted the story of the famous Western Rifle that everyone wanted. James Stewart is a cowboy who wins the Vinchester Prize in a shootout only to lose him in robbery. The story talks about Stevart's search for a rifle and a certain man through a movie. The gun changes hands from time to time, as if the owner was destined to lose it by violence. The picture has a lot of action and uncertainty while Stevart closes in his quarry. The great actor is supported by Stevart, Stephen McNalli, Dan Durie, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jai C. Flippen. It seems that Shelley Vinters is wrong here and that the purpose of her role is quite vague. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, teenagers in later years, have short but good roles.
