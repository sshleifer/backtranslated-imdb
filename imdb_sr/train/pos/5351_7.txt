Although this movie is somewhat filled with an eight-year-old, I have a place in the DVD stand and I do not know why. I think I like it because the story of 'television is a garbage, so turn it off and go and find life.' For those of you who choose to listen to a message, you should try to read the book, its movie is not at all similar to the movie. To destroy it for you at the end of the story, fatal wounded Richards ended with a plane crash in the network building, killing himself, everything inside and turning off the network at the same time. I read it many years ago, but today it's hard to compare it to September 11th.
