When I first saw the Exorcists in 3000, I did not expect this film. Although, it was not as bad as I thought. It is a type of Italian version of Roadvarrior, with actors, which is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story are Elisa Briganti and Dardano Satcheti, who are also responsible for the story of zombie carnivores. You can also see other links to Italian horror films: Luca Venantini plays Tommy's role, and you can see this child in the Paura nella citta dei morti viventi like John Robbins and Cannibal as the role of Mary's brother. Pretty funny movie, with some boring parts.
