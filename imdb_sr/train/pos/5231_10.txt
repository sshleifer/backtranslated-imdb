to communicate in the film the essential things of life - such as life, does it have a meaning? - It's completely impossible. Of course, the possible answers to these questions are shown in every movie (story), but communication requires a direct call to consciousness. This happens if the entrance from the senses dominates the "entrance" from our mind, i.e. Our thoughts. A few directors know how to convey important things. Tarkovsky is one. His "Stalker" shows the images of existence, communicates life as it appears, and yet your mind is avoided. I think De Zee and De Graaff are doing the same.
