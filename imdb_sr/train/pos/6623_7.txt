First, the film is sick. A person who works on 3D CG films as lighter / composer, the visions have delighted me. Every second I was stunned by what was on the screen. As for the story, well, it's okay. It will not set the world on fire, but if you like your futuristic stories about Blade Runner (and who does not?) Then you'll be fine. I must say that I felt that the acting was very gentle and distracted from the movie as a whole. I saw him in a cinema in English, but I hope there is a French version that floats somewhere. It is definitely worth seeing.
