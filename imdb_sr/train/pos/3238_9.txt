Finnish version of "Short Cuts" by Robert Altman, set up in a small rural town of Aanekoski. Episodes represent a kaleidoscope of eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disappointment, hopelessness and death. Especially impressed by two episodes. The first is a story about a young waitress who is trying to encourage romance for her associates: she radiates the overwhelming joy of love and life. The second episode presents and the old man dies in the hospital, and his wife is trying to help him die dignity. Particularly striking is the way the old couple must fight against degrading practices in the hospital and their loneliness is contrary to the "routine" of the hospital's crew (despite signs of occasional empathy). Compared to Altman's classic, this movie may be less professional, but it's definitely a great deal.
