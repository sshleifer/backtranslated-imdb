I really thought this film was excellent. Not only is history true, it is also a style that is luxurious, yet intimate. I was the fan of Emily Blunt about Victoria and how she retained her spirit, although she was forced into a virtual exile in her youth. Blunt describes the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic way in which Vicotria has become famous (perhaps infamous). The romantic elements of the film are so sincere and gentle that you can really understand why the Vicotria decided to spend the rest of their lives in Albert's grief until the end of the film. Technical aspect of the movie worthy of attention. I appreciate a nice review, which is quite beautiful with the dramatic movement of the story. I thought that the film scene was remarkable, some of the scenes leave me breathless because of the brilliance and shine they show. This year there were so few movies as beautiful and gentle as this film is and evaluates. as one of the best 2009!
