This film was absolutely brilliant. That actually led me to think. During the entire film I was confused as hell. I loved everything about it ... it was so confusing and so weird and weird that it was hard not to love it. All the actors were phenomenal, and nobody could do a better job ... This is one of my favorites for the year ... deserves the charm.
