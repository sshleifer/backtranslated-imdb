I'm sorry, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but I've known him for 25 years. She said that Scott Vilson was extremely well presented by a sociopath (without conscience). I agree! She also said that Robert Blake showed a person with anger and impulse control who had conscience, but could not be controlled perfectly. I agree! What a cool and huge movie. I've seen over 2000 movies and ranking this in the top 100. My lifelong friend regularly deals with clients like these. My only criticism was storytelling at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less ideal circumstances, but only one million will behave like these two losers.
