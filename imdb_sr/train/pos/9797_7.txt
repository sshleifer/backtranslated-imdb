Batman: Mystery Batvoman is the latest animated Batman directly on the video / DVD movie to be released. The action revolves around a new fighter for criminals, Batvoman, who appears to have been personally involved, for whatever reason, in stopping a large consignment of weapons. Although the movie is interesting enough, it's not as good as the 'Fantasy Mask', 'Sub-Zero' or 'Return of the Joker'. The main reason is that it does not give emotional attraction to other films. At the end of this film, we do not feel sorry for anyone like we did in others, in particular, "Sub-Zero". There is no real tragedy that would make other animated films special for us. Even Batvoman is not really a "tragic" character (like Mr. Freeze or Phantasm). And not only that, but Batvomenina's alter ego seems so incredibly "stiff" and boring that the viewer does not care about what happened to her, why she put on a mask, or what happens to her eventually and there lies the main reason we do not get this special emotional attraction. Do not misunderstand me, I found the movie comfortable. It has its moments, such as when the audience finds out who Batvoman really saw an old returnee who was last seen in the original Batman series: Animated. The action is also very pleasant at some very tense moments. If the background of Batvoman was more interesting, this film would be better than the "Return of the Joker" in my book, but as it is now, it's in 4th (out of 4). As for animation, it's the same as cartoon Nev Batman Adventures from mid to late 1990s. The result is not so unforgettable as the previous 3 animated Batman movie, but it's still good. I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its drawbacks, it is pleasant. But remember, it's not as good as the other Batman animated films. 7/10
