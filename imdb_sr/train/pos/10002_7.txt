It's easily the most indispensable film castle in the Brooks Cannon. Of course, that's wrong. This does not give a realistic view of homelessness (as opposed to, for example, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of the singers in the showroom, or Titanic gave a realistic view of the Italians VI IDIOTE). Many jokes are falling. However, this film is very appealing in a way that many comedies do not, and that is the truth in the story of some of the traditionally convicted members of society. It's not the king of fishermen, but it's not shit either. My only remark is that Brooks should surrender to someone else (I like Mel as a director and writer, not as much as leadership).
