I've watched this movie twice and I think it's pretty good for the limited equipment used to create this movie. (shot in 1947) Dr. Heierdahl explains his theory of the migration of South American pre-Columbian Indians to the Polynesian islands, with abortion falling with large balsams. This documentary follows dr. Heierdahl and the crew while picking up balloons in Ecuador and floating with them down the river to the Pacific to gather in Peru. They are launching on the 101 days of marine adventures testing the power of their primitive rafts that survived only the means available to those of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
