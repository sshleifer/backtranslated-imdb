Most people who watched this movie think it's the best movie ever made. I do not agree, but this film is very good. Tony is a bad guy and knows he's terrifying and uses it to make progress. It's about him and how he goes from washing the dishes to a big house and a cocaine office all over the table. If you want a family movie then that's not the way to go, but if you want mobsters and revenge and things like that, then you will like it.
