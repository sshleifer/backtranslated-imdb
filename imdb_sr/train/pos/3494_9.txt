For what it is, "Raising Victor Vargas" is about as perfect as a movie can get. Or a clean genius from a young author or just one of those happy mixes in which everything is clicked (probably on some of them), this simple little ethnical first film about love that comes out of love, enriches your young characters so deep that you can read their minds . The film begins with a strong taste of "street", but breaks into the Latin family affair, and then focuses on a story that tells about the uncertainty of youth and the deep natural desire to love the other. According to my experience, there has never been so much work done with such a small number of votes (actors of tiros, director of beginners, etc.). Praised by critics, but not for everyone, "Raising Victor Vargas" is recommended for indie lovers and realists in simple stories rich in humanity. (A)
