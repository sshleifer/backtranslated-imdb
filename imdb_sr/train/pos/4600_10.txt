This is sad that this movie is the top that should be at least the top 250 movies here. This is still the best action movie ever made. Action movies of today are badly done. Actors and action directors do not know how to fight and properly stop. just some do not have how to do it mainly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. Stunts are so smart and wild that I do not think we'll ever see things like this. The beginning in which Chan and his team go down the hill, through the hilly city, is startling. The ultimate fighting is for me the best fighters ever made. The final trick that went down the pillar that fell through Jackie's glass was severely injured.
