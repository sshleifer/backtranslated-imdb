I see that the DVD version lacks scenes or lines between the release of FRF and launch. They will prove that they can win the right to sit in the FRF other than the green team. The second scene is like during their failure on simulation, Kevin gets Joakuin I think VHS release except ABC can have all the missing things. Otherwise I like to know which DVD edition has missing things. The DVD I watched seems to be arranged for television.
