Winchester '73 was a movie that translated Manna from b-movies into a big league, rescuing James Stevart's post-war career in that process, throwing him as a defending hero (although he succeeded Fritz Lang over the project, maybe Lang deserves the credit for that) . Both men went to much darker places - Mann with the incredibly dark Devil's Doorvai, who stayed on the shelf by MGM until Broken Arrow's success convinced him to let him go? but a movie about a man who hunts his own brother while the rifle of a title is transferred from person to person on the track before he finishes in one of the regular shootings on the mountain, is still stronger flesh than you would expect from a study system. Excellent dialogue, impressive support? Dan Durie, Vill Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNalli, Shelley Vinters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jai C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them ?? and Mann's extraordinary visual sense rises at least with this.
