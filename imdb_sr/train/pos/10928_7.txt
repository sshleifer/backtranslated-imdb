The dying Kung Fu master sends his latest student to find out what happened to the previous five students who were members of a banned poison clan. The teacher also wants the student to find another member of the clan who escaped with the clans the master wants to use for the good. Early students were all studying in a different style of snakes, hens, scorpions, lizards, frogs, while the last disciple was taught in every style. All students complete in one city looking for an old man with all the money, and soon everyone is struggling to get the money. The classic martial arts movie has a title that even many non-fans know. I've talked to a couple of occasional fans and it seems like it's a movie that's in the head. It's a very good movie, although I'm not sure why this film stays with people when there are other movies that are better than Shav studios for my money (One Armed Swordman or Brave Archer series for example). This is not about selling a short film, it's not, since the film is structured as a mystery, our hero has no idea who someone is, and Venomi is best known only by who are two of the others. We got the identity of four, but we still have to figure out who is fifth. The film is also strange that it is a martial arts movie, except for a series of training at the beginning and killing an old man and his family for money, there really is no action about 40 or 45 minutes. It's a brave move to do it, but it's worth it because the plot and the shows are keeping your attention. (The film is also unusual in that it is the first martial arts film I've ever seen where there are no women. I do not think a person has a voice role and I'm pretty sure no one appears in the background. That's an indication of nothing, just something that made me This is a good, solid little movie that may not fill the reputation that it has in some circles, but it's still a good movie that clings to your couch. Br /> Approx. 7 of 10.
