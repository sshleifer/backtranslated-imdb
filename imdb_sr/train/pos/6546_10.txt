I'm probably one of the biggest fans of Nancy Drew. I read every book three times and I played a lot of Nancy games. I loved this movie. It entertained you all the time while you watched it. I went with about 10 of my friends and they all loved him. In front of us were three women who looked like they were in the late 30s and early 40s and I asked them what they liked, they said they liked it! So you see that it will be fun for all ages. You have to give him a chance. And he also teaches a lesson, just be yourself, even if everyone around you is exactly the same. All in all, this move was excellent. I'll see him the other way now! Stop hitting him, please. It's a really good movie!
