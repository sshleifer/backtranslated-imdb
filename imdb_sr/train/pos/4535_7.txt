The first 50 minutes of this film was pretty boring. He focused on the personal problems Doile had, including his sick wife, threats from death by fans, an aggressive publisher, and a sense of guilt over his mentally ill father. Although these items had a significant impact on Doile's life, I was more interested in the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes was great. We finally looked at Doile's head, as Holmes created and why he had to "kill" Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerney, Arthur Conan Doile, the convincing role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cock as a "role model" for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Locations are good, especially for a TV movie, and camera work is good. If the first 50 minutes were so good in the last 40 minutes, that would be a little masterpiece.
