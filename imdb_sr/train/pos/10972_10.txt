I've only recently seen it, but I've been aware of it for several years now and have always been intrigued by its title. Now it belongs to me as one of my favorite movies. It's hard to describe the incredible theme discovered by Maisles, but everything works beautifully in it. There are so many unforgettable pictures and moments in which you feel you are immersed in a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and with the characters in it. As if the filmmakers cast a spell on the audience and pulled us into a strange world of eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wanting to be far from all that, cooking corn on a piston over a night table. It has the air of a grief that spills all the time. A fall in size for this once-respected family. The money went, but their air and mercy remained, and their beauty was left. He drew me from the first frame and long after the film was finished, I found myself wondering about their fate. I wonder if, if I walked along the eastern beach of Hampton, I could hear the voice of Old Edie at night and see Little Edie's silhouette dance in the window behind a thick reptile. Unforgettable.
