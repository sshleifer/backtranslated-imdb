I do not know why critics destroyed this film. I do not agree with them at all. Film could be a bit scary - usually I'm not going to Horror movies! I even had to cure myself to see him during the day. I do not need to be disturbed! ;) (The cinema was full of children, heh !;) ... Liam was as good as ever. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Tailor (Eleanor-Nell). The house was very gothic and beautiful in an awesome way. Special and sound effects were excellent. I liked music, especially gentle melodies for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, as she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally got her power, peace and freedom.
