After watching this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I was barely waiting to hear how to get a copy. Jim McKai held a speech (K & A) on a film that later presented his ironical situation: how to get a distribution for a movie that shows minorities (women, non-white) working on the solution of controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teenage mother, racial identity, households with only one mother), and how to write a faithful scenario on all these topics, a white man in the middle of the thirties. The multi-racial, multi-gender audience of the majority-adults has rebuked the fantastic story of the film, the detailed characters and the fantastic display of "real teenage life". Most teenagers, however, left the building - which led me to think that this is a movie that adults see with children as the starting point for discussion, rather than, as it seems to many adults, "movie teenagers should see because about them. "Hence, distribution issues - how to get to it? Internet (retail) would be a great way - this is a film that will be buried, such as" Puppies "or other radical modern teen films - and McKai looked responsible. Concerning his points as writer / director, McKay was delectable and detailed in his work - merging with the Crovn Heights neighborhood in which the film was set, working with actors to portray characters in their vision of what they think to be - with the results that are disarmingly realistic.
