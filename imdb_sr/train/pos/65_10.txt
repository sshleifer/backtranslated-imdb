This film is not just about shooting at school, in fact, it never saw it. But this only increases the strength of this film. It's about people and how they deal with tragedy. I know that this was shown to students who survived the shooting in Columbine, and for many of them, they gave a sense of imprisonment. The acting is wonderful. All three major actors (Busi Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are great in their roles ... I recommend this film to everyone. It's one of those movies that talk about it after you see it. This triggers a discussion not only of school shooters, but also of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It's a tear, but it's worth it and I'll watch it again and again
