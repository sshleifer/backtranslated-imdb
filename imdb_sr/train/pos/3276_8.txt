49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) Sick in bed with fever 11-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has only her drawings to keep her company. Her health is progressively worsening when she catches a series of mysterious 'black outs'. In each of these episodes, he dreams of a house in a desolate field, where only a sick boy named Marc (Elliot Spires) settled him. When the dark, unknown danger threatens her idyllic "paper house", Mark's life is endangered. Her life is also at risk because these dreams reflect her state of health. Criticism: The first debut feature of the British director Bernard Rose. Taken from the fairy tale ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr, leaves many other "original" fantasies in her mark. Whenever the story deals with dreams and nightmares, it is difficult to give it a mixture of fairytale and reality to make it work in film form. Director Rose is successfully grasping the world aspect of childhood fantasy, along with the darkness that tries to usurp them. Feverishly recorded by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how wisely he uses music with a professional pace to 'pop out of his place' moments. Most of the thrillers are very untidy in this very important aspect of intimidating the audience that they do not know what the next scene will bring. I also like the way in which uncertainty is caught and never let it go or drop in the next sequence of events. Also, his mastering by placing objects within a frame (as in his P.O.V.shots) gives cinema an additional dimension which he otherwise seems to lack. Only in Europe you will find such malicious looks as presented here: a lonely house, fields, coastal towns, an observation post, etc. Rose would follow this film with "Candiman" (1992), a real 'thinking man' of a horror gem and bona fide cult favorite horror.
