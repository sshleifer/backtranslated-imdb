Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It looks like a story of loss, when it's actually a story of itself. Some people may never feel loneliness at this level. Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessing, Fineman tried to forget his life in the same perspective. Jada is a great addition to acting and Sandler pulls tears. Cheadle had a comedic role and was an excellent fan for Sandler. I see somewhere Oscar. Very nice movie. If you've ever lost and felt alone, this movie will convince you that you are not alone.
