In the introductory scenes of this film, a man shot from his hotel room to the other man's bathroom and fired all the lights. It must have been a very hep for 1936, but before the exit had nothing to do with the film, Robin Hood did not appear as I could see. However, Bette Davis (Daisei Applebi), "The Vhales of August", '87 was very young and attractive and played one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisei never stopped teasing or was very sexy with her nightgowns and the so-called swimsuit on her yacht with Johnny Jones, the Spiral Staircase, '46. Daisei even suggested marriage with Johnny at Ferris's point upside down and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent have made a great pair, one should be very rich, and another very bad reporter. Outside the stage, Davis and Brent had a real hot love affair, which is a good reason why sparks appeared when these two appeared in this movie. If you like Bette Davis and George Brent, this is a movie for you!
