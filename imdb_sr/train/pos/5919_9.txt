Street fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie you're just looking at for fun. It's not a comfortable experience, although it has some moments to laugh. This is a movie you watch when you need food for thought. Discard this movie as simply racist is to completely miss the point. This is not just a satire Song of the South, but also a commentary on prejudices that Americans still have as a society. Every ethnic group shown in the film is shown as a grotesque caricature of their stereotypes, which are in fact grotesque caricatures of the right people. Through this wild exaggeration, the director shows how absurd this firmly held belief. If you are a person who is willing to admit the ugliness of the prevailing prejudices that American culture still holds and if you are not afraid to look at your prejudices in the eyes, this film can be for you.
