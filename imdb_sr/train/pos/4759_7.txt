A wonderful little episode played mainly for laughter, but with a clever punch of uncertainty. Martians somehow boarded a broken bus on the way to nowhere, but who is the traveler, (talk about their illegal immigrants!). All actors supporting the stars, from the wild eye of Jack Elam (it's shameless), to the sexy Jean Villes (if she is the Martian, then I say we open the borders!), The Cruel John Joit, together with the famous faces John Archer and Barney Phillips and a nice turn from Bill Candice as a bus driver). It makes for a very fun half an hour, even if the action is limited to one set.
