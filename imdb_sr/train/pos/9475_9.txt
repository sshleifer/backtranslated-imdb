The most satisfying element of the "Real Life Day" is that the relationship between Dana (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is pretty realistic. The casting of Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a great decision; It is extremely talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank God, suitable for the role! If this film was shot by Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, that would be a disaster. Another great aspect of the "Real Life Day" is that it is the perfect adult movie that is interested in a mature comedy that leaves three pillars of the formula "frat pack": stupid chickens, chauvinistic guys and humorous jokes. "Real Life Day" is funny and fun, intelligent through everything. While other comedies contain or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience with laughter, jokes from "Real Life Days" are more natural and smarter, and include a certain audience opinion. My only problem with "Real Life Day" is that rebellious, middle-aged daughter is an overly actress actress Brittany Robertson. It's hard to say whether it was her personal choice or the choice of director. In any case, her character is unrealistic and boring. But it is only a minor shortcoming in the film, and does not take the story as a whole. All in all, "Real Life Day" is an excellent movie, a fantastic escape. from the redundancy of offensive and distasteful comedies. The quality of writing, directing, acting and (especially) cinema is excellent. It's just a beautiful, easy comedy.
