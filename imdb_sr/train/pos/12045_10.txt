For the first time I watched this movie when I was a kid and only in my life could I remember putting my hand over my face and eyes in utter horror on a particular scene. I remember it again with conversations with my friends and I immediately bought it on a video with a lot of hesitation. I could add (to my surprise, I only found it on the web in America when it was made in England!) Again my reaction to my surprise was almost the same, from pure horror and fear, and my heart never beat so much. This is, in my opinion, the worst movie ever made, Hollywood films look pitiful in comparison and a little Pony and Trap (crap), forgive the boring game. What's amazing, although the power of this movie and at the university when you watch it with some twenty of my associates, I've never heard so many screams, even boys! Even a look at the video brings to me fear of God in that particular scene, and I have left the feeling that I will never walk alone in the dark again!
