It's hard for me to assign a "fair" star to this movie, but I decided to 8 because of its high production values ​​and what was, in 1968, an innovative approach to the war film. Remember, and I have not seen him since 1969. But it made a strong impression. Long-lasting dying has to be one of the most picturesque antiwar films ever recorded. This is achieved by simply displaying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwest Europe from 1944-45. None of the films before this showed a war at the level of an infantry detachment with such brutal details, all in a coldly impartial way that allows actions to speak for themselves. No preaching, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios. Unfortunately, there is no subtlety either. Partly because of their situation - attempts to stay alive - characters face straight, familiar clichés. As a "party", the film does not do it, although it obviously did not intend to "entertain" it. The intention was to overthrow you over the head with the misery and horror of World War II and modern war in general. It was twenty years before he was in the water and thirty years before he saved Soldier Ryan, and both were far "more visible" films. Here, straight and generally disadvantageous characters, the lack of real complication and a real disadvantageous image (including what may be the first on the screen vomiting in theater history) make the movie difficult to sit, although it is only 95 minutes. So, the 10 stars for production and realism, the 4 stars for the feeling you will have when you finish it, the star bonus for being his heart's in the right place. Average: 8. As the "Winners" of Karl Foreman, as equally weak, but more interesting and provocative, as the Long Day Dying, seems to be not on DVD. Why not? Both films are several times on the cable.
