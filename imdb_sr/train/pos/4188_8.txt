Samuel Fuller is an interesting director, mostly because he had a very inconsistent policy in films. While the "shock corridor" and "naked kiss" represented the hypocrisy and madness of America, and the "big red" was an effective portrait of the horror of war, "Merrill's robbers" were afraid of the war as the necessary hell and "whore in South Street" about the dangers of communist spies "All his films were made for a very entertaining viewing, and although he was often chosen as a b-director, Fuller was as good as any of the main studio performers." Pickup on South Street "is no exception, and despite dated topics, the film style is remarkably ahead of its time, which is also very fast, solid, and occasionally brutal film noir. The actress is fantastic Richard Vidmark is a great anti-hero, and Jean Peters is pretty sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend.The thief of the show, however, Thlema Ritter, in an absolutely beautiful performance as a police chair, the angles Fuller employs is excellent, making the acting sequences even more exciting and brutal (this is very violent for his time) .The camera is constantly moving around as Tarantino and his school work for forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great action noir thriller. "Shock Corridor" remains my favorite Fuller movie, but this is very close. (8/10)
