Special telescope, Dr Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff), successfully proves that many years ago, a meteorite landed in Africa with an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr Benet (White Lugosi) forms an expedition led by Rukh to find an element. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X", which is even more powerful than the radio and very radioactive, and Karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by touching them. Sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science fiction film during the Second World War. Director Hillier used several standing sets of the FLASH GORDON series that was filmed at the same time and inserted some snapshots of Frankenstein electric machines. Universal held public unconscious special effects used in this great classic film. Karloff and Lugosi were in the best light and both enjoyed working together and enjoying future generations.
