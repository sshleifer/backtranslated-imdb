When I was a kid of eight, I always watched movies and television that I did not need, and this was one of them. It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and it must be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, acting is great, not real comedy like these these days (movies that are actually funny and make you laugh without excretion or some kind of bodily fluid that induces vomiting as in Judd Apat's retarded films, playing unhappy non-actors such as Set Rogen, Barf). This movie is a classic with actors who can really act and deserve all praise.
