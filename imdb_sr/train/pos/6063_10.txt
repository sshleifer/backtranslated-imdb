Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about the young prince (Simon) who was expelled from his kingdom because his father (king) was killed by the clich√© "evil adviser". This film is about Simon's adventures. Special effects, complication, acting and the whole thing about this movie is BAD. However, it is so bad that it's ridiculous. You will continue to watch this movie simply because it's so bad it's ridiculous, and, as another reviewer said, it's so bad that it's good.
