The second part (actually episode 4-8) of the Danish TV series is slightly worse than the first one, but there are also many laughs and fears. This time Udo Kier plays two parts, like a monstrous baby and his father like a demon. Other prominent parts of this road are Dr. Krogshoy SÃ¸ren Pilmark, who must face the terrible vengeance of dr. Helmer, and once again, the patient Mrs Drusse tries to solve the secrets, Miss Marple's style. It ends on the cliff even after the death of the actors Ernst Huger Jagger (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Ms. Drusse), you wonder that he will ever be able to make Part III, but I hope that Von Trier will give it a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, Dovn's Syndrome # 2 dishwasher, died shortly thereafter. Look for Stellan Skarsgard in the karma. ***
