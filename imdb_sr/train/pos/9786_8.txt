I really enjoyed the performances of the main actor. Emma Lung is brave and interesting. The director has developed plays in which characters are not one-dimensional. A complex story with a change between the era. They also appreciated the story of unions losing power and the large employer closing down a small city. I do not agree with the comment that an older man must be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - without a male look. The depth of character may be attractive not so shallow. The film has a good look and the cinema is also good.
