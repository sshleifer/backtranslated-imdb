What an exciting ride! Prompted and provocative. Once again, Sharon Stone seamlessly pulled out her beautiful, enchanting character Catherine Tramell. The original Instinct takes place in San Francisco. The sequel takes place in London, where Catherine has now moved. Both a busy city famous for excitement, high fashion and a perfect place for someone like Catherine Trammel. David Morrisei ("Derailed") plays the smooth role of psychiatrist dr. Michael Glass. The character David Thevlis plays Roi Vashburn with Scotland Iard, a refreshing departure from his role as Lupine in the Harri Potter series. Incredible cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, tension, - all "basic instincts". Bending the mind. Great screenplai. From the superb scene to the end of the surprise, this movie is just not boring! Everyone in the theater was glued to the screen.
