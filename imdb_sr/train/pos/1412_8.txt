Why, for God's sake, you need to explore the hypnotizing documentary of Nature? How much time do you have on earth to explain this to you? All right, I will not extend my research on Earth to infinity, but I must submit my claim on why this is "must see". The documentary deals with natural trips on the migration paths of three animal families: a female polar bear and her cubs with real-life bird-bearer fighting for food hunting in her isolated trail, a mother of whales with her baby kit takes a whale of a migration journey to booty , and an elephant mother with her little (perhaps not so small, elephants) offspring migrating to Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill and Mark Linfield have done a job "out of this country" in conquering the survival skills of many other animal species except the magnetic shots of our three animal animal protagonists. The cinematically-trained team of Richard Brookes Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer were animals who recorded amazing natural sites and animal instinctive behavior; Not to mention, the slogans of animal prey were in the b a i b a. "Earth" is also a student who learns about the effect of global warming on animals; Pope Polar Bear in the Doctor is a poster animal boy on that effect. So fellow countrymen, it's time to go on a documentary trip to visit Earth today! **** Okay
