POSSIBLE SPOILER - In a way, "How to alienate friends ..." is "the loser learns to adjust, becomes successful, and finds out that something else is more important" type of story, placed in a glorious business. - END OF SPOILER I do not know the original book, but this comedy brings a few good moments. Although I think the end of the fault is. It was too fast and abrupt, as if something was missing. In addition, I would say that the film is not able to maintain a high level. In addition, you will find a sweet selection of actors and actors with sometimes controversial acting qualities. I've never seen Pegg before. However, it is a very unique type, although it can sometimes look a little harder on the screen than it needs. Fok has proven to be capable of playing a hot starlet with a head in the clouds. I do not know if it was difficult to do, but her performance was cheaper and better than during the "Transformers" (well ... probably it's not a difficult match). Kirsten Dunst is very Kirsten Dunst (again) and you may like it (like me) or I think she's boring. On the other hand, you will see Anderson who has proven his acting skills and Jeff Bridges (which is fine, but maybe he might have acted a little bit more powerfully). Everything fits well into their character. Conclusion: I think it's a nice comedy celebrity with some more and some less funny passages, sweet band, but also a sudden ending.
