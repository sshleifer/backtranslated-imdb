The US State Department would not like to see this film because they have beef with the Iranian government. However, he shows us how civilized Iran is, despite the content of the film, which focuses on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the simplest way: the ability to watch a football match at the stadium, which is strictly limited to a male audience. The film is ridiculously funny, and in itself is a proof of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this film intensely. Five girls try to enter the police border at the entrance to the football match between Iran and Bahrain. The comedy that followed was too funny to describe, from traveling by bus to stadium, to mediation of police and subsequent detention of girls, to the last end. Do not miss this classic movie. His MUST SEE. One of the best foreign films I've seen for years.
