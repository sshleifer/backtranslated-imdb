When will people find that some movies are made for fun and do not necessarily change the world? If you understand this, then you expect to have a bunch of fun while watching "the false trip of Bill and Ted". This is a movie that has a bunch of fun to watch, Keanu and Alek make a great screenplay team that reviews their characters from "Bill's and Ted's great adventure" with even more "style" and then in the first movie. It's not rocket science, but it's great for laughter, and the characters are extremely similar and the story is so radical that you have to laugh. Do not expect "deep-and-mean" just to expect a clean party!
