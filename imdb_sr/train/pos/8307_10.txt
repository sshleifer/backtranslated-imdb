The stress of vocal performance was Outstanding !! Tress played the role of singer, while Richard was in the club. When she first came out on the stage, and started to riff and whispered her stuff, it made my soul shake. Her voice is platinum. He needs to make a CD. He has more fans then he understands. I loved her performance that stopped the performance in five heartbeats, which she also played with Leone when she was younger. How can a girl have such a big voice? She is truly incredible. Good voice Good Good Good Good voice voice voice excellent voice fantastic voice, back shakes, tears of crying, uplifting, you return in the day voice. If you read this engagement, please listen to my advice and start recording the CD. If not only for love for singing, but for your fans. I believe you can really succeed. See these other sing singers singing, lol.
