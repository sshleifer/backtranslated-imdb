A great series, masterly performed and directed, but not loved (I was told) by Mr. Deighton and withdrawn after a presentation. It can now be viewed only in private collections and through the British Film Institute at a special request. It's very unfortunate, because Ian Holm's tinted, tough, but determined Bernard Samson's tone is wonderful; one of his best performances. Supported actors, including young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, are great. With Mel Martine, who played a clandestine and treacherous woman, and Michael Degen as a lively Verner, speaks positively of the tragic and fateful consequences of a big game.
