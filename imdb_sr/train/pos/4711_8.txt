Oh, what's fun here! Amy Heckerling has a talent for directing comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Vho's Talking), but here she seems to have told the actors to come out and have fun. Micheal Keaton breaks through the role of Johnny, he is easily his best performance on the screen. Joe Piscopo is brilliant as appropriately called Danny Vermin, which the shame directors did not understand this. I even mentioned Richard Dimitry playing Moronie and the unique vocabulary of the character. I do not think that it is by chance that most of the names of characters are written by MORON. Good lines were lit during the film, while Peter Boile, Griffith Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merrill Henner got good lines. Even actors with smaller roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get good lines. Recommend it to a friend.
