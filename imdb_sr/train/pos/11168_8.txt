Drawn from the real life ventures of Chuck Connors and Steve Brody from the 1890s in New York, "The Boveri" is high energy and good nature. and little Jackie Cooper. The first shot could be stunning. This is true for the time it was set up and when it was made. And it also speaks about the diversity of the population in that neck of the forest. This certainly contributes to the fierce taste of the atmosphere. Beer as Connors is a tremendous thunder in the center of action, a loud mouthguard with its fire brigade. And he has a soft position for the orphan Orphan Cooper. An abortion like Brodie is Connor's hood, looks better than any other attempt. Brodie could never deny the challenge and he liked the attention, which led to a leap from the Brooklyn Bridge (he is still discussing whether he actually jumped or used the doll). put on Irish-American accent. He's just a rude character that draws children, cats and ladies in trouble. This is probably the most powerful character of the Raft that he has ever played, and he even gets a little dance (as well as a foot show). And again he is mistreating the leading lady (beautiful Fai Vrai) for a prostitute. Cooper is tough as one of them, although he has a chance to include tears.

It is certain that someone more had a bruise than the ego.
