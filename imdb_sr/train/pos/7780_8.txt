Robert Stack never exaggerated to lose Oscars for best actor for the role in "Vicious on the Vind" in the 12-minute performance of Anthony Quinn in the film "Lust for Life." Stack plays a deeply troubled, alcoholic son of oil tycoon. He lived his life in the shadow of a friend with whom he grew up, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. Both love the same woman, Luke, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kile's wife. Kiel's sister, Marilee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut who is in love with Mitch. Their story is played in a magnificent color under the capable direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films, including the "Imitation of Life," "All That Allows Heaven," "The Magnificent Obsession," and many others. Br /> Do not Miss - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the best use of their roles, Malone has won Oscars for Best Supporting Actress. There is an incredible scene, mentioned in other comments, where she dances wildly with loud music while her father crashes and dies on a staircase. We believe Marilyn is sleeping with everyone, including a gas-pumping guy, because she's in love with Mitch. Mitch does not want anything with her. He is so much in love with Luke that he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation due to loyalty to Chile. I doubt he would be so impatient to arrive today no matter how much he was in love. Hudson and Bacall have less exciting roles - Hudson's Mitch is a good guy who was cleaning Kyle's for fucking all his life, and Beckham is Mitch's wife who finds himself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year sobriety. Sirk focuses on unstable players who support him. In Sirk's hands, "Shot on the Wind" is an effective movie, and the great scene at the end of the house is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of film, and although he had many imitators, he never had an equal.
