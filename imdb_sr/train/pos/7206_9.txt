Excellent plot inside the plot within the plot. It's a shame that my two heroes have a good sleep. It must have been my upbringing :) Very well everyone behaved. You never know who will do it. The last small turn in the end allows everyone to get their real deserts. Recommend everyone. A harmless, linguistic thriller who, if he has any mistakes, probably uses the word "bloody" excessively, but that's his signature, is not it?
