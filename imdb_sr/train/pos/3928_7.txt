It must have been well recorded and made, very well recorded and made! But the story was so bad. And the display of Lincoln was even weaker. It was not that Henry Fonda was good, but the character he played was nothing but crazy. You want to tell me that Lincoln was a clever smart ass without law or court. I mean, who should he be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean, come on, "then I'll call you Jackass" ???? I understand that Ford went on a big funny hero, but I did not like that guy at all. He cheats on the sport, speaks like a real sweet fool and does not seem to know he should sit in the courtroom. How do I get this seriously? The strain was even weaker. I mean, come on! It was just stupid. The whole story seemed to be invented by five-year-olds in her dreams. Saying that I like it enough, it was very fun and laughed a few times, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact, I must say that I must say that it is good enough, nothing that entertains me and it seems to me that it can be bad. > <br /> I have no idea how much this movie was historically accurate, but if anything is true, I really would have to handle it.
