'Europa' (or, as it is known, 'Zentrop') is one of the most visible films I've ever seen. A blend of shaded photos and color photos is almost flawless ... a real eye treat. The painting was a candidate for the Golden Palm in 1991 in Canners. The prize was awarded to Barton Finck (Coen brothers); film stylist very similar to Zentropi. This is a classroom exercise: rent both films and be the judge yourself.
