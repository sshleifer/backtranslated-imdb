Henry Hathaway was brave, but enthusiastic about his love for people in the early days of American history. However, in order to criticize the historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the people of Mormon, it is not necessary or useful to comment on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway has made a supreme direction that conveys what Mormon people have in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the period of time, starting with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith until the date of publication of the film. In often subtle recording and dialogue, he covered Mormon's philosophies and teachings in many segments and scenes. I remember I watched this movie in many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950s. It was only a little over 10 years after the film was released before the temple was completed in Los Angeles, which I watched as it was built and embroidered by the weird wonder of the Mormons. I recently bought this movie and I will enjoy the following messages that Hathavai interpreted in his film. 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. Love for those who need it or not, 3. Family is very important, 4. Listen with respect and carefully, because even and conflicting messages have important points to consider and adopt, 5. Work hard, individually and in community, 6. Prepare and guard for future needs, 7. Hope is a binding relationship with a higher being, and for our everyday life, 8. I , that there is a unique quality to appreciate those that are identified as useful.
