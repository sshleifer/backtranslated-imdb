This is no doubt my favorite Le Carre novel and it turns into a silver screen with all the love and care that one can wish for. I read a review on this site that looks like the characters are disgusting, but I believe that's wrong. All Le Carre stories are essentially a love story and this is no exception. This is the exact reflection of the period in which it is set. Release is the key to good for anyone. Pimovo education is so close to mine that I consider it cold. Peter Egan is at his best, and the late Lak McAnalli is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles such as Andi de la Tour, Tim Heali and Jack Ellis are on the spot. This actor is Dream Theater Impresario. The story does not need to spoil a badly informed description, but it is enough to say that it refers to a young man slow, but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and betrayal. All my sympathy lies with Magnus Pim and his unique (non-sexual) love for Pope (Rudiger Veigang - as beautiful as ever.) His only true friendship, and by definition, the second in a long line of betrayal.
