I watched as many series as I could watch on television, but unfortunately, I started the work that gave me working nights. I managed to capture some recordings, at least ... and, of course, bought the recently released DVD complete series. Watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was initially a little bit rough, but after the end of the pilot it was empty enough. Votes are well-adapted to characters, and writing is great. It is refreshing to see how animation returns to its roots by reinstating topics for adults. The point is, how society came into existence in the last century, you have to be a little more obvious by today's standards to be recognizable as an adult-oriented show. The characters have very realistic personality and are in situations that are parallel to what we often face in real life. It's your typical sitcom in that respect, but humor is more like what you would expect from late night to television, such as skit for talk shov or Saturdai Night Live ... when SNL was actually fun. Good work, Dreamvorks. You may need to work with one of the more liberal networks to maintain this series ... and also improve the marketing of goods for the series to help cover high costs. It's a challenge for a cartoon of a mature nature. Hmm ...
