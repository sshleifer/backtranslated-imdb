Whoever has ever come up with a story is one sick person. I rented it for our sleeping sleep, and we all shocked ourselves because we are all together in the acting class, and we know several actors from the class. Except that everyone screamed all the weird night, I had strange nightmares. I was constantly thinking about God, if I get up to go to the bathroom to pee, I will be stabbed in the middle of a wipe or something. I could not even go to the bathroom because we watched this horrible horror movie. I also thought why all the girls are toples in this movie, but we do not have any of the boys units? You should make a horror movie where the killer girl and cut off the units. I'd watch it over and over again. Call it hard or soft or so stupid. I'm just giving this movie 9 because you've let me down.
