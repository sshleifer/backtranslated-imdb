This is not Masterpiece Theater. You should not go into it, expecting it. This is a pure FUN girl with the most fantastic actors' heads. As someone said here, this is a movie that baby Mama should have been. And the only drawback I see in this movie is that Tina Fei was not in that - apart from playing the brightest and brightest girls on the planet. The film is pure nonsense on the surface, but if you really look, you will know that there is a lot of messages and a deep meaning for each of us who wants to come back and re-work in life knowing then what we now know. I CLEAN ENTERTAINMENT and I recommend it to everyone who is looking for 84 minutes of excellent escape.
