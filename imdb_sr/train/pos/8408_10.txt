"It was not me, it was, my brother, twin Rupert!" Bobbi tells Dugan when he faces being in Sallin's place. I've used this line dozens of times over the years (no one has yet believed it). This film is one of the best for all time and for incredible fun. Steven Oliver was perfect for the part of Dugan, so much so that he was in "Malibu Beach" in 1978 as the same character (though not so much time on the screen). "No one calls Dugan a turd!" is the second line for centuries. This classic film was certainly worth the price for admission.
