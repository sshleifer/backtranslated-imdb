beautiful, this is no doubt the best cartoon anime ever made. I first saw it as a castle in the sky in the late eighties as a child and left a lasting impression. It's been a couple of years and I forgot the title of the movie, and only by accidentally reviewing the Internet I found this masterpiece again. After reading the reviews and analyzes of other people, I am not surprised to have so much confession and so much touched them because it leaves an impression. a real fantasy adventure, it must be seen for all children and adults. best that does not tell the story and I would say that this film will be clear and open. If you have kids to treat them, I promise you they will like them. there is much to be said about this artwork, but if you have not seen it, watch it and enjoy it.
