The first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and not very funny and they had a dramatic element where Bill (mother) fought with all the usual problems in life, but that element was a bit depressing and did not mix well with comedy elements that is probably the reason he was released. After that she soon became one of the most entertaining comedies the BBC has ever made! The chemistry between the character of Bila and Ben was very funny and there were always a lot of great and memorable sketches in each series. Christmas specialties were a hilarious and real treat for Christmas. The show stopped when the starring actor Gary Olsen, who played Bill, passed away, which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in movies such as Up 'n' Under and a very funny RIP man. This undervalued shov has unfortunately disappeared from our TV screens and does not repeat so often - although it appears on UKTV Goldu sometimes, but it should be repeated on BBC one or two this great comedy to the new audience
