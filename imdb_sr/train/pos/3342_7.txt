If you enjoy romantic comedies, you will find this story about two 30-year-old singles who fall in love with American fox races. On the other hand, if you wait for you to wait for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you should probably stay away. The action contains a compulsory type that meets friends of a girl, a girl meets friends, and a boy happy girl scene. There is even a guy who encounters a female dog scene. That's all for a course in this kind of film. However, what I liked was that the action was overwhelmed by the decision-making process people make while they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and that it's actually a little strange. The action is about answering questions; how much courage is too great, and how much love is needed to overcome these abuses? It's interesting to see how the characters do it because they are deep inside (if we admit it) we all have strange things. Barrimore is doing a very good job in his role, and Fallon surprised me - and he is good. I estimate that this is 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved in one. Add another point if you're a Red Sok fan and take two points if you're a fan of the Iankees.
