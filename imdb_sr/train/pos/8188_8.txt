I fundamentally enjoyed the first part of these two partners, The Impossible Planet, and I was a little worried that the other part would not last as well as it was true in the past two of the last two games. But, fortunately, my fears were unfounded because I enjoyed this episode as much as the previous one. In any case, we left with surviving flight crew members from Ood, who became the devil's pawn. There is also a bit of philosophy about the role of a doctor in the episode that I enjoyed quite a bit. Needless to say it was a good doctor's story. It may be a bit too intense for younger viewers. My Rating: B +
