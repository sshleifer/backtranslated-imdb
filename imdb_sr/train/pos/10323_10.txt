This is a VERY funny movie. Several reviews I read on this forum have been written by people who, in all likelihood, think that the film was an attempt to seriously drama. It's NOT ANY ... It's a very pleasing movie, done in a language in the face. All actors are obviously entertaining while entertaining us. The sequences of the fighting are lively, lively and, above all, not unreasonable. The so-called "Green Death", which is used on several occasions, is not, as I read in one review, "creepy". Several critics have been very critical of martial arts martial arts between Doc and Seas near the end of the film. Hey, make fun ... Again, I remind one and all that this is a fun movie. Each stage of this "struggle" was described, which contributed to the fun aspect. The actors did not try to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of those martial arts films. Ron Eli looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice for playing Doc. Another nice touch is the unique way to solve the ultimate fate of a "bad guy" (Seas). I promise you that if you do not try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for fun, you will spend 100 minutes in the most fun way.
