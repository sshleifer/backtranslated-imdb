The path to ruin, a film that was unexpectedly foreseen in the Oscars is another work by Sam Mendes (and in his opinion, his best work), a director who won the Oscars three years earlier for his widely recognized, but controversial American beauty. This is a great movie, and at the same time extremely sharp and sad. It's a story of a relatively rich and happy family from an outward appearance in the difficult times of depression when Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by big Tom Hanks (I am not his fan, but I should say that ) is a hit man for the local mafia boss, played by Paul Nevman. His oldest son, thirteen-year-old Michael Sullivan Jr., Who perfectly acted young Tiler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what his father and the money his family lives in. Encouraged by his curiosity and his aspiration to learn the truth, he accidentally becomes a witness to the murder committed by John Rooney, the son of his boss. Such a discovery affects the innocent soul and causes many events that have changed his life forever. The atmosphere of that period, all wallpapers and ornaments are perfectly created, editing and cinema are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the film, the most important moments and points of the film and the key success factor of the film are heavy paternal-sinistic relations in bad times. They are displayed so deeply, strongly and convincingly. Tom Hanks is great and has one of the best performances in his career in a rather unusual role for him and everyone who works through the forum is great. Finally, it is worth mentioning Paula Nevman's very nice rating, and the result is the extraordinary work of all the people involved in creating this wonderful (yet once sad) masterpiece. I believe that Road to Disappear belongs to the greatest achievements of the film creativity of this decade and is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. My Rating 10 out of 10
