Sue Kali is an original but notorious horror film dealing with the works of a cult group in India composed of German psychologists who have learned how to control their will and their bodies to the extent that they can cause "healing" of other people radical techniques (which can cause nighttime marine hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to free the messy demons in them. The film is shown as a series of vignettes about the Tailor-Eriksson group - the aforementioned cult group. The first segment is slightly slower than the rest, but it serves to set up a premise for the rest of the movie. The rest is played as a mindf @ ck movie with some key clippers thrown into a mix (full-frontal nudity, some up) to make you happy. I say this. It may not be spectacular, but the concept is pretty neat and comes in the right places. 8/10.
