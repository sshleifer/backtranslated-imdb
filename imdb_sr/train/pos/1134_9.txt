The only missing part in this movie is Shue as a daughter who wants to follow the steps of her "aunt" as a soap opera star. Otherwise it would have been perfect 10.

It was well thrown and there are some classic lines that will stay with you. It's a fantastic movie that everyone should see at least once. I recommend that you do not drink anything that would burn your nose. You will certainly want to carefully watch the last scene, 'sister Nan' has a small secret that she would not share. with you. If you like daytime soap or you despise them, this move is entertaining in all the right places.
