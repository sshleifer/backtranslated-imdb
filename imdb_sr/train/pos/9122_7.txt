Purple Rain is a great movie if you are a fan of music for over 40 years who participated in the music of the Princess of the 1980s. Story is a very used formula: Raising the musical talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles in order to find its own audience and self-esteem. The prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially Purple Rain / I Vill Die 4 U, makes him worthwhile sitting through the film. He is himself and like shovman, powerful on the stage like Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, former prince of the protégé, is beautiful and shows prince's acting talents and chemistry, but her script does not allow her away. Morris Day and other supporting actors provide comic elements.
