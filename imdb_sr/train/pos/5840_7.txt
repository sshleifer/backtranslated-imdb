Although the premise of the film is rather poor (Ollie has a diagnosis of "hornophobia"), the film is a nice and pleasant movie. It's also a bit better than the movies they made after this - probably because this was the last film produced by Hal Rauch and Laurel and Hardy. In fact, it would not be a bad idea to not see ANY of their latest films, because entire chemistry is lost in these films, and the boys play their parts exclusively for the road - something that True Laurel and Hardy films NEVER would do. They had a little edge missing from all subsequent films. Stan and Ollie work at the Horn Factory. It sounds pretty funny, but it's not. Not surprising with all that racket, Ollie will have a nervous breakdown and must take a little free time. The doctor (James Finlaison - in his latest film with the team) recommends a trip to the sea. However, they do not like sailing, and Stan has the idea of ​​just renting a boat bound for a dock - then they can get all the sea air they want without any problem! Once they were on board, he escaped the dangerous boats and they all accidentally set off to sea. Fortunately, this part of the film was really well-timed, and the very end was very good. Although not a great Laurel and Hardy film, he was much better than many of them because he did not have boring and disturbing music numbers (as in DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES IN TOILAND). In addition, there is still a decent amount of physical comedy - something that could be seen almost nothing after this film. Part of this was due to the fall in the health of the boys (and the increase in the volume of Ollie), and part was due to the overall inspiration of these later films.
