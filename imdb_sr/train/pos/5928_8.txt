This is not a good movie, but I still like it. Cat Clovis is gold in the jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves - essentially opposed to the evil Sleepwalkers. I think there is more in this film than people realize, it's essentially very rough, but this rudeness can sometimes be good. It has stripped lines, a sudden ending, and a comic element transmitted by miserable police officers. Has anyone discovered that the incest element is somewhat disturbing? In the end, this film is casual and randomly sharp, which is quite effective, I compare it with Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, the change of the protagonists. I think that quick work is working, this is not the movie you want to extend, but it works only if it's short. I'm still not sure if the director lacked depth, or not. These things with purpose, we know that Stephen King has the skills, but I did not even read his books, I only saw some of his films. In any case, I liked it. If you like sharp movies with 80 contours, just watch. but do not expect too much. It's really so bad that it's good.
