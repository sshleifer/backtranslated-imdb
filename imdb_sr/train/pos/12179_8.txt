I accidentally watched this movie a few days ago when I turned the channels. My expectations were not too high, but it was an interesting movie. In 'A Gui Thing', Jason Lee plays Paul, an equal Seattle-based boyfriend to marry his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) and to calm down the unbearable life of a middle-class household. We first met Paul at his party party, where he did not express his desire to embark on any of the activities that are common to his boyfriend (surprisingly little). and quarrel. Of course, the next thing Paul knows is that he is in the night after night, he's in bed with a bare-haired dancer, and his cordial phones to let him know that Karen is on his way here. Oh, and hula dancer is Karen's cousin Becki (Julia Stiles). From this little grain of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of meaningless accidents, as Pol scabby from accidents to accidents, trying to conceal an accident to an accident, trying to conceal an accident to an accident, trying to conceal an accident to an accident , trying to conceal the incident until he attempted to conceal what he did while maintaining the appearance of being obedient, a family-friendly good guy, who was very excited about his upcoming wedding. His efforts to ensure that Karen does not remain wiser about any potential misconduct on his part, ironically forces Paula to get closer and more fun Becky, forcing him to ask whether he really wants a life that seems to be sketchy for him. . The film contains the right combination of comedy and romance. Definitely worth watching.
