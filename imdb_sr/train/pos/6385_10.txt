This movie was great! It was a great performance of the ancient bribe. The animation was a bit strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie without singing. The background animation was magical. It was a different level of work for people from Dizni. Some of the characters were small, but it was more than compensated by the beauty and richness of the landscape. Music was mostly instrumental, but that was perfect for the movie. This was definitely not the movie that is needed for the characters to intertwine in the song. Perfect. 10 of 10
