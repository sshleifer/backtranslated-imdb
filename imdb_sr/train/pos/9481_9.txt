Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not just in the year when it was shot, but now. It is an artistic film that has not become obsolete even in the 21st century. The director kept a good narrative skill and so he made the story so smooth! The film reminds me of a later French film of the new wave: Francois Truffaut's "Femme d'cot", which is similar to the theme.
