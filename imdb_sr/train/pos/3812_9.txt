This is a real candy. The world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities. Huge monsters whose target of attack prefers throwing the cathedral to their opponents ... Who can resist it? Ancient prophecy, a bunch of heroes and a sweet princess in search of her hero ... sounds familiar ...? Yes, we've heard that song before. But you will forget it while watching a spectacular scene. This movie is fun to watch while it lasts. But after leaving the cinema, you cry for a little more story. What is behind the circle of 30 years? What crazed the knight? Who built all those incredible monuments, castles and cities ... and why they are falling apart? And apart from that crowd of farmers, where are the people? Really, this picture seems so intriguing, but not Lord of the Rings.
