It's time for the future and for many who are not aware of it, that day is now. In this final film for the legendary actor, Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a top class. Many movie lovers and environmentalists believe that this is our final history. The film is taken from a novel under the heading 'Make Sites, Make Places,' but the work title has been changed to 'Solent Green'. The story refers to the Earth as it evolves into the future, and environmental problems in the world do not become anything less than catastrophic. Natural resources of the planet are exhausted and basic foods are reduced to simple fasteners. They come in different colors, such as Solent Iellov, Solent Red, and now Solent Green. However, there are those who know the "real" ingredient in Solent Green and kneel at their own blame and fear the divine punishment. The first is Food Executive named Villiam R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). After his death, devoted police detective Robert Thorn (Charlston Heston) is seeking the truth behind his apparent suicide. Though corruption goes all the way to the top, it begins with Simonsons bodyguard, Chuck Connors, and security chief Donnie (Roi Jenson) who target Thorne for a waste disposal factory. Thorne's boss, Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes in his suspicions, but warns him of the 'Hot and Hot' who want the case to end, but Thorn will not risk his 'job' in a simple way. What Thorn reveals marks him dead, but as a movie awaits the final warning. ****
