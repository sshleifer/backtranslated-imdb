The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his short career in ARTHUR in 1981, an unusually funny and intermittent touching story that generates warm smiles, a big laugh of belly and occasionally a tear if you are in the right mood. Moore won the Academy Award nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "runs cars, plays tennis, loves women, but has free weekends and he is his own boss." Arthur is destined to inherit $ 750 million when married to a snook girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberri) and who is spoiled by the daughter of a gangster in a secret mission. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Minnelli, waitress / actress from Cuenca, who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore illuminates the screen in one of the funniest performances of the past 50 years. The late cheese John Gielgud won Oscars for the best supporting actor for his impeccable turn as Arthur's sour tongue, butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward contempt for Arthur's behavior involves more paternal feelings. There are other funny additions to Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's crazy grandmother. The film was directed by a sharp eye for the comedy of the first director Steve Gordon, who, unfortunately, passed away the following year. A few years later, there was an unforgettable sequel, but this instant classic is not missed.
