The surreal movie noir was released shortly after the "true" classic defining the genre "The Maltese Falcon," "Double Indemnity," and "The Postman Alvais Rings Tweets". Velles' films should not be judged against others. He played by different rules. In fact, he played. This begins where other femme fatale films cease, so that the vaguely logical (but interesting) child is equipped with a Vellesian scene (a typical style of quick ignition), a dialogue (a lot of "hard" philosophy) and unusual acting (a good Haivorth is probably intentional one-dimensional) . The Velles "genre" may have meant a "formula," but it seemed that he liked to use "mysteries" as a background for his "fun".
