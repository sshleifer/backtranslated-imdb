DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a brutal story of a brutal man. A doctor who treats the sick in occupied France, even if their ability to compensate is not there. However, it fell to the weakest among the population. Pictures and cinema are extraordinary and provide an added feeling for this complex story. He's a perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. A film that will certainly not be forgotten by spectators. Част г. Serrault, because of his terrifying appearance.
