An excellent comedy played by Dudley Moore with the support of Lisa Minnelli and a good speech by John Gielgood. Moore is Arthur, a man from a multimillionaire family, who was close to borrowing $ 750 million under the condition of marrying a lady (Susan) from another multimillionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but finally refused when he met the beautiful and poor Linda Marolla (Lisa Minnelli). Arthur was just a parasite, because he did not work, he just enjoyed sneaking up and having fun with the prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan just minutes before their wedding. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur, although they knew his life would change in the future. This comedy is a good lesson for everyone's life. Rich people are usually not satisfied with their way of life.
