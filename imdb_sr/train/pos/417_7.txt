This film has wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays a bad guy who sells weapons to Indians and hardly can recognize it. This was the first time that Cecil B. DeMille and Garry Cooper worked together and that the next film was basically the same, but set at different times. This film begins with Lincoln's assassination, and he deals with the Indian War. Calamiti Jane is in love with Will Bill and Buffalo Bill is married and now wants to stay home. This film also deals with Custer's last stop and is far from accurate. Garry Cooper is as good as usual and usually I do not like Jean Arthur, but I liked it here.
