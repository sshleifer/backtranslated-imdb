"All can contain spoilers" "All dogs go to paradise" is a great movie. I saw him in 1989 when I was two years old. More and more I love the songs in this movie, the favorite songs are "Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon Iou Come Home". These are beautiful songs. The movie is Charlie Dying. When I was a little my sister could not even watch that part. Besides, this movie is wonderful. My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie fly around the sky is beautiful in film and "watches" are very smart. And I like itchy, I actually have three dachshunds. They are so sweet. All in all I love this movie I suggest everyone to see.
