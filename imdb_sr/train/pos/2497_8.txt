Indeed: the use of drugs, warehouse recording, 'Matrix' - esque add-ons, a futuristic city with a mix of Asian races, and a lonely vampire - all in the same movie - looks like a story that could only be imagined by a Japanese pop / rock star. And that's exactly what the 'Moon Child' is, and much more. While all of these elements in combination may sound like the perfect theme for the camp B-film of this week, the 'Moon Child' pulls him off with several expected blows and interruptions on the road. The movie has a strong, definitely independent feeling towards it, jumping from one scene to another, not in a smooth transition, but sporadic jumps and borders, giving insights into the lives of characters and barely scrolling through a real plot. But the film does not give excuses, instead transforming the story into friendship, love, trust and betrayal of all sugars in the above-mentioned elements of futuristic society, infected gangsters and vampires. HIDE like the dark vampire Kei is excellent, gives depth to the character and balances the overly genuinely acting Gackta like 'Sho', the orphans who get acquainted with Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as a vindictive 'Son' who becomes friend with adult Shaw. The story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods of life, and how simple friendship can easily turn into sadness and betrayal. While the action is sometimes aware of unrealistic and special effects look just like shov-off, one thing that a movie never does is the assumption that it's about the very popular Asian singers that it features. Superstars as actors have their faults, as well as their characters. The film rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping a bit. The 'Moon Child' is pretty comfortable, sometimes funny, and even very touching: it's definitely worth your time!
