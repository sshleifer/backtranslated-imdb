The documentary presents the original theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel". The series graphically depicts several episodes that strongly support theory and defend the theory from the usual critique. I was deeply confused when I found the user's comments complaining about the lack of new information in these series. They say that the documentary represents information that is being taught in high school. Indeed, he has. In fact, I really enjoyed the original view of information I knew from high school and unexpected analysis. So if you love to know why things work, if you've taken a phone call To determine how it worked, if you went to the farm to see how the farm works and how to cow mow, you will enjoy in this series. Definitive recommendation.
