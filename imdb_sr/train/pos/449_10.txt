For everyone who sued others at the first meeting, here's the perfect tutorial about the depth of character. The hurt old lady has a soft, thoughtful heart - and she needs new friends. A dark, uncertain, 'ditsi' lady who makes inappropriate, unpleasant comments - sees deep in your soul and has pure love for everyone. A cold, primary, regular, neglected woman has passions that they can buy at any time - given the right attitude. Perfect beauty - a rich, sweet, party, led by crowds - wants peace, quiet and love without possessiveness. If you take the time to look beyond the surface, you will find treasure in everyday life, from the least expected sources. It takes only patience and attraction.
