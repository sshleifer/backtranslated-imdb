He did not know what to expect from Van Damme's partner and friend / trainer / and his choreographer for most of his films. It was nice to see him as "TONG PO" in "Kickboker and other Van Damm's films, now he is alone." He and his wife made a great team. His wife was a writer, producer, and directed most of the scenes that did not require action, she did a great job, well arranged, the trails were real fighters and they looked good together - the story is well merged, and if you can believe ... without a bad language, without sex, only with action.
