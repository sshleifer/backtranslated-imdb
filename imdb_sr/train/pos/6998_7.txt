Entering the Seven Pounds was not quite sure what to think because the performances were left to openly understand what it was actually about. So, in the first 20 minutes or so that you are completely lost in the plot, you have no idea what's going on and you think that Tim, who claims Ben is just a big asshole. It all ends when you "twist", to say so, discover at the last moment of the film. Basically, Tim (who will be a blacksmith) was upset and persecuted by the great misfortune he caused by causing the end of seven human lives. He decided to include seven new people who needed bad help, and in return, he gave his life. It seems to impress. Rosario Davson, for me, this is one of her better films, except an eagle eye that I think is up there. She was in some bad things, but she's in this movie. Other actors, such as Harrelson, have very small roles and do not have a big enough role to understand the character. Although the movie was still good. This film was definitely not what I expected and certainly a much slower pace in which I was hoping. Still, the film was pretty good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the film and everything falls into place. By that time it seems like a meaningless love story. The final thought is seven pounds = seven stars.
