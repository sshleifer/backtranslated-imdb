It was a movie I heard about my growing up, but I never saw it a few years ago. His reputation really continued. I knew about Michael Miers, I saw the mask, I saw commercials for all the inconvenient sequels that followed. But I grew up during a decade where Jason and Freddie had a deadly grip in the game of horror, and they never thought of the franchise Halloween. Man, how I was cheated with cheap knocks. The night of the witch is a truly terrifying film. Now, according to today's standards, it is not as graphic and visceral, but this film is shown at all other levels that most horror films can not achieve today. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so creepy, and the fact that it is set in a strange, middle western city is evidence of his ability. Light effects are downright scary, and "Shape" appears to appear and disappear in the shade at will. A simple but brutally effective music party only contributes to uncertainty. The performances of all players are well made, with specific nods on Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Ms. Curtis is so good Laurie Strode because she is so cute and vulnerable. It's terrible scary when Michael Miers is persecuted because the director and the viewer have invested so much in her, we want her to survive and escape. Donald Pleasance plays dr. The man on the mission, and he works well. He adds a sense of urgency to the situation in which the city is located, because it knows what kind of evil passes through their streets. He works at many levels and attracts the audience and never gives up. This should be standard viewing for anyone who wants to experience a really terrifying film. And for an even worse time, try to watch it yourself with the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think you see the "Shape" lurking in the shadow!
