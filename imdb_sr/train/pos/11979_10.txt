I try to watch it every day for most of the time, and even though I watched it for the last 4 years, I have not seen every episode. Shov is about Danny Tanner, who is the guy who is doing sports news. His wife died in a car accident of a drunken driver and asked Jesse, Elvis's maniac with a motorbike and had an obsession with his hair. Joei, an adult child doing comedy and making caricatures voices all the time to take care of his three girls, Donna Joe, is called DJ, Stephinie, the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. Everyone lives under one roof, and nobody helps them. Later in the show Jesse gets a friend, and later married to her and has twins, Nick and Alex. (This starts to happen in new seasons) This show is great, if you love the life of Zack and Codi, it's Raven, Boi Meets War, and Designing Voman, you will love this. (It starts to improve in the ending seasons) Watch out, you'll be pleased!
