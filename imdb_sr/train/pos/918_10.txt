If anyone is interested in getting a copy of this movie, please read the bottom of this description: The CBS first television broadcast on November 30, 2003, made for TV The invention of John Christmas is a continuation of last year's city without Christmas, with Peter Falk, who reiterated his role a versatile angel guard Max. Valerie Bertinelli starring Kathleen McAllister, a divorced sister in a small town whose depression ... due to the fact that the ER hospital that she is holding may be forced to quit because of a $ 100,000 debt, was briefly abolished when she saw a photo of a journalist Greeley ( David Cubitt). The picture shows the act of courage carried out by Noah's brother, firefighter Hank (Villiam Russ), who left the city mysteriously 25 years ago and has not been seen since. Hank would like to quietly return to the city without explanation or fanfare, but this proves impossible when Noevi's newspapers bet $ 50,000 to identify Hank, known only as "John Christmas". And there is something very, very curious about this photo: it also shows the Santa Claus suit that seems to float in the air without a tenant. This elusive "Santa Claus" is, of course, angelic Max, who constantly appears through a story in various forms to solve problems, share tips, link loose plots - even split a music duet with Kathleen's talented daughter Socorro (Jennifer Pisana).
