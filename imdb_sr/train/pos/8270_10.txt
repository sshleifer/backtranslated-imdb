This is an extraordinary movie that keeps you playing. It seems to be moving towards the clich√© in a few points, and then something amazing will happen, which is truly amazing. It would be too much to say much more, but hold this film and you will be richly rewarded. Villiam Haines is absolutely wonderful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be rediscovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pikford is incredible - there is even a scene in which Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this subtlety subtly and with great depth of emotion, so there are moments that are very moving. And I never thought I could join a football game like this one - and I do not even understand the rules! Francis Ks is also excellent. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines rivals a girl (yes, it's not a complete gay film). A beautiful silent classic - an excellent example of the twentieth commercial cinema with a blade.
