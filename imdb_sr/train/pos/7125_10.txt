Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully shot and beautifully realized. She is not completely faithful to the book, but must it be? Not at all. John Thav enchants as Tom Oakley. His transformation from rude to caring was so well accomplished, making him more convincing than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After inspector Morse, this is Thav's best watch. He was honestly linked by young Nick Robinson, who gave a convincing account of the evacuated traumatized abusive relationship with his mother. Scenario and music made it worth buying, and you also see Thav playing the organ. Incredibly! The most exciting scene was that Villie learned of Zak's death, and then Tom told him about his deceased daughter who died of scarlet. Buy this, you will be liked! 10/10 Bethani Coke
