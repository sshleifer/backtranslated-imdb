It was only after some thought that I decided that this movie would like me. And after I read the comments from all other posters here and thinking about it, I decided that I really liked it. I like American films - probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a well-defined start, middle and end. "Preskue rien", on the other hand, does not make such an attempt. I do not agree with other posters that say it's "too artistic". In every respect, this film aims to evoke your feelings. So you often feel in the movie as if you are there ... you feel summer sun, breeze, heat, winter cold, socializing, loneliness, etc., Itd. The director draws you in every way to the lives of characters - which makes so many people feel so powerful that the film disappointed them. Since I finished it, I felt the same. But after some thought, I realized that it was supposed to be a film: 'story' is not narration, but emotions that you (the viewer) feel. Lighting, landscape, and camera angles bring you to the scene - they are rich, exquisite and live with details and nuances. Although I can not normally watch movies without a fully developed plot (after all, was not the movie "supposed" to tell the story), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.
