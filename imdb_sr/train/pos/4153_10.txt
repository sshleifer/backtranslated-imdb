this was a fantastic episode. I saw a video clip on IouTube from it, and I promised that it would ever appear on TV, that I would stick to the set to watch. I ended up looking at him with my friend, who was accidentally gay, and we both cried in the end. This was a really well-written, honest episode of the forbidden love between two cops who, I think, really (in Coop's words) were "happy". episodes such as these that really make Cold Case one of the most attractive and favorite television magic works on CBS. I wait for more episodes, and a series of "Forever Blue" series, because I will always watch it again and again.
