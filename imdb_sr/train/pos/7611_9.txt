"I looked around this island, and what I saw was wonderful," proclaims one of the main characters in ABC's award-winning television show "Lost". The series could be summarized as a dramatic story of a group of survivors of plane crashes stranded on an unknown island, but this would be a bad service. The "Lost" follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island, each other, and ultimately themselves, as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependence on one another. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear that this is not an ordinary island - and that they may not be alone. My initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories that they could tell us after a certain period, but this proved unfounded. Narration flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are remembered and the execution is wonderful. The island itself is a character, and to understand this comment, you should see a series for yourself, which only shows its originality and size. At the time of writing this text only the first two seasons are broadcast, and they are full of strong episodes. My only treacherous criticism is that the second season slows down a bit, but happily returns in an amazing form for the final episodes. now this would certainly be this one. If you like excitement, adventure, storytelling, an extremely strong team and crew, beautiful places and an island that looks more spiritual than natural, "Lost" is for you. Just start from the beginning.
