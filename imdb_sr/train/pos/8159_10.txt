Okay. This film is pure pleasure. There is always a violent horror mixed with a little suspicion and a lot of black comedy. A dentist really starts losing his mind and it's nice to watch him like that. This film is for certain people, though. Or you will love it completely or you will hate it completely. Good movie for renting and watching When you have nothing else to do. We also recommend: Psicho III
