Jesse and Celine (Ethan Havke and Julie Delphi) are two foreigners in a European train. The two come from very different backgrounds, he is an American, and she is a Frenchman, after a little talk on the train, Jesse manages to take Celine off the train and explore Vienna with him. Over the next few hours, the two of them roam in Vienna, taking everything the city has to offer and become madly in love with one another. But whether this new relationship will last the past of the sunrise. This beautiful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air in the genre that is in decline. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before Sunrise" is never boring because of his 'little actors'. In fact, it flashes thanks to traces that love you to love their characters and have wonderful charisma between them. Smart dialogue makes this a must for romance lovers.
