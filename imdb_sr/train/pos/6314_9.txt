I went to the cinema with two of my friends and chose this film from the hat, completely not knowing what to expect. And it turned out to be a very pleasant, funny experience! It's a great movie with a very unexpected story, a very good dialogue and crazy humor. All the characters were obviously made in the style of "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical comic strip), but that did not bother me for a second. In fact, this kind of Lucerne-Boum made the film unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, and Villian Maci, Clooney is barely recognizable and brilliant. But the real star is actually Guzman. He played the role of his life in this movie! The scene when his character Cosimo dies in a movie, it's so hilarious that he strangled me and died with him! Recommended for all fans of "Alan Ford"!
