Stunning high quality film. Apparently based on true events that, as said, has a clear ring of truth about it, this film is highly emotional and deeply moving. Abused and neglected child often becomes reluctant in adulthood, as one of life's failures, whether it's a gangster, a drug addict or a burden to society. Antwone Fisher as a young adult in the Navy, is upset. He's on the verge of being a loser. The psychiatrist advises him in therapy and it is this relationship that takes a central place in the performance. In the back and therapy, the source and medicines for Antvones are discovered. Extraordinary performances from the whole composition. The story is in fact a family tragedy with emotional and physical pain. All actors give a full blood performance with conviction and realism. One message from a movie is the importance of raising children decent. True Antwone deserves success. To endure corruption as a child, but to rise above it, it shows a magnificent character. And to all those who survived such torture, but that they survived and succeeded: you are all winners. 10 of 10
