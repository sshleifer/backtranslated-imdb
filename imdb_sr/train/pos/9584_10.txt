Yes, these films are highlights. Not recommended anymore. Gai or Strait is great docu for anyone who loves the movie. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never dull. Excellent access. A film shot with passion and interest in the subject. Some of the shows and incredible. If this film is only on VHS, it's still very valuable to watch. Great. 10 out of 10. I had to see part of this year's dock a decade ago and I did not understand what I was looking at. Interviews very reveal ego performers who are like heavy boxers trying to get out of the ghetto. The director was obviously the first timer and what kind of achievement. Cool. Follow him.
