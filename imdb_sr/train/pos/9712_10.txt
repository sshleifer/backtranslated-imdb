Another review compares this corpse with the cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also convenient. Another criticism dealing with differences between comedy, we enjoy non-critical and black comedy, also worthy of attention. See the whole thing, all three series. In the end, all the characters are tied and pieces of the puzzle fall into their place just like the novel by Daglas Adams. Details and intricacies are stunning. Thoroughly postmodern. Evil funny and astounding tragic. Not for children. Not for those with thin skin or lack of objectivity. Thinking. Suddenly literally, figuratively and surreally in disturbing ways. The finest comedy I remember. And very probably the most beautiful thing I'll ever see.
