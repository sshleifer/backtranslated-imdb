I just watched this movie on Shovtime. Accidentally. If I had not only had 6 hours of sleep in the past two days, I would not come home from work before. If I had not come earlier from work, I would not have seen this movie. I would not know what I miss, but I would miss a lot. So is this film. He almost plays on Kevin Bacon's effect. This and the causality (hence and my above). Sometimes the character intervenes in one way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This movie is wonderful. I'll have to find a copy for the purchase.
