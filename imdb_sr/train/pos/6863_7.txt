A great film about uncertainty with incredible slow motion of the camera that contributes to dramaticness makes this treat for viewing and enjoying. The scriptwriter Brian de Palma is doing great Hitchcock imitation (many called him "ripoff") with this movie and 2.35: 1 Widescreen DVD is necessary to fully understand the work of the camera (and several scenes with people hiding on each side that is lost on TV-format formats). The bad side of the film, at least for anyone who has some kind of moral standard, is the general laziness of all characters, including a policeman who played before NIPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). The introductory scene is still shocking the fairly long stage of the show, Angie Dickinson, which is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes in it, while Dickinson (if it really is a close-up) and Nancy Allen are not shy to show their bodies. There are not many dialogues in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the photo after the murder. The first 36 minutes are rivets and although it is obvious who the killer is, it is still very uncertain and fun to watch all the way, especially for the men who are naked women.
