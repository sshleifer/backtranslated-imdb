As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to New York, I love you with very high expectations. I'm happy to go out with all my expectations. It was funny, sweet, fast, and fun. The film begins with two cab carriers (Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha) who are trying to reach the same area, but claiming in what way. That was funny, and then the film enters some of the best sketches I've ever seen. There were four amazing of all the good ones. These four will start talking. One of them is Shia LaBeouf as a bell-ringer in a hotel that finds love in an old lady. The next section shows Orlando Bloom as a musician who works with a woman played by Christina Ricci. One of them is Anton Ielchin and Olivia Thirbli as two people who go to graduation, and Thirbly's character is handicapped. The best characteristic is Eli Vallach and Cloris Leachman as a dashing old couple. I will draw your attention to Nataile Portman making an impressive directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about the keeper, while Ethan Havke and Maggie K are excellent as a flirtation man and whore. New York, I love you definitely good, if not better than Paris Je'Taime in 2006. The skates are well-timed, and the film shows how it should be indie films. The film, however, does not have so many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which made it fantastic to live in accordance with its excellence. If you want to laugh, you see some dramatic effects, you see an incredible amount of great performances, and just have fun, then definitely go to Nev Iork, I love you.
