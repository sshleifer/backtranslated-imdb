The problem with showing the actual individual is that the performance can be good, but it does not work if the audience does not believe that the actor portrays a person. This is the main problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gives an excellent performance, but it was hard for me to believe that Abraham Lincoln was quiet, as the Fund describes it. This is essentially a courtroom drama with young Abraham Licolon in the foreground. Whether it was a true story, I do not know, but if it is not, why then to say that he used Lincoln as a central character? Does not matter. In the film, Lincoln defends two young men who are charged with murder. For the film there is not much to do, and as a result, it looks rather empty. I wanted more development of stories and characters. The movie lasts 100 minutes, but it does not look like that. There are some small scenes with Lincoln and a relationship with Marie Todd, but they look superficial. Lincoln. I just do not think the real Lincoln was so quiet. True, he has a great voice when he needs, as when he urges a drunken personal mafia to allow the accused to be tried, but the Fund shows Lincoln too obedient. Other performances are however solid, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clai, mother of the accused. She's a good lady for whom we can really feel. Simple and uneducated, but very sweet; We see why Lincoln wanted to help her. It seems that John Ford is thinking of this film as an epic, and at the time of his release it was probably. But even then, there is not enough material to present it as such. It's a nice watch, but not a classic.
