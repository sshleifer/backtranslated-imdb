Contra Todos is a big Brazilian low budget film showing life on the outskirts of the great Brazilian city.

Actors have trainings in the workshops and have used a lot of improvisations, which was the reason for such a natural action. My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): "Contra Todos" ("Against All")
