Tattooed Stranger was another of those rare B-films that BBC2 played during Christmas / New Years 2005-2006. See also They live at night and a bayton's stranger. In this, the man walking his dog in Central Park encounters an abandoned car and reveals a dead woman inside. The police were shot, so she tried to identify only with a tattoo as a major trail. After being identified, the killer was detected and killed in a shootout at the end. Most of this film was filmed at a location in and around New York City, so we can see some parts of the city we do not usually see, especially in the back streets. Most of them are unknown in the acting team, while John Miles receives top billing. Excellent or rather unclear. Rating: 3 stars from 5.
