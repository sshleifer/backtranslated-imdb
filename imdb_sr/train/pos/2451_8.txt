George Lopez is a funny man even without a comedy. The first episodes I've seen about this are often joked at the expense of his mother. As I looked at this more, there was more and more diversity. Now, no one at the acting station is really safe from his mind. It seems to me that this season has progressed and that George is more comfortable with the family role of Daddy. At first it did not, but gets more and more into the groove. That both him and the shows gradually becomes more entertaining. They also added several characters for George to play this year too. His wife's dad became more and more involved in the plot. His mom is still there, but not as centrally as the last season. I think it's wise to say with George's sense of comedy, and the lack of good ABC series, George Lopez, has a good chance to be here at ABC long after George V. Bush.
