I know that this film should appeal to me, and I work mostly, but as others have mentioned, it's a long time in the teeth. I also found that the raging hormones of all male crew are a bit boring. It's a miracle that they did not start to breathe and shout for months. I have to say that my film is completely cold. It's a very sterile atmosphere that spills the film. On plus side effects are great (except for cartoon monster), as well as effects, requisites, costumes and of course Robbie. If the robot was not in this movie, I do not think it would be as popular as it was. The other half of the film wins the pair when we begin to explore forgotten gadgets "The Core". How many times have I watched this movie, Krel still leaves me scratching my head, exactly who they are or what they were. Based on what was being produced at that time, in addition to "this island nation," the forbidden planet was miles above the average Sci-Fi movies of that time. Color Recording also contributes to enjoyment. Certainly a classic in your law, flaws and everything, and deservedly.
