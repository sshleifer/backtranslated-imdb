And I'm a fanatic Nicole Kidman. I would pay to see her and hear her read the Moscow telephone directory, which, as far as I know, maybe worked when she spoke Russian in this movie. All four directors are excellent, but the film is a large number of good pictures and better scenes that are not held together. While he's always ready to stop believing while watching a movie, this one asks too much of the viewer. It could be very funny (which is in parts) or rather scary (which is in one scene), but it seems that the director did not know which way.
