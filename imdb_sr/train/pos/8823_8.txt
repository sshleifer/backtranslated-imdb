Good movie. He tells a boyfriend fantasy story, tells us that we are trapped in social situations and what extreme measures should be taken to behave differently. Or at least a feeling: you must break every rule if you want to break it. If you want to express love for someone you do not know, how would you do so without creating an urgent social situation? Also, Fascism is deciding on the cultural life of others, about what culture is doing. What gives Disney or Foku or a suicide bomber the right to decide what our choice is. Can anyone drink morning coffee from one. Do we have to listen to the NRJ shouting, see stupid tabloid headlines and street advertising before we even had morning coffee?
