This is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television. The first season was hilarious as most of the following seasons. The only reason I gave this show was 9/10 due to the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the last season was the final. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that remembered the human imagination, often showing characters in famous TV shows or films from the seventies. It's a rarity in the fact that I liked every character (with the exception of the final season ... too late to try to develop a new character, and fez was not even ridiculous). The red leg in your comments has never grown old, nor is Kelso nonsense. Good handcuffs for such a long, long and good performance.
