This film talks about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and the first few years of the reign of Great Britain. Young Victoria has incredible production. Each scene is designed and decorated with flawless details. Extravagant costumes, sumptuous locations and beautifully landscaped gardens make "The Ioung Victoria" very impressive. I was most impressed by careful cinema. As each person is set in relation to the background or foreground, it is well thought out, each scene is well-composed. The scene that hit me most is when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from the corner of Victoria, while from the corner of Melbourne Victoria was placed between the place where Melbourne held his hand on his hips. to be followed and understood by a person without the historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are accelerated or not even explained. I expected a big scene of the crown, and the disappointment lasted only a few seconds. All in all, "young Victoria" is a good movie, and it would be even better if it was longer, so the events can be properly explained without rush.
