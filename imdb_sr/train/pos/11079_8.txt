I always enjoy watching movies that make you think, not just to feed the answers to your audience. "Revolver" is one of these films, and although many reviewers said it was difficult to follow, with a little concentration and open mind I got it. First time. True, this can not be compared with other minds such as "Common Suspects" or "Memento", but in itself it is an intelligent and thoughtful movie. Another thing that I really liked in this movie is that it's damn pretty. Every scene, every corner of the camera looks like it's been thinking for years. If you see it, you will know what I mean. So, let's conclude ... look at it with an open mind and you may enjoy it. If not, well, nobody ever said "Revolver" is for everyone. And that's my 2 cents.
