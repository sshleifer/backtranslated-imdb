Evening is a fun movie with plenty of depth. All actors and actresses turn into spectacular performances. With great acting, however, we expect a starring act, but in this film, expectations are exceeded. It can relate to personalities and situations in their own family. While one sees the interaction of family members, one's family memories are immediately learned. This is one of several movies that inspired one to read the book. Usually this is the other way round; One reads a book and then wants to see a movie. I'll definitely get a copy of Susan Minot's book and read it. The landscape of Rhode Island is spectacular as well as a soundtrack. Every auto-buff will enjoy the seemingly professionally renewed periods of the car. Needless to say, but I recommend the Eve high. You see that you will enjoy.
