Personally, this is one of my favorite all the time! No, I'm not 10 .. I'm 30! I own the old, original VHS that I bought from the store. I watched him countless times .. While this is a fun movie for kids, it's an intriguing adult movie. Once I saw this movie while I was .. it was not sober. my eyes were open to things I had never noticed before. I saw that the moral attitude is strongly encouraged, and openly and a bit subliminally .. I would like to remember all the things I have noticed, but since then it has been very long. Be sure, there are tons of things that are alluded to throughout the whole movie. if you have the opportunity to look at it ... do not soberly .. do so, you will not be disappointed .. in fact, you will probably feel pretty happy and warm. Unique and beautiful!
