After seeing Arthur on television, I laughed several times so that Dudley Moore's role as Arthur as a happy drunken millionaire was hysterical, but John Gelgood as his servant / father Hobson was equally charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and I watched it, despite the passage of nearly 27 years, which is still as pleasing as Liza Minnelli's role ever since the interest was fascinating for the chemistry between them is magic. Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled pillion millionaire who has a bill that is read as a state debt and has no desire to grow up and enjoy the behavior as a child. His activities are supervised by his dry English batler Hobson (Gielgud). It seems that nobody cares for Arthur except him, Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he does not marry a horrible blonde socialist Susan Johnson (Eikenberri). He will cut off his son's $ 750 million inheritance for weeks. However, Arthur met and fell in love with Lynn Marolle (Minnelli), a young waitress working class and a necktie thief, now facing a tough decision. marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur finally grows up and ends up with Susan before the wedding, leaving him to keep both money and his true love. Arthur is truly an enchanting romantic comedy for everyone
