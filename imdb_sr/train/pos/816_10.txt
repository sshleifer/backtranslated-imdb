First, I would like to say that, although I know my part about the wars of the star, I am not a fanatic. I do not know how many chromosomes there are Vamp Rat or an extended family TK427. what I know is: Star Vars, all the movies (though with episode 2), captured something magical. it's hard to say what Lucas found and button boldly pressed, but he does. Star Wars are more than a movie. It's an idea. How, ask? I'll explain. Star Wars touch the most comprehensive stereotypes, good and evil. it makes it so obviously, so deeply, that virtually every person in any environment can understand. Episode VI works very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his man and his manipulated father, but, also adding, they are still discovering the story of the epitaph. Suddenly, it's Darth Vader on the front, and viewers realize that this is the story of Anakin, and not just Luke. but even before 1-3, everything was incredible. It was real, as if the capsule fell from the sky to Lucas's wing, detailing the history of the galaxy far, far away. Star Wars are definitely something far above the norm, and I have to admit, whenever I see them, especially this, I feel very little. I feel like I was drawn into a world in which good and evil are so clearly defined. I feel that something, somehow, touched me more than ever that a physical thing can hope.
