I enjoyed the Longstreet, which was following the successful series of Raimond Burr in Ironside and had the goal of giving her the competition. But this show was canceled after a season, because it was decided - I believe it's wrong - that Longstreet was not able to compete with Mr Burr's Ironside. I can add that the pilot for this show was especially well made and very memorable. I hope that the Longstreet box will appear. Writers should note that this story idea is only briefly researched and that much more can and should be done to show the game and the interconnectedness of disability on TV.
