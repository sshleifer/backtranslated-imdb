this film was just a brilliant, casting, landscape location, story, direction, everyone really answered what they were playing, and you could imagine that you are there, Robert Redford is an incredible actor, and now the same director, Norman's father came from the same. Scottish island like myself, so I loved the fact that the real connection with this movie, witty remarks during the whole movie were great, it was just brilliant, so much that I bought a movie as soon as it was released for sale and I recommend everyone to watch, and the fly was amazing, it really was a cry in the end it was so sad, and you know what they say if you cry on the movie must have been good, and this was definitely there, also congratulations for the two boys who played the role of Norman and Paul were just brilliant, children are often omitted from the list of praise, I think, because the stars played by all adults have such a big profile for the whole movie, but these kids are incredible and should be praised for what they did, right? the whole story was so wonderful because it was true and it was someone's life after everything that was shared with us all.
