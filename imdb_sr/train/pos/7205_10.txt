Deathtrap is not a detective. That's who will do it to who first. It's so hard to describe this movie without dropping anything, so I will not mention anything more about the plot. As for acting, Cris Reeves has the greatest role as Clifford, a young drama writer. You really see the range of his acting abilities in this film from the "exhale of the Cheeseburger" to the utterly scary. Clifford has such a difficult role and on the theatrical production of this I have never seen Clifford play well at both ends of the spectrum. The actor is played by a little puppy or a maniac of murder. Reeves is the only person I've seen, which has its character all the way to the end. As for Michael Kane, he's ... ... he's Michael Caine. One of the best actors in the past 50 years and in this movie is as good as it ever was.
