Some people have said that since the 11th season, South Park has launched a trend to leave its politically nasty satire for shallow subversives; but that can not be further from the truth. While this episode underestimates the Living Dead series, there's more. It's a satire about how people treat homeless people. The characters say things like "They pretend to be just like us" or "They want to be people." This episode attacks the culture of people who ignore the lower class, and are often just lucky. So, it is still a satire, but also a wonderful gift. What more do you want?
