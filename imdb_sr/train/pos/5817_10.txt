If you want to remember MJ, this is a good place to start. This film contains sweet melodies, MJ as a robot, and a crazy, confused action. I remember, many nights, having come to this fine feature film in college, and thinking of the pure avesomenes who decided to green this funny piece of the green light. There are lots of singing. A lot of dancing. It's a lot of singing while you dance. MJ kills him the way you would expect when it comes to these things. But there's more to this film. There is a glitch. He has fat children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that Michael Jackson must fight in dancing (apparently clay). There is also Joe Pesci (not made of clay). RIP - we love you Michael! It's a sad day for all of us.
