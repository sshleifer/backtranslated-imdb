Heartland was produced around the time of Michael Cimeline's Sky Gate - Heartland cost a fraction, but it's 10 times bigger than the movie. Heaven Gate was "the largest and most expensive (40 million USD 1980!) Hollivood flops of all time, its failure resulted in the sale of a unified art studio MGM-In-Heartland Heartland It costs you hundreds of thousands of dollars and benefits from great writing, direction, photography and acting. It's easy to attract you into the beauty, joy, hardship and sorrow of pioneering life. It's sad that Hollivood would sometimes put millions into turkeys ( based on the great hits of the director) and ignored such a wonderful story.
