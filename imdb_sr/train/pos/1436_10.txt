Since I worked in the center of Manhattan and often ate my lunch during the summer days in a park near the City Hall, I would see the mayor come and go. It was great to be able to get out of the city hall door and see what it looks like in the lobby and through the whole building. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", '03, gave an extraordinary performance through the whole picture, especially when he delivered a speech in an African American church for a boy who was killed. John Cusack, (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Fired The Jury", '03, was a devoted officer of the mayor and loved him in everything he tried to achieve. Bridget Fonda, (Maribeth Cogan), begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhouna and gives her a big supporting role. And finally, but not least, Danni Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Kei", '01, played the mafia boss who had some very difficult choices to make the end of the picture! A great movie with great acting and fantastic photography in New York!
