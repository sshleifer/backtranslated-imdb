In the thirties and forties and forties of the last century, each of the main studies broke the jazz one-reelers. Although the majority on the screen looked cheap as it should, Varner Bros.. (which suddenly stopped producing them in 1946) often distinguished their unusual corners of the camera, mirrors and optical effects, thanks to some creative directors such as Jean Negulesco. It is appropriate that the best of this genre comes from this study. What "Jammin" Blues "differs from the rest of the pack is that it resembles an avant-garde experiment rather than a Hollivood musical. Filmed in July 1944, it transforms a regular jam session into a" trippy "san-escape from war troubles, accentuated by the melody "On the sunny side of the street." Gjon Mili and cameraman Robert Burkes (later worked with Hitchcock) had plenty of artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glen Miller, and the studio was less worried about how they were he and his fellow musicians are presented. The optical printer is well used, and at the same time there are several images of the same artist. (Norman McLaren really twisted this process two decades later at "Pas De Deuk", while Linwood Dunne's team achieved various effects in "Citizen Kane.") A strong emphasis on silhouettes and the smoke of cigarette smoke also was ahead of his time; in a way, it was preceded by a psychedelic sixties, but with a markedly forty film noir style.
