This is a great movie! Most of us saw the Jurassic Park, where the theory of chaos is summed up by talking about the wings of a butterfly, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug is all about it (or at least something, do not worry this is not a spoiler) I'm definitely not a religious type and I do not believe in predetermined things, fate, etc. wondering if coincidence really exists ... </ br>> Moreover, the acting and the camera are great, others prove that it is still possible to make a good movie without the zillion dollars
