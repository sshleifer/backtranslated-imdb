Directing behind this movie was fantastic for comedy. Many scenes look like they are from comics and much darker (visually - not a story) than I expected. However, this may not be the most fun film ever made, especially if you are in very rough sexist jokes, because it has very little (compared to others like Mari or American Pie). As you look at it again, a few jokes stand out and become funnier. If you've ever read a comic book or watch a comic movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and like it, you'll probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie. If you do not like it, you may like the fair ridicule that this movie has for them. If you liked this movie, DVD has some great accessories. (8/10)
