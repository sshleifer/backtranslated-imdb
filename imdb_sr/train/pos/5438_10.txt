A uniform director of adventure forms, George Stevens (before turning to a more serious offer, like in 1948, I SAY MAMU and GIANT in 1957) sets the standard for all future campaign yarns. Based on Rudiard Kipling's poem, GUNGA DIN follows the trips of three military officers in the 19th century in India. The noble trio has to deal with a series of battles and other dangers, including a cult tuggea and a temple full of gold. Their screen adventures remain exciting even after more than six decades, and have inspired almost everything, from STAR VARS (1977), to the similarly staged RAIDERS LOST ARC (1981) inspired by the clairvoyant opera. The greatest reason for the success of the picture, however, are perfect performances of trio films of extremely charismatic actors. Victor McLaglen was rarely better than a powerful guy, Cari Grant is the ultimate comic book, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is a persuasive hero that can be imagined - perhaps even more than a rival Errol Flinn. Chemistry between the three actors can simply not be improved, and such a warm and convincing companion is exactly what is lacking in the most modern action pictures - and they receive tremendous support from the wonderful Sam Jaffe, which goes beyond the obvious physical miscasting and the true title of the character of the adventures of human sweetness and quiet power . A big hit in the day (the film was supposedly the second largest maker of money in 1939 behind the undoubtedly successful GONE VITH THE VIND), and remains undoubtedly the best film of its kind.
