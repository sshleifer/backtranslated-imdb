"GI Samurai" sees Sonny Chibu and some other guys returning to feudal Japan that has been hit by a civil war for no particular reason, and a lot of massacres are created. This is above all a top-level essay of swords and machine guns that ultimately brings some interesting results. The plot basically moves along the track that you can expect from the title; the initial fish-out-the-water antics ("what is a flying metal box?" etc.), "is not it better for us" discussions and, ultimately, a huge battle. This is another evidence that the film is not taken seriously, the massacre that occupy most of the other half as a Samurai army fighting against Chiba's waters; the face of one would completely expect from the title, but nevertheless manages to overwhelm his inventiveness and extravagance. This is certainly one of the most striking unique sequences of combat in its time and does not pull in spite of its length. own morale, because the situation slowly affects him. This is certainly one of his better vehicles from his great CV. Until the last act of the two worlds had such an impact on one another, you have to ask yourself whether it was some kind of nihilism by the writers, as it seems to be asking, "Was not it better then?" But this may be a little reading in that it can generally be described as an extremely fun two-way (almost) non-stop action.
