People of honor have many great aspects. Good action sequences, lots of "good" scenes, good music, but the part that really makes the movie is great acting. Mostly Robert Deniro. The story of people of honor is centered on Carla Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr. He records his tough fight from being a poor farmer until entering the diving school and even further. It's a good story, but it looks like it's been done many times before. A person, against all appearances, will not give up until he reaches his goals which he set for some sentimental reason many years ago. It could happen, but many faces from Brazil in the film are questionable, including CO. at the diving school with his final test. However, all this is invented for the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie. Deniro plays the main Sunday teacher at the diving school Brashear is attending. As soon as Deniro comes, he leaves out this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can not hate if you do not have incredible force. Before the film finishes, Deniro gives you multiple speeches that will make you laugh cool, but you're too stunned by the way they hit them. In the end, you have to doubt some aspects of the film, but acknowledge if it was all true, it would allow you to put it off until the first twenty minutes.
