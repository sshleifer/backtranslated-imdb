The question whether or not he loves this movie version of the "Spiritual Train" always depends on one thing and the very things: your reactions to the appearance of Arthur Askeia. the scene in which it is, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you want to calm down a bit or retreat, to make sure that many characters are working and developing (which do to some extent). But somehow it all points to Askey's character Tommy Gander. I personally like the movie, and even Askei. I always seem to put it in vcr in those odd hours early in the morning when I can not sleep and I really can not find the energy to watch anything else. There is something about watching old b / h movies in the quiet darkness of the tunnel that seems attractive to me.
