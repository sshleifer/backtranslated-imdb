You can talk about Princ's acting talent, or even about his choice to parody his life in this film. There is no debate about his musical talent now and now. Seems like a shadow twenty years later, but music remains relevant and fantastic. Having gone through this film (graduating from high school, '85), I can tell you that at that time there was nothing greater. From Tipper Gore (wife Al) who tried to censor "Little Nikki" and every other thing under the sun via the Parents Music Resource Center to each "Air Band" at the time when he was presented as Prince, it was absolutely the hottest thing. At least a couple of weeks, the Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. We all waited for the movie and we were excited when we first premiered it. He did not disappoint. ALL were caught. At that time I was a MTV narco (they actually played music ... all the time). Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I have to qualify this comment by saying that at that time my favorites were Billi Idol, Oingo Boingo, Fikk, Flock of Seagulls and others in the genre Punk / Nev Vave 'Music Prince at that time had overcome all types and styles. One of the reasons why some of them seem so cruel and corrupt now is that it was SOOOOOOOO then. All the things that remind you of the '80s were then iconic. It was the main stream and now it looks like a cliche. It has become so popular that it has become ridiculous. It's like a grandma ad for Vendi's Hamburgers. Now it looks stupid, because EVERYONE has been caught in it (unfortunately, like a bizarre purple macarero or something like that.
