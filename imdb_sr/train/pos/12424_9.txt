I always wanted David Duchovnei to enter the film business, and he finally did it, and made me proud. This film has experienced what I was hoping for. Duchovnei played his character very well, having managed to stay consistent with something new, instead of playing Agent Mulder, to which we are accustomed. So I give him extra credit for his role, also because I could not see anyone else playing that particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to psychotic Timothy Hutton. A great performance that you will not be tired of during the entire film, because you will never be surprised. He has weaknesses and strengths, making the story even more convincing. I also enjoyed the narration very much, I added a good job in the story, and I had some very unforgettable quotes that I still use for the whole time. This film also had a vulnerable rating. I recommend this to anyone who loves a drama and does not mind his blood.
