An unusually stupid actor who acted as an actor and shot a director who apparently seriously grasped the material. Unfinished, as you can expect from a movie that is obviously shot on a tight budget, but the drama involves - it's one of those movies that when you repeat themselves on Cinemak 2 or More Mak or as they call it, you end up watching blocks of 40 minutes when you need to go to work. In addition to V / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault", a reminder that Vinnyor is a much more talented director than many of his low-profile Brether, who has the real ability to make a genre film when he is actually interested in the material (i.e. do not bother to watch any of his Shannon Tveed flicks with 3 or 4 after the title!) Actors who have recently had little work (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandi for the sake of God) have indeed put all their years in some of their best role - as for Grieco, he has a real look, though he is a little acting unambiguous - it is clear that his character should be self-destructs film, but Grieco is not transmitted. I checked the IMDB and I see that the writer wrote "Sororiti House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" for directors - and less classics in their rights, but apparently a "stupid" Cinema like Roger Cormon - this is more like some of the best Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B-picture of the 70's - giving you an element of exploitation, but offering simultaneous drama - a real step forward. No "Citizen Kane" and comical final moments are a bit disturbing but well-written accent that moves above the character. Such small achievements should not be ignored when they arrive, which is rare enough (as I recalled while I was trying to sit over Albert Piun monstrosity called "Heatseeker" an evening - this low-budget thing is not as easy as it seems-but this is another story !)
