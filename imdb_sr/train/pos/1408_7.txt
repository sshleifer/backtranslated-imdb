It seems that the Pentagon Scientific Team has perfected the serum that causes invisibility, but when the main attempt on it can not reverse it. Frustrated and drunk with power, he turns psychologists into the classical tradition of HG Welsh. This is a joyfully awesome story of an Invisible Man, delivered with delicious Verhoeven and Bekon as genius - loonitoon-maniac. As with the large part of Verhoeven, he has an incredible sense of adventure for boys-his own comics (a secret underground laboratory where scientists work is wonderful) in combination with the most terrible and shameful visions (women in the underwear that swallow and attack) invisible villain , animals beaten to death, literally with gallons of blood and massive massacre in the last two rollers). While the story does not follow the new reversal of the old idea, the special effects of CG by Scott E. Andersons are obviously brilliant because we see warts and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissue, bones, and flesh. nowhere. In particular, the sequence in which the team returns the gorilla from the invisible state and the scene in which Bacon deals with Devaneo in the pool, absolutely takes away the breath in detail and the artistic invention of the effects. The film also features an excellent soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and a classic horror-film photography by Josta Vacan. Young actors are largely obscured by the technical pedigree of the film, but both Shue and Dickens are impressive beyond their depths. This is a great entertainment movie.
