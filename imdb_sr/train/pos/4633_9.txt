Here's another beauty in a series of beautiful films directed by Eitan Fock. The film depicts a story about the fallen stars (one Israeli, one Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The effectiveness of the film comes not only from the presentation of the interethnic conflict, but also from the conflicts of personal and political within ethnic groups. For example, there is a moment when one of the secondary characters, openly gay, visits the hospital for his boyfriend who brings flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his family visit, and suddenly we see a wave of unpleasant discomfort washed through the room. It is clear that a young man is not as open as it seems, and the family does not accept the way he wants to be, while the boy is confused and discarded. A good deal of complexity is packaged for a short time. As we know from Iossi & Jagger, Fox is a master in an effective package of emotional and psychological complexity in short sequences. The film is also effective in an impartial way that represents the brutal brutality that Israelis and Palestinians inflict on each other. If you're not insensitive, you'll cry through the last third of the movie. Although the action is melodramatic, it is so intelligently written and acted to remind us how satisfactory good melodramas can be.
