Okay, so a little lends it to "It's a wonderful life," but it was 44 years before the movie, so why not a new attempt. Belushi has a rotten 35th birthday. He did not get wheat, his coffee and lost his job. The captain was when his car was described as the "big blue piece" of the car at the end of the day. He went into an empty bar and called on the tow. While waiting, the bartender recognized him as a child who lost a baseball game in the city 20 years earlier. This leads him to think about how life would have been won in the game. He finds out when, not knowing about him, Kane serves as a drink for moving in a glass that gives him a house, Queen of Promise (Ruso) as his wife, and makes him the president of the company for sports products from which he was preserved. Caine is later revealed as one who is responsible for this change, but Belushi is not entirely on board. He never adjusts completely, and in a plan that does not kill the movie, but is still strange, he tries to judge his wife (Hamilton) from his real life, who is now married to some other. A good move is that they do not spend too much time on it, as essentially ruining the "Ghost", while Belushi constantly tells Hamilton things that only she can know. Also, hockey plays a dramatic element, such as his two lover in the shadow, his new wife Russo and his unbalanced lover Coke. But the movie's keys are a very long beginning and a good ending. Also a good work from a big and recognizable actor, because Belushi is very sympathetic, VERY attractive ladies are chosen, and Caine is perfectly easy for the title. It is strange that it was Belushi's second film from 1990 that dealt with the alternative way of life of wealth, found in the "Care of Business". Though they are similar, both films are at the same level of laughter. So look at this for a fun study "what if?"
