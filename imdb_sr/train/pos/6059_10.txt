This is a great documentary, full of great pictures and great stories. IMAKS cameras give you a very wide perspective, because the DVD movie is perfect. You hear all the speakers that work almost all the time, the movie is not accelerated and only gives you a natural feeling of 230mph. Of course, some sound effects have been added, but I think they are good, give depth to driving scenes ...
