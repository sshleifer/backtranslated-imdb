IMDb states from 1972 for some reason, but other sources I've seen, including great program notes, labeled it as '68. It does not matter, except that it is interesting to watch this abstract collage of movies and videos (one of the first artwork that obviously merges two) in the context of the Star Star sequencing from 2001, released the same year. Pure abstraction is not my thing, but it can be taken in small doses, and super saturated optically painted colors and psychedelic feelings of this series of flowers, Rohrschach blotches, birds, etc. They are pretty convincing and pretty pretty. He certainly helped pave the way for many other video artists in the 1970s, and deserves to be better known.
