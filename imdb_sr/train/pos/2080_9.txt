The quotation I used for my summary is about halfway through the SPIRIT COUNTRY, as the captain of the Chinese Revolutionary Army (played by Filip Ahn) apologized to the mob because he did not have time to shoot among them, as his unit was only called on the front lines. Of course, the next robber who will be revealed and filmed is the main character of the film, former kitchen slave O-Lan (whose portrait Luise Rainer, now 99-year-old, won her second consecutive best actress Oscar. The next scene tells O-Len to obey delivering his bag of looted gems to his beloved wife, the farmer Vang Lung (Paul Muni), moving this classic dichotomy of man's upward financial assistance. Mobility is a direct inversion of his moral decay. For a film dealing with the theme including Slavery, false accusations, misogyny, hunger, invasion at home, eating family pets, mental retardation, infanticide, exploited refugees, riots, civil war, massive executions, bigamy, beating children, adultery, incest and insects of biblical proportions, GOOD COUNTRIES is a heart-warming film. My thoughts about the breed are in the form of another classic quote, from O-Lana itself (while putting the noble bone of a soup that her son just admitted to stealing from an old woman in a cooking pot after her husband Wang Lung angrily threw himself on the floor on the other side of the hut: "Meat is flesh."
