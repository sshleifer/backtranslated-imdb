One of the best Three Stooges shorts ever. The spooky house full of evil guys and The Goon provokes the best people from the Detective Agency. Shemp is in top form on the famous scene in the dark. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in his role as Mr. Goodrich, the target of a plot to kill. Before it finishes, Shem's "Reliable Small Shovel" is used with great effect. This 16-minute gem moves as fast as any Stooge's short and two packs. Recommended.
