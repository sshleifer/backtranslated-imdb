This film began with a poor showing of the first few weeks. Then Meena Kumari died, and that just attracted a crowd of people. Songs on All India Radio, especially Inhi LogoN, so they often played that I was tormented at the time, despite recognizing their beauty! Yes, it took all those years. This was because marriage was very unhappy and Kamal Amrohi also had difficulty finding money for filming; Looking at gorgeous sets and costumes, it's not surprising !! Not only does Meena Kumari get old and get sick, but he hears the Latin voice carefully. Inhi logoN does not have its 50-year-old voice, while songs re-recorded as Chalo dildar chalo show a clear development. I would just like someone to find the songs of Ghulam Mohammad that were not included in the film because of a change in fashion that required less, though few songs were published by them. Lata in a recent interview (2007) rated Ghulam Mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with, except Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Pay attention to the fact that you do not see the actors at Chalo's gigantic songs at all, very unusual. There is only a short shot of Raja Kumar from a medium distance and you only see the last side of the alleged Meena Kumari. Kamal Amrohi made a virtue of necessity and focused on the stars and the moon. Any other movie, this song would have both big plans for both of them. As for the fact that this is the best movie ever, I would like to distinguish myself. This means that you missed a lot of Indian films, without special order, movies such as Barsaat (old), Devdas (older versions), Bandini, Do Bigha Zameen, Garam Hava, Dastak, Guddi, Aan, Piasa, Kagaz ke Phool, Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam, Kabulivallah, Abhimaan, Guide, Sujatha, Bombay to Babu, Daag, Parineet (old), Umrao Jaan, etc. Etc. Raat to Naia Daur, Teesri Manzil, Mahal, Aag, Jugnu, Anand, Mera Naam Joker: The list is really endless! So enjoy Pakeezah, but do not miss any of the above. .
