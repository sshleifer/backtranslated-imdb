I recall that the Legend of Zu trailer was quite impressive and that I was a fan of A Man Called Hero (my favorite at all times), the Storm Riders. I decided I had to watch this too. I know that there are many ways to critically reflect on Ekin Cheng's acting skills everywhere, but he is up to now my favorite Hong Kong moviestar (though better than Nicolas Tse) and he is one of the factors that I enjoyed in this movie. No doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. I even thought that the actors were only real and everything else was computer generated to the end of this movie. They must have invested a lot in this and deserve a great deal of merit. The story of the movie was a fairy tale between good and evil with a love story (I think Ekin Cheng easily drags girls). The story is not very intellectual and deep, but that's not what you expect when watching an action movie. I wanted to have more martial arts with fists and fists instead of battles with magical abilities, but that's a good life, and it never goes the way you want it. And why were they ultimately in the battle sounding like supersonic planes? It's too funny. The Zu legend can not be a man called Hero in my eyes, but running as a video game, and it's not a bad thing at all. If the company decides to publish games on this movie, I will not be surprised because it carries all the elements of the video game. Good work. Please make more fantastic movies like this one
