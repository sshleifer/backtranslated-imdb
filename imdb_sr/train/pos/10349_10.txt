This is one of those movies that made me want to make movies at all. Generally speaking, I am a movie lover based on valuable true stories. And this is EXCELLENT! Apart from Meril's performance, which has gained many awards and praise, the highest value of the film is the story on which it is based. The story of dancing about a couple that suffers social and legal torture after suffering a huge emotional pain due to the unexpected and brutal death of her child is actually a story that opens its eyes and expose the inhuman side of its neighbors and reveals barbarism a very sophisticated and lawful society. It's interesting to see how people who consider themselves good and intelligent people (for example, the emotional jury in the movie) are nothing more than selfish cheats that, due to their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, would close the brain to any thought and contemplation even in the light of all the facts which very clearly indicate their opinions. The other person of the so-called "civilized" society that the film exposes is apathy for the pain of other people (it is superfluous to say, this is very general, although this specific story takes place in Australia), which continues to be a real cruelty. You need to see if you are ready to take some serious and perhaps challenging thinking.
