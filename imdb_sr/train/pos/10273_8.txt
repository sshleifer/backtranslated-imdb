I am a big fan of films where people are transformed, and House of Games is almost the highlight of 'movies where people are transformed'. In short, it is an outstanding thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing you with interesting characters with many levels, and never really revealing what's happening, while throwing many revolutions and surprises to completely upset what you just saw. The film opposes the audience on several occasions, despite the fact that we know it; it's still hard to guess where it goes, and every turn is a surprise. As I mentioned, I am a big fan of films, and the plot is accompanied by a psychiatry that receives a patient with a huge debt towards a gambler. Then he goes to the gambler in an attempt to help the patient, and on his way into the art of reading people to get out of the concert. throughout the whole period, and David Mamet is well able to establish the setting of his film in the underground levels of the city. The film is well-acting, with all the interested lives and credibility to its characters with the greatest skill. Joe Mantegna plays the rogue in the heart of the film, and although his performance is a bit poor, he is always tough and convincing as a felon. Lindsay Crouse plays beside him as a psychiatrist who has hinted at his work, and is again convinced in his role. Maybe it's not the best person, but at least it can work. The way the film is made is the main star of the show, and you will no doubt be stunned on many occasions that the film is continually stunning and cheating on the viewer. Sometimes it's almost like we're in the crowd of action and people deceive us in the film. Another thing that is great in this movie is the way in which it shows the audience how to draw a certain counter, which is useful if you are interested to make twenty dollars, say. All in all, House of Games is a real ride.
