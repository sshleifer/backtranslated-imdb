I saw this independent film when I was in Philadelphia and that was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made her so ridiculous was that she was based on a true story - funny! There are also great actors in it. Mindi Sterling is in her and she is very good. I loved her in Austin Povers. Hovard Hesseman is also great. I remember him from the boss of the class. I'm tired of all the dark movies that are constantly changing. This is fun and easy, and I can watch it with my family and I will not be ashamed. I'm constantly checking to see when it will appear on a DVD. I'll definitely buy it.
