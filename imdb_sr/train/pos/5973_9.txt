This is a great, funny horror film that reflects the essence of the obsession in the middle and late 80s that the evil metal music was supposed to have been. I remember being terrified by teenagers when I was a kid. It did not help me to find a desecrated tomb in my cousin's cemetery when I was ten years old. It turned out that this weird metalworker dug some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice for satan. Perhaps things like me have discouraged metal for some time, but now I like, like a 24-year-old. , but to my surprise, she ruled. Everything is in the extreme demonic power of the metal. And you have to love the scene where the guitar fires lasers and evaporates headaches in the crowd. This movie is great, if you like metal of the 80's and bad movies, this is for you. 9/10!
