First of all, I have only one word for this film: 'wow'. This is probably one of the best movies that touched me, from the story to his performances, so beautifully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed with this last, because he really entered the depth into the character, because it was a very difficult role. However, they were created by the couple, who surprised me, from the beginning to the end, showing on the road, a friendship filled with love, which develops throughout the day, located in the film. The story takes some time to shoot, because the introduction of characters is long, but finally we are compensated by the wonderful story of love and humanity. If you have a chance, you see, because this is a movie that will keep you in the head for a long time. Simply amazing - 9/10.
