I never met a single person (out of a hundred) who hated this movie. I bet anyone who votes is a small saboteur or a victim of one. This movie has everything. Ask yourself: "Are you a lover ...?" Then go see "Laputa". It's not my favorite movie, but my favorite music is the same person (Haiao Miiazaki). In any case, this one is among the top five. And I've seen a lot of movies.
