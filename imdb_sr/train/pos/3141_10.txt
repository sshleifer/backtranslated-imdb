Let's face it: the final season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons in any show I've ever enjoyed (mostly, I never found dry spells to last for the whole season). But if you judge this show by the last season, of course it will happen as inferior. It's a totally unjust assessment - because the "70s show" in its time was a brilliant and hilarious series about the past era and how people who lived there were not so different from us in modern times. Okay ... I ignore the 8th season. Topher Grace plays Erica Forman, a teenage teenager with a constant love for Donna (Laura Prepon), a feminine girl from the neighborhood. Playing their friends, Danny Masterson (Hide), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Vilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) give fantastic performances in (almost) every episode. Fez, an exchange student who is mentally promiscuous, is the best. From which countries? Try to understand! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, like Kitty, is both impressive and sweet, as if Mrs. Brady meets Marie Baron, while Smith's Red serves mainly to scare off the circumstances of all. Don Stark and Tania Roberts play very well against one another as Donna's parents, chauvinistic but sympathetic Bob and Airplane Midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances like Leo, a stoner who acts like Father Hida. In addition to the anachronistic mistakes that appear quite often and the over-top lessons that sometimes come (and in that sad ending season), the '70s' is a great performance with an astonishing writing, heading to spot and feelings of good will pulsating through every episode. They are all good.
