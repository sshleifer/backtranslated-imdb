this film probably had a budget of $ 750 and he managed to outperform Titanic. I rented this day when I crashed my mother's car, and that was the only thing that cheered me! must be linked to 'Assult of the Killer Bimbos'. The things to look for are: 1. Drive into the blast of a Chinese girl scene 2. Blonde bleach in a shirt that never changes 3. Flinstone-screaming ride 4. An ensemble carrying a redhead right before it gets killed (do not worry, do not worry I'm ruining no surprises, because soooo is predictable) 5. A guy who considers it necessary to wander. 6. A psychic patient who plays a persuasive job to be crazy by coming out of the manicure. 7. A time sweep that involves a teacher and a priest. 8. Graffiti for writing on the bathroom wall. 9. Last, but not least, wonderful special effects - especially stinging in the chests that ... paradise helped me ... popping up noise. Enjoy! <br /> <br />
