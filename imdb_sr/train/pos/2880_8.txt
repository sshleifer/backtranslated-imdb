"Cinderella" is one of the most disneased Disney classic. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy tale by Charles Perrault, the film follows the curiosities and troubles of Cinderella, a good girl, mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally inconspicuous stepsters. When the royal ball is held and all young young women are called (read: King wants to marry a prince), Cinderella stays at home until her stepmother takes her horrible daughters with her. But there is a story about a fairy-tale ... The story of "Cinderella" itself would not be able to throw out the characteristic, so while otherwise it's true story, pretty random characters of animals that the goddess of fairy used In order to get the title character on the ball become the real assistant to the Cinderella. Mike Jake and Gus are the main assistants, and their own enemy is the cat of the stepmother Lucifer. Their nonsense is intertwined mainly with the main fairy-tale action, and are mostly beautiful. However, the film slows down a little bit between the main characters and shortly before the half-balls that go out for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really starts again and surprisingly (since "Cinderella" is the most terrible story of all time, probably) ending as one of the most intense the story of Disney. The animation and the direction of art is wonderful. All the legendary Nine Old Men animated in this picture, and Marie Blair in color and conceptual art (she worked on conceptual art and styling colors for "Alice in Wonderland", "Peter Pan", "Three Kabaleros" and many others) manage to they move on the screen. Colors and patterns are beautiful, especially in fairytales fairy tales and scenes of balls, as well as in those nice moments here and there. All in all, "Cinderella" is ranked among the best Disney fairy tales of the Story and comes recommended to young people and all that embodies Disney's philosophy that dreams can really come true.
