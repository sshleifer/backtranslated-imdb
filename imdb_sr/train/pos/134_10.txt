Someone issues this film on a DVD so that he can take his dedicated place as one of the greatest movies of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look at the so-called. most of all, and how Lars Von Trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the world film world with this masterpiece. As it stands now, "Zentrop" (or "Europa", as it is mentioned outside the United States) is one of the most fascinating and most interesting views on the gloominess and almost psychotic insecurity that spilled out of Europe after the Second World War, namely the decimated German region whose physical injuries corresponded only to the damage of the psyche of her people. Von Trier greatly displays his vision on the screen. You will feel as if you are looking at some lost classical spy nail from the late 1940s with perfectly illuminated black and white scenes, while at the same time you feel that you are on the edge of something outside the blade, especially in scenes like assassination on board. train. Literally, when you see this movie, you are witnesses of the evolution of the art form. For some reason, Von Trier has been caught up in his own Dogma movement shortly thereafter. And while his "Breaking the Vaves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are themselves classics, it is with Zentrop that he has really raised the art of film creativity to new and exciting heights. 10/10, gets fine wine, and asks for DVD release.
