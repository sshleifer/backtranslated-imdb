This cheap digital video movie has power in the right places - writing and acting. In addition, digital photography is the best one so far. In low light conditions, the characteristic video umber tone predominates, but, surprisingly, it faces film stocks for brightness, clarity and saturation in bright situations. This is a best-selling film work, with a quick dialogue in which a midnight cowboy story about how people doing everything they need to survive in urban San Francisco are going on.
