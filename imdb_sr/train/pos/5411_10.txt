I do not see the point of burying a movie like this in a sulfuric sarcasm, when in no way it was intended to be anything more than a children's entertainment vehicle and preparing for the next line of goods that it is madly praying for. /> This is a fun movie. My children sat quietly throughout the whole thing and loved each moment. The criminal, however, overestimated his ridiculous costume and maniacal laughter, but this is much easier to take from the dark, gloomy and very morbid Pokemon 3. My children have watched Pokemon since it started and soon it will be time to "put off the childish things "and move on to others. I'm glad we enjoyed this together.
