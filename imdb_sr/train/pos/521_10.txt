This is probably one of the most original love stories I've seen for centuries, especially for a war (short) movie. Basically, this is a story based on two worlds, one obviously real, the other fictitious, but the film's authors at the beginning say that it's just a coincidence that this is the right place. In any case, Peter Carter (Great David Niven) was supposed to crash on a plane, talked with Jun (Monkey Planet Kim Hunter) before he pulled out the money and said he loved her. He had to die from jumping without a parachute, but somehow survived, and now he sees and loves the junct in his body. This second place, like paradise, is unfortunate because he survived and had to come to their world, and sent French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to leave, but he is obviously in love. Peter suggests that he appeal to remain in a court of another world, and he was granted it. Apparently, love prevails when two lovers announce that they will die for each other; in June even offers to take his place! Also featured are Robert Coote as Bob Trubshave, Kathleen Biron as an Angel, a short (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as an English Pilot and Abraham Sofaer as Judge / Surgeon. David Niven was 36 on the 50 greatest British actors, the film was number 86 on the 100 greatest film films for a happy ending, was 47 on the 100 biggest movies, was 46 on the 50 largest British films, was 59 on 100 biggest movies. Outstanding!
