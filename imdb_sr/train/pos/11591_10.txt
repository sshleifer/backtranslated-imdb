I also asked to find this movie for a long time, and how great it would be to find it on DVD ... I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old, Holland. And I was very impressed with it. It was shown before Valt Disnei's JUNGLE BOOK! What I remember this movie is fragmented. I remember that an Indian was a friend of the eagle. This impressed me very much. For some reason he was thrown out of his village (he did not understand the reason for that). When other guys threw stones at him, he climbed to the rock and jumped. Then he turned into an eagle and flew with a friend of the eagle. As an eagle he still wore his turquoise necklace. CB
