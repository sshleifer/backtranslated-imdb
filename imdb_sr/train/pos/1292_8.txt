Preston Vaters, a 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and brothers, especially because of problems with money. He is crazy to have his house and his rules, because his brothers always stole his saved money, and his parents ignored his wishes. On one terrible day, Preston drove his bike; It was the same day when the story-teller, Kuiglei, tried to pull out of the police and accidentally rolled his car over Preston's bicycle. It should have been far from the police, Kuiglai in a hurry, a check to cover damages on Preston's bicycle. The problem was: it was an empty check! Preston is a clever boy and decides to have a high price on that check: $ 1 million! All this money gives Preston the things he always wanted, like a villa with a pool, lots of toys, and even a limousine! Problems start to start when the FBI and Kuiglei want to know where the money is, making Prestona in a difficult situation and facing many problems. :)
