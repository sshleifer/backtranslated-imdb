It's hard for me to criticize anything Mitzi Kaptura does. She just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. In spite of that, yes, the plot was predictable. I think maybe if Jill HAD was sleeping with Richard, maybe a little crazy than she was, which would further increase the uncertainty. It would also be nice to see Jill and her husband find out about Richard's little problem with her ex-wife, maybe a little more stories. I was a bit disappointed with the end of the film. I wish I had seen more closure with Zack's death and eventual closure with her husband. I must say that I will never be able to look at the rocket pistol and not imagine it standing there. It was a very nice place for Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! So I look forward to future projects.
