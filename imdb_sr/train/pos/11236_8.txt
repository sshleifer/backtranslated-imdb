For the record, I am not in any way connected with the production. The hidden boundary is probably a Star Trek fan club with the highest episodes so far. Over 7 seasons (this is the last one) produced about 50 episodes. It is not a venture in almost no budget and everyone volunteers their time and energy. By their own confession, the previous seasons do not have as good production qualities as they later, but as the effects are progressing, the work on the green screen and the performance improves. It was hard for me to "dove" into "so it started from the beginning and looked all the way to the end." HF benefits from the arc of the story as well as all the best sci fi fi and fits nicely into the Star Trek universe in which it is set. Characters and "cousins" from the original series are entered into stories and add a lot of storytelling, sometimes improving characters over the original. Full experience includes an excellent website, blooper reels, a high-membership forum that is visited by many actors and producers and a weekly interview. If you are looking for a high resolution production, high budget, it's probably not you. If you are looking for continuous adventures in the Star Trek universe with stories that make up Star Trek credit and seem to think, that's it.
