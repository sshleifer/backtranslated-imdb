This comic-comic movie is ridiculous, has a nice action and a great futuristic style. Writer Steven de Souza, who also wrote the Commando, gives Arniu many lines to examine: "Send me a copy" after signing a contract and sticking with a pen in lawyers; "What kind of pain in the neck", after the subzero with a barbed wire was strangled; "He had to separate" after he cut his body between his legs; and finally, while Killian breaks through the billboard carrying his face, Arnie concludes: "Now that's come to the scene." Strange enough, has some similarities in overall memory, another science-fantastic film in the main role of Schwarzenegger.
