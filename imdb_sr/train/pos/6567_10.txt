Most people (36) gave film 10, and those who did not work were too critical or maybe expecting something else. This is one of my favorite films from the '80s, growing up on you, and it's all. I just got it on DVD, and 20 years later it still does not disappoint, having a lot of action, drama, romance, and even comedy. Add to that great driving experience, automatic gunfire and lots of things that break up and have fun, the edge of your seat! You'll even be the day after you've seen this bungling or whistling the main song. You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and you will both enjoy a lot. The assumption is that it is a hero from a book of soft covers, such as Doc. Wild, really existing and helping people fight evil, in order to write a story, it's almost accurate here. Jake Speed ​​is a director, producer and writer of many films. In this film, Jake Speed ​​is a type of adventurer from Indiana Jones, usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations, but he will sometimes resort to brutal fire (iai!) Look out for his James Bond high-tech equipment, the ultimate terrain SUV the heroine is a very beautiful young love from the early vampire Jim Carey, the movie "Once Bitten" and here is a little older and still knocked out even in comparison with her teenage blond sister, I like to hate .The end is perfect and it can stand alone or call a sequel, regrettably never made it - but you can only imagine what would have happened then? <br /> <br /> You need to see this movie just because it will keep you entertained and have fun, and it's worth the ticket price.
