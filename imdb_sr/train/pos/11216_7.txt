The story is extremely unique. It's about 2 pilots who save Earth from extraterrestrial beings, but they have to use a special speed that speeds up everything around them. The whole series refers to pilots who deal with wasting time, friends and mentors. The end could be fantastic. He started to end up on the overall message and left a real trail, but instead ended up on a super happy Disnei's note and he irritated me VERY bad. The animation is responsible for 89, but it can not be compared with today's days. I also heard that many complain about chewing gum. I actually found that something was decent. The rumor was generally justified except in Episode 2 where there was a surplus. Overall, it deserves a glance, but the ending stops it from being a classic.
