This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Take me to the wheel of emotion. I laugh and cry and be disgusting, happy and in love! All this in just over two hours! The actors are brilliant! I must mention the leading actor, of course, Michael Nikurist. He does an extraordinary job! I also admire the actor playing Tore, who in this convincing way plays this mentally disturbed young man! He kind of reminded me of Leonardo di Caprios at Gilbert Grape! And there is the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's sang. I recommend this to everyone to see and enjoy!
