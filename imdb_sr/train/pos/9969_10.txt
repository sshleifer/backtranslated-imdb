Shavshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies. Great films. But nothing, and I think that nothing can satisfy the greatest Christmas movie, Santa Claus. The film is so big and there are so many messages, I cried as I watched it. Seriously, this is one of those films to be watched 10 times. When we see that Pitchu says he will have to eat ice cream, we see grief in his eyes, and we feel deep sorrow, and then we wonder ... what is so bad about this ice cream? Does this imply that we treat people as ice cream as good when it all makes us evil? A film for reflection prompts you to think. This film has the best performance of Santa Claus ever. Unlike other Santa Claus, he is a normal person. We see him locking up children and spying children's dreams, and we are wondering; Is Santa in which we truly believe? Also, this Santa Claus actually mentions Christ, the whole meaning of Christmas. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie masterpiece. We just need to stop making movies and broadcasting anything except this epic 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets 500/10. Who says this film is bad, is a foolish fool.
