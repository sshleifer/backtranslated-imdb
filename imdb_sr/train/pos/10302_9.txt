This film is the best film ever made by Jim Carrei. Carrei did not have a normal face in this movie. He was both funny and sad. Carrei played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan is guilty of God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then, God descends from heaven and gives Bruce his power. As I said earlier, Carrei did a great job. I also thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as actresses / actresses. The action was good because it had many sub-points in the main point. This movie can be fun (Bruce's dog) as well as sad ("break"). And the script worked well. I'm glad they continued this film. I estimate this movie 9/10.
