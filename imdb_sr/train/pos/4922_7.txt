I wonder what the audience thought about when she first watched Valter Jack Palance (Blackie). Surely it looks like no one else at the time, a face like a skull, a flattened nose and an elongated body - even now it remains a disturbing presence. And what might be more appropriate than his exit from those unhealthy New Orleans neighborhoods that seem to be angry Blackie is losing out on the city. I'm just sorry he did not have more scenes. The film itself is very skillfully assembled? the black humor of the morgue, the Vidmark-Douglas interaction, the non-tourist sites, the fighting amongst officials - they are all wrapped in a tense realistic thriller with a threat unlike other times. Even Vidmark's homemade scenes that place a woman (Bel Geddes) on the tent can not be too disturbing. The director of Kazan certainly shows his inclination to conquer the studio (Fok) products, regardless of how he felt about the commercial aspect. But my money is on one and only Zero Mostel. Has there ever been a beer contractor who could bite louder or be pushed more than a stupid type (eg The Enforcer, 1950). This scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with Mostel's humorous wife (Lisvood), is a gem of submissive obedience, as Mostel tries to calm everyone down as a restless pinball. It's a shame that he's lost on that black list for so many years. (I wonder if he named him who called him.) But not only professionals add color. The locals also add character and authenticity, especially the two Asians who police interviewed. This whole scene has improvised air, as if Kazan recognized their potential and made the face in the form of a small scene. And then, this colorful hall for rent with all the hands of the deck is pure inspiration. And what about those cafes that bite me from the flea and who run me to the nearest Denni. In any case, the film is still well placed, a ripple thriller with apocalyptic air that unusually suggests many of today's mega. -hits.
