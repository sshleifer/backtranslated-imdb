One of the last classics of the French New Wave. For the direction, the cineast Jean Eustache drew from the simplicity of the early-century film; For the story, Eustache used the pain of his complicated love life. So many things can be said about this film - observer brilliantly; complacently longer; occasionally hilarious; emotional drying ... etc. etc. In my opinion, all the complaints that can be brought to this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous advantages. Every student of the film, a writer, or simply anyone who is willing to deal with a three-hour film without sudden cuts, no music videos, no complications in soap operas, and no banal dialogue should be the point of watching this film. Everything should be admired: writing (concise, smart, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone, quite simply, perfect in their roles), and a simple direction (the viewer feels like a random observer inside the film) film unforgettable. This is undoubtedly a film that stays with you.
