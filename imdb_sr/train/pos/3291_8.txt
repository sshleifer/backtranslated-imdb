This is a great movie, and it's a shame that a little attention will be paid outside arthouse circles and students who stay up to two in the morning to watch it on the Four Channels. The plot is simple, but it works very efficiently, blurring between a child-like fantasy and a strong nightmare is very blurry. The budget looks quite low, but at the expense of those involved it is not displayed too often. There was not even that much. I was lucky enough to record this from the TV when I was a couple of years ago, and he spent half a dozen examinations. It's one of those films that will not appeal to everyone; though as usual, those who have more careful access to cinema would get a lot of things from this. Charlotte Buerke gives a good performance like Anna, spoiled brat and damage that seems to have gone from the acting scene. Baptism is also very good, carrying the character of its character very well in the context of the image. There are some genuine (and I'm not saying this lightly) disturbing moments in this movie, both half a second of shockers and more tension. Watch him with the lights off! Highly recommended. 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br />
