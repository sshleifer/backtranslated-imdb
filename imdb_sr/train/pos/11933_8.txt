I think this is a wonderful family movie. There are many hilarious scenes and moments that warm the heart during the film. The actors are brilliant and the effects are well performed. Danny Glover plays George Knock who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great during the entire film. Fantastic are young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is as good as Al 'Angel, and the effects are great in this top-notch Disney movie. Touch a movie that heats the heart and everyone should enjoy.
