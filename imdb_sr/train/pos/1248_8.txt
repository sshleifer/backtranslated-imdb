"The Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film from his megamix "Beverly Hills Cop". And although it's not as good as "Cop", it's a fun comedy adventure. Murphi plays the inventor of lost children who are given the most unusual case. His task: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This film could have been titled "Beverly Hills Police Officer and the Temple of Destruction," because parts of this film play as Spielberg's adventure, as a comedy by Indiana Jones. He has a comedy of laughter and an adventure with special effects. A lot of fun. *** (out of four)
