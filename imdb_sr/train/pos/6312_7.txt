Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his directing debut "Confessions of the Dangerous Mind", they performed together in this film. George Cloonei was involved in this film as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. In potential, this also seems like a funny and fun project, which is in line with movie remakes such as "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but somehow this film is just halved, or at least not As it is could be good. Films his characters play some well-known actors, but the shame is that characters do not actually get enough room for development. Though they could turn into funny and appealing characters in their potential, now they are only mildly entertaining characters, mostly because of some strange sequences that are in the movie. The fact that they play does not change much on this, although they prevent their characters from becoming totally boring or perhaps even boring, or anything similar. It is natural. for writing that characters are not used to full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than this movie. The film rely too heavily on its simple story and the predictable way of telling the story. Still, the movie is simply still very fun to watch for perhaps the same simplicity. It's an innocent little movie, in which you just do not have to worry much about the story. In this sense, "Velcome to Collinvood" is still a film that works well and serves the purpose. It's a movie that you will not regret when you finish it, but it's also a movie that you can really easily watch without. 7/10
