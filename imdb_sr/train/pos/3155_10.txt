I'd like to get the show back on TV. It was the biggest show ever! They should make episodes between the other episodes, but of course that would be confusing. But I want to come back and make more episodes. Please come back ... The show was absolutely hilarious. You could not laugh without seeing the episode. Every episode has a really funny piece, and the show was much better when Hide and Jackie went out with each other. These were the best episodes. "That show from the 70s is the best" .... It will be and will always be the best shov ever. It was really sad when the show ended. They need to make new episodes.
