With this film, which is the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood is not only starring, but also producing and directing, you know that it must be good. Although some say The Enforcer is the best in the series, I totally disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only ones that deserve to be in the series. Although The Enforcer is a fine movie with a couple of good action sequences, it does not get a dirty and persistent influence with the other three films. This film records all the excitement that Clint Eastwood's movie is doing, and there are also quotes that make Dirty Harry a good one. In Diri Harri it's ".. Are you, punk?"; in the Magnum Force "The man must know his limitations"; and it's "Go ahead. Make me a day." Also, in this movie, it's nice to see a landscape change, since you are tired of seeing the same old San Francisco Street in other films in the series. With the great acting of Clint Eastwood and Sandra Locke, and good director Clint, this, in my opinion, is the best Dirty Harry ever.
