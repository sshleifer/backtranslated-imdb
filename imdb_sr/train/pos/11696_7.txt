"Thief in the Night" is a movie that was largely ignored by film fans because of the low budget (which was obvious) and its themes - the enthusiasm of a true Christian church and the fate of those who remained. Nevertheless, it was a story that attracted the viewer and definitely led him to review his relationship with Jesus Christ. She touched everything - even showing the pastor who preached the Word, but did not believe it, knowing exactly why it was left. This film, and its sequel "Distant Thunder," must watch movies. Even when the new "Left Behind" series comes out, telling the same story with a much larger budget, the impact is still the same - "The Thief In The Night" broke the genre of this genre and will always be remembered.
