The girl is like cooking your grandmother: the same old recipe you tried a million times before, but somehow turned into something fresh and new. Try and explain the story to people who have not seen it before: young women on the wrong side try to improve her situation by fighting for boxing as they fight with a harsh, obstructive father and growing attraction to a male rival. Watch them watch a series of clichés, and they're right: it's a cliché. Nevertheless, I was hypnotized how well this film works, due to often superior acting and dialogue, and the sensitive direction that makes it "new". I avoided this in the cinema because it looked like a complete shit, but I'm not making the same mistake as me. It's definitely worth a look.
