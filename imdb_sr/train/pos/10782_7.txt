Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. There are no problems with naked dancers, but when women begin to have sex with men, then it loses. He believes that when women really have sex, it means losing the feeling of "innocence" and / or "beauty". So, he walked to the Hollywood hills that lure the couples to conduct love at a distance, eventually firing at dead people with a powerful rifle with a range. activities over and over again. The "story" appears as something later. This will surely make many happy heterosexual men happy because we are treated by sufficiently long-lasting naked scenes (ladies look pretty good without clothes) and sex serves as the main dose of titration. Of course, looking right at it through the scope significantly increases the scarcity factor and illustrates coercion to voyeurism. (One thing, Mike watches the couples through the range in a few minutes at the same time before he finally pulls the trigger.) All this is accentuated by an awfully intrusive, though somewhat atmospheric music on the sound surface. Those with preference for suspicious garbage will have to enjoy at this or that degree. It even includes one lesbian story that confuses Mike and makes it uncertain * how to * react. It takes place very slowly, but ends with the most funny ironic twist. It's silly and entangled rarity that, if nothing else, will surely not keep some viewers glued to the screen. 7/10
