The story was pretty interesting, but the characters were pretty flat and sometimes extreme in their thoughts / behaviors. Extreme than necessary. Also, I think something went wrong in casting. John Turtorro does not really like me playing a semi-autistic chess player, not to speak about an Italian player. The motives were not very strong. <br /> <br />
