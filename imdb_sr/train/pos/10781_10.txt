Road Rovers was a great idea of ​​dog superheroes that the Master chose to fight crime around the world. The show was the least funny. Simple and complex jokes that can attract all ages. Run jokes during a series that could cause a drinking game. The action was enchanting and smartly placed. The characters were very original, each with a different personality. But what led me to enjoy the show was the depth of the characters. Each of them has struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed, but are implied in the subtext. I hope one day there will be ways for the rovers to look back at the action.
