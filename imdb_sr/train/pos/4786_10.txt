Straight Story is a story about an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state border. He decided to make way on his mower because he could not ride and wanted to make a split. The film beautifully describes his journey and the lives he touches. Richard Farnsvorth turns into a beautiful performance as well as the rest of the actors, especially Sissi Spacek in a costly performance as his daughter, and Harri Dean Stanton in a small but endlessly important role. First I felt that the story of an old trip around the country would be boring, but I soon discovered that Linch with all the insights into human life made this film that I would recommend to everyone.
