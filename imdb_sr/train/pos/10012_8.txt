A night listener is probably not one of the best Villiam's roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat strange but very different film. I can guarantee that you have never seen this type of film before. Some people may not like the slow pace of this movie, but I think it's a big plus movie. It's definitely one of the best movies that came out in 2006. He has an intriguing performance in a film with great content, a dramatic feeling. This is not an American movie. Nor is this a predictable movie. You just feel it's a movie that has secrets that you find it hard to figure out what their outcome is. This is not a great movie that has everything, but hell, it's a damn good and very original movie.
