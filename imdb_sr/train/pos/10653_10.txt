I know it's modern to hate this movie now. I've seen hundreds of affair movies including the original Haunting of 1963 as well as most Hammer films. This film is not abstained and does not stop at all, which is probably the reason why many modern viewers did not like it. However, many viewers can accept beyond control films such as Scream because knife killers are easier to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. This film had many great scenes, and the acting and special effects were great. Now I saw him 15 times and every time he was better. The director of this film made a number of interesting and stylish films and did not strive for the type of realism of the sixth sense. Haunting is let out and certainly not boring. Perhaps this film could have more attracted John Carpenter fans, but more traditional structure of the plot. Old Haunting was also a good 1963 movie. It was even more scary. You see both, like The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
