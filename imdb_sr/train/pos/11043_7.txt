Malefici has a lot of spectators from start to finish with their nervous atmosphere. Almost the entire film is set in a prison cell that revolves around 4 characters, of which the transvestite Marcus and his little retarded boy are by far the strangest. Soon, prisoners find a diary of the previous prisoner behind a brick that deals with his obsession with occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell. From here everything is about discovering the secret of the book and its spells to escape from prison. This leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into an unknown light. I honestly think the story is pretty bad, and the final turn is nice, but for me the ends are rather loosely connected. In any case, I was thrilled to the last moment, because the atmosphere of the film is unique with minimal settings and acting roles. The murders are crude and spooky ... they are not taken worse to cool your spine, and occult topics are also well done and reminded me of hellish issues in Hellraiser. Malefic has a claustrophobic and cold, dirty feeling with a greenish shade. Sometimes you wonder if the real or occult world is shown here by a stranger ... when a retarded boy loses his fingers and is lazy to sleep on a Marcus breast, it looks normal, so strange are the light gates of freedom? With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and cools the viewer in a completely different way from most of the genre-singer. I just want the story to lead to a more consistent finale. Several elements such as a visitor with a camera, other prisoners obsessed with books and dolls of toys that vaguely point to the end do not fit into the story. In any case, I will keep my eyes open for other films by director Valetta, although his departure is to see the Hollywood remake of "One Missed Call" that has already been exhausted and useless already in the Miike version.
