Only once I saw IPHIGENIA, almost 30 years ago, but has been hunting me since then. One sequence specifically stays in mind, and could have been made by a great director, such as Michael Cacoianis undoubtedly. Context: the weight of history and the mighty army and fleet lie on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. The act of sacrilege has driven the sea, endangering his great expedition to Troy. He was told that he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia Apollo to get the wind for the sails of a thousand ships. He initially resisted, but crashes, and deceives his wife Clitemenstra to bring their daughter to a Greek camp to marry the greatest of all warriors, Achilles. sacrificing and raging gods for protection and revenge. In the meantime, proud Achilles reveal that his name was used in this false, dishonest way. He climbs the hill and tells Iphigenia she will protect her. Video: The camera circles around two young people, not looking directly at each other. They are complaining about their fate and the weakness of people who cheat their loved ones and lust for war. Suddenly, they look at each other and for a moment we feel their strength and beauty, and the uncertainty - except for the camera - the irony that at some other time, somewhere else, they can love and marry. It's a harsh and sad epiphany that only lasts for a moment. <br /> In which direction! What a camera! Vhat storitelling!
