Keeping her man is found by Jean Harlow, a Brooklyn working class girlfriend who falls on Clark Gable and gets all kinds of trouble. The film begins as his film, but by the time it's over, the accent definitely shifts to her character. cops. While chasing him into Gable's corners in Harlow's apartment and what a charming guy he is, he protects him. Soon she was in touch with him and unfortunately with her rackets. Gable, Harlow and Owen are trying to pull the badger's play on drunk Paul Hurst, but then Gable will not go through it. Of course, when Hurst realized that he was a cheater, he was still sick and became belligerent, and Gable must hit him. But then he approaches the dead in front of Harlow's apartment and this platinum blue hair makes it easy to identify. She goes to the accomplice in the murder. The rest of the film is her and her adaptation to prison life. Her interaction with other inmates gives her some very good scenes. I think some of the materials were later used for MGM classic Caged. Harlover can also make the title track and it is done as a ballade in the style of torches, very popular even at that time. Sophie Tucker's story / sounds pretty good. Gable is well ejected as a man who develops a conscience, a part that will often play, especially in my favorite Gable film, Honky Tonk. Still, Harlow is shining in this film. I think that this is one of the best things she did at MGM, her fans should not miss her.
