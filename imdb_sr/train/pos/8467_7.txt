I liked this film because it essentially did more with less. It may have been more interesting to keep him even more in the studio (although some elements of the action would have been more difficult to develop). The guy who played DJ has done a good job. to show someone who was tormented by memories. His dialogue with the callers was also quite funny. While parts of the movie can be seen as reaching miles away, other parts you do not expect will turn out to be the way they happened. I thought this was a fairly minimal story about ghosts, mostly concentrated on the living side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes have been pretty well done while everything has been discovered. While the film was shorter, there was quite a time to talk a story. It would be more and started to pull.
