This is a surprisingly above average slasher, it's nice and well made, with some decent up !. All the characters are decent, and the story is pretty fun, and Molly Ringwald is very well play a boring bitch. I bought it in a pawn shop for $ 1, and it was amazing worth it, and the special effects were pretty good for the budget, plus I liked the mask he wore killer, because it was a bit creepy. The finale was really cool, because I loved how they beat the killer, and the end was predictable and was very fun, plus all the characters except Ringwald were surprisingly pretty cute! This is done decently and written, and I thought it is a very creative and original, and that some of the death scenes were very impressive. This murderer did not crawl, and I loved him, and Slasher lovers (like me) would really need to enjoy this movie, plus the opening was really mean, they shot a movie with them! This is surprisingly above the average slasher, this is a pleasant and well made, with some decent roof, and I say it's worth the watch! The direction is good. Kimble Rendall works well! work here with a solid work with the camera, using the eerie setting, good corners and keeping the film at a speed that is fast moving. The acting is solid! Molly Ringwald played the bitch very well, and I had a problem with regret for her, after everything she was supposed to be a heroine, she turned out better at the end, but not much, I was surprised that she decided to do this film, but she did a great job! . Frank Roberts is fantastic as a murderer, he is threatening, scary and had a hell of a mask, and this guy is not messing around, it was fantastic! Kilie Minogue plays a very good house in her small role. Jessica Napier is cute and acts well like another heroine. Other actors are fine. Overall the clock is worth it! *** from 5
