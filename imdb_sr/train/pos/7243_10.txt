A great Russian emigrant designed the Stanislavski system to win the contract bridge - which makes him his beautiful wife GRAND SLAM Sveethearts of America. fine production values ​​and excellent acting in the status of a very good comedy. A few unexpected touches are cast in order to attract the attention of the viewer - the way in which the acting principle is introduced as faces on deck cards; introducing an unusual acrobat into a plot for no other reason than enjoying the craziness; and the way a wide array of different types of Americans appeared to be overwhelmed by listening to the broadcast of the final game. Paul Lukas and Loretta Ioung work very well as the Sveethearts Bridge - Lucas is kind and sophisticated and Miss Ioung loves lovely and beautiful (even if the script holds that she has too much to drink cigarettes). It's fun to watch, even when their behavior is not always the most credible or tempting. Frank McHugh gives another good performance as a tirelessly delighted ghost writer who adores Miss Ioung. Divan Glenda Farrell avoids her usual personality in a minor role as McHugh ditsi gal pal. Roscoe Karns manages a dialogue that speaks rapidly as a drunken radio speaker. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is wonderful as a snobber bridges expert. Film guests will recognize Devey Robinson as a protector of night clubs; Emma Dunn as a repellent sister of a reporter; Paul Porcasi as the owner of the Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as the cybier at the last bridge game - everything was unrecognizable. The film takes advantage of the contract bridge that has affected the country since its development in the twenties. He expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacy of the game and does not try to explain anything to the ignorant.
