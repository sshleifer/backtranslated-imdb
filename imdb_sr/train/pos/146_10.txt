I came to the end of this and I almost yelled: "No, no, no, no! It can not be over here! There are too many unanswered questions! Engaging a dishwasher? Mona's disappearance? Helmer's coming? Zombie? The little brother saved his father? What about the head? ARGH !! Then I read that at least two actors have passed and I have to say, I know that this would probably not be true for the vision of Lars von Trier, but I would like to look at the past actors of the replacement just to see the end that he had planned! It would, however, be difficult to find someone who would play Helmer, as this character deserves. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I just need to see a self-confident, unconscious, self-righteous person on the screen! But, I could overlook the change in actors .... I just have to know how it ends!
