"COSBI" is, in my opinion, the unavoidable hit of CBS! I'm not sure I've never seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I really loved a song. If you ask me, although I liked everyone, it would be nice Madeline Kahn not to die during the race. Since that happened, I always wondered what a shov. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, costumes were well designed, and writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can now be seen on TBS, I strongly recommend that you catch it in the event that it is forever disappearing from the air
