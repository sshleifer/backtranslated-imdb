It started slow after an excellent animated introduction, because the director had a lot of characters and school settings. However, when the bet is on, the film picks up the pace as a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can eat up to 19 hours. We had a good opportunity on our way home to talk about some things with our son: by bullying, by helping others, by the mind of things when you do not want to do something. played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director snaps her unexpectedly, and when she is enchanting on the screen. She is one of those "Hey, she looks familiar" face, and then I remembered that she was a little girl Pepsi showed about eight years ago. She was in "Paulie," a parrot movie trying to find her way home. Eisenberg had many TV and film appearances in '99 -00, but then he was not seen much in the next few years. She is now 14 and she is growing up to be a beautiful woman. Her smile really warmed up the screen. If she can get some good roles, she could have a good career (or better?) From Haley Joel Osment, another trilingual actor, but we hope for some of the problems Osment has had lately. Anivhozitz, according to my 8th and Son, who just finished reading the story, the film did not follow the book well, but it was still fun. The end of the movie looked like a big setting for some sequels (How to eat boiled tubes? Escargot Kid's Style?), Which may not be that bad thing. It was nice to take the family into a movie and do not have to worry about language, violence or sexual scenes. Another good aspect of the film was the respect / fear that was caused by the main Mr. Burdock (Boilerplate). Films today tend to display adult authoritative figures like shields. While he has one special scene, he has ruled the school with a firm hand. It was nice to see Andrea Martin working at work.
