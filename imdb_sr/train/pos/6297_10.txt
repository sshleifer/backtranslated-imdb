My friends and I just talked about how frustrated we are about the way movies are made and especially romantic comedies. We feel insulted because Hollivood is serving these days as they behave as if everything is good. Well, everything is not good ... with the exception of several bright spots, such as this movie. There are no big names of actors, a big budget, I do not think it had a great edition (I rented it from Hollywood Video), but it did not have anything most of the big budget romantic comedies have. But that's what lacks the majority. She had great chemistry between love interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastvood). Their love story was not imposed on us like many. The director took the time to let these characters get to know each other. Their story reminded me of one of my favorite "Tootsie". Supporting an actor has added not only really funny comic moments, but also the depth of the story. The character of James LeGros was absolutely priceless. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with colleagues in Psychic phone line was very fun. I laughed, I cried, I remembered how you feel in love.
