I enjoyed this movie. I'm firmly convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the comic genius of our time. They have the incredible ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and turn it into a funny but realistic ... if that makes sense. This is mostly what makes South Park so ridiculous. Once you go through the fact that this is probably the most vulgar and indistinct cartoon ever, in each episode you see the message being transmitted. This is obvious in BASEketball. Although directed by David Zuker and is completely exhausted, he has a sincere message about corporate America and the shame that is the main sport. I am also a fan of sports, so this movie sometimes looks hilarious, because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love. The introductory prologue is brilliant ... every time I see those soccer players starting Riverdance! Some may not like this movie because it's not everybody's tea ... but, just like South Park, when you look at the past of the absurd ... it has a really real message that is transmitted through a literal comic. I gave this film 8 out of 10 stars.
