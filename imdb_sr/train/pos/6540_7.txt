To be honest, I had to watch the movie back, I did not expect so much, but hey, I was not cheated, I had a good time. I would say that this film is a fresh breeze, despite some facts that they tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but it made me remember these 60-70s youth films from Europe and Quebec, where Children succeed in interacting with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tries to fulfill justice by trying to solve the mystery about the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. In any case, as her father was at Hollywood, why not rent a house with a mystery behind the door? Well, at least Emma Roberts is doing a great job here. Something like a fat child, who first naively brought to support Nancy's sister joke, but eventually she found Nancy cool enough to stick with her, even with her stuff ... The rest of the support was great , and he was happy that Rachael Leigh Cook had a different role this time: a single mother (she did it at Family Rescue, but this time she plays a mature woman ...) Anyway, do not leave this, it's fun!
