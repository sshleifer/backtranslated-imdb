This film is correct. As a former USAF Air Cadet, I can tell you that this movie has everything. Ignore the application process. Waiting for a word. The joy of acceptance. Take care of the course. The grief of seeing your friends (perhaps the best ones) is washed out. The pain in paying the final price - the death of flotated student aviators. Slava mature. Always flying, flying, flying. Many are called, but few are chosen. We paid what we would gladly pay for.
