I bought, "The Feast of All Saints," and it's not really a horrible movie, but much could have been better. It had a lot of historical value, played by very talented actors / actors, and it is not a daily occurrence that actors can play such a role and that it is somewhat convincing. There were some parts that were a little bit central and confusing, but I would not say that the entire movie was horrible. Once you think about it, catch Nev Orleans 1800, and do something about it, it's pretty hard and harder to get actors who can strongly tag those parts. But the only major problem I had with the movie was that most of the actors playing colored free people were mainly Africans of light skin, not very universal in throwing others who were not bright; one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exists. Whichever the casting could choose wider variety when it comes to the nuance, despite many creams, they are aware of the colors. I could have better writing, and all in all, I discovered that the performances were very convincing.
