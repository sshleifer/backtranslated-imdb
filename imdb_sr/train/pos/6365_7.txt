This highly-engineered movie will be fun for many who have not seen some of the unknown anime films. I enjoyed the most, especially after fairly straight opening hours in the museum (although the order of the pre-title is very fun and includes some of the better parts of the animation). James Garner as Commander and Leonard Nimoi as King gives impressive performance.
