With this we have great expectations. . . because Zombie 3 is the official sequel to Zombie 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . However. . . co-directed by Bruno Mattei (from Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti, but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of Zombies) and his recording in Phillimines as Night of the Zombies and similar to Night of the Zombies living dead. The result is more like the follower of the Hell of the Dead, than Zombie 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis, who produced Zombie 2 and his editor Tomassi (?) and efk gianetto De Rossi, gave Zombi 2 their magic. . . Zombie 3 is not magical. . . It's like a peanut butter and peanut butter jellie. But over the years I accepted Zombie 3. I could swear I saw the version in which a soldier was struck by the hand and went to the hotel room. . . it was pointless Fulci-cut and Mattei / Fulci-cut is the one on DVD.
