This reconstruction of the notorious killings of 1959 in Kansas, based on Capote's book, was shot by Brooks and a black and white camera room, giving it a documentary picture. Good performances from Blake and Wilson as killers and Forsythe as a cop who follows them. The scenes that led to the killings, recorded at the very house where the crime occurred, with the sound of the whistle of the wind, are quite intense and cold. Bruce directs with a lot of words and uses several interesting passages between the scenes. The only complaint is that it is a bit overdone, with a drawdown drawn and somewhat distrustful.
