From the rainy, dreary, late winter of England in the early 1920s ... --- where there are still sorrows and many young widows and disabled veterinarians from the great massacre of men and murderers of their feminine dreams - now known as the First World War ... Four women share this beautiful little sunny Italian castle on the hill; a young widow who drowns in a crazy party, two women who will rediscover their husbands, and a fourth woman tired of their well-known dead friends ... ... These four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to receive a spiritual "transformation" for a great April holiday in Italy in the early 1920s. NOTE for future filmmakers. Study this film about how mood and beauty can tell the story. (Probably not a movie that would satisfy many men ...) NOTE: Prepare for coffee and hot chocolate and invite girls to some gloomy, winter day ... Spring is coming ... Enchanted April promises you!
