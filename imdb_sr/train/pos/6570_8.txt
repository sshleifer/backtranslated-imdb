This film is a harmless escapist party. Missing something is the recent Tomb Raider movie. I can not wait to get a DVD. How can people give this low grade and continue to go and see Titanic without guilt conscience I do not know. Anything with Karen Copins in the underwear must evaluate one or two extra points!
