What a classic British movie! It was about time. And a comedy for separation from the side! Everyone who seeks to win some freedom from his youth, this travel movie will prove the ticket. It's a combination between "nails" and "I" and "Easi Rider." The film works at a solid pace and does not let you go too long ... Sometimes there are reflective moments, but I think they are well justified and Initially, I was a little concerned about the character of Fil Daniels, but fortunately he won halfway in one of the funniest scenes of the whole movie! In general I found myself in my belly laughing through a movie that most likely bored some people around me. Oh vell. I would recommend it well. This will become a home tna British comedy. Well worth a visit.
