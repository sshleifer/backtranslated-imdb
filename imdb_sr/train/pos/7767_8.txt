Stack was supposed to get an Oscar for this performance, a period. It's a crime that is not. It's amazing how humanized a rich, worthless character. Dorothy Malone earned a well-earned academic prize for her performance. Actually, all the actors in this movie are great. The plot starts with a taxi ride, then a plane ride, and then an emotional ride continues which will keep you in the interest. You'll be entertained! However, this is just an obvious soap opera. One-dimensional, 100% softer. You can call it an ultimate co-operative, because the acting is thoroughly triumphant over the material. He was great acting, directed, but strictly within his soap genre. I would not call it a melodrama (such as "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). Although it does not deny the great fun of this movie, you can only imagine what this talented actor has achieved and the director has achieved with more important topics.
