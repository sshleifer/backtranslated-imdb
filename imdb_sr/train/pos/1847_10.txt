Whatever you become in your life, you must never forget that you have the roots. This is a story about the true facts that are made in a beautiful and moving movie! I dare say that this film is well underrated. This shows us the reality of life ... the more evil you surround, the better person you become. ... no offense, no life "under a stone". The concept of film is more interesting ... linking storytelling to real life events ... keeping us aware of everything ... from facts to emotion! Bless these people and make everything happy! You see, I recommend it to all young people. It's not about racism, but about how to live your life!
