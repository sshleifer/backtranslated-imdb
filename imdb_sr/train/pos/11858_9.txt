this movie is great. if you have a chance to see him, then you should go to see him. Although the film has nothing to do with the original 1932, Pacino works perfectly with Tony Montana. Pacino has such a road with him where he can say anything and sounds great. if you thought Pulp Fiction was good with curses (if you saw it) then you should also see Scarface to see the other angle in how the actor can pronounce it. (pretty sweet) Although the movie has lots of action and the action moves very quickly over time, not keeping the right relationship in real time, it's easy to follow, but you have to keep your eyes peeled at any moment Do not lose anything. Personally, I discovered that watching this movie is three hours as if it's a breeze, it's really so great. you forget that this movie was shot in the fucking 80s, but that makes you the real root for the bad guy ... "Well, say good night to a bad guy"
