This is the first Michael Vartan movie I've seen - I did not see Alias ​​- and I was curious to see if a guy could act. She is sure she can be nice in this movie. usually in more physical and action roles, so I found it very good and sympathetic in this diverse "sweet" role of the teacher. Some of the negative comments I've read are true, the movie is full of cliches, and the story does not sound true at all. Also, although every character in the movie notes how well they look together, I do not think there is any chemistry screen there. However, I enjoyed this film. The stores are good, the characters are nice and good, and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you expect to see a great romance, that's not it. But if you want to see a nice, innocent movie with good looks and nice characters, it's very good.
