All that a music comedy should be. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) does not miss a step, and Frank Sinatra (like Clarence Doolittle) does not miss a message. The scenes with them together are very good, showing how much talent can contribute to something unevenly complicated. Sinatrin "I'm falling in love too easily" is an indication of his best and best future. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" with a young Mexican girl is wonderful. Kelly certainly earned his nomination for the best actor. And there he stared at the real ridiculous lines, like: "Do you think the navy is taking the doping?"; "Do you think someone is singing a sailor to sleep?"; And, "We got into a little trouble, we picked up a little kid." A completely pleasant film, just a thing to dust off the recently completed World War II.
