I could not keep commenting after reading a very short "Not bad" comment. This film is much better than just bad. The act is starred, even from children in the acting team, who do not play sweet or anything else, but act as friends of my son. The film is smart and expects the audience to be fine. The lines of double flashes of stories are imaginative and contribute to the story, but do not act as a filling of time. I watched this movie with my children and then I looked at him again a few days later. If you have children and are sick of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with your syrup sweetness, then look at the "Rupe". My six-year-old enjoyed that as much as my 11-year-old, and my husband and I enjoyed as many as the two of them. How many movies can you say about it?
