This film is incredible. The action was just ... wow. I was very surprised by Gackt and Hill's performance, after growing up in the American world of actors who can not sing and singers who can not act. In this film, young Sho (Gackt) encounters a vampire, Kei (Hide). Over time, they form an incredible friendship. Kei suffers because he is forced to live from the other half-lives of a vampire. It's a sad movie, but not gloomy. The plot was very unique and contrary to your typical vampire swing. The story was thick with reversals and very attractive. The only mistake I would say that the film had, despite the lack of a happy - though peaceful ending - would be a multiple language. I had a version (without glare) (I'm happy to realize that all this is kept by some cantons), so I would recommend that something be done with subtitles. All in all, the film was great.
