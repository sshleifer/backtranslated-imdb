Once you go past the title of the movie, "Pecker" is a great movie, perhaps one of the best John Vaters. A wonderful actor, led by the powerful performances of Edward Furlong and Christine Ricci, makes the story very entertaining and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children, but they are there for a specific purpose. Unfortunately, this film was not produced serially, and most people will be denied the opportunity to look at it. If the opportunity is broken, then go to see this movie.
