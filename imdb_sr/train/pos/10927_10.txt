This is one of my favorite kung-fu films and is considered one of the most popular Shav Brothers from the late 70's. The action is interesting and weird, the characters are cool with each style - frog, snake, lizard, etc. displaying different characters. I recommend this film to those who think that all Shav Brothers films are especially Chen Cheh the same, most of his films usually focus on 10 tigers and the conflict between Shaolin and Manchu. This film is a breath of fresh air in comparison.
