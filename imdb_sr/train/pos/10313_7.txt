China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cinthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This production of the Golden Harvest was led by veteran director Robert Kluz. Unfortunately, he was lucky with Enter the Dragon or lost his touch, because he is not as good as a director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the combat skills of Mrs. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this film was directed by Corei Iuen or Hoi Meng, it could be a classic action work, not a stupid action movie directly into the video. She has problems with the local mafia and needs her help. Thus, she returns home and returns the order (with the help of two people). But will it be enough to bring down Mister Big and his evil idols? If you are a great fan of Cinthia Rothrock, then this film is ready for you. I only enjoyed the fighting scenes, everything else is garbage. Why did Raimond Chov not drop out a few shekels and hire a director for cutting-edge action? Recommended.
