Robert Mitchum plays Clint Tollinger in this short, but firm west: A man with a pistol. Tollinger is a professional city crook - as in when the city needs someone to save; he is the one who is brought to do it. The latest appearance of Tollinger comes as an accident: walking into the city seeking his former throw, he stumbles into a town that plays as a doll by a local Western gangster. However, many residents of the city are starting to hate the day they hired Tollinger, as his way of cleaning the city becomes very taxing (suddenly the High Plains Drifter seems less original). A man with a pistol begins as an average Western movie, but he starts to surprise you more and more as the movie progresses. What starts as unforgettable and ends dark and turning to character. The whole film is very well recorded, and the actors are very pleasant. Mitchum is his usual great feature here at Man Vith The Gun - not one of his best performances, Mitchum still has his classical and effective presence on a powerful screen at high speed, and he breaks action, meaningful and shocking scenes. movie from the park. The man with the gun is a beautiful Mitchum western and is worth the time.
