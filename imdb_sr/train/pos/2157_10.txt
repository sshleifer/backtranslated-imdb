Okay. As you can see, this is one of my favorites, if not your favorite movies. This is a character drama that is absolutely hilarious. The main character is a businessman who is stuck in the "same thing, different day" mentality. He saw a woman who looks melancholically from the dance studio window from her train every day and asks for her and decides to find out more about her. She decides to join the dance class just to find out she is not an instructor. From there she connects with four more dancers and teaches her to enjoy dancing, as well as to find out about a mysterious woman. There is no free (or any) sex that is involved, just as a small group of people learn how to form and develop friendships. This film has been transformed with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and a new, while appealing is not anywhere as comfortable as the original. The film in America was never great because he had no right to Oscar since he was broadcast on television in Japan (films can not be released on television or are disqualified for nominations for the Oscars). He has won numerous awards in Japan for best film, actor, director, etc. For their Oscars Awards.
