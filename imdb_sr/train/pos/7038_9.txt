"The first war, which is 100% externally." Day Ackroyd's line says everything. It's hard to describe a movie; comedy, satire, action, screw. He reminded himself once or twice for Dr. Strangelove, especially on the scene with Ben Kingsley (which, I think, was an extraordinary job). I did not have any special expectations from this film, although I am a big fan of John Cousack, so I let the film wash around me. And as a result, I was pretty amusing. Political satire is painfully accurate and fairly condemned for the US military-business complex. The sub-plans were somewhat predictable, but the last intertwining of the stories made them worthwhile. I can understand why this film was not very popular in the US, but for the rest of the world, it's a timely story.
