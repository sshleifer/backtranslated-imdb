I loved this great movie. Farrah Favcett played the role phenomenally and with a good heart. She plays a woman who has been brought to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after being attacked by an unknown person. After the police dismissed her, she realized that she was alone. One day, when alone at home, a foreigner enters her home and again attacks. He does not intend to call the police or to take him out, she is forced to spray him in the eyes and close in the fireplace. I think there is a need for a call to awaken the law of land. They're too easy for these criminals. It's time for stiff fines.
