While talking about a problematic kid turning to a box for self-esteem and managing anger, it's barely a new thing, the story got a new turn when the protagonist is a girl, not a boy. Diana has problems in school. Simply can not get away from the fight. At home, her father is constantly exposed. Her brother trains boxing in the gym and one day when she picks up she decides she wants to train. It would be easy to call this movie "Ricks With Girls". But that's not what it's all about. The story actually benefits a lot from the main character who is a girl, not a boy. This way you can solve multiple problems at once. First, the problem is not accepted, because she is not a girl, and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she is a girl at all. It is also a story about how the purpose can change one's life. How positive things can grow you. I do not want to sound pretentious, because the film does not feel pretentious at all, but what I'm saying is true. Also, Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the lead. It's a shame that she's stuck in "rude" types now, because that's not what her part is in "Girlfight." She is surely a female boxer, but it's a much more sensitive moment that really gives her a shine. Perhaps this is basically your average story with a loss, but that's Rodriguez's rise above the masses. performance. I estimate this 7/10.
