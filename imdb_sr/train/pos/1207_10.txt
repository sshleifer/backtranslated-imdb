I still love him 17 years after I first saw him, I actually discovered that I lost my copy and I was very upset. Despite being unrelated to the original (which as a child I have never noticed and as an adult, I do not care), that's what cartoons should * be. Just dark enough to be interesting enough and easy enough for everyone to enjoy. I am more than happy that my parents raised me to such things, not the cartoons that we see today and who do not give anything to the students. The music is great, and you will get stuck in your head forever ... At one point I took the whole music.
