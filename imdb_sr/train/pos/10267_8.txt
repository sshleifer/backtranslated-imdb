Much is written about Mamet's "House of Games"; the majority is good. I decided to look at the movie again to see how he stayed after 17 years and I was surprised how much I enjoyed watching him again. The success and durability of the film probably has much to do with the two main ingredients that are always fun on the movie; good story and good scam. Mamet is able to incorporate his signature curiosity and apparent histrionics into his film, while simultaneously accompanying us, the audience and the sign. Then he explains the art of speaking only to do it again, etc. As long as he builds a story. "The House of Games", now a freebie on the cable, is worth a look at the first timers and a good reprieve for fans of Mamet. (B +)
