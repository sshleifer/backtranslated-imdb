The truth, the idea for this TV series may have come from the huge success that Ally McBeal enjoys around the world, even here in Germany. However, this is said, Edel & Starck is very different from Allie McBeal in many ways. The two main characters work beautifully together. Felik Edel (Felik Noble), performed by the famous German actor, Christoph M. Ohr and Sandra Starck (Noble & Strong, get it ???), played by charming Rebecca Immanuel, exchanges fast-paced romantic partners and are constantly spying on each other in criminal cases in Berlin and the surrounding area. In addition, they are assisted by the magnificent acting of co-actors, especially their secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, who is a rare gem with extraordinary potential. Also, the sensitive car dealer, Otto and the noble friend Felika, Frank, are doing very well, not forgetting Sandrine's best friend and another from the room, Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. All-in-all joy to watch on Monday: no wonder that the series and its stars received several awards. Will Felix get Sandra? I hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out ......
