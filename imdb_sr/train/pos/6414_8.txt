I was interested in how critics responded to this exciting, inspirational film, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and I was horrified when I discovered that the Peacock Peacock Gallery, our national film critic, gave the movie an average of 43% (or " Rotten "). ) Rating. All I can say is, if this film does not move you, you do not have the heart. (It's interesting to note that the same movie on the same website got a rating of 74% of viewers). It is not that criticism is all that matters to me. After all, I can not imagine a useless, overpaid profession. It is paid to some slumber to go to the movies (which is a difficult life) and does the same thing as everyone else on the planet: it forms an opinion. But these nonsense have a way to get to them as if their opinion is more important than yours, and worse, they like to hate. I'll give you this movie is good (good, except for f-bombs), syrup and a little predictable ... after all, you know from the very beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr., showing the real navy hero of Carla Brashear, triumph (at the end) at every step simply by the way he finds himself: determined and brave; Willing and optimistic. But his performance and De Niro's work (like Billi Sundai, the composite character of several real people) are so strong, so inspirational that you'll be on your feet cheering on many scene films, especially at the height of the courtroom. You would have to be a real mud wand to not be running these scenes. As film critics of our nation. Michael Rappaport is as good as a cute, stingy diving student who gets acquainted with Gooding's Brashear. If anyone saw "More Learning," this figure completely redeems this character. In any case, this confirms what I always felt: do not listen to criticism. Watch this movie and be inspired.
