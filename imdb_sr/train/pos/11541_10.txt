Matthau and Lemmon are the best in this - everyone else in the movie is great. The dialogue is excellent and very, very funny - and the scene in which Lemmon's character is trying to empty his sinuses in a restaurant, I roll on the floor with a smile every time I see it. Anyone who has accidentally seen a not so good sequel should not be turned from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just love it. The fact that Jack Lemon plays his character so straight ahead with tragic references only contributes to the harshness in my opinion. These two great guys together made a series of films, but this one is the best - no doubt.
