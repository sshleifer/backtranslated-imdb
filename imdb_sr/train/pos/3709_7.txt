Every screen adaptation of the story of John Grisham deserves the mainstream Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman is the last director I would refer to as mainstream. But this southern frying pot is pretty good. Although not one of the best in Altman, it's certainly not among the movies he made to scratch your head and wonder what he was thinking. Altman put his hat on a mysterious thriller with noir overtones earlier in his 1973 movie "The Long Goodbie". "Gingerbread Man" is not nearly as good as that movie, but it's pretty good. Kenneth Branagh is a self-confessed attorney who found himself framed with murder after confronting a client (Embeth Davidtz) who asked for his help to protect her from the coward (Robert Duvall). The film was set in Savannah, Georgia, during a tropical storm, giving the film an oppressive atmosphere that I loved very much. Turning to the end of the film is becoming dirtier and lighter, and Altman proves that he is not exactly the one who is skilled in the execution of the shooting, but generally the film is not a bad addition to the Altman's canon. Also featured are Robert Dovna, Jr., Daril Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. Rating: B
