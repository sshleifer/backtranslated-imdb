"Dressed To Kill" is one of the best ever made trillers. His relationship to sex and violence make this adult movie. Brian De Palma, once again, proves why no other director can compare his camera use to tell the story. He directs many scenes without dialogue, and speaks a lot about his story, strictly through the use of his visions, and the brilliant result of Pina Donnagia. Filmed in Panavision, the film MUST be seen on a wide screen, as De Palma uses the full width of the film to tell his story. Cropped, on the video, "Dressed To Kill", hardly the same movie. Solid performances from his acting, top direction and, perhaps, the best film ever made, make "Dressed to Kill" have to be seen.
