The third and final continuation of "Hanzo the Razor" is the most conclusive of all. "Training" even ends in the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film describes in detail Hansa's piracy investigation at the order of blind monks. He also gives a historical commentary on the proud refusal of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where the first Hanzo film was just a ridiculous and bloody ride with a little tie-in connection, Hanzo 3: Vho's Got the Gold "manages to connect everything and finally brings it home. Definitely perfect finals. Oh, yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there's lots of unnecessary blood and violence (that's Hanzo Razor after all).
