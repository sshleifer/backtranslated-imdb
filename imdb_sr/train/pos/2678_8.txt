Now, I can not claim that I have seen all the films of Jesse (Jesus) Franc, and that there are many of them, but this is one of the better (and more weird) of what I see. I would say that he was most likely in his premiere in the late sixties / early seventies and everything that has been a bit strange to me lately, and I need a lot to say it. In any case, this is like a big bad dream in which it seems that its parts are being realized in different places. This woman is an actress or something, she performs at a theater in Berlin, where acts of "false" torture are performed for a respected audience (?!) And this dreaming dream seems to be. It seems that what is real and what is not in this movie is the real thing in a sharp focus, and things of the dream are not. It seems that it exists in a state of deja vu. I will not say that this makes a lot of sense, but it's pretty wild, weird and fun. Berlin's videos make it look like a lonely and creepy place, so it contributes to the atmosphere. The end is extremely surprising, but the film just ends and the tape becomes black, I guess I do not need to inform you that it's over at that moment. My copy is from the Anchor Bai Euro-Trash collection, and I say, give me more Euro-Trash, I can not get enough of that shit. But that's good shit.
