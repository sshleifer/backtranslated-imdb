I've never heard of this movie until I saw a skeptical DVD for rent, there were many movies in the past with good ensembles that can not do anything bad script, and in some cases not If you just watched it, there was no reason for this movie you do not get a theater show, it's good. A story like the majority of this genre sometimes seems a bit compulsory, but there seems to be a good amount of realism here that allows the momentum to wear. I was pleasantly surprised at how good a job Justin Timberlake is doing here with such a major role, OK, he is not yet an Oscar material, but he will learn with every role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here. Dilan McDermott was also amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely a cream for this film. After all, just try. you will not be disappointed, you will not be bored, in fact, I think you will be more than happy with the end result.
