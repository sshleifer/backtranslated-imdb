I chose to watch this film in Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and I found it to be one of the best films on the festival. Both leading actors deliver a well-rounded, delicate performance that seems to fit personalities on a personal level. The director has done a great job bringing characters and story into life with a skill that is not usually seen for the first time. One interesting aspect of this film is Love to Wood and New York (Brooklin Specific). The film revolves around the business of family furniture and intertwines the delicate cinema of the carpentry and the ordinary life in Brooklyn ?? I regret the director again in this good choice. This is a gem and I would really recommend it (I'm sure it will be on the screen).
