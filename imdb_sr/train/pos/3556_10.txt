Oh, this is such a magnificent musical. It's a bit of a bad voice - Frank Sinatra is as bad as Jewish Nathan Detroit, although it becomes visible only to "Sue Me", which is a distinctly Jewish song. Unfortunately, the directors decided to cut off one of the best songs from the show, "Marri the Man Todai", and replaced it with the inferior Sinatra's exposition. Bearing in mind these two shortcomings, the film is otherwise magnificent. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brovn. Marlon Brando can not sing worthy beans, but he still pulls it. Stubby Kaie remarkably repeated his role in Broadway (written for him). Damon Runion's language and rhythm and humor go pretty well. This is on my list "see-to-every-chance-I-get".
