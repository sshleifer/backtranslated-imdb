Today there are very few performers who can amaze me during the entire film only by their presence. One of them is Judy Davis, who built a successful career of creating characters who are stubborn in attitude, but very vulnerable in the heart. She takes on roles that most other performers will treat melodramatically and adds a fiery, deeply emotional intensity that draws attention from everything else on the screen. which coincides with her for the second time with director Gillian Armstrong, who gave Davis his first big success with "We Brilliant Career". In this film, Davis played the young woman who was determined to do it in the world, despite the choking she felt from her community and upbringing. In "High Tide", however, Davis's character, Lillie, is roughly the opposite: she gave up any hope for her future while she was young, and, after she gave birth to a child, she escaped responsibility and took a life without direction or meaning. When she finally meets her daughter for years later, the thought of taking care of her child is cruel; she knows that it is her chance to redeem her failures, but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect? others, but they face obstacles that create their own habits and habits. "Oscar and Lucinda," for example, referred to a man and a woman who desperately needed to love each other, but they were always blinded by their desire for a chance presented by their addictions to gambling. Here we are immersed in the family of a family torn apart by the inability of the mother to dedicate himself to a constant life and her struggle to redeem it despite being completely convinced that it is late to change for the better. This is not just a movie with a great performance in the center, but also a rare achievement: a completely convincing story of redemption.
