Good movie with strong performance (especially twice). The film talks about two American girls caught with a 6kg kilogram at the airport in Thailand. Both were thrown into prison and one of them signed a confession. Bill Pullman plays a lawyer who tries to throw them out. All he has to do is find Nick Parks, who put the narcotics in one of the two girls' bags. So far for a story that is not so original (it has many similarities with a better return to paradise). Beautiful photo actress and Nuit Thompson Sigel makes this movie worth watching. 7 of 10
