This movie is good. It's not the best of the big CG kung fu flicks, but it's pretty good. First, the story is actually good. The whole idea of ​​the gods in relation to the fallen gods deals with the super powers is pretty cool. My problem is that there are too many characters! It became confusing when they replaced the scenes! Special effects were incredible! The battle scenes were very fast and complex. This film practically generates a computer. The acting is great, as such players are expected. Ekin Cheng is a great protagonist, a lonely figure. Zhang Ziii did nothing for me in this movie. I thought she would have a bigger part, but she made a fighting scene and a lot of chasing. A bad guy, the entire army of the skull and the whole cloud of blood is very scary. Music is also great. For me this story deserves at least a mini-series, not just one movie. There's too much talk to get stuck in 2 hours. Perhaps, if there were a book or something like that, I would be able to track all the characters and details. This film sacrifices the integrity of the story for action. I recommend Storm Riders any day.
