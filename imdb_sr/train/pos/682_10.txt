This is one of my favorite films of all time, and although it may not be enough for some, it's worth a look at it. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is drawn into a case involving "city" Aborigines, and this is not an ordinary case. Okay, the man died, but it was not normal killing. Lately, there was also a higher amount of rain, and the atmosphere of most films is somewhat claustrophobic and oppressive. The Aborigines hide the secret and refuse to spill the beans. This has a lot to do with white people who make assumptions about "Citi" against "Tribal" Aboriginal, and of course Abo would not practice tribal modes in the big city. Uh huh. Chemberlen has strange dreams and he's kind of the key to what's going on, although no matter how many times I've seen it, I can not figure out the exact connection. This is a very dashing and dreadful movie, and it's a good example of Peter Veir's ability to create tension from nothing. The ending is a little ambiguous, but I understand it literally, it's the easiest way out and the most terrible. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
