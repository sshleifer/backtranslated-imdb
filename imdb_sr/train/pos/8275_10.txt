Vendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller, the film has a great drama between characters and some good nasty scenes. The acting is good, the characters act like a normal family. Vendigo effects are good, Deer Forma reminded me a little about Zack in Donnie Dark. The film sees a family who will stay for a while, but accidentally hit the deer, the group arrives a hunter and one of the hunters named Otis begins to argue with Dad George, after the car is lifted, they are driven off to the house. Son of Miles is a little shaken by the deer, but his parents are trying to tell him it's natural that such things happen. That night, while in bed, he begins to see strange things in the bedroom, the next day they go to town, and Miles meets a man on the counter who gives him a small statue of Wendigo, when Miles shows Kim statue and tells her that the man behind the counter gave him that the owner says he works only there. When he returns home, George takes his son to the dusk, and while the sleigh has collapsed from the board, and Miles is persecuted by the wind, after being sumptuous going in search of George, he is in front of the house where he says he was killed, Hospital Kim says to the sheriff Otis shot him, Shrieff went to Otis's place where he hammered his hammer, while Otis drives down the street and finds that Vendigo is waiting for him. Vendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some cool moments. Look at this. 10/10
