This movie is great. His setting in the 40s and Meg Rian's character is struggling to be known as 'smart'. Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And all this has a magical feeling towards her. Every time I watch it, I feel happy. It's definitely a movie about girls, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I also love music. Violin is great. but in addition, I think it's a sweet story and that everyone should be watching.
