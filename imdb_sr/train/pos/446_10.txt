One of my favorite movies ever. Just wonderful, lots of human emotions, wit, humor, intelligence. The story is growing, like the lesson of life, just a wonderful movie in many ways. The actors are also fantastic ... a great selection of the best British talents. I loved them all for every variety of elements that were put into the movie. I love it :)
