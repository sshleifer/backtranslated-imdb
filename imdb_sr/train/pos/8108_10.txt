I have, "Things to Come", to D.V.D. and it's very clear in relation to my VHS version. The sound is honest, but sometimes it's hard to understand. The movie I liked so much that I was looking for a copy of the book and found it. He gave details of why some things happened. The best things about the movie are small things I did not notice at first. For example, John Cabal was playing with a toy plane on the Christmass Party, as if it were a diving bombarder that came out of the seaside by naming a "Dinosaur" battleship. Ships submerged by air force, unpublished hostile hidden aircraft. Swept by flight planes. Strong roles for women throughout the film. Have them more, watch the movie to enjoy them.
