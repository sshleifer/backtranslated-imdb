I loved this movie. It was so good! Great acting and drama and historically correct. I love Romi Schneider movies. This rock is not as big as Sissi, but it's still a rock! And Scorpiolina, commented and said French dubbing. So this is an original German movie, not French. So that. Secondly, it was complicated, perhaps your knowledge of history. Oh and her mother played the role of her governess, not her teacher. And the story actually was not Cinderella but Queen Victoria, maybe you missed that detail. But still ... that the history in this movie is brilliant, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is very fascinating! I love all the historical things. Like the guy who was trying to manipulate her mom. And when she ran away and met her future husband, she showed her a "new type of dance," which he valued. When the Waltz was new, it was considered somewhat scandalous because the couples were so close. That her governess was like my God! As well as clothes, I like clothes. Styles are great, skirts are excellent. And of course, Roma always look very nice.
