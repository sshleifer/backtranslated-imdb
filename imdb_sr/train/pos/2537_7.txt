Boris and Bela agree well in this film, regardless of whether they are against each other, or boating with the same boat. I saw this in 1972, and I just bought it from Borders this year. This time I watched with my children, I noticed two things: he kept the attention of the old 3, 4 and 5 years; and I caught a few things I did not have when I first watched them. A very fast story with an unpredictable end. Required for movie lovers !!!
