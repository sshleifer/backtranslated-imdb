This early biographical short was so much fun to watch. The other on the disk is one of D.V. Griffith's DVD "Iears of Discoveri" (highly recommended) contains three great performances by main tracks, and it's interesting to see Henry B. Valthalla (Little Colonel, Birth of the Nation) as a prisoner who gives the Countess an eye (and other things). The Countess husband is eating from the pain of betraying his wife and closing her in a small room with her mistress. It's kind of unlikely that they would not hear the wall rising, but hey, maybe wine had something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (the father of the mighty player Raimonda Hacketta) wildly gestures and adds this to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. The best moment comes in the end. As the lady loses shock and fear, when she realizes that she was doomed to ruin, Henry picked up her instrument and "adores" over her. The way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way sexy, and I just lost him and he laughed. The expression on his face! From that moment Henry B. Valthall.
