This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir that was shown through the eyes by an 11-year-old boy living in a rural Cuban city in the year of the Castro Revolution. This is obviously a worthy love of love. The names of CUBA LIBRE and CUBA BLOOD are just attempts to mislead this into the market as an action movie. RECORDING JULY has much more meaning. It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO, and the revolution is only an inconvenience for everyday life and the search for people. This fact itself makes the film more respectful than most papers dealing with this time period in Cuban history. The excessive use of narrator voice undermines the story, but the film is compensated by unconditional pics from Hollywood films that speak much more visually than the narrator could. Comparisons with CINEMA PARADISO and a fair play, because the film returns to melancholy about movies, but there is also the basic pain of loss of lifestyle that exceeds the lost love. The revolution, like the movie JULIE, seems to never end.
