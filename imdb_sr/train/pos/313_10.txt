I'm a Black American and I loved this soap opera. I looked at him in Spanish on Telemund, nearly five to seven years ago. The story was a true story about black goods that had a love affair with a white commander led to her guidance and sincere, humorous lifestyle. She took what she had, nothing, and saw her possibilities. Many would argue that she was selling, but she was trying to secure her future and the future of her future children. but it's not cleared. This soap opera was the best soap opera EVER. It needs to be published on DVD or re-broadcast on TV. It is currently playing in Aztec America, which is available only in Mexico or the United States through a paid cable. We need to send it back to Telemund.
