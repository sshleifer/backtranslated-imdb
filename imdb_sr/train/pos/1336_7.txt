This is mostly a beautiful movie, with a good story, great actors and great songs. Unfortunately, the cinema was bad. One of the weakest points in the movie is a boring chain of sequences copied from Pretty Voman. Why? Does it hurt the attempt of some originality, Abas? Mustan? Anyone? The film is about newly founded marriage, Raju and Priya (Salman - Early). Prija can not imagine her after the accident she had during the previous pregnancy and finally decides to use a surrogate mother who will wear their child. They elect Madhubal, a vulgar prostitute played by Preiti Zinta. The film is not really realistic, I mean, is not it easier to adopt? Even if they choose a girl, does that mean that a man has to sleep with her? Did you hear about fertilization? In any case, I suppose that if the writers heard about all of this, the film would not have been made, so the concept is obviously intended. It's nice to see it playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and inexpensive dialogues about his great love for his wife and how difficult it is for him to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's sour and unrealistic. Early is just fine; she is generally effective and is trying to do something with that role, but she is completely shaded by Preiti Zinta. She transforms from a loud prostitute into a sensitive woman easily and naturally. She lives a movie, emotion, and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of her best career shows. There is no doubt that she is more talented than her contemporaries in the industry. It should only be more of such roles. The ending of the film just highlights what I said above. It's tearful, exciting and acting very well. Watch him for Preiti. 7/10 for movie! 10/10 - for Preiti!
