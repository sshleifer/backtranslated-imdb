Most of the feedback I've heard about the Meatball Machine is pretty good. The couple even said they thought it was "sucked". Well, for those people I say, take some f @ ckin imagination and go f @ ck yourself. This was a very fun movie. The story starts with this mechanical mistake that attacks and in some way transforms its hosts into those gvar-costed bones, lethal maps called Necroborgs. In the end you will find that these mechanical hooks also attach a little parasite to you, which is then able to control your actions because of the hot connection of the nervous system. Unfortunately, for two lonely young men seeking love, they are crossing the paths with a mechanical bug, and before you know it, transformations occur and blood is sprayed. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Perhaps a way to stop this mechanical threat by mistakes? Why are Necroborgs struggling against each other? Can these two desperate singles express their feelings for each other and do bad? Just one way to find out. Entering the Meatball Machine I was kind of careful about the mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a great surprise. Several unanswered questions, sometimes average behavior and a little confusing ending are the only weak points that one can think of. From the feelings of the anime to him, how parasites become small characters themselves, and even to the feeling of a low budget, this movie hits the right mark much more than it lacks. With a story that is constantly developing and interesting enough to ask questions in combination with the cold effects of lipstick and spraying blood, this is one of the fans of bizarre / horor / Tetsuo / splatter fans. 8 outta 10
