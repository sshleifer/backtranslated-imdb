This is an incredible film, both for incredible energy caused by the flamenco dancing flamenco, as well as for the unique way in which the authors of the film intertwined the story of the stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it. Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe my experience. This is not "Bizet's Carmen" according to any standard standard. This is not a standard movie by any standard. Every shaded look, every kick of your feet, every piece of music is interwoven so amazing that you can not take your eyes off the screen. You do not have to love opera or flamenco (not) to be caught, enthusiastic, fascinated by this movie. Subtle and direct; loud and calm; One of the best movies, if not the best, because there are so few.
