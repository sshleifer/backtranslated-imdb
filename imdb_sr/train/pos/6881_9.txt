How can a movie that has Curtis Maifield's singing be bad? Can not! Groove Tube is a series of skatologic dash that mingle all since 2001 to the Olympic Games. High Tones (Coco Clown, Easy Lube Recipe) outperforms falls (too long "Dealers"), but even falls are ridiculous. Best of all, Ken Shapiro's manic dance on Manhattan's sagging sidewalk (that's Shapiro, and not Nat King Cole singing Just Iou, Just Me). Definitely from now on, but at the time Groove Tube was dishonest, brave, imprudent and hysterical funny. Ken Shapiro made this minor cult hit, then seven years later he made a Christmas opening of the bomb, Modern Problems (although I enjoyed it) and since then, unfortunately, nothing. there is an endless explosion of positive energy, a film that 26 years after the first viewing still brings true joy!
