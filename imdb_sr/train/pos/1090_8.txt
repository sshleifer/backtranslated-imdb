One of Caroline's longest-running comedians, Mr. Blandings is building his dream home. Although, according to size, the apartment would be a dream villa today. Still, Cari was making good money in the advertising field, although he had the time of trying to come up with a slogan for ham with Vham brand. What made this movie so popular was the lack of housing in the aftermath of the Second World War. Veterans who returned from the war demanded their rights in accordance with the GI Rights Regulations that included housing loans. The problem was that literally there were not enough houses to satisfy the demand. Somewhere at a time when the book of Eric Hodgins and the film was so popular, the Congress was adopted and President Truman signed Taft-Ellender-Wagner's Law on Housing Relations which first put the government in the job of building a house for the first time. I had an uncle and aunt who at the same time built their home in which they moved in the early fifties. Like Cari Grant and Mirna Loi, they had two daughters and asked to leave Rochester. Their place was not as glorious as the houses in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, yet they lived the rest of their lives there the way Cari and Mirna most likely did. Of course it was expensive and the costs only continue to increase and threatened to send Tsarya to cleaners. Cari and Mirna also have Melvin Douglas to offer advice, usually too late. The truth is that she's kinda cute at Mirna and Cari knows that. The Role of Quiet Loi is simply the extension of Nore Charles. If you can imagine that Charles moved into the country and that Villiam Povell has Cari Grant's headaches, the film will continue to function quite well. Blandings builds their dream home and continues to work well as a comedy because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my uncle Valter and Aunt Kate who lived in her dream home for more than 40 years.
