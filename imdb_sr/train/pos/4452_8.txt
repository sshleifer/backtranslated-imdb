Do not swing by the nozzle. This is a wonderful spooky movie. This was the work for the writer / director, JT Petty. He did a great job on the edge of my seat. I never knew what to expect, and for the poor horror, this is Nirvana! The film refers to an older man living in an isolated log cabin in the forest. One day, while searching for his cat in the forest, he is a witness to the murder of a child or him? The rest of the film is bothered about this. What is most unusual about this movie is that there is no dialogue here for the last few scenes. I found this to be intriguing. The writer manages to reach your senses and gives them a ruthless move. Leave this movie, you will not be disappointed.
