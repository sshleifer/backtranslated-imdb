Flapping the butterfly wing in the Atlantic can free the hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to Theory of Chaos, I'm not sure exactly), any action, no matter how small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This little jewel of the film shows us a series of seemingly unconnected characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect the lives of others. (The Six Degree Separation Theory can also be applied.) Each story is an aspect of the gem that this film has. The play is fine-tuned and tinted (Audrey Tautou is brilliant), stories are multiplied, humor is fine, and the viewer goes out of the theater as a sign of approval.
