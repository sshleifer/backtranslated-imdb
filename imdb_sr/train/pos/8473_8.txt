This charmingly pleasant and gentle continuation of the highly successful "Legend of Boggy Creek" is just a continuation of the name. The stories abound in the dormant, self-contained fishing community of the allegedly infamous creature Bigfoot called "Big Bai Ti", located deep in unattractive swamps of Boggy Creeka. Two brother brothers and their older, more sensible sister (a sweet party with a sweet, intricate future "Strokes from Jake", star Dana Plato) enter a dangerous wetland to check if the creature of a local legend is actually a real living being. The trio is hopelessly lost in a fierce storm, and furry, bearish, humongous, but very gentle and benevolent Saskuatch comes to the rescue of children. Tom Moore's casual, worthless route connects a simple story in a light rhythm, apparently capturing details of a rural town in extremely precise details, drawing different characters from the land with great warmth and affection, and fortunately developing emotions on the organic , a restrained, unapproved way that never converts into a sticky-sappi mush. Beautiful Dawn Vells (Marie Ann on "Gilligan's Island") gives an interesting and striking view of a girl who loves a working single mother while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus provide pleasurable support as a pair of bumps. The capable, sunny cinematography of Robert Betard shows a woody environment in all its luxuriously calm, painfully clean and fragile intact glow of civilization. The result of Darrell Deck cleverly combines synthetic tricks that crawl through the flesh and a joyful banjo-woody blonde into a melodious sound-making coffee. In addition, this image deserves a special praise for the way in which it incredibly predicts the Bigfoot vogue children's play in the nineties for well over 15 years in advance.
