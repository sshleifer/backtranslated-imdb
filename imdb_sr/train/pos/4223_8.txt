The film has a great written genre story. Contains all of the usual Columbo ingredients; The way Colonel Columbo approaches and connects with his suspect, the way the mystery reveals him, the Columbian dog, plays cats and mice, which is great in this and happiness, as well as good humor for alleviating, mostly with Columbo figure. Everything is written despite the fact that there is not even the original concept. Columbo, who hunted a writer of a detective / murder novel, did more than once in Columbo. It is also an extremely well-directed film by James Fravlei, who subsequently directed five more Columbo films, the seventies and the eighties. He offered the film with style and some really great and unforgettable sequences. It's one of the slower Columbo movies, despite not having too much time. This style and approach are not always good for the Columbo film, but in this film it does, which may not be the least thanks to the acting performance of the film. The most Columbo movie or actress is a great-known star or star from the early days of filming, as a movie killer. This film is played by a rather unknown 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. During her career, she did not act in a large number of films, but she is still well-known, mainly due to her role in "Rosemary's Baba", which also brought her the Oscars. She had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting, which some people might not like. She won another 4 nominations for the Oscar during her career, before winning the "Rosemari's Babi" Award in 1969. She also has a great interaction with Peter Falk in their sequences together. The film also starred as a young DG Spradel. I say young, because I only know him from his latest productions from his career, despite the fact that he already had 57 years at the time of this Columbo production. He is still alive but has withdrawn from acting since 1999. Even better than the usual Columbo movie attachment. 8/10
