If you've ever seen a trailer for The Recruit with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you'll never have to watch this movie. Unfortunately, the Renaissance had similar manufacturers of trailer trailers. The story of the Renaissance is about a detective investigating the abduction of a young woman and a medical researcher. The setting is a futuristic Paris, and elements of science fiction appear throughout the day. The specialty of the Renaissance, however, is its visual style, not its story. Renesansa is a 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but highly stylized in black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. The result looks stunning (although the problems of 3D animation of human beings are still noticeable from time to time: mildly robotic movements, mildly wooden facial expressions, etc.) As a stylized, beautiful film noir, Renesansa manages to impress the audience visually. Story and writing, however, are not at the same level of quality as the picture. It's not a bad story (and probably, if you did not see a trailer, it's much more exciting than it was for me). But it's a story that's not very original, and it's bordering with the ragged. Several lines of dialogue were painfully deformed, so the writing sounded like an initial effort. I will definitely recommend the Renaissance to friends. It's like everything I've seen visually before, and I believe that its originality is a valuable experience in itself. It's also a story that can be watched, even if it's not perfect.
