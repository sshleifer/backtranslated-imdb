I'm a man, not a woman's film, but this is a really well-made story. I do not have a personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but she works a hell of a good deal, while DeNiro is his usual great personality. Everything is so well done: acting, directing, painting, setting, photography, casting. If you can enjoy the story of real people and true love - this is the winner.
