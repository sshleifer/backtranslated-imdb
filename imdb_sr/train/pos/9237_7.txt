This movie is pretty good. Half a year ago I bought it on a DVD. But first I thought it was an original movie. I saw a series and it's a good movie, but here they put together "The Living Legend, part1 and 2" and "Fire in space". As with the first film, but with other episodes. But still, it's a pretty good movie. Only the end is strange (you do not see what happens to Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. Actors and special effects were good. If you have not seen him, go see. Cast: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Svartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
