Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason he was so terrible about Ramones! You could not make the same movie and put something like Sek Pistols, or The Clash instead of The Ramones, it would just not be the same. Dei Ioung, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Marie Voronov, Paul Bartel, and Monters, just added a movie. The whole film is about Ramones ... especially Joei! So everyone showed up to see Rock 'n' Roll High School if your big fan is making guns. No new shit ... but loud and fast. The kind that only the Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest In Peace) Joey Ramon 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
