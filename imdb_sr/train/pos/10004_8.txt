This is not a comedian Robin Villiams, nor is it unusual / usual Robin Villiams of the recent thriller of fame. This is a hybrid of a classic drama without excessive dramatization, mixed with Robin's new love for the thriller. But this is not a thriller per se. This is a more mysterious / uncertain vehicle through which Villiams tries to find a sick boy and his guard. In the lead role of Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense drama plays almost as a news report, as long as Villiam's Lik is approaching achieving his goal. I must say that I was very fun, even though this movie fails to teach, lead, review or entertain. It seemed to me more like looking at a guy (Villiams), because he actually performed the action, from the perspective of a third person. In other words, I felt real, and I managed to subscribe to the premise of the story. All in all, worth seeing, although definitely not Friday / Saturday night. /> Contains 7.7 / 10 by ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
