Whoever says Pokemon is dumb, he can die. This film is superlative. I even narrowed down when Celebi died. I do not admit much! This film is a moving animated thriller. In this fourth part of the story, Ash and friends must prevent a bad jerk from Celebs becoming an extremely evil weapon with their dark ball. At that time, Sam and Celebs travel through time and are constantly hunted by game hunters. I like the part with a double battle and Sam has an apricorn pokeball (if you played pokemon gold, silver, or crystal, you know what it is.) Instead of Varner Brothers. Putting a mini movie in the end was a great idea. Pokemon in this movie is reviving more than ever.
