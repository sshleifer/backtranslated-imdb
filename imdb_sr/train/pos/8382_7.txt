If you love mech war games, it's pretty good. Some of them are cheap, but robot fighting is worth seeing. For some time I've enjoyed the Mech war field and this is almost the only movie I've ever seen to get closer to that feeling so that we could pilot one of those huge bellows. If you like generations, games that you like are Mech Varrior Three and Four, and if you have Ksbok and $ 350 to save the Steel Battalion. The movie is worth a look at least once. There really should be more movies on the same topic. Less remakes and original works. Enjoy
