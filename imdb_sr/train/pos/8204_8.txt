Sudden Impact was generally better than Enforcer in my opinion. It was a great movie, but then I saw the villain and I was disappointed. The sudden stroke was different from the previous one. The action went in the other direction in this film, because Dirty Harry does not take such a police approach this time. We also do not see criminals until later, which means less time for them, which is better for all of us. . Pat Hingle enjoyed as Chief Jannings, Harry's new boss. Bradford Dillman seems to have changed his name to Captain Brigs, in any case, he was not different. Michael Currie is decent as Lieutenant Donnell, Harry is a boring supporter. I personally enjoyed Kevin Major Howard as Havkins, a young bastard who has a vengeance against Harry. Albert Popvell was as good as Horace, Harry's friend. Audrie J. Unafficient was as good as Rai Parkins, a famous lesbian in the city. Jack Thibeau was as good as Kruger, a pervert. Now for a really bad part. Sandra Locke, a longtime lover of Eastwood, was terribly wrong as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was as horrible as Mick. The film would have been much better that it was not for better writing and acting in some parts.
