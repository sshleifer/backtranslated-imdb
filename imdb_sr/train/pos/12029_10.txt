I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremiah Jordan, one of my favorite and sweetest actors ever. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I've seen most of her films, but everything from Jeremy Jordan. What I do not like about Twisted Desire is when Nick is arrested and Jennifer strikes him. Tvisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first one is Goonies. But I still love Jeremiah Jordan.
