In his editorial debut, Denzel Washington is making a true story that also happens as a very difficult story and brings him to the screen with the sincerity we expected of Washington's acting efforts, but now we see this touch as a director. Recently we have seen some of the catastrophic results of children who have fallen through the cracks of public protection. This story speaks of the existence of a nightmare that leaves terrible scars, but suggests a triumph of the human spirit in the end. We can decide for some problems with the first efforts with too much work, not the best editing of these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that design such power can not be underestimated. If the academy looks at this film it will be a tragedy. This film does not pull the blows and goes to the cool solid facts of a story with a purity that usually does not go from the novel to the screen. This is, of course, a recognition to the director. This is the whore so go look at it and tell your friends to see him too!
