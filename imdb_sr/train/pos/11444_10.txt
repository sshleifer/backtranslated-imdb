Take a look at this film for the beautiful sculptures of Andy Goldsvorthi, and give yourself a completely relaxing experience. Music perfectly complements the recordings, but never attracts attention to itself. Some commentators have called clipping interviews with the artist's weak point, but consider this: why would you expand it in the movie, if you can read Andy's thoughts in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures? This medium is much more convenient to show the effective nature of the artist's work and is professionally used in this regard.
