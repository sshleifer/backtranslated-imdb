La Coda Dello Scorpione (aka Case of the Scorpion's Tail) was the sequel of the director Sergius MartÃ­n to the beautiful gialla Strano vizio della Signora Vardh. This is an essential giallo, with all the aspects that the fans of this genre met and loved. A rounded shop, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades, and a little bit worse, all are gathering to make one of the parts of Italian exploitation. The group of gialli favorites, both in front and behind the camera, make this one of the best non-Argento gialli. There is also mentioned Martino who added to directing, giallo the great Ernesto Gastalli as a writer, Bruno Nicolai who creates music, and a multitude of giallo stars and starlets, such as George Hilton, art actor Luigi Pistilli and attractive Anita Strindberg. Br /> With all that talent behind him, does Scorpione deliver? You can bet. The film works on several different levels. It's an exciting mystery of murder, a tense and violent horror movie, and a thrill thriller. All in all, one of the best gaylies. Martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli. In some points of the film, it appears that almost directs Argenta in his approach. For example, there is a direct scam of the scene in "Bird Vith the Cristal Plumage" where the killer is trying to break through the door, which actually surpasses the Argento-in jerk. Is there a movement problem? Hmmm ... just less. First, all scenes that do not follow murder or romance between the two lines start to bother. But just before you fall asleep, the killer will emerge from nowhere and you will immediately return to the swing of things. Also, before the end, the outlines are a bit bizarre. I mean, what was the purpose of scorpion needles really served? If you do not care about the dialogue, you can easily lose yourself with a twisted story. But these little fictions, the La Coda Dello Scorpione is tense, tense, stunning and all about the fun movie for gialla fans. Find him!
