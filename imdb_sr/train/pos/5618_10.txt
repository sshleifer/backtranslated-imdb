This is a creepy movie. Creepier than anything from David Linch, and this shows what a great director Polanski is doing, because that's not his usual type of work, and that's BRIEF. Everything starts with Trelkovsky crossing into a residential block in Paris. It soon learns that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and believed that the other people who lived there drove her to her. He also believes that they are trying to do the same. The result is an astonishing and terrifying look at paranoia. The whole production has a classic horror written everywhere: from the picture to the music the viewer can feel the building of the terror of the poor Trelkovsky. Did everyone go out to kill him? Or just crazy? Is there a difference? Learn for yourself. 10/10
