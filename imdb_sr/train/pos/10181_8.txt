In the beginning I bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishvaria Rai on the cover and I thought, hey! another movie in which Aishu and Shah Rukh play, I knew little that Aishvaria will appear in the last quarter of the film in a song that he shares with SRK and helps to present his character in the movie in only 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about the mother's love and endurance. It is a film about transformations, ignorance, aging, entering into knowledge and accepting difficult life situations. The number of the item in which the SRK and Aisha appear does not have anything to do with the film. This is actually a sequence of dreams that occur while the SRK's drunken figure is obscured by alcohol. He dreams that Aishvaria Rai is this sexy street girl who one day appears in her favorite gathering place, scarce dressed and begins to seduce him. The title of the song is 'Ishk Kamina' (freely translated as "Love is a whore!") And it's just smoking hot! Do not miss.
