I've seen a lot of movies, but 'In the cold blood' I'm alone in the class. It is distinguished by every department. The fact that it contained several big stars helps to push through the top until you are more attentive to the characters and their story, not on the name on the screen. Blake and Wilson turn the star performances of a duo killer. The fact that a large number of films are filmed at the actual locations where the crime occurred, even in the house itself, adds additional winters. Black / white photography darkens mood and photography is magnificent. There are many outstanding film works there, but if they can only vote for one at the top of the list, they will most likely be "In Cold Blood".
