If you love the cult of the 70s Sci-Fi in the way I do it, or if you like movies such as "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai", then you will love this. It is a stream of Sci-Fi spectacle of consciousness of the 70's, including the 22nd century dump and Earth for a million years. This film is pure for 70 years. Put Steve Miller "Fli Like An Eagle" or Pink Floid's "Dark Side Of The Moon" and you're ready to move!
