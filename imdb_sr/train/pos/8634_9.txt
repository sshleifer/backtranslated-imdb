LOVE TO TOP - a totally wrong American title for a wonderful French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (which means, I mean, The Rabid Sheep) - is such a genuine film, the fact that it turns out to be staggering until 1974. This film was far ahead of its time; even by today's highest standards, it realizes things that look rich and new. He shot an extremely underrated director, Michel Deville, but he does not deal with the description in a way that combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex, and satiety into a totally original mixture - leaving aside the ultimate but subtle surprise for all of this before is suddenly sad and more understandable. The actors are brilliant, just like text and themes. But it's Deville's delicious tone, which keeps you out of balance, but is freaky, pushing this "lost" film to a very high level. (A written interview with the director in the "Special Features" section of the DVD is definitely worth reading if you have time.)
