Of the three remakes of this plot, I all like, I have all three on VHS, and besides, I have a copy of this on DVD. There are enough variations in the scripts that all three parties are watching again. In addition, is any other film processed three times with such stars? Of course, the main stars in this are great, but the supporting actors are excellent. I especially like Villiema Tracy as Pepi. He was such a thief of the scenes that I asked to find other films in which he appeared. Like other comments I say - buy this one.
