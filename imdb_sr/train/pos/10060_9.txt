Vang Bianlian is an old street performer known as the 'king of masks' for his mastery of the art of change in Sichuan. Liang is a renowned opera artist of Sichuan art and respects Vanga as an artist and as a person. Liang is concerned that precious art should not die together with Wang, and therefore sows the seed of the heir to Wang's mind. The film talks about prejudices, male domination, state of art, values ​​and the most important warmth. I can not recommend this film enough. The whole movie is in the loop. Everything is important. His long story is so well arranged that the length of the film is only 91 minutes. Totally satisfaction. Five minutes is an artistic film, the next five minutes his sad movie, the next five minutes his thriller. Just changing his mood as his protagonist changed his face. The last scene on the rope is phenomenal. Story and script are flawless. The actors are brilliant. Both protagonists are artists who can tell you how they performed. Very impressive. He's not even nominated for an Oscar. That year, the 'English patient' received the best Oscar film and won the category of foreign films 'Kolia'. 'Kolia' was fine about the 'English patient', he said less. Watch out for 9/10.
