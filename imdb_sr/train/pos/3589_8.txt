I enjoyed this movie, and after I looked at it, I wondered how many Caitlin Rose there are in the world. How many other girls were exposed to this kind of sexual abuse and torture by colleagues and who were too frightened to open their mouths about it? How teens are threatening and cruel can be towards each other, because as this film shows, who is not right is not the most important, who is popular, and who fears manipulate the minds of young people, and that such kind of immorality happens Tiffany Amber Thiessen gives a powerful performance as a victim of rape, and Brian Austin Green is as convincing as a guy torn between a girl he thought he loved and his best friend. Deserved. Outstanding and brilliant, too good to be just a movie made for TV.
