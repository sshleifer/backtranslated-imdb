I realize that many people hate this movie, but I must admit it is one of my favorites. I accidentally prefer my predecessor and I love to love him better than a lot of movies. First, I think people never tell a story about any kind of loan, just like Back to the Future, Time Travel is hard to write, and this movie includes Time Travel and Spiritual Journei. I also think that Keanu and Alek were there at the best performances in this film, they looked colder, they played cooler, and said colder things. The scenery of this film is incredible, the sets are pretty detailed and massive, and it's hard to believe that these sets are made for a movie about two. teenage buds that barely spell ... but it's not a genius of an entire franchise, making these two idiots bigger than the characters of life who are responsible for the entire utopian future of the country. The costume design was avsome as vell. Bill and Ted actually look good at Bogus Journei, where, as in Ecellent Adventure, they look like, as they would, FAGS !!! Even the music in this movie is incredible, the result is special. I can say so much about this film because I love it. But this is one of those movies that I grew up watching and every time I loved him so I can understand why people hate or just think that Bogus is compared to a great adventure (which I also love). DOWNLOADING YOUR BAD SELF !!!!
