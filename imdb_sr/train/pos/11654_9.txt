I agree with the above commentary, I love realism in this, and in many films (not just about eating disorders films) producers forget it. They take a daily problem and create a dramatic scene, and then the end of the film comes to a perfect conclusion, which I do not like because it's not a reality. It does not mean that things can not be better, not to say that things are not working in this movie, but it does not spend much of the film creating all these problems, and the end of the film comes to the end everything is perfect again. When people have eating disorders, people do not recognize it and want to improve, and then life is peachy, it takes time, and I like how we grow in this film with characters, we go through difficulties with them, we get problems with them better and worse, because it's a very important part of the movie. It enters the mind of people with eating disorders, and it shows complications and pain, in a very realistic way, and I liked it. I also love how Mysterious it shows and the betrayal of people feel when they are suffering from eating disorders, it's scary to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve of it. I thought this film was very touching and beautiful and well-spoken, and defiant one of my favorites.
