Well done giving perspective to the other side of Fraulein Doctor catches both the cost and the futility of the war. Excellent behavior, especially when the German Supreme Command refuses to present a murder for a medal in the name of chivalry. The scene of the massacre is probably too intense for intelligent American minds who would probably prefer silly talk and meaningless abstractions like 14 points or the league of nations. true Americans can appreciate story and action. For all actions and intrigues, Fraulein Doctor compares the fauna (s) with Jacob's Ladder.
