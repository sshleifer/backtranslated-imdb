For those who did not follow the murder case of Anne Marie Fahei. You miss one of the saddest, most complicated murders. The killer is a popular Delaware lawyer, Tom Capano and the victim is Delavare Governor, secretary, Anne Marie Fahei. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until its disappearance and murder. She wanted to leave him, but he did not want it so easy to let go. On the other hand, he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters. Where did he find time to have two lovers and family life? In addition, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for four-hour mini-series. While the actress who plays Ms. Fahei does a good job, she does not have her dark long hair. His second mistress is definitely more attractive than a real woman. Mark Harmon looks better and makes Emmy Award as Tom Capano. It would be better with the actual locations in Delaware and Philadelphia. With Ann Rule's production, she adds accuracy to the characteristics of Anne Marie's organization and her personal struggle with eating disorders. These pieces of information can be overlooked by any other executive producer or director. If you have not read the book, it's worth paying off. Ann Rule is a fascinating storyteller of the real crime. Ironically, Mark Harmon plays Tom Kapan. He also played a former friend and author Ann Rule, Ted Bundy in another adaptation book many years ago. He was brilliant then and now. He is doing an extraordinary job with an incredible story. Even President CLinton offered his help in the case of Anne Marie Fahei. And now, former governor Tom Carper is now United States senator for Delaware who defeated longtime, popular current Senator Richard Roth in the November 2000 elections. If you do not think the movie is interesting, then read the book Rules.
