In her autobiography, Laureen Bacall discovers that Bogie has told her that she should not make such films as this or something like that. At the time, Douglas Sirk was labeled "crying for women", in fact, he was returned to the benefit, at least in Europe, after he stopped directing. And when he recorded "written in the wind," Sirk had only three films: "Darkened Angels," "Time for Love and Time to Die", his masterpiece, IMHO, and finally the "Imitation of Life" (1960). Then there was silence. In fact, Bacall and Hudson characters are not interested in Sirk. They are too upright, exalted virtually. The steadfastness of the brother and sister, from the family of rich Texas oil traders, was thrown out of sight by disgusting clothes and rutile cars that are at the highest speed in the slopes. landscape. Malone's metamorphosis at the end of the film is astounding: a suit and a pinch, playing with a small spatula: she is ready for life, the rebel is trampled. Now herself, because she lost Hudson (but she was not in love with her anyway). This end is a little reactionary, but the melodrama is a par excellence reactionary, three years later, in the "imitation of life," Sarah-Jane (Susan) Kohner) will be blamed for not knowing his place.
