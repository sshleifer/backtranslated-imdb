This film scared me when I was a kid. It's not "Citizen Kane," but he has his moments. The ripping scene is good. The action is good even if the characters are not - they could have to do with the acting. Put some eminent people in the roles and then see what you get. This was one of those recordings, editing (what was a bit) and distribution in several months of movies. This is a classic sci-fi with a low budget and deserves it just for that. I rated it to other films of this genre and age.
