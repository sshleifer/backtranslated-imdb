I believe Sarafina's huge effort is Vhoopi Goldberg. Besides her, there is no other star in the film and its role is less than the title character, Sarafina. Since I work in an urban high school with children, I think this is an important film that shows the history of South African apartheid. Sarafina is a film about education and a teacher relationship with her student, Sarafina. I saw a video for almost nothing on the video. I watched him and quickly forwarded through the music numbers. But I strongly recommend this film to teachers and their students to understand. Now I do not know the other actors and actresses in the film, I guess that is very popular in South Africa and I'm glad they took the South African cast, with the exception of Goldberg in a small role if he finds people to see this movie, then Vhoopi achieve global attractiveness .
