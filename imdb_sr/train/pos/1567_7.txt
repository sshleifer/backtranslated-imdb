It's not a bad movie because Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Coven, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Villie Best could either be with Charlie Chan, Motom, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint and so on. get an opportunity to spend another hour in the company of some old friends, from ordinary to usual, killing and killing - it's always a pleasure in my book. Barrie is a stubborn woman who refreshes and cleans her framed and dead father, a police detective, planning and implementing with her side a series of underground killings. Which would surely have the opposite effect! Sanders joins the party with a simple dance in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting that falls on him and the first killer (at the right time!) And kills him. > The story and the acting is fine, the only thing I have to do with a busy and almost funny discovery who is evil genius (Valdeman) - have they almost forgotten its importance in the plot? It's a solid entry into the series.
