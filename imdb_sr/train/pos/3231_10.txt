The soldier is not a great movie, and everyone who hates him has many good reasons. But I really liked the Soldier, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me was me. As far as science-fantastic backgrounds are concerned, the soldier did things with more design than 90% of the genre. Kits, costumes and props were consistently and competently derived; I did not like their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort. For me, this made a movie worth the time it took to watch. Second, I am fan of Kurt Russell. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable films of my youth ... Barefoot Eksecutive and his films John Carpenter. The soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. It is not an award-winning role, but Kurt collects persuasive emotions with VERY small dialogue. Thirdly, the fighting scenes and battles are well choreographed. This is not an iron monkey, or even a matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre. Action movies, pick them up if you pass by your dock for rent. Just do not expect the next Bladerunner.
