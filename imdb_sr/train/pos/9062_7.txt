I watched this funny movie this weekend. and I really like it. All the children are sweet, who remind me of my childhood with this stupid reflection. It's a real entertainment movie for a family group over the weekend, which can make lots of memories and ports. Child humor always works. And nice acting. A simple story, but cool recording. Good job for the director to find a way for a child. When it comes to a movie about a child, I mean "12 and holding". Another one this year, but the aspect of the child's world, which is real and cruel, is different. great work. H2EFV focuses on the happy side of childhood, which every child and family need. п.с. Tvitch, I think, is a voice Not from "Finding Nemo".
