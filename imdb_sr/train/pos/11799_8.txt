Good summary of the real event! Well, actually, I was not there, but I think it was so. I think there are two typical American views: "Communist" and parallels with Adolf Hitler. This should be visible to most independent observers. In any case, Boothe has a great performance, like many other famous actors. The last twenty minutes of the film is unbearable - and I really mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (That's why it's so terrible - it all happened, and it probably looked exactly like that). But, in fact, did this last scene at the air station really happen?
