I was raised to Doc Savage and was petrified by green death as a child, but even then, as now, I found it to be fun. , they have agreed to generally think I'm weird, but there you are. "I do not know what the doctor is doing, but he always gets girls" must be the end line when you look at his sad group of men. This film is a classic gossip for all the super hero's genres, and it was the time before time came, you do not need to take it seriously, cross over Austin Povers. Ron Eli is God. It's sad that this film was not released on DVD in the UK. I do not think the spear should be transformed, as I said it's a classic, it can not be done without Ron (as an Italian job without Mini and Michael Caine). I give 10/10.
