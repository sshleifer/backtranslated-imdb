The fake travel of Bila and Teda is possibly the highest quality film I've ever seen. Although acting and landscape, etc. The poor, who cares. The story is brilliant, and jokes and words that they come up with are great, ideas are great. I recommend everyone to see this classic. The best part is obvious when 'melvin' is death, I was shooting in 10 minutes and missed the next part of the movie. This is much better than the first, which was also great. Perhaps the most entertaining film of all time !!!!! I think the best part of the movie, however, when Bill and Ted shouting greatly and playing solo guitar, it was funny. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, bring out the third movie !!
