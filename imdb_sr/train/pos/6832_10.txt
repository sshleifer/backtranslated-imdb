Beautiful film, clean Cassavetes style. Gene Rovland gives the impressive performance of an actress who is in decline, dealing with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. He tries to avoid his own subconscious spirits, the young girl's death. Accepting yourself, the human condition, although its overall difficulty, is the true purpose of the film. The parallel between the theater sequences and the film itself is confusing: it's like the stage has become the exit for Heroin. If all American films can only be top-notch, dealing with human relationships at the level of adults, without trying to infiltilize and standardize feelings ... One of the best drama ever. 10/10.
