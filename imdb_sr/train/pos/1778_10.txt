I just want to say that I am glad that someone finally sprayed beans on this movie. Bravo "Spaz", Bravo! This movie is a funny movie farce. Especially for student film! I just want to give a confession to Spazz that he took the absurd amount of time of care to find such a rare picture, and then I DO A COMMENT! Most people I know do not have that much time, especially so few of them will finish reading. Honor to you, sir! In any case, the film follows a tiny story that is at least incredible and just stupid. I understand the idea of ​​creating Charlie's Angels satire, but why to hire such evil actresses! Also, what the director did, worked, wrote, created and edited the picture! Choose one job and put all your love into it! It's a shame to hear that he made a good movie about the toothbrush brush. Again, thanks to Spazz's pull-out curtain on this movie, people like you are a rare phenomenon.
