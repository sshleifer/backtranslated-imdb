I really like what I've seen so far. Of course, the animation is not the best, but honestly, I'd rather see this type of more cartoon style fast and cheap than the old type of style that is done quickly and cheaply (which is more and more often and more often - it's just a style that looks good when in it takes a lot of time and effort.There is nothing wrong with the corner lines and the small eyes of the black dot-in fact, I think it's really sweet.As a kid, I never thought that Scooby-Doo's design was particularly sweet, but I think it would be me I like it better. In any case, Shaggi has always been my favorite the character, and I believe it or not, but I think he has the greatest potential for some depth. Of course, the show does not focus on the original theme "Mystery-solution," but that was just a tired old formula anyway, do not misunderstand me - I'm sure there are writers who will be able to bring much more interest in the traditional activities of Misteri Inc. (which is late), but in the meantime this is a funny departure from the standard. Shaggi and Scooby are still funny, but they're not just comical. They are still cowardly, but they finally have the opportunity to use what looks like (shock!) Intelligence. They are the same old overweight as always, but now they seem to be dealing with their lives with the help of Uncle Albert's succession. Be pure cheese and unintentionally ridiculous at best, but this emission actually has the capacity of real humor. Likewise, I never really liked Casey Kasem as Shaggi, so the new actor does not irritate me as much as other people. (I still think Billy West was the best, though). All in all, although not a great cartoon within all cartoons, there is still an achievement among other Scooby incarnations.
