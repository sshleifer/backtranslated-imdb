It's really a good phenomenon of horror that concerns the biggest, Boris Carloff and White Lugos. Dr Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on an expedition in Africa trying to find an ancient meteor. After finding him, Rukh was poisoned by radiation. Everything that touches dies, and the dark side of Rukha makes it an egotistical killer. His friend, dr. Felik Benet (Lugosi) finds a limited cure for the problem and at the same time understands that radiation can be used for the benefit of humanity by treating the disease. Two beings will fight for the possibility of radiation. Pretty good special effects. Others in the actors: Frances Drake, Frank Lavton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
