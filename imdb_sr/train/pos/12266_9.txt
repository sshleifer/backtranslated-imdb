Imagine I missed this big cultural event last night on Swedish TV, and only because my girlfriend insisted on turning on the TV (so it would be easier for her to fall asleep!) If I had found it (I saw an ad for but of course he forgot about it and looked forward to 'early night' ...). In any case - this must certainly be a rather unusual idea - based on Documentary on an interview recorded with sound just 30 years ago. But with animated and other documentary film material, a really good and insightful portrait of one of the most appreciated writers of the 20th century - Georges Remia aka Herge - is added. I will surely read my Tintin albums with a different eye after seeing this movie, making it easy to link variations in style and content to different periods in Herge's life (and I can tell you that I will get as soon as possible a few which they do not have). Of course, my album perception has changed over the past 25 years that I already read them, as well as my opinion on which albums are my favorites, but it adds (at least) another dimension to them.
