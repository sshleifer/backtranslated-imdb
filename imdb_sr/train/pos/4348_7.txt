Paul Reiser is moving away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warm, witty and gentle, gentle story of the family - what we see and what we do not see, what we are expecting and what surprises us. THE STATE OF MY FOLKS does not set new standards for the film, but it is a well-told story that reminds us of the important connections that the family represents. Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) was a workaholic, sometimes pushing his wife Muriel (Olimpia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lidia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) in the background. One day Muriel leaves a message that after years of marriage he leaves! Her daughters, along with Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately begin searching for her place of residence, leaving confused and hurt and unhappy to Solve things on a journey with her son Ben. Traveling is a time for two men to learn who each one is and what they mean for their father and son status as family members. He relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces Ben's radoholder into the enjoyment and fun of life. The journey ends with a phone call about where Muriel is and why she left and the regurgitation of a wiser family is attracted by the warm ending of the story. Everything was not what it seemed: it was better and better. Falk and Reiser play each other as professionals, but in many ways the movie belongs to short moments when Olimpia Dukakis is on the screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs in the film.
