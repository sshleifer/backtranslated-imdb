'Preskue Rien' is a beautifully portrayed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Fleeing from stereotypes and preaching, it's a beautiful naturalistic film, superbly acting, captured with a sense of the coastal town in which action takes place, never melodramatic but often painfully real. If anything is too realistic, because there are few ways on a conventional plot, only scenes from life. But the absence of conventional dramatic tension is less important than it might have been in such a subtly drawn world. 'Preskue Rien' may not be the most exciting film ever made; but his simple humanism serves well in comparison with pre-conceived celebratory or intolerable attitudes that often obstruct the treatment of this topic. It's worth the clock.
