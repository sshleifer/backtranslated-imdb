Opinions: Pure joy from beginning to end. Not a rebellion of laughter, but rather a subtle, sophisticated humor. What a golden mine of great scenes and acting actors, including Reginaldo Denni, Nestor Pau, Ian Volfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr. at that moment, when it's framed. The young carpenter, played by the future Tarzan Lek Barker, asks him if he wants his "bitchies to be screwed" or something such a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to look like an ignoramus, replies affirmatively. In addition, Barker shouts to his companions, "OK guys, he wants to screw them up, so .... IANK 'EM OUT!" A second later you hear ripping and breaking sounds of about 20 large nails drawn from various boards. All that Grant can do is to groan. Yes, the film is dated. You would never see that many carpenters work at one time at a family home, and in such a place, in Connecticut in all places, they will probably start a few million dollars. Classic movie that is really treasure.
