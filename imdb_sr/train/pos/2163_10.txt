I just love this movie. This is the perfect example of well-rounded amazing stories that come out of Asian movies. It was the recent Hollywood remake of this film, with Richard Gere and simply terrible Jennifer Lopez. Please do not mess with the two films. The original Japanese film was touching, subtle and beautifully behaving. The Hollywood version is exactly the opposite. I was horrified when I first saw a trailer for a revised version of the US and who played it. It is a typical Hollywood non-genuine brutal commercialism at its worst. The remake argues that some foreign films can never be improved. The only reason why the original film did not become widely viewed is the repulsiveness of the American audience towards the titles. One of the main reasons why this film would never work in the American story is that it is reserved, ultra socially conservative. In this film, it is about the character of a public Japanese person. Certainly the main character wakes up to a fuller understanding of the life of living through dance, but half the tension of the film comes from the stereotypes and ridicule of dancers in Japan. Try to see this movie in its original form, not in a horrible whole screen. And please skip American remakes ... it's a shallow travesty compared to the original Japanese movie. Yes, I know that the "original" movie is much older, and this is simply a Japanese movie Accept the story, but only two people will soon see this and the new American remake. When we are already in foreign films, I will make a few recommendations: 1. Monsoon wedding - this is the first one I listed for the reason, an extraordinary movie! 2.Johnni Stechino-Veri funny Italian fik! 3. Shiri-Korean action pic that combines Asian flare and American style 4. Run Lola Run-a German film that integrates ingeniously with techno parti. <br /> Well, however, just a quick list:)
