David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... if it sounds weird to you, then you are right because you are. People are famous for their scripts with the moral implications of what is right and wrong, He covered these themes in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and almost all of his scripts have something to do with that. Paul Anderson's first successful film was a violent thriller. It's not surprising that all his other films are! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications! The human scenario is quite obvious in the first half of the film. Soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill and never had a normal life. They were replaced by better, genetically modified soldiers, and Todd, one of the original soldiers, was left on the planet and left dead. There he has to deal with a group of refugees, some want to stay and others hate him and there is an interesting drama. ALSO ... ... bullets start to fly as new soldiers cross the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all people. There is a large, violent, loud action, and Peoples script turns into Anderson's action fest. It's hard to believe that the script is written in this way, but the end product is better than I expected. It's fun, a bit, though, of course not, challenging thinking and exciting when the action starts. 7/10 Rated R: A lot of violence
