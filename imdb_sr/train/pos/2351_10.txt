First, I want to make it clear that the inability of the average user to appreciate the imagination is terrible. What makes this performance so unique is the hyper-reality it creates. You do not need to know why Ned can return people from the dead, or why it can only be for a minute. Where the childhood miracle disappeared, similar to A Vrinkle and Time. I say it's refreshingly genuine because it's a polar contrast to the masses of the TV that is turned off. does not leave room for imagination or wonder. It's nice to add a little escapism to television experience. Hyper-reality is my favorite aspect of the show. Scenes from the 1950s, innocent and rare characters, and landscape and physical environments that are not considered pure reality. This performance masks the morbid nature of death, while others accept it. While entertaining, other television shows took the back of this series. He really renewed the sense of curiosity, imagination and wonders on television. The dagger pressure quickly reached the top of my list.
