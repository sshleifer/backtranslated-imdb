One of my favorite films, with a very nostalgic ending. The movie is about the Sullivan family, it's obvious that Michael Sullivan (father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the killer who says this, and expert. One of the kids wants to know what his father is doing (a terrible mistake), hiding on his father's car and good, seeing Tom Hanks in action to say so. Mafia no Rules, in Mafia no one wins, when they want you out, pull you out. Of course, you can see anyone working in a mafia with a huge house, the best car in the world, whatever you want, but do the wrong thing, or do something your boss does not want and you're fired You can see what I want I say in the movie, Sullivan Jr. he saw something he did not have to see, and well, almost all his family was killed for this "wrong thing". his son. The movie is really fun, you see how Sullivan lives after the mafia is hunting it, or somehow. This film is kind of sad, shows us revenge, those dirty jobs that people do, almost everything you like. I hope the guy reading this comment does not work for the mafia, and if you work in the mafia, make yourself a favor and exit the country before the boss and their workers kill you. This film receives: 10/10
