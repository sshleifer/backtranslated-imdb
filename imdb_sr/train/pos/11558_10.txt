"Unusual Couple" is one of those films that far outstrips his reputation. People all know it, they're buzzing, they complain that they live with a messy "Oscars" or a disgusting "Felix" ... but they sell a movie without knowing it. It's not just a regular guy who lives with a messy guy; It's a portrait of two friends who help each other through the divorce agony. It's also damn funny from the beginning to the end, but it's the kind of comedy that comes from realistic, stressful and free situations. So, some viewers really thought that the film was a little uncomfortable, but I think its credibility is its strength. Besides, Matthau's bulldog's face just cracked me! My favorite comedy.
