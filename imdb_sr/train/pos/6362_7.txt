I allowed that I saw some "Speed ​​Racer", but I never watched it, and I saw other shows in which these characters were dressed like birds that flew a boat called Phoenix, and the other revolves around a spaceship that looked ghastly Ocean. the vessel occasionally flew back for some reason and it was really dark and difficult to understand for someone who may have been five years old. This, although I've watched almost every episode and astounding for me at the time, it was that this show had some resolution. In fact, they ended up, the bad guys did it unlike almost every American cartoon film where nothing actually ended up like the last episode of the Transformers generation that ended up with Galatron and this new bad guy who committed the autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with children never home, with GI Joe and Cobra still ready to try again and so on and so on. This guy finished and he had a pretty cool robot who got a new weapon while the shov had progressed, it was a bit smooth because he could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons. As it continues, it got cool, like the one that was used by Android 16 against Cell in Dragonball Z, and then the weapon evolved to include razors that fired. Then the great robot even had wings to fly and more weapons were built into the wings. He would also get several allies in a female robot and a pretty funny Bobo in America. Zlikovci consisted not only of Dr. Hell, but also a very strange person who was half a man half-witted and a flying-head type. It was an interesting show and it was nice to see the conclusion.
