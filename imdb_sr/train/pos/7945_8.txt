I am a lover of animal films. If you can take a plot and put the animals as the main players, you will usually win me. Homevard Bound did exactly that. They took a plot that was as old as time and put a new bandage on. It was a complete success. It's essentially an archetypal movie. You have a common group (shadow) that is wise and logical, you have a light, but impudent and unbelievable chance, and a princess who thinks she should be pampered and praised. These three figures are well-off. I also like that coincidence and Sassi made such dynamic characters, and they did not exceed it. Most people say it can not be good, because it's too much children's movie. What they forget is, however, that this is allegedly a children's movie, which still does not take away the film. This is a good movie to watch when you're bored and you just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie without cartoons, a movie about a plane with a better complication. I would, without a doubt, advise you to watch it.
