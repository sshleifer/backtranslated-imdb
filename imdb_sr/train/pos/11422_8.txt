Cherries Claire Denis is a beautiful but frustrating movie. The film is a very interesting look at the household of the European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often inadequate. For example, the central theme in the story is the inability of young France to form solid relationships with others. Although this portrayal has been performed impeccably, especially in the way Denis turns his story from French return to the home from childhood, the lack of intimacy of the girl with other characters of the film makes it difficult for the viewer to invest a lot of interest in her development (or without her) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of film character development makes it difficult to engage in a loosely organized plan. The film raises a great tension between characters, especially between Aimee and men in her life, but never completely does not deal with these social trunks, leaving the viewer unhappy. The last few scenes are powerful, but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you are looking for a movie with an adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.
