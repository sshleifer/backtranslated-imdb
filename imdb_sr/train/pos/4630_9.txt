This is the second Eitan Fok movie I've seen. Fantastic actor Lior Ashkenazi, who played in Valk on Water, also has a smaller role in this film. But real stars are young Israelis who live together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad) Knoller, Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Ielli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian who joins them - Ashraf (Iousef 'Joe' Sveid). There is some sort of Friend / Sex in the city that happens (mostly gay), and they all want to end the war so they can continue their lives in peace. But, this is the rub. Regardless of how many posters you set or how much you were for peace, the war will not end. For many years, many have tried to bring two sides to the table, but they just want to continue it for any reason. Many are on the Israeli side, and there and here in the US, who only want everything and will not consider peace. It's a lot on the Palestinian side that would obviously be out of work for peace to come. Nobody is interested in ending this war, and children are suffering. This is always your memory while watching this fun and interesting movie. It will not disappear. You know that something tragic will happen and, of course, it will happen. With strong feelings on both sides and revenge as a motivator, tragedy always happens and this is what makes this version of Sex / Sex in the city an adult. No superficiality. It was a real life, and it was great to see.
