This show is a great story about history. It has everything from slavery, the way in which they are treated, the religions, the ways Jews hide, the inquisition, the faith in the African gods of Orisha, the ways in which women are treated, including their daughters. Even homosexuality. The manner in which the characters are intertwined and this Violante, this character sues me. She is so desperate to be loved to destroy everything around her. I'm glad they decided to reissue it. again. Although I would like to see an unregistered version. Xia became my heroine. I look at the way I use my power to help everyone who is looking for it. I love all the characters and have discovered that they can refer to many people now in this century. I look forward to seeing my daughter every night. It would be great to call him in English, so the Americans can love too.
