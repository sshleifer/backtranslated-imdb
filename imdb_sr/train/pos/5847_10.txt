Although this series only led the season, it remained with me for 20 years. It was far and far above all of my favorites ever. I would give almost everything to it on a DVD or any other format. If you find any way to see this series, I suggest you take full advantage. This series was the first (in my opinion) to have a truly coherent story that included several episodes. I also really worried about the characters and what happened to them. Damn, the figure of Goose sometimes scared me. At that time he was so strange. Also, the group leader reminds me of the combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way to contact the creator / bearer of the right to a series and can put them on a DVD, be sure to do it !!!
