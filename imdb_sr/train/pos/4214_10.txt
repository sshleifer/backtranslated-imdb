The best of Seven Fuller's seven films I've seen (including Park Rov, Running Light, Verboten !, Shock Corridor, Naked Kiss, Big Red and this movie), Pickup on Southern Street is counted as one of the best movie ostriches. He represents Fuller at his maximum control. I like it when it's out of control, of course, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Vidmark is a pocket star who steals a microfilm that was supposed to go with communist spies. Jean-Pierre plays a woman who wore a movie for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kilei. Peters is forced to find Vidmark and return it back. She finds him through the pigeon of a chair by Thelma Ritter. Vidmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peters's loyalty (and the fact that she learns to work for the Communists; things from the Cold War are really interesting). A lovely story is done a little quick and is not quite convincing, but it's not so bad to damage a movie (as opposed to Fuller's previous film, Park Rov). Richard Vidmark is great. This must be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I can say so. Thelma Ritter gives the most impressive performance. Her role gives the movie an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this movie is as touching as you will find in the movie. I'll never forget that. 10/10.
