The film is a fantasy. The story is slim, but it serves as a structure on which beautiful singing and singing beautiful songs. (I still can not believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing well.) A part of the dialogue is wonderfully smart. I felt like wearing a fashion show of high fashion from 1942. Movies are designed to serve different purposes. This one is designed to entertain and it certainly is. If I have a negative comment, it's that Nelson Eddie was too old to be a handsome, horrible count. Some of the big plans made me uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing magnificently. However, Jeanette MacDonald was as brilliant as ever. She makes a spectacular angel. This genre is long before my time, and I am new to the movies Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddie and similar conversations. Music in this movie is beautiful. As much as I like classical rock music that fills most modern films, there is no doubt that this music is simply and clearly memorable, beautiful, better constructed. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see in cinemas today. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of plastic surgeons Beverly Hills, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. It is unclear why so many other posters apologize about how this film loves and in general this group of films. They say that he is dated and trying to explain why this is so. And those who do not like it say it's not good, but in relation to what? I think this film will no doubt continue to entertain people when so many other films have long been forgotten. In this film, it is too much quality in every way to not remember and enjoy. I recommend this film without reserve to anyone who appreciates great talent, great beauty and great music.
