I am surprised by the low rating of this film. With all due respect, its low rating is representative of the IK level of those who rated it so bad. You'd rather watch a movie with cheap excitement, a bigger budget, and more blood. The first misconception of people is that this is a horror movie. It's not, nor your film comes into error. It's one thing. It's a psychological thriller. It's for people who really want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. Reel.com's review is a perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All other negative criticisms do not make much sense. Almost as if you are trying to make an original movie for a change - very rarely these days - it's something bad and not worth it. I will uncover some moronic spoofers that said it was boring and not. does not make sense. Marta was cleansing her brain and experimenting herself to be a caring mother while she was really a wicked Nazis who would kill without warning. The proof is everything in pudding and the fact that at first sight, we are sympathetic to this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the film, testifying about the direction and the writing of the film. Definitely I feel. that this film should at least be ranked in the very sixth range of originality. I recommend this film to people at the other end of the IK Scale - known as smart people - since this movie is obviously corrupted by those who would rather watch Scream or Freddi's Nightmare. Honor plays as well. For such a low-budget movie, you're amazed that this film did not hit your local cinema with great direction, writing, and acting. Please do not fool you IMDb. This film pays off. I actually recommend buying a movie, because the first look at the rental will not do this justice.
