The King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a shockingly beautiful and deeply touching movie. He has won 16 awards from around the world, and this film is based on the true story of Vang Bianlian, a street actor from the 1930s in China who is older but has no heir to pass on his art of opera to change his face. It has a unique talent of rapidly changing masks in performance, and no one knows how it works. He has the desire to have a grandson, because his art is a family heritage that can be transferred only to a male heir. Then we go to the streets and see that people are selling their children because they can not afford to take care of them: some even beg for their daughters for free, because daughters are not worth much in this society. The story of Vang Bianliana continues from there. The film was so amazingly good, the acting was amazing, and the questions were so heavy and well addressed. There is a gender inequality and a depressing fact that nobody wants a girl at this time and place. It is also interesting that the famous opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as a living body, a man dressed as a woman, and while he is known and respected, he considers himself to be a low, half woman. As we go further into the film, we are confronted with the issues of trafficking in human beings and his demands, and thus by the lack of a possible solution to this, brutality and corruption of the army and the police, and the helplessness and lack of power of each individual. face for unhappy events or even good intentions. This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Vang Bianlian, is another wonderful show.
