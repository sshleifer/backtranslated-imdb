"The father is still at work" was the title of a review after the "Promise me this" premiere in Cannes. I understand why many think it is the same, but the unique expression of Kusturica is still present in his new film and that something is why critics can not touch him. I had two hours of clean energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from a lack of concentration or fear of empty space, he is still unique and intact. Amazingly good performance by Stribor Kusturica. Much more big plans and less landscapes than "Life is a Miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a fatal potential of the world class, do not spoil it. I certainly recommend everybody to see this movie.
