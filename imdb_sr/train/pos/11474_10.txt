This film is one for ages. First, I have to say after I once saw this, it has become one of my favorite films of all time. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director) has compiled the real work. Where 99.9% of movies are pure entertainment these days, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us the reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. The main media is turning around and rolling, but Ben Coccio looks at school in the face, able to go where no other kind of media has left before, into the minds and hearts of two young men who are planning to kill their colleagues. Although it's certainly graphic and frightening, how can that not be? The gloves are removed, the lies and sugar coating of our media masters is thrown aside and we are taken to a place where we can find the truth in what happened. Sometimes it's not just a screw like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, more human, we've shown that these guys are us and we are them. The society left them behind and the consequences are terrifying and real. Respect and love your loved ones. A lesson that we all need to learn, thank you very much for making this film, Mr. Coccio, I hope with a great expectation that you will continue your film career.
