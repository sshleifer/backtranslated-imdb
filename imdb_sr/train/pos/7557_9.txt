Gender Bender Limerick: <br /> <b> Man or Woman? Who knows? It turned out to be "it" both. Sleep in the clay Then everybody left In one of their UFOs. Rod Bender is another great episode in the season. I enjoy this because the story is a sort of thing you never know what will happen again. It's completely original. The zipper is very fun with a close eye view and a reflection of the disco light. I really have to learn my own trick with the fingers that the sexual agent has. I really like the atmosphere in the small village of Kindred, and Mulder and Scully are sneaking in the middle of the night. It's very exciting. This is one of my favorite episodes of the season 1. I think what I like very much is that ultimately freaks out and left the crop circles. Many people see this as a non-mythological episode similar to extraterrestrial, such as "Unnatural" or "Space", but I think it could easily be considered a related mythology. Perhaps the parent was like an alien hunter and could look like someone else. Huh? In any case, I will give the episodes 9 out of 10.
