The story is about a girl who grows in colonial Africa, but it's much more than that. Anyone who grows up in the South will experience the same things. Longing for another, different race, which can not be consumed. Even the view is forbidden. No words are needed. Their facial expressions say everything. It is a story of black slime, Protea (Isaach De Bankole) and white woman Aimee (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for each other is so strong that they are mutually bothered because they can not have one another. She really can not see this dance. One of the more ardent aspects of the movie is the laziness of the colonial. I can not even take my bed for myself. There the world is in the place; they do not know that yet. Their racist attitudes will be erased by their presence. I think I would like to visit this Africa. It looks so quiet; especially at night when you hear only animals.
