Sisters in the law will be theatrically announced March 24 in Sweden. A good opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It is presented in Gothenburg along with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto, the "director in focus" of the festival. She held a masterpiece, highly valued, talking about her method as a documentary film and told the audience about the special circumstances that led her to shoot Sisters twice in the law: the first version was lost forever, so that another photo was organized and turned out to be a movie in the end different. A rather terrible problem happened, in this case, to create the possibility of a very strong film.
