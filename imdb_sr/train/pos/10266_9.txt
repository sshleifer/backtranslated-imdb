The House of Games has a strong story in which obsession and illusion play a big role. The psychologist offers to help the patient with his gambling debts and be caught in the game. Have you ever felt the fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong? Watch what happens if you continue with this need and you go to the end. Sit on the edge of your chair while cheaters are deceived and victims are turned into perpetrators. You're never sure who exactly is in this movie. This is both the quality and the lack of scenarios. As the film finishes, you feel the story has little consistency. But all of this is largely offset by excellent psychological development. This is definitely one of the best movies about gambling.
