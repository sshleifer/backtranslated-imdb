I will do this briefly and sweetly, because I think you can not tell a lot about someone about this show that has never been seen before, except for his funny and unique, for her probably the funniest shows ever. You need to really watch to understand her humor and it took me a few episodes to really get into it, but once you do not come back. For example, the way Hides character always wants to see his friends in some sort of trouble, the more that happens, the more fun it is. It's all classic, I mean actors, writers, directors, it's just a recipe for success. One actor I think is always difficult is Ashton Kutcher, but I think he's great in this show, I do not think it's possible that Kelso's character was played by anyone else, it's important for someone to play somebody stupid. All the main characters are great and it would not be worth a look if I did not mention the stone cold fox Mila Kunis, now it's a spooky match with a ball that jokes aside an incredible show.
