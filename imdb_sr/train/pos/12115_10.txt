Another comment on this film made it sound bad. The giveaway pictures were so new - I think the script and the acting were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She has not yet found her style that we expected. Still, it's great to see it this way - still learning the craft. So many clich√©s came from this movie and it seems that this movie has lit some tracks for the next 70 years. My voice is to see him and remember how young a guy was this type of film. Keep an open mind and you may be shocked how many characters have been concerned about this picture because you were in 1934 and how we watched the early part of the past century as tense. Another negative and one comment.
