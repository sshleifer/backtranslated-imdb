The story of Antwone Fisher's neglect and abuse in childhood is an inspiration to all of us who have witnessed or even experienced the difficulties of home-grown children. Abandoned by an upset mother, Antwone never met his father. Growing up with abusers "going to church" using "n-word" not only to intimidate and hurt, but also as an expression of grace, as a young man who testifies that his best friend was killed in delays, enduring racial insults and teasing him serving in the Navy, Antwone's anger slowly turns into a positive force when advised by a naval psychiatrist, and love enters his life. the most powerful moments in the movie. Stunned by an unexpected conflict, a woman in silence listens to the young man telling him that he lived without crime, drug addiction, reviving the children left and right, all in spite of extremely unfavorable circumstances. If this scene was not strong enough, the next one drives home (and opens the floodgate): Welcome home home Antwone; dozens of smiling faces and open arms that announce that he is part of this large family. One of the messages of this wonderful movie is that there are many well-meaning and honest people working on the help of orphans and unwanted children. Even if some of the homes and administrators do not care and look self-contained, many give it everything. The character who found Antwone's "file" when he discovered the circumstances of his birth is one of those "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. The DVD contains a song in French, different titles. , as well as additional characteristics and information on foster care. As Clevelander I appreciated the snapshots of the location. No matter where you are from, you will be deeply touched by this autobiographical gem.
