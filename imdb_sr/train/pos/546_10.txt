I thought it was one of the best sequences I've seen for a while. Sometimes I felt as if I only wanted someone to die, Stanley's murder of boring characters was great. It was such a well-made movie that you were happy when it died so. My only problem was in some scenes that looked like someone with a home camera was shooting and it was weird. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion, and he was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant movie.
