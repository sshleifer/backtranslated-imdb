The first time I saw this movie a few years ago - and I was hooked in a moment. That's great and much better than J. F. K. because you always have to think: "Can this happen to me? Can I become a killer? You can not turn on the TV or VCR without thinking about the plot and the end, which you should not miss under any circumstances.
