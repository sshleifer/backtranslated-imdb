Mary Streep was incredible in this film. She has an incredible sense of accent, and she shows incredible skills in this movie. I really felt for her when Lindy was persecuted. She played real. She became lascivious, upset and embarrassed while the media and the government continued with their irrepressible witch. At first, I did not expect much from the film, but I really got interested in it, and the film is based on the right person and real events. It turned out to be better than I expected. Neill himself was also outstanding; This is the best work I've seen from him, and I really loved him in other films (Piano, for example). I gave the movie 7, but if I could only evaluate the acting, I would give it 9.5, and the perfect 10 for Streep.
