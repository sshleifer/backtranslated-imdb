Really ... and an incredible movie that although not very popular ... extremely touching and almost changing my life ... it was for me at least. It's definitely worth seeing and buying ..... Added to my favorite movie list .... now is the number one .... This is a very touching movie that all people need to see .. Man in the Moon ..... we will be incredible. It's now my favorite movie and I've only seen it today, and I would recommend it to everyone over 15 years as long as you're a bit mature. I will never get the true meaning and value of this movie .... But it's really incredible .... just watch it because it will change the way some people look at life .... worth seeing
