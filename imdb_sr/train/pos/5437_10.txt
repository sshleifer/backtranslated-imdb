Pandro S. Berman was "In Charge of Production", but he did so by the so-called producer of the line. But who produced this epic, it was not recorded in Arizona, but in the California Mohave Desert, where the collectors fled with all the remains of the "golden temple", the Tuggee cottage, the British branch office in Muria, the village of Tantrapur, etc. Minor technical errors can and must be forgiven. What is unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for best music, although perhaps the Academy did not offer such at that time. One theme is played at various pace, including waltz, march and sweet mood. Brilliant! One of the interesting aspects of production was the request of the widow of Kipling. The actor playing Kipling appears shortly before and after the battles. In the original edition of his scene, they were cut out, according to Ms. Kipling's requests. Later they were involved and "connected" Kipling's immortal song with Ben Hecht's script. Interestingly, this very typical and pro-British story came from a great screenwriter who hated the British himself.
