I was always a big fan of this movie, first of all, did you see the acting, the acting is great and help this film go very well. Cibill Shepherd received great criticism for her role, and they were deserved. The beginning of this film begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cibill), whose perfect marriage in connection with the picture, is causing delays when her husband Louie suddenly dies. Luckily, Louse gets another shot in life when she agrees to be "recycled" back to the ground as a newborn Alec Finch (Robert Dovnei, JR). Alek continues to live her new life by forgetting her past life, while Corinne is trying to keep up with her. But fate crosses the path of Alex, 23 years later, when she meets Corin's daughter Miranda (Marie Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly overwhelmed with the wealth of unwanted memories (this is where the party begins and the unpleasant situations arise), the heart is very sweet. You will not be disappointed if you give him a chance, chances are you will like it. Very funny and sweet!
