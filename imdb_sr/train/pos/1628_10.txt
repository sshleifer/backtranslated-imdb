This is not at least one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Beginning with four delinquents sent by their fathers to the Military Academy in Vienberg, there is a tone that continues throughout this film, not for a moment. It's hard to try to describe this movie; the elements of humor are so striking and brilliantly understood that at first glance it seems like nothing more than stupid 80s teen comedies. But that's a lot more than that! Fresh from the minds of these people from the magazine MAD, Up the Academi serves a formula and style that I have never seen before duplicated from any of the "most fun" offers that came out last year from Hollywood. Basically, the film is full of infantile corn material that you can assume that the writers were a couple of 14 years old. Watch this movie if you like to act "immature". Classic. *****
