Kureishi was not very blessed with films that justify the quality of his writing. Recent adapted travesty like 'Intimacy' has destroyed a lot of writing. But Mother surpasses all her previous incarnations, obscuring even my beautiful laundry. A middle-aged woman overcomes the widow by having a very difficult relationship with her boyfriend's emotionally weak daughter. The fact that you believe that all this is a merit for the quality of the acting, as well as for the final gift of writing. And with Daniel Craig, we have a passionate, stupid, rude anti-hero who refuses the audience to ever wonder why a young kid would think about the linen that was playing down the grandmother. Beautifully captured, the film fails only in the poor display of peripheral characters, but as a study of unimaginable lust, it is a winner.
