This is the best picture of baseball since Redford hit the natural way. Dennis Kuaid and Rachel Griffiths illuminate the screen with a great storyline and a movie that seemed to be true enough to attract you into their lives. Swamped by dreams - a drop in reality, the American dream is growing again after 9.11. Australian born actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays western West Texas better than many Texans I know; and Dennis Kuaid was perfection? throw it like a wannabe, dumb and modest winner with so much psychological luggage as an average audience in the audience. That's right. Chemistry on the screen works. If you love baseball heaters, you love this movie. Ingredients for Americans and apple pies were there. My popcorn became a modality. And buy a CD! Music rocks and transmits the story magnificently! Synchronizing words and music moves the story exactly as it should, an area that disappoints me more often. Critics: I would give baseball to someone else. But Kuaid has something to teach us about character and heart. Sv. Rita and the nuns were beautiful decorations, but they never found their place in the story to open and close around. A little long. Worth every minute in the last analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
