Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his best films in his historical career in this very tense and extremely shocking story of a family that involves dysfunctional as one of the children. With the list of A-list headed by Philip Seimour Hoffman (Performance by Oscar), Ethan Havke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finnei, Lumet recorded not only elements of bad stories about crime such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories like Ordinary People. Many viewers can be confused and feel unprepared to build a plot with which Lumet went here. Instead of displaying it linearly, he went to the Tarantino route and showed the central scene of the robbery that was wrong from different points of view, and everything is wrong. Personally I thought this was very satisfying and left me constantly to guess what would happen next. The scenario is very strong with excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffmann and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All actors are fully interested in watching, and Lumet obviously entertains in directing a style that usually does not permeate. Many of the actions and uncertainties that hold the audience for two hours, this is a rare movie that did not disappoint in a moment.
