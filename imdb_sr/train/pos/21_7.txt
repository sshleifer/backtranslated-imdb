This may not be an unforgettable classic, but it's a touching romance with an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and destructive careers and life's consequences for every unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill. The story revolves around Iris, a widow who meets a fellow employee at her factory workplace, illiterate cafeteria workers named Stanley. Iris reveals that Stanley is not able to read, and after losing his job, he gives him reading hours at home in his kitchen. Of course, as you can anticipate, the two of them, although initially cautious about it, develop feelings for each other ... Jane Fonda competently plays Iris, a woman with her own problems, who faced with a job without perspective, two teenage children (one pregnant woman), an unemployed sister and her husband. However, Robert De Niro, of course, is brilliant in his precious display of intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, Stanley, bringing dignity to a respectful respect. They are not your typical charming young young couple, as is usually shown in romances on the screen, but the ordinary working class, a middle-aged couple with a pretty bad land. I will not give the end away, but it is a wonderful, cordial romance and personal view in the worrying issue of adult illiteracy, although from the perspective of the fictional character.
