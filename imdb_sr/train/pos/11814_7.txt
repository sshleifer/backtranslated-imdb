Usually, when we use the word "escapist", we think negatively; A large version of Warren Beattie's "Dick Tracy" proves that "escapist" can be good. This is really a fun movie. As an eponymous, brutally dressed, fearless head character, Beatty creates a detective whom we all can relate: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses. From there, the other characters are almost themselves. Tes Truehart (Glenne Headley) is glamorous as it would be expected that the husband of any fighter for the crime would be; Without breath, Mahonea (Madonna) is probably the most unpredictable person; Big Boi Caprice (Al Pacino) is an average villain: relentless, but cool. Other characters include Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), challenged by speeches, over-music 88 Keis (Mandi Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dike, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seimour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathi Bates also play. Oh, wait a minute. I did not explain the plot! The action includes Tracy, trying - and by now - to find some way to catch Big Boi. At the same time, there are some very bizarre events happening in the city, and their answers may or may not be closer than everyone thinks. Of course, the main thing in this movie is that it's fun to watch. If Varren Beatty had problems with his age, then he used it well. "Dick Tracy" is a cool movie.
