Gandhi My father is a well-made movie. Gladi's eldest son, Haril, beautifully portrays life. His character, his differences with his father, his love for the family, his desire to fit his own, his failure, his ego .. Aksha Khanna fully justifies the role of Harilal. Not just him, they all went well in the roles they played. Darshan Jarivala is the best Gandhi I saw. But I will shorten three points because there were several drawbacks. First, the film was fifteen-twenty minutes longer than it was supposed to be. Second, the film needed more research on Harry's character. Somewhere, the figure seemed incomplete. Also, his relationship with the brothers is not shown. There was no mention of any other Gandhi child in the entire film. I believe that a character like Harilal should have at least some difference between his brothers, considering the egoistic nature of Harryl. Recommended ...
