The whole of this movie is worth watching only for the magnificent final moment - his best ending of any movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, simply beautiful. This film was wonderful, even with a French film that is taking too seriously. I liked it - it's a great love story. And I liked the way the Algerians were wired - and by the way, the music during the final points is excellent. I want a CD!
