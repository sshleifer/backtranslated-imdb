I watched it on an 8-hour flight and (probably because of pressure and altitude) I actually considered it mildly entertaining (emphasis on "mild"). : A woman dies, the bride falls in love with someone else, she decides to take care not to connect, but ultimately let them do it. Unfortunately, the film was not so good. OK, there were a few laughs and the actors were all doing well. But from the beginning, the plot was as predictable as the flight destination I was on. I think that the whole story about gay-but-gay friends could be much better. The speech parrot was a good idea, but to be honest: it was not so funny. In short, the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me, but it was close to the call.
