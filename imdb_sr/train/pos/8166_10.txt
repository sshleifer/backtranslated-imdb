This movie is great! The acting is fine, with the excellent casting of Corbin Bernsen as a perfectionist dentist who curses and tortures his patients. At first, he sees his wife with a pool, then crazy. He also refreshes his wife and swimming pool, next to the torturers. Most of the special effects are also nice, though some are really fake (like a tongue that was laid out one night outside and this morning is still red). But the torture scenes are absolutely well made. Although this film has a weak point that is very slow; between heavy parts are sometimes only extremely boring parts. But for a real horror / thriller fan this is a must watch!
