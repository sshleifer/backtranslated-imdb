This was a great movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) liked this movie, including me. The music was fantastic. No, the horses do not speak, but instead the story is told by the Spirit. And to hear the story told by the horse's attitude if the view is fun. I think the title says everything, "ghost". This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I must say that my four-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl are really touched by this movie, and even so I got into it, so they laughed and eventually cheered for the spirit. Enjoy the "Spirit" with your family and raise your spirit with this warm story. Your children will like you. I think you will.
