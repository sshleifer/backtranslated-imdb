I have to agree with Cal-37 that this is a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the girl is really talented and cute, of course Jim Belushi has earned his tape! But I want to like a piano song, if you're a musician or you're not watching this movie just because of that, you'll know what it is. "You are nobody until someone loves you" Written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock and James Cavanaugh. So have fun watching See you, Nelson
