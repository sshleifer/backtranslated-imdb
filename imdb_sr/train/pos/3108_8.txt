This war seems to make the CIA look like a very stupid organization. In reality, they may have. After all, the way the action takes place in this way looks like one man has the power to sanction the killing of everyone, including his own people, to kill Jason Bourne. while Bourne was trying to stay one step ahead of the murder of the entire movie. He's still trying to remember who he was and how he came where he is. She gets help from a few people and it seems like every minute of a movie, someone is trying to kill him. There is little time to rest in this movie and action sequences look very realistic. There are many sequences in the search for a climbed camera which in some way contributes to realism and makes it seem less Hollivood than many images. These sequences add realism to the movie in the feelings. The tension in some sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone will die or if Bourne can deny them. This is the kind of action uncertainty you are going to see when you want to have fun and I'm sure this will lead to the next movie in the series.
