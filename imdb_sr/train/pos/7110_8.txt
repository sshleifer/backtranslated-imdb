John Garfield plays a Marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting in Guadalcanal and must learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypical notions of blindness and is sure to be a burden to everyone. The hospital staff and his fellow wounded marines can not reach him. Neither his girlfriend can return home to Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self-pity, and prejudices. This is a complex role Garfield undoubtedly wears in a great performance that keeps viewers in spite of the omnipresent syrup melody. The best scenes are in Guadalcanal, where in the machine gun nest trying to defend the progressive Japanese soldiers in a hellish night battle, and later in the dream sequence at the hospital where he sees himself walking along the platform platform with a white cane, dark glasses, and holding a tin cup, all while his girlfriend is walking backwards from the camera.
