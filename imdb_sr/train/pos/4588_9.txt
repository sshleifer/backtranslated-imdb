Rated PG-13 for Violence, Short Sexual Humor and Drug Content. Kuebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I saw a police story several times now. In my opinion, the police story is Chan's best 80s film. he did it because he did not like another police movie in which he played the Protector. I did not see the patron so I can not compare it. The acting is not too bad and the plot is pretty good. I remember the actions well because I saw this movie some time ago, but what I remember is that this film has many great actions, acrobacies and comedy just what Chan film needs. If you can find a police story and then you're a Chan fan buying this movie! Time works: 106min 9/10
