When I first saw it, I was really impressed. The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially at the end. Throughout the story, spectators can expect Richard to really kill Thomas or do it first. life.It's amazing. Every time I watch it I enjoy it! Of course he's pretty violent as any action movie, but I think that's acceptable. Thank you very much, Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Incredible movie, I advise everyone to see it. I'm sure people will not regret it and will really be having fun.
