This movie has everything. It is a classic outline of events surrounding the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is just one of the thousands who have the opportunity to choose their fate in America. This film, but extremely accurate display of Miamis's empire of drugs is astounding. Brian DePalma does the incredible job that leads this picture, so that the viewer becomes involved with the story, and with every character in the acting. With the pressure of Tony's characters that is so convincing and strong, Brian DePalma defends the unbridled talent of Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Marie Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Toni's Sister), Roberta Loggie (Frank, Toni's Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I enjoyed watching each movie at any time, and I still watch it on a weekly basis. This year, the twentieth anniversary of this classic crime film, I am, in truth, a true believer that in 20 years people will continue to talk about this film in staggering numbers. With other drama films that are so dramatic, this film is a shock to the system.
