I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television series made. Both stand out in my mind because, unlike the early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: LPG, these were good shows, but there was no overall theme or action that linked all the episodes. In many ways, you can usually watch shows completely out of order, without the difficulty of understanding what's happening. This is less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with his gigantic battles that have been going on in the last season) and other TREKs, because there were more than one major story that united them. This coherence seems to have evolved as a concept with BABILON 5 and this has been seen to a greater extent with SG-1. The conclusion is that this series in many ways was like watching a family or a long novel that slowly takes shape. Of course, there were several episodes of "throwing" that were not related to others, but that was very few and far between them and also were usually quite entertaining. And when it comes to ridiculous, I loved that SG - from time to time I kept the mood and it was not so terribly serious. In that way I really enjoyed more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love for Homer Simpson - it's really bad that he slowly faded out of the series in later seasons. To really appreciate the SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how complicated the works are. This coherence shows outstanding endurance. And, if you do not like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably not a genre for you.
