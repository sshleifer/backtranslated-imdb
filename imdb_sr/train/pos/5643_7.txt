Mari Pickford ("Born on the Fourth of July" as Angela Moore) is a "Little American" (French heritage); falls in love with Jack Holt (like Karl von Austreim), who moved to America with his German father and the American mother. French-American Raimond Hatton (as Count Jules de Destin of "Fighting Destins") fell in love with Ms. Pickford. The love triangle of the trio eventually ends in France, with the Great War (World War I, in the ni≈°an) complicates their lives considerably. Mainly fun, if propaganda flaved, Cecil B. DeMille film. The torpedoing and sinking of the ship carrying Pikford is a "Titanic". War intrigue is becoming dramatic because Pickford is slowly becoming a secret spy for France, while the Germans take her ancestor. Of course, German lover Holt arrives. It was hard to believe that they had been recognized for so long as he entered for rape, but it was dark; and previous events forced them to believe each other dead. The film goes into its symbolism. Picford is, by the way, Canadian - though a few can deny that she was not a "little American" for all intentions and purposes. BEAUTY to spot the "statists" who later became the main stars of Vallace Beeri, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - in particular, make sure that Mr. Novarro displays "starry" quality during one of the unforgettable sequences of the film: Pickford and a wounded soldier saluting one another while carrying it on the stretcher. Novarro even brings Mari Pickford to write a letter to him; Obviously, he has a future in pictures. Also, in the future, Ben Alekander, who plays the boy "Bobbi", is also linked; he became a trusted child actor and grew up to become a Jack Webb partner at "Dragnet". ******* The Little American (7/12/17) ***** Cecil B.
