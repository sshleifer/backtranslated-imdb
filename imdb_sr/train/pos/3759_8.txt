Two years later ... Bill (Alec Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are becoming close to the stars in the present, but they still need more work in their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted is in public popular history, but then the evil man (Joss Ackland) is ready to kill Bill and Ted by sending a cyborg to destroy them. Cyborgs are sent in the past and actually kill the real Bill and Ted. Now, both are ghosts and have to travel through Heaven and Hell to save themselves and their future. Directed by: Peter Hevitt (Tom & Huck, The Borrowers) made a smart sequel with great visual effects. . Much funnier and funny than the original. Villiam Sadler (The Shavshank Redemption) steals the show as The Grim Reaper. DVD has a good anamorphic Videscreen (1.85: 1) transfer and fine Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. DVD has a theater trailer and a party behind the scenes. This sequel was a Bok Office hit as an original, but it is also (Believe it or not) one of the best sequences ever made (depending on your point of view). George Carlin briefly presents his role again. Pam Grier also appears in a minor role. It's a nice fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
