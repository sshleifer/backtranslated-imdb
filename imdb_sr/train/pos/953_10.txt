A far richer texture and character than classics from the 30s and 50s. George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge, just like he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. The character of Scrooge played by Mr. Scott seems to have jumped from the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought to the screen a richer, more robust but even deeper Scrooge than any of his predecessors in the role of the most cruel man in London in the 18th century. It seems that Mr. Scott has brought Scrooge to a more personal, more understandable but very conflicting level; his role worked with the great authority that Scott always brings to the screen: nevertheless, his usual war voice would sometimes be a whisper, almost as a monologue, because he would celebrate Christmas holidays for one breath, yet he discovered his own human weakness in the next row. He could display the sour and rigid Scrooge, and the incomprehensible, compassionate Scrooge all in the same scene. The truly outstanding performance of the giant of his generation.
