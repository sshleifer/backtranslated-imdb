Dani (Reese Vitherspoon) was always very close to her older sister Maureen (Emili Varfield) until both of them began to fall in love with their neighbor's court (Jason London). But not after a terrible tragedy, the two sisters realize that nothing can separate them and that their love for each other will never disappear. It was a true story of the heart of first love. Probably a painful story about a young love I've ever seen. All acting is incredible and Reese Vitherspoon gives a great performance in his first film. I would give the Man on the Moon 8.5 / 10
