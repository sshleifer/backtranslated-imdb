If you are not in the mood for more than an hour, the movie might give you some variation. What I love are constant surprises. Not only do you want to continue one or more short movies in 'New York I Love You'. Yes, some of the short films make you curious, some of them are very short, some are longer, some of them have a definite end, some do not. Most of the stories are the sad side of the capital. It shows many different nationalities. Many of them make it feel the same way I once was in the capital in other countries a year where many people came from different countries. This movie explores many things that you may have known, but for all the characters, these are new things. Perhaps some of you traveled abroad abroad to stay for a year or two just to feel something new, meet new people; the feeling of a dreamy, sad, but the sad thing you're looking for, because it's just that you were boring in your home. You may want to re-live it by watching this.
