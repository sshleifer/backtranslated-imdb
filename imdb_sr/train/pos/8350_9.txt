As with this movie, we follow the incredible, if always attracting adventures 2 the leading character. But while C + J avoids sex for a girl's return to childhood, this couple enjoys in their body even to the point of homoerotic research. Most of the sex they get from reluctant or reluctant partners, and yet, despite their profound behavior against the PC, they all appear smiling. Like C + G, they remain innocent through all this, they fight against cybidia, bourgeois, restrictive. As someone else commented, I would not want to know these two, and it's a little surprising that their journey brings a scene of comedy and very little tragedy (and what can not be placed on their door) and so for that reason, left me with a savored but sweet taste in my mouth. I dare say that only the French can get out with such films. And that's part of their genius.
