Antonioni was aiming at another masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic than the "Blov up". It was not a success with critics and youths as it was the first. Why? Perhaps because it was a European view of America filled with clich√©s that did not work at that time and which did not stay well. (Revolutionary students are initially uncomfortable.) Perhaps when big blockbuster films were released and those who were targeted at the young market seemed to be obsolete. If it was released a year before perhaps the hippies in the deserts looked fresh ... It's a very interesting movie, very nicely captured with some brilliant and Antonionian scenes between, like love in the desert, the silence of desert villas and the explosive region ... That the traces two amateurs did not help. They were beautiful, but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would be much better with real actors! Perhaps Michelle Phillips or young Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is sometimes quite funny and touching, you would not know how to deliver lines ... Very interesting document in the late sixties is certainly worth a look at the photo and soundtrack.
