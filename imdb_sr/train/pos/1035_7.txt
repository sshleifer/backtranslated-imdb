This film was nominated for the best picture, but lost in Casablanca, but Paul Lukas defeated Humphrey Bogart for the best actor. I do not see why Lucile Vatson is nominated for the best supporting actor, but I do not think she did a good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and come to the United States on the first scene of the film. They go by train to Davis's family. Davis and Lukas were in the underworld to stop the Nazis, so they were very tired and needed a break. But when they arrive home, their Nazis live there and their people can not do much. It turns out that the Nazis only care about money and that he is ready to negotiate with Lukas. Their is more complicated, but you can discover it yourself.
