Whenever people ask me to name the most horrible movie I have ever seen, I always answer "Black Noon" and to this day no one has heard about it. I watched him only 30 years ago when my parents left for the evening. As far as I know, it is only shown once in the UK and unfortunately it is not available on DVD or VHS. If anyone can follow the copy, let me know. If I were to watch it now, it would probably be a great disappointment, but it always remained in my memory as a very disturbing little movie!
