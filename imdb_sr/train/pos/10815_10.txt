Many would have thought to stay away from this film just because of the title. If you do not have a stomach for bloody films, then what are you doing reading this review? In any case, I borrowed a video from a friend and I immediately fell in love with this movie. This film is full of marvelous bleeds, plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie and give a truly wonderful viewing experience! If you are a fan of quality experiences, then be sure to watch this great movie!
