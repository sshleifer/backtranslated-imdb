B Movie? Yes. DII? Yes. The first movie? Yes. Ali Aestheicalli A +. This film definitely had bad sound / assembly / lighting / acting / etc. etc. However, this film has many positive things about it. First, the worst person dies first! Secondly, it was made to be a parody / funny film about evaluation. The remarks our killer makes to our victims left me and my friends laughing on the floor. Take it for what it is, a bunch of kids right after high school made her first film. For what it is, it's really good.
