I saw the last half of this film a year ago and I was very happy to finally find it on DVD. I recently watched several series of reality about PBS ranching, etc. None of them came so close to tell a story like this movie. Based on REAL reality, without bumps, dark, happy, tragic and enlightening, this is a film that should be shown to students or anyone interested in early life at the border. The fine acting of Rip Torna and Conchate Ferrell adds a well-prepared scenario. The initial loan states that this was done through funds provided through the National Foundation for Humanities. If this is a type of product tax, I could go more. I highly recommend him and encourage people to tell a friend if you saw him and enjoy the movie.
