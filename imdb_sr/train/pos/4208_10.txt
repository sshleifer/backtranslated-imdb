Every now and again, this film is about which no one has ever heard and for which it was shot in a very short time with very little money and resources, but everyone is crazy and it turns out to be surprisingly excellent. It happened in the 1950s with quite a few films, which many people did not hear. There are really some unknown, big, surprising little jewels from the 50's which are worth digging. "Panic in the streets" is another movie like the one that gets out of the mind. Both are films that are not really like normal genres of their time and are also made with limited resources. I was really surprised how I ended up on the movie. It was really a movie that made it better and better as it progressed. Like all 'old' movies, it starts running slower, but when you enter the story and its characters, you can enjoy the right job with this movie. The film has a great story. This includes spying, even though the movie does not start like that. It starts as this typical criminal thriller with the touch of film-noir. But "Pickup on South Street" is simply not a movie by numbers, so it soon starts to move in its direction. This ensures that the film remains surprising but, above all, really refreshing to watch. Also I liked the characters in this movie. None of them are really a good guy and all their flaws and weaknesses. Really humane. In particular, the great performance of Thelma Ritter, who even received a well-deserved Oscar nomination, is particularly outstanding. It's really one of the greatest female roles I've ever seen. Although this is a little obviously little budget, this is simply a great, original, special little movie that deserves to see it more! 10/10
