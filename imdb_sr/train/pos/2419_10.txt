Apart from planes, carts and cars and Uncle Buck, this is John Candy's most entertaining film. When hypnotized with a game card (similar to the Manchurian candidate) and becomes an angry type who does not know what he is talking about, he makes two very important quotations (Both deal with male anatomy). A lovely scene with food items must be seen, can not be described. <br /> <br />
