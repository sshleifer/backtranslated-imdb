The sudden impact has a tendency to be treated as Eastwood's artistic failure at the time of his career when he established a good reputation as a director. The reason is not actually the film itself, but the attitude towards vigilantism, which seems to support it. In some places this actually owes more to Death Visha than to the original Dirty Harry movie. It could be argued if this is the case - at the end of the day it is a film of guilt, justice and retaliation. For me, at the end of the day there is more empathy than sympathy. However, given all these arguments, it is easy to overlook that the sudden impact is a very well-made film. Forget about "Go punk, make my daily scene", it's iconic, but not genuine. But look at the view of San Francisco from the air, zooming the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or look at the brilliantly made scene in which Sondre Locke's character visits his mentally ill sister at the hospital. It really uses the juxtaposition of the face. So, all in all, Sudden Impact is a very visual movie that really shows how Eastwood is matured as a director. And if I remember correctly, it was the first time that Eastwood had put it on the screen, although in the action movie, it was debatable ideology. Also, I think this is the first film directed by Eastwood. Although Eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Plai Misti for me, Breeze, etc.) The narrative space leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not disturbing the story. The only thing that's really boring is the dog that farts.
