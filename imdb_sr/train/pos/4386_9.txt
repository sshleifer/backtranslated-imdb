This is a powerful movie. The first time I saw him, Scottish accents made my understanding difficult, and it destroyed the viewing experience. I gave up on it, but then I bought a DVD, used subtitles in English when I needed it, and I really got into this movie, revealing how good it is. He is great. The widescreen makes it spectacular in some parts, with beautiful landscapes and a story that reminds me of Braveheart, a story of good against evil. Here is Liam Neeson (good) against Tim Roth (evil). They both do their job well. Few actors encounter contempt as Roth. Man, you really want to hit this guy in his arrogant, irritating pic. (He is so nasty and disgusting that sick critics love his character more than anyone else here). Neeson is a male man and a solid hero figure like Gibson was in Brave Heart. Jessica Lange is as strong as a woman here. The movie attracts you and fully engage, so you're ready to have an emotional experience watching this.
