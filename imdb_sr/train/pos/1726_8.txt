As I thought about the "Great Escape," I allowed my mind to return to this little jewel of a movie from my childhood. I read and re-read the autobiographical novel from 1949, which inspired him, and when the only cinema was created (we never used that word, actually) in the city that showed "foreign" films, I was the first to buy My ticket. As someone who talked about war magazines and propaganda films during World War II, I had a passionate interest to explore the reality of this conflict that is reflected in the memoirs and stories of people who were there personally. This later expanded strongly to buy books on the subject for years, and finally to read the equally appealing novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarkue, who gave even deeper sensibility. Film versions, however, were not similar to the fact that they seldom delivered goods. The medium of black and white film has never been so well served as in those years. I have never seen any version of the technique that looks authentic, as is the case with deep chiaroscurov films such as "Wooden Horse". If it is true that we are destined to always be captured before the images of our childhood, then I freely acknowledge it. And there will never be others like Leah Genna as an emblematic British war hero. on film. Not even Sir Alec.
