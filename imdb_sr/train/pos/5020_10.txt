That's what the movie should be when we try to capture the essence of what is very surreal. It has this foggy tone rarely recorded on the movie, it feels like a sequence of dreams and it really moves you in a dark memory. The children were extremely convincing and I expect some things to happen in the future. Very natural action for such youngsters, I do not know if Bill pulled him out of them or just there so well, but not less excellent. Bill received an evaluation of how worried I am and KevNjeff's comment on Mr. Pactons is a bad act, what can be done in that role. He played this role quite well in my opinion. This comes from someone who says Hamlet is good (The Ethan Havke version?) Vov ......... Do not listen to his comments. A great blow to make you feel really embarrassed, if that's what you want? Cinema gets above average.
