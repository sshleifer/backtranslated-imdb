This masterpiece of the first of these two films Substances River, the sequel to The Man From River Dreams is all that should be continue. He does not stumble on his predecessor's fingers, preferring to leave the legend that was the first film to live in a single immortality. <Br /> <br /> The Man From Snowy River II is based on the return of Jim kreig to dreamland River after a three year absence. The film subtly speaks of a change in the nineteenth century, of Australian history, legends and horses. The story demonstrates a touch of Hollywood in lighter shades, an aspect that is absolutely absent in the first film, but it is a unique fit with a strong sense of patriotism Australian. The story is much livelier than the first film, and it is much more striking, with certain aspects of the previous incorporated into the film, and yet Man from Snowy River II has all the essential features of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography, stunning the focus of Australia's high country, the second most memorable footage horse ever recorded, and a fantastic soundtrack and deeply shocking Bruce Rovlanda equal first in every way. Geoff Burroves has done an excellent job with this film and is very worthy of recognition, especially in terms of the quality of the Australian film industry. The main actor of Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton, and well replaced Brian Dennehia, carry their parts with as much passion and differences as well as the first film. As for the sequels, The Man From Dreams River II is a masterpiece; again deeply depressing and inspirational experience.
