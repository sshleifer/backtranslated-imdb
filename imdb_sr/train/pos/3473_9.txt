I admit that I had a bit of anxiety when I first saw the performances for this film. Did VH-1 stand on a hollow country? I mean, Harris and Kuinn do not really look or even sound like John or Paul. But I have to admit, this movie really surprised me. It's far from the exploitative film I was expecting. Instead, it's about a character study, a low-quality, humorous, and ultimately a bitterly sweet view of friendship, and the ultimate lesson that we all learn: it's difficult, if not impossible, to catch what we once had and what was going on.
