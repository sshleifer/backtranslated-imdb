I saw this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I really liked if it was not an action movie or a comedy. So in later years I decided to look at it again and see if it was just a nostalgia or there was really something in that movie. To my surprise, the film kept all my expectations. Great movie. Emotionally in the right scope, some jokes, nice songs (although not really great, which in fact explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and everything in all, of great benefit to my time. I was surprised that the last of my childhood films I visited again did not even pass my minimum requirements for a decent movie, and yet this film, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like I was crying . . Maybe it's because my dog ​​recently died and maybe not, but the most important thing is that I felt, and that's why I've made real movies (that's the money, of course). Yes, there are errors in continuity. Yes, the script has holes, but it does not matter. The film itself is funny and smart. Do not be fooled by cynical people who always look for bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets not because it's perfect. He gets 10 simply because I felt.
