An abrupt thriller with multiple turns and double crosses than a doodle pad. A great actor who blended with an intriguing plan that oversaw the influence of Twin Peaks in director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrait of a man looking for the right thing. J.T. Valsh (RIP to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, as well as Dennis Hopper. It's a shame that he never made a bigger profile in the business. I'm sure he has his followers. All in all, this is a great movie that shows you do not need big bangs or commercial soundtracks to be a fun movie.
