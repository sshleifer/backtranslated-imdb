For comedy this has a decent and inventive action, and comedy Trey Parker and Matt Stone is perfect. There are dozens of funny moments in this fantastic movie. I especially like the many colors and the way the conflict occurred on the scene of the sports arena. Robert Stacks Unsolved Misteries spoof is also very fun.
