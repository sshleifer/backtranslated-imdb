I saw this film in 1959 when I and my family were 11 years old in a discotheque. <br /> Then I thought it was very funny. . . Although I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful movie such a pleasure! This morning I saw him again at Turner South. While I was watching it, I was absolutely shaken by laughter! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic of mature age. If you are too young to experience the magical period in the history that produced this film, I am very sorry for you. There is no way in which you can watch such films and understand how they (even today) can deliver such a beautiful piece of sky to "old people" like me. By saying this, all I can do is Sincerely, please younger people refrain from commenting on movies such as "The Mating Game". And as such, these movies speak a completely different language than any of you can understand. In other words? if you do not understand the problems that the film deals with, do not be embarrassed by offering comments that? frankli ?? does not make sense.
