Gung Ho is one of those films I never tired of watching. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite, and he is absolutely funny in this movie. Answering him step by step is Gedde Watanabe. The two of them work beautifully together. Although this film is a comedy, I also like how it shows Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) who are fighting in their roles as leaders of their groups. They both strive to keep peace so much, and then finally enter the battle (which is hysterical for watching). First, they both are on the floor. Then Hunt jumped on the chair. Kazihiro jumped to the table. Hunt jumped to the table with him. The fight was then poured out of the factory in the factory. I like that once they are separated by workers, you can say that both feel bad because they allow things to get out of control. There is also a scene in which you can see the influence Hunt had on Kazihir. He is in his house and his boss from Japan arrives and says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is locked and we can not find the key. Tell me you can not imagine Michael Keaton saying something like that! I think this movie really likes me. because it's genuinely funny, and also shows how people who are radically different can not only learn from each other, but also become good friends.
