Okay, we have Extreme Verhoeven's violence (although not as extreme as other Verhoeven's moves), we have plenty of sex and nudity, but something is missing ... Oh, yes, the lack of intelligence Paul Verhoeven is known to know in his sci-fi movies. I admire the way Verhoeven introduces characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most Verhoeven movies, the film itself does not have enough humor to fall into the comedy genre. The performance was above average in comparison to most slasher films. What makes a Hollywood Man a good movie is not a story, neither the actors nor the characters, but the incredible special effects that would otherwise make the film so impossible. The crew did indeed make an invisible man, without using things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects (effects on the set). Incredible scene effects can not be seen while Kevin Bacon is invisible, they are when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. The problem is that this invisible story of a man deserves to be more imaginative. This is mainly done in the laboratory. I'd like to see invisible Kevin Bacon robbing a bank and coming out of it, or let's just steal something from folk bags, or something like that. But what is shown is enough to make Halloween a fun movie. Rating: B
