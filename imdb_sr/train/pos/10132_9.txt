In this first episode of Friends, we met with the 6 main characters of the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffai, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joei Tribbiani and finally Rachel Green. We found out that Rachel, a wealthy girl who was Monica's high school girl, left the fianc√©, Barry, on the altar, having discovered that she did not love him. She also decides to live with Monica and becomes independent of her father, getting a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. Ross, on the other hand, discovered that his wife was a lesbian and lost her because of her Susan, her partner. (We see him moving to a new flat during an episode). Monica, in this episode, discovers (and finally sleeps) with Paul's "wine guy," who gave her an excuse to be powerless since he divorced his wife. But in reality, he just fooled her. Ps: I just hanged Joe's and Chandler's hairstyle in this first season! =)
