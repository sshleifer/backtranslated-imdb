What can I say about this story? This magical story has followed me from an early childhood, evoking warm memories in my heart. The characters lead you to so many hilarious places that they want you more than any scene. For example, there were so many different flavors of science on the market. I loved exotic dancers who were following steel drums. The story was wonderful. I was so bad that Landsburi decided to keep the early kids and stay with Mr.Brovno, and find the other half of the spell so that men who have less weapons can win the war. I'm still a kid in, and this movie is calling on my inner child like no one else. This film is my definitive favorite of all time. I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be taken and transported at some other time.
