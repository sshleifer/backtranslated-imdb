I do not know what I am so pleased about in this movie, but when I first saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I am not a big fan of Paula Vinfield, nor of war drama, but I really wondered how and when Vinfield would find his child. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. True to my will, I have not watched this movie for years or been shown on TV for some time, but this film is somewhat odyssey of one man after the war. Vinfield shows a very cute and hearty portrait of a man who is lost in his memories. In this film there is a fundamental message that he seeks for the last human morality after the war and the reality he faces. Why this movie is not on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
