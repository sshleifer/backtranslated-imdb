One day I heard a few friends who said that "Scarface shit ... some idiot tried to make another Kuma set in the early 80's." Now, I usually listen to the idiots / watch CNN so I decided to cling to it. Then my friend gave me a DVD and said: "This is # 1 with pelicans," I was confused trying. This is the best movie ever made. It's more realistic than all these shit about running stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in the area. Still, what's better than Al Pacino who has m203? I give this ***** outside ****, perfect for lovers of Al or GTA: Vice City.
