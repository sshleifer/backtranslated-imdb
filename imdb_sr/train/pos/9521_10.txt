I think this film is brilliant. There are many reasons why, but these are some of them 1) good acting Tom and Tiler 2) a brilliant scene of a machine gun that was great 3) I thought the end was a good twist because I never expected that in the end everything would be merit for Sam Mendes .as like these 3 points movie film form is also good. I'm a film student at college and have studied this film in detail, and that was one of the best movies I've seen for years. I would just like to thank all the people who took part in the making of this film. In the end, I would like to say that the best scene in the movie is the scene of a machine gun in which John Rooney kills, it's just pure luminosity in shooting a scene in silence, while John Rooney does not say, "I'm glad you are," it's much better to think because the viewer creates his own sound and this sound is completely different for each observer only brilliant.
