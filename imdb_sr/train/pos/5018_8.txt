If you are like me then you will like this great coming teenage movie. And I think it's up there with the evil / love book / high school of the USA / vikkom / calendar girl / cribabi / all the great films set in lat. early sixties and has a wonderful soundtrack. not as many songs as in some of these types of movies, but still great.it is so very funny from time to time and has a great love interest. all the young casts are great. And I want the favorite movie of all time back into the future when Marty McFly came back in 1955 and in these fabulous films remains in fab 50s (early 60's) there are some movies of this type better than but not much.
