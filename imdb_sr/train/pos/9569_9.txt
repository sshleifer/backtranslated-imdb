As far as I understand, after the Chinese took over Hong Kong, the infamous Cat. 3 Hong Kong movies have disappeared. At least until now, and what a wonderful film it is. I knew it was a serious criminal drama, but I was the first Kat. I bought it recently, I was not sure what to expect. The Cambodian hit man goes to Hong Kong to defeat the judge's wife, who is also a lawyer. It turned out that the judge had made arrangements for the killer, because she was divorced from the judge and threatened to take all his money. That's all in the first ten minutes, so nothing is given. After the blow, the police quickly found the killer, but in an attempt to arrest him, several policemen and civilians were killed. He lost the police and now the race caught the boy before he escaped back to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops and it is difficult for the viewer to get a chance to catch his breath. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many policemen are killed, while the killer is proving to be very difficult to track and crash when they find him. By the way, the killer who was trying to hide in the landfill finds a woman who raped and harassed a man. He helps her and saves her from the guy, and she kills the killer to take her away. I loved this movie, it's like moving and moving at high speed, because an incident leads to another, and the police are sometimes as bad or as bad as the killer. The acting is extremely good, and capturing location and photography takes away breath. In this film there is no indulgence, even with a very incredible ending. Completion is quite incredible, but also a convenient end to all actions and violence. Yes, violence is sometimes brutal, but this is a very meaningless criminal drama that will slaughter your socks. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely needs a more widespread release, including the release of R1. Great movie, recommended.
