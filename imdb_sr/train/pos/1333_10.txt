I love this movie I've been watching over and over again. I do not see why anyone would think this movie is not good. Maybe you saw better or anything else I love. It's one of my favorite films and I'm not Hindi at all, but I love it. Maybe it's a bit like "The Beautiful Woman", but I did not see it and I do not think it's any better than this. I do not know why you're worried about it, but you may have a good reason, but I think I've said it enough, but I absolutely love this movie, and those who say it's not good at all, then I wonder why you watched it and which movies you feel good about. As for all the others I watched with them, they also enjoyed it, so it surprises me that many people do not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think it's how her last name is written) she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!
