The film actually has a fairly good story, but it gets bogged down in several key places. It's almost like the director threw the movie together without having to take the time to make some important cuts in the movie. Dennis Kuaid is doing a pretty decent job in his role ... but something is clearly missing in several key scenes. And it would probably be a much better movie that he did not feel like he was thrown together. <br /> <br />
