Like other people who commented on "Fraulein Doctor", I accidentally came across this little gem on late TV without having heard about it before. The strange mixture of the story of a sexy fiction, but an unscrupulous anti-heroine, on the one hand, and a realistic and well-researched display of war in the trenches, on the other hand, has taken me from the beginning. For me, this is one of the top five films about World War I ("Quiet on the Western Front", "The Roads of Glory", "Gallipoli" and post-war "La vie et rien d'autre"). And the stage with the attack of toxic gas is really cold; Horses and people look like riders of apocalypse with their gas masks. I would just like to film a movie.
