"A Gui Thing" may not be a classic, but it's definitely a good, fun comedy. The action focuses on Polo (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning after his unforgettable mom and Uncle Beck (Julia Stiles) lies naked in his bed. Before he realized what had happened, he flew Becky out of his apartment because his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) was coming. After that, as you can imagine, there is a chaos. Almost every scene in "A Gui Thing" releases a loud laugh. The most exciting moments come from the moment Paul comes up with what could happen if Karen says. Selma Blair is a really talented comedian, and the worst thing about this movie is that she is not being used enough. Although it turns out to be more funny than Stiles's character, which is not really that interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. As I said, "A Gui Thing" is not a classic, but not a bad 7/10.
