Pop quiz: you are part of modern armed forces in peace on routine maneuvers and you are being thrown back in the past with the chance to change history. What are you doing? Well, if you're a Hollywood studio, change the Japanese G.I. in G.I. Samurai (aka Timeslip) for the crew of an American aircraft carrier, discussing halting the attack on Pearl Harbor for 90 minutes, then returning home and hoping that no one remembers that Japan did it first and with more balls in 1979. Sonni Chiba . But unlike his Hollywood counterpart of the Final Countdown, this sees his premise through: over 400 years in the Japanese feudal wars, her peacetime soldiers decide that their greatest hope is to return lies in the provocation of history, trying to change it by joining a war leader to conquer the country? Many tank and helicopter action versus samurai, including a very impressive 25 minute battle sequence that contains thousands of people who cause serious harm to each other.

Even before that, soldiers interact with one another who want to go home, for those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and rob for hell. Impressively directed and surprisingly well-thought-out, soft rock and countri and western songs are sometimes disturbing, especially when they have English words singing Japanese singers who can not utter a word aloud, let alone speak the language, but this is a farewell defeat in the surprisingly good sci-fi shareholder . Optimal UK DVD is a good download of the uncut 138-minute version.
