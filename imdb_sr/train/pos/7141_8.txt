Since Siskel's death and Ebert's absence, the show has remained in the hands of Richard Rooper's incompetent hands. Roeper is not a film critic but only criticizes anything that he does not like personally, i.e. Movies with Countri music are obtained because "I do not like countri music!" and children's movies get the standard "Do not see it now, wait until it appears on DVD and rent it for your children!" Roeper may be an idiot, but in some other field. Weekly guests 'sit in' for Ebert better, but who wants to choose a daisy in the middle of a cow? He said it all, it's the only show in the city and it just looks worthwhile. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Havking can speak, you can! It's your mind and the thoughts we long for. Do everything you need to take off the usurper from his self-proclaimed throne.
