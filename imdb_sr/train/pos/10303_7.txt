Bruce Almighty is a story about Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is ruining his life. God opposes him and shows Bruce the error in his paths. Of course, giving someone's power to God might take the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrei is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and looks like at home as God and actors well connect the action. Jokes are almost always targeted, although they sometimes over-emphasize Carrie's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the film was actually showing God, not just that but as a blacksmith. I thought this was pretty good, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, for example, the original cookie scene, and others miss the goal, but still a good movie. 6/7 of 10
