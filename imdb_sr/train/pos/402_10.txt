I've already seen Zu: Warriors from the Magical Mountain. In this film, the setting takes place in Chinese mountains, the Legend of Zu looks like the second dimension !! We thank Tsui Hark for the great use of CGI effects. He is able to display his vision of mountains that float above the clouds, the land in which the creatures fly freely, and the powers that move from sharp wings, split swords, and the cool cool Moonlight. Many characters in this, the focus is mainly on King Ski and Enigma. The romantic aspect is here, although the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on the screen makes this movie worth watching. At first, I like how she looks like a Countess (from Zu Varriors) and plays Enigma well while dealing with past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia is very attractive to the eye? In fact, Zu Varriors had more comedic elements and his special effects were limited due to time in 1983. Tsui Hark brings him to a whole new level and sets new standards in cinema.
