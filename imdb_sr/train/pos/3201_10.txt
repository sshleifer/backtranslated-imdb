This is the early movie "Pilot" for hit Canadian TV show Trailer Park Bois. It was played by executives on several networks before Shovcase decided to sign them for the TV series. Excellent acting and a very fun acting cast make this one of the best cult comedy films. A film plot is that these two small criminals are going around "destroying" pets for money. If you have a dog in the neighborhood that barks all night, these are the guys you go to! But they fall into trouble when they come to a job that's too big to deal with and end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the TV series. I recommend it! Estimated R for cursing, violence and drug use. It is not too offensive (actually do not show killing animals)
