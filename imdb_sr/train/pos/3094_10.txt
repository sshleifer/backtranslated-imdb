This is the best and most original performance seen for years. The more I watch, the more I fall in love with him. The acting is excellent, writing is great. I personally love every character. However, for everyone there is a favorite character because there is a good combination of personality and backgrounds like in real life. I believe that ABC has done a bad service to the writers, actors and potential audience of this performance, to quickly deny it and not advertise it enough, or to give it a real chance to win the next. There are so few shows I watch more, because most TVs are terrible. This show, in my opinion, was up there with my favorites Grais Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for brothers and sisters would like this show that they even knew about it. Why is it always the loser to show that so much time and winning broadcasts with high potential are always immediately rejected. I'm sick of reality, I do not watch any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for the show and then hiring great actors, this show had so many promises. The recent episode was still the best, since everyone started to really get into their parts and so the show is so real. Please watch this show on ABC's video and ABC knows that you want this show to be returned. PLEASE PLEASE ONLINE PETITION IN ABC: http: //www.petitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
