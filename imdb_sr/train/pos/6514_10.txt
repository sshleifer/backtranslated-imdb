I thought the children in the show did a very good job. I particularly enjoy the performance of Emma's character. Good work! Stops were pretty good for a low-budget show. I was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to watch the watch every 5 minutes. There were also good spooks of the children's souls. Another good thing in the movie is that she continued to move. There were not many slow scenes. Adult relationships were also convincing, and that helped make the show fun. All in all, a pleasant night of watching movies.
