I've never danced Flamenco before, but somehow it seems to me that this movie is perfect. The colors, as far as the dances were obvious, Gypsies and all rivals together made a movie that seemed to end too soon. I saw other Carlos Saura movies and I agree that this movie may be his best production. I feel that the best features of his past films are composed and harmonized to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors in detecting activities that take place behind the camera. As I watched this movie, I felt like sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, comfortably watching dancers on a wooden board over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fits like a glove. I do not know how to get a copy of this film in the United States in the next few years. I recommend this film to anyone who is attracted by the life of other cultures. It can be safely said that this film is certainly on my favorite list.
