Action, Horror, Sci-fi, Director of Exploitation Fred Olen Rai shows that he has some talent as a director. Artistic actor Villiam Smith is one of the best hard / bad guys in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best acting performance in his career. As for Randy Travis, he gives his best impression to Lee Van Cleef. Not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis are a real movie. As far as the rest of the team is concerned, none of them stand out. Rai performed this film perfectly, Smith and Travis were good.
