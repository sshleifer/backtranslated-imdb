That's what I call "pre Sci Fi; Sci Fi" movie. It does not get better than Lugosy / Karloff in this incredibly good "available" movie. These two real artists are in the best light, as well as the story. I was preoccupied with the idea of ​​looking at a man as he drowned in the three aforementioned concepts. I was grieved and at the same time fascinated by two stars, as they themselves play. This time Harrison Ford was put into the Karlof part and maybe Kieffer Sutherland as the role of White Lagos. Perhaps this can be done almost equally well. This is one of the best that Hollivood has produced. As I said ... it does not get better. No way.
