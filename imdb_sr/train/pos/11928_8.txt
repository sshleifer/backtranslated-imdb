This film, though apparently based on the 1951 film MGM, starring Janet Leigh, is still an excellent movie. Danny Glover brings George Knock to one of his best performances, his director of baseball luck with short temperament, into life. As for this film, which is "stacked", in order to add Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience works and shows through his performances on the screen, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levit (Third Wave of the Sun), Brenda Friker (Charming ) and well-experienced Irish actress), Tony Danza (even he is good in this film), Matthev McConaughei (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be so crucial in this film, but he got an exposition) Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthews McConaughey is the same for Adrien, except Dazed and Confused), not starring actors such as Tailor Negron (David), Toni Longo (Messmer), Jai O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Vhitt Bass) and experienced veteran in one of his final performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphi, owner of California angels), and the rest of actors do a great job, plus a great story that raises beauty. however much I do not care about your depression. I enjoyed this film as a child, and it brings back memories when I watch it today. I need this on a DVD. I recommend it to every parent who is looking for something their children did not see, and everyone else.
