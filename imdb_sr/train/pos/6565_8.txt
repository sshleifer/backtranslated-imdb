I know that movie snobs are bothering. But if you are looking for an amazing fun ride through the Jungle B-movie, try the "Jake Speed". It's a little thin, but its liner and location are more than that for this. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to be having fun playing the role of an ultra-evil white slave. Enemy Crawford, Jake Speed. He adds a dimension to a movie that only a professional like Hurt could provide. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) are a good team, although you are wondering why both of them have agreed with each other. However, together with both Cravford and Christopher, they have shown a team that is so exciting that, if you can cross over yourself for a moment, you can find yourself again in childhood in the situations and inherent uncertainties they provide. Tasty Karen Copins works perfectly as a girl in distress, who is more concerned about her savior's motive than for torture. I have not yet found a movie that is so funny without being overlooked, or worrying about the film by making myself too busy. Not every movie is the latest "Citizen Kane". And believe me, Vells was original. So let's remember that movies are sometimes fun. They are not social comments or attempts to politically promote the audience. But only for the pure entertainment of life and life at a time when our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
