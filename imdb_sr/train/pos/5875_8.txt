This is one of the films that do not require any brain or thinking, it's a very funny time that you forgot about in the next hour. I was really surprised by the acting John Abraham, who usually plays a gangster like a face without emotions, so that he plays the opposite completely and successfully, by being able to shine among comic geniuses like Paresh Raval and Akshaie Kumar. I was quite surprised with 3 girls from Akshaie, because the roles do not require much talent, but mostly mourn Akshai's disappearance (other girls), I was surprised that they managed to establish a real personality and you could differ from them. It's a good thing, and most of the songs are good, colorful and fun, so this will relieve your mood on a boring Sunday night.
