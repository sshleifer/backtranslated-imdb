My, Kassi Lemmings is certainly a woman who looks beautiful. This film is a lost gem, a dead satire "mockumentary" of the early nineties Hip Hop scene, when MC Hammer was just beginning to fade into that good night. We follow three members of NVH as they embark on their picnic journey of potential riches and glory. Like Nickolas Nickleby, they eventually complete their journey not far from the place they started, but at least a little wiser and less naive. This is one of the best movies that no one has ever heard, but it's the type of movie you either love or hate, much like "Compani Man" in that regard. I consider this film as a 1000 island in New York State: it's a wonderful little secret that you want to keep for yourself.
