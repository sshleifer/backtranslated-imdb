A few years ago when I first watched "Gray gardens" I remember laughing and finding a hilarious camp. Years later, I still laugh loudly when I look at it, but after many seeing I came to see the beauty in a strange, distorted relationship between the inseparable "great" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, Little, Edith Bouvier Beale. Mother and daughters who live together in their collapsed 28 room of East Hampton add a completely new meaning to the term "jerky chic". With countless cats, raccoons and opossums like roommates, this aunt and niece from Jackie O. enabled filmmakers Alberto and David Maisles to record everyday life in their home. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving display of true love and the rule of anarchy. The relationship between the Big and the Little Edie is the testimony of the inextricable love links. And their lives are an example of instinct, determination and free will. This movie has a lot more to recommend it than I can say. It's a rare experience that you have to see yourself. <br /> <br />
