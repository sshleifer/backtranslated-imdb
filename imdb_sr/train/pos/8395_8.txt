*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is no doubt the best film ever made by Rainer Verner Fassbinder, and even with a marvelous script, the film is enhanced by the great performance by Hanne Schigulla. The film begins with Maria (Schigulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lovitsch) who only marry while the bombs continue to fall, and Hermann is delivered to the last days of the war, and now Mary and her mother and sister must survive to survive. Mary decides to be employed as a dancer / prostitute at a club that takes care of US GIs and meets Black Army soldiers named Bill (Greg Eagles) and begin to see each other. Mary heard that her husband Hermann died in the war, so she became very serious with Bill. But one day, while I was intimate with Bill, I saw Herman at the door. He did not die and when he entered the room there was a fight and Maria broke the bottle over Bill's head and he died. Hermann assumes guilt and is sentenced to a long prison, and Maria says he will succeed in something and get him out. The war is over and Germany has to rebuild and one day on the train Maria learns Karl Oswald (Ivan Desni) who is a successful businessman in textiles and uses his charms to get a job. Maria is determined to do well and climb the corporate ladder and become Charles's mistress. She tells him that she will never marry him, but she is in love with her. Hermann leaves the prison, but he goes to Canada to try to overcome everything that Maria has done since he was imprisoned. ***** RECOGNITION OF SPOILERS ***** One day Karl dies and leaves Maria almost everything in her own will and Maria buys her house. Then Hermann finally came home to his wife and they are both ready to start, although they have been married for some time. But Maria leaves gas on the stove, and the house explodes with both of them still in it. In the film there are so many interesting things that one of those movies that can be studied and talk about them. long-range. As in all Fassbinder movies, the use of color is used in a very interesting way. As the film starts, the tones are brown and gray to represent the war-torn Germany, but as Maria begins to become successful, they change into rich colors such as red and white. The reconstruction of Germany with all the sounds of construction serves only as a background, and the film remains focused on Mary's ventures. Fasbinder wanted sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was then happening in Germany. Hanna Schigulla has never been better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a smaller actor, it would be just another interesting movie, but Schigulla is so strong that her performance raises this film to an elite status. Schigulla portrays Maria as very decisive and smart, but at the same time uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She was not ashamed nor felt guilty about this, and Fassbinder wanted to show Mary as a woman who practically sold her soul to survive. Schigulla was not nominated for the Oscar, but she gave an excellent performance that will endure the test of time. Fasbinder appears in the movie as a salesman, and his mother, Lilo Pempeit, plays Frau Ehmke. I've heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether Mary deliberately left gas. Later in the bathroom she runs water through the wrist and seems to be sad. This is just a guess and if you think I'm wrong, please send me an email. I think she was too excited because Herman was at home and accidentally left him (Remember she dressed the dress for no reason?). Then when she reads her will, at that moment, she finds out that Herman and Karl have become friendly without her knowledge, and I think she felt that everything she did was in vain. That's the reason for the bathroom scene. So, when a house accidentally explodes. But I think that the reason for Fasbinder to have such an end is to show that anyone who sells their soul has no business life. Fasbinder was fascinated by the survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. In his view, Maria can not have this in both ways. Fascinating film.
