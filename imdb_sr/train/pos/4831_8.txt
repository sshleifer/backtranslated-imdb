I went into this, expecting that I did not like it; I thought it would be terribly decent and serious, and pretty boring and boring. It's actually much better than that, and I discovered that I really enjoy it. I do not know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know - married to Albert, who died young, and she lamented him ever. See the circumstances under which she grew up was fascinating; In fact, I found myself wanting to see more than a story, and I imagine that at some point we will see a continuation. Visual is a stunning movie. Kits and costumes are incredibly luxurious and not too strong over the top. The acting is superior to all involved. In one word, it was great!
