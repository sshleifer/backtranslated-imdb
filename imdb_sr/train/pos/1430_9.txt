This was playing at our theater in Amsterdam and the movie we wanted to see was sold out so we went to this, not knowing anything about it except for a documentary about the planet. We were very happy about our accident because this was a very powerful film about life and a delicate balance that we all share with the rest of the Earth's inhabitants. This film has some of the most beautiful photos I've ever seen in the movie and took me from deserts to the ocean to rainforests and showed things I've never seen in a movie, television or book! "Earth" is a film that every student needs to see before he gets poor. I will encourage my niece to see this film because it will inherit the planet we leave. This is also a movie that can be seen on a theater screen or on a large television, because the photo is so powerful and exotic.
