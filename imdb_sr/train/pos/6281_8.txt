I had the opportunity to watch several movies in BluRay and HD DVD. This film stays on a wonderful action and a great story. Although you are looking for a great movie, this one is not. The inability to show this movie on DVD has made it easier to shop. I've always enjoyed an intense action and a great acting that does not always go together. All in all this is what makes this a great fun movie for watching. Now on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies you get two things. A picture that is almost crystal clear without distortion or a film with a grain hd image. I was disappointed when I made this my first blu ray movie. I almost started to think it was a blue standard. Although after watching other movies I know better. I do not think they spent so much time as they should get this movie to hd. This is mostly a problem with some movies. And at the price of Blu Ray player and Blue Rai discs, you only have the best picture. So I consider this to be a valuable investment for people who have never watched a movie or bought a DVD version.
