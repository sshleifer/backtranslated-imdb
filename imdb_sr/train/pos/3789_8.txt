Bravo Cesima, their once powerful film industry seems to be awakening from post-communist dreams. Loners is a comedy with all the elements you expect to see in a modern "Hollywood" production minus garbage that appears to be related to the genre in the last few years. Superior sound surface, excellent visual processing, beautiful Prague city landscape, to mention only some. The story actually consists of several sub-stories that are often intertwined and overlapping, and in essence is a collage of destiny, fate, desire ... followed by a group of urban young people through the mid-thirties through various situations, from everyday life and leisure activities to career and obsession. And it's hilar. In fact, the film has a place where the whole theater I was in (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed nonstop about 40-50 seconds. How often do you perceive it with modern Hollywood productions? Although the entire main actor is excellent (especially the upcoming Macedonian star Labin Mitevska is in the role of an immigrant who faces too many difficulties) We need to extract Jiri Macacek for his extraordinarily credible display of Jakub, an unbroken stone boom whose brain is very strong hit by things he smokes to put him in a lot of fun situations. Conclusion: Do not Miss This! There is plenty to offer.
