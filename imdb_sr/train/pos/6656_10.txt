This film was simply an avesome. It was a very sensitive issue and the movie was great. This film did not create any controversy in India (as far as I know), and its publicity also kept hunting. Initially I thought this film would simply be \ t waste of time because most Indian directors and producers altered the subject even though it was very sensitive and added a love story to the original story and broke the whole thing ... most Indian viewers would agree on this topic if you remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandei, LOC etc. There were so many movies in India that would become a turning point or mega hits if part of a love story would not be unnecessarily added. But his treatment is quite similar to the Pineapple movie (also has to be watching). If it counts, then I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (director) for a really good movie.
