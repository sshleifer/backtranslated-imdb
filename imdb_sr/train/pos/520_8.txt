My only little thing about the movie I was growing up knowing that it's A RACE TO RAJA is the fact that the beautiful RAIMOND MASSEY has been degraded for the last twenty minutes at the scene of the trial. And the trial, IMO, is the most interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are beautifully thrown as young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEI that gives the most lifelike and most credible performance. French accent MARIJUS GORING is a thrill (even an objection to Technicolor) because the heavenly messenger was sent to regain Niven when his war death remained unreported due to omission. Goring has some of the most precious lines and delivers them with pleasure. Seeing this tonight at the TCM tonight for the first time in twenty years, I think this is a top-notch example of what a wonderful year of 1946 movies is. Technicolor photography, somewhat muted and not at all fascinated, is excellent and the way it is shifted to B & V for heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and efficiency. The starting scene is a kind that really attracts the viewer into the fantasy aspect of the story - and Niven's tense story with Hunter's radio operator as his plane collapses to the ground, unexpectedly leads to an unforgettable romantic encounter. A truly wonderful film from start to finish, another triumph for Michael Povel and Emeric Pressburger.
