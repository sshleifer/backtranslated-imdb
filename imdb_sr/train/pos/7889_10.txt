Freddie's movie film is a dead ending nightmare as equally terrible and disturbing as any other Nightmare on Elm Street, that it has a comic essence about it, like all other movies, but how can anyone say that you will not find Freddy Krueger terribly if you encountered this man in his dreams, he would not find him even more intimidating with the comical essence of him, for his comedy shows that he does not care to kill you that he is extremely funny, and Freddie also plays comedy games with them, which in his own way, very disturbing, using it It's comical ways, I think it's horror movies Nightmare on Elm Street, as they are today, the writers are extremely clever, making Krueger comical and horrible versus Jason Vorhees, who does not speak and has no recourse to truly frighten his victims, this film is as good as Freddie's spirit and I would recommend it to everyone with a sense of humor and vai "Don't Fall Asleep!" ".
