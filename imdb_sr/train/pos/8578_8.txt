This film is one of the best American B movies of the nineties. If you are looking for a serious movie, look somewhere else. However, if you are looking for an action, a lot of laughter and a language in facial variation on policemen who fight gangsters, it's worth watching. Everyone's a little cheery landscape, but that's actually what it's all about, and everyone's pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have excellent chemistry and have to do another movie together.
