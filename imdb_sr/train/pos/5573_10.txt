A MUST SEE! I saw VHIPPED on the press and he was hilarious. We are talking nonstop laughter. Something about Mary seems to look like a curved drama. Amanda Peet screams with her winning combination of beauty, brain and serious acting skills. Peter Cohen, the director, has made a top film showing the raw in the male ego in the urban world of dating. For all this is a comedy, Vhipped fights with his intelligence. Which is such a line for the first director, especially in romantic comedy. He's a great talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber round their acting sets with depth and very strong performances, because they would be hungry women. You need to see that these guys go to work and get caught in Peet's network. Watch the trailer at vhipped.com, it's worth 3 minutes to download.
