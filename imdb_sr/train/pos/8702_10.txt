A woman girl in this world and she was alone. They were both alone because the boy had a gift and a curse in one package - he was able to pull the sword out of his hand. There was always a wound on his wrist due to the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the deadliest weapon in his body. He first kills his constantly drunk stomach that causes him pain every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. Just as simple as all the time for superheroes - it comes to justice ... but society decides that this justice is not necessary and dangerous, which is really true because it's not like Hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - Sasha (he is the main character who acted Artem Tkachenko) kills if a person who in his opinion deserves to die, but gets guilty of power and runs. In such a run of power and mafia she meets the girl (choreographed by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else should be looked ... do not say. Be aware that this film is more about feelings and emotions, but not about actions. This film is full of the pain of the protagonist who is full of him and his vision of life.
