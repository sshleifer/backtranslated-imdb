I was absolutely enchanted with this series from the moment Tom Long entered the recording - the whole thing of 'bad boy', it was just infectious. The story clasped, what will happen next - will Joe finally find a girl, after 5 years in prison, and all this time thinking about her lost love, once again crossing the road with her, revealing that he has a son ... Although he is a violent, bad guy, you still want him to find happiness. Truly amazing two-layer - please take it to the video!
