This movie is great. It's fun from start to finish, you'll always be on the edge of your spot during the whole movie. In my opinion, this film is highly underrated by the critics. Sli perfectly fits the role of well-trained brother to rescue the mountain of Gabe Valker. Together with him, Michael Rooker is seen as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgov, one of the best performances I've seen about him as a villain. And the fact that 75% of the film takes place on the mountain with lots of bad guys on it is the right path for many action! brilliant film!
