The choice of Silvester Stallone for the performance of the protagonist Rennie Harlin has been praised since Stallone has been such a kind of hard and passionate man who has previously done the necessary versatile aura of characters Rocka Balbao and Ramba. But to compare the Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a strained notion. Greatly created opening scene introduces the audience into excitement, uncertainty and intrigue that will swallow them in the bloody and dangerous consequences of encountering apostates. Robbery and a high altitude transfer of cash in suits from one plane to another is something that has not been recorded before. The coldness of snow covered Alps and the revealing scam and betrayal among the force antagonists make one shiver of anxieties. The forces of passionate adventure and merciless murder cast out the drama to the end. Good movies are not made every year and people do not get a feast for the eyes they sometimes watch. In addition to the dirty language / speech that in certain scenes adore drunken excitement, the film can be seen as one that will not fade its enchanting appeal even after seeing it after so many years.
