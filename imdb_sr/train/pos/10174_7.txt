This was another message to the Second World War for soldiers and allies to be careful in spreading rumors. They were called "instructional" cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with the main character of a funny look called "Pnaf Snafu". We all have imagination, along with fears and what-yes, it's happening here as a Pvt. Snafu wrongly adds two and two for something he hears and comes to "five". You can start panicking and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe in them. This includes the loss of confidence in your country and your thing, as highlighted in this drawing. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. That's still going on today. "We lost the war," declares a great nonsense at the end of this cartoon. It's amazing how some Americans have not yet learned. This caricature can be 65 years old, but it is definitely relevant today. As I write this, there were two terrorist bombings in Europe today, and some people still think that the "war on terror" is just a slogan of stickers. Incredibly. The author, the famous "Dr. Suess," uses the "hot air balloon hot air" analogue to present the above message. With Theodore Geisel (his real name) you know that rhymes will be clever. Nothing here is ridiculous, but it should not have been. You need to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was there during the Second World War. People forget that the war could easily end with the victory of the other side. It was a tense time
