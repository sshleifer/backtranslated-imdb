I'm 14 years old, so I would probably think I never heard of George Burns or Valter Matthau or anybody else. You made the boy wrong. I heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won Oscars for him. I was a fan of George Burns since my tenth year. I've seen Oh, God recently and I loved him. This one was also very awesome. George Burns did a great job. Like Valter Matthau (this is the first time I see him). And although they had very small roles, Phillis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. That special movie they shot would be awesome if this was really done. Let me tell you this, if you are a fan of George Burns or Valter Matthau, you should look at this movie immediately!
