WARNING !!! TONI DEAD GIVEAVAIS !!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS SERIES! Or you can, no matter what. These are just a few words that describe a movie that claims to be the last and coming out with another; Liars, Cheats, maybe even some words that can not be pronounced. But when Elm Street 6: Freddi's Dead shows everyone who thought the series had grown old, and wanted to stop seeing it, or people who wanted their hero (or Villian) to stop at their last breath, this film was. This film starts with the parody of the Wizard of Wizard, and then you see a child called only John Doe, the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaves and leaves the Freddie territory. A woman who resides in a hospital to take the children to her place, meets this boy, and at the same time dreams of a man, a watercourse, and a promise of a secret that floats in her mind. He returns to Springwood to understand this terrifying vision, and soon finds out she is Freddy's child, and we'll soon find out that Freddy can leave Springwood only if his daughter can be a kind of host for him. And behind that comes fear. This movie seems to have hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know. This film has a bunch of humor and humorous stories, such as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and very young Breckin Meier plays a teenage stoner who sees the psychedelic vision of flowers and "In-a- gadda-da-vida "Iron Butterfly, and then stuck in some sort of super Mario parody. This movie will either make you hate this movie, or as a Krueger even more. The best of the best.
