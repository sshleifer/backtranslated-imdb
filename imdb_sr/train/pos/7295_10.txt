I managed to see it at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We were both very impressed by the complexity of the action and we found it to move emotionally. She was very well focused with strong images. Visual effects were incredible - especially for short. He had a genuine fantasy approach to a very real and serious subject: This film talks about a young girl who is visiting a demon who offers help to her situation with her violent father. There is a sudden turn in the end that caught me aside. This relies on Gothic feelings. I would like to see this as a complete feature film. - Carrie
