I just watched this movie and I had to say, I was very impressed. It is very scary and has many moments that will make you jump! I had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes to calm my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that there may have been anything, that there were too many moments for jumping. There was a point where each new scene peaked with a jump and it gradually reduced the stunning effects because you got something new. , they were all so good that they kept a creepy, fearful factor. She had elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling).
