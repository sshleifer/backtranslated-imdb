Diane Keaton gave an extraordinary performance in this rather sad but funny story involving a lot of young people and their deep dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "The Familiy Stone", '05, who had the only daughter and she liked it out of the way, could describe it. She always called her and told her: "Give Dorothy," which is the term used in the "Wizard of Oz" in 1939. A sudden traffic accident occurs and Natalie intertwines with his friends and lovers. As Natalie explores, the more truth she finds out for her and her true relationship with her daughter. An excellent movie for watching and enjoying, especially all the good acting of all supporters.
