To be honest, I watched this movie just because of my pubertal needs. I mean, I could not get a woman in my age (I was 9 or 10 years old) so I thought I was watching Elvir's neckline as a pendant for sex. In the end, I did well with this cult. classics of horror comedy, Halloween parties, sassy humor and some sexy show that Elvira shows. They simply do not make such films anymore ... He had a sense of amateur effort mixed with the style of cable voice broadcast late at night. The truth is that it has created many fans for humor and the ability to perform Cassandra. This is a classic that reminds me of the good days of the USA Up All Night.
