The film maker breathed in the art of Andy Goldsworthy, his quest for proximity to earth and water, and his sense of proportion - and so gently, so wonderful, that he returned us to the film for the rest of us. "Rivers and tides" adore Goldsvorthi's work and associate it as a visual concert of time and human presence in the current world, a world that hides its power in a visible place. Watch this movie!
