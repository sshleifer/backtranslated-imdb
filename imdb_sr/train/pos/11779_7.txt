Reading Diamond's book, I was a bit disappointed in the series, but all in all, it's pretty informative. Reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that "warriors of culture" are busy at work, seeing "attacks" on "Western civilization" under each carpet. Of course. Like many academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the term 'rifles, germs and steel' in seemingly every opportunity during the series. We get it after the first 10 minutes. Is Diamond a little simplified (in the series)? Of course. Part of the Spaniards in South America is particularly fun, condensing a very long, complicated history to "big gods, swords and horses", ending the entire conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the thing remains valid - these things have contributed (but not fully defined) the reasons for the success of the Spanish against the established cultures. Is he in any way preaching * against * Western civilization? Nope. It's not a word. Not to my ear. All he says is that luck has played a major role in determining which cultures are progressing faster, * not * that happiness is the only reason. Finally, if you are looking for something that confirms your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all the factors that affect the success or failure of society, this series represents a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
