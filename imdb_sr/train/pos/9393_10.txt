Some movies you just know you will love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Following the roots back to "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Alvais Rings Tv" in the 40's - this was an excellent example of the modern film Noir of the 90's. Nick Cage plays the protagonist who has embarked on a plot to kill a husband and wife - and his luck goes from bad to worse and worse as he tries to escape from people, city, violence and threat of Red Rock West. A lot of turns, excellent performances by Cage, Hopper and Valsh, a hypnotic music pistol on the guitar and a flawless directing make this game truly joyful. Favorite line: When Cage looks at an empty gas gauge in the car that goes away, he shakes his head and says: "F *** in" the story of my life. "
