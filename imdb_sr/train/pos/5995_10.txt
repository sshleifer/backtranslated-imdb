I'm not sure whether it was right or wrong, but I read other comments before watching a short one. I must say that I disagree with the majority of negative comments or problems that people have had with that. As the first time, "Lone Wolf" director / producer, I like to see things that I can tie, not necessarily from professionals, but from people who only wet legs like me. If this really is also from the first timer, while I read, I applaud the effort. There were some comments about music. I thought it was pretty nice for a piece. Some say it somehow droned for some time, but I discovered that it created tension without us (we) necessarily aware of it, and when he pulled the pistol and the guitar started to screw up the chords, it was as if we knew the train was on he does, but he realizes he's moving. Yes, there's a 180 degree piston, but the shi happens. Has anyone else seen Hugh's dirty shirt white (near the end, in the rain) in "Australia"? See how much money and people were behind this movie! Give the kid a break for the gods! All in all, I think this is very well done. Only two things I would mention are not worth mentioning - Do not go to the great brass frame with the camera, and I would just show a crunch at the beginning of the shots on a shot so people would not necessarily know what it is. My previous experience has taught me that it is not difficult to make a movie, it just takes time to learn how to do it, then it's time to do it, and then it's better to think about all the details for a bit more time which you will have to record before you call "post-production time!" IMHO, it seems that the director / writer Rian Jafri has done his homework, and if this is indeed his first business card, I would give him "A". Others report to the director's office for that.
