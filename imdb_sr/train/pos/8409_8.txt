Good movie, and I'll watch one myself a few times. Rich (the previous commentator) is right: there's a lot more going on here than it's clear from the bulletin boards, and I have to wonder how long it's been in the translation. Was it still in the original? Or was the audience expected in their mother tongue to read more? Or - since the script was written by the author of the novel on which this was based - was it the current popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? In short, it is very worth looking at, but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original audience from 1913 had to bring in it. does not suit the progress of the story in any way. Of course, it starts promising, but it degenerates into a repetitive, filip-glass monotony that does not reflect anything on the action on the screen. After a long listening, I turned off the sound and just watched: much better!
