My sister and I rented this film because we were in a mood for something trashy and not so demanding to watch. However, the film greatly exceeded my very low expectations. It's much more than a one-hundredth century display. It has very realistic views of the characters in it and most actors do an incredible job. Various stories are baked along with real recordings from a time that give it a very unique touch. As I watched him, I really felt that I care about what happened to the characters. I would also like to give endless praise to Julia Stiles in her presentation to Katie; she was great in a way that stands out! I would recommend this film to everyone ..
