The film I expected very little and he only watched the silent hour pass - but what time it showed. Roll is a great, if not too serious story about 'countri-boi-lost-in-the-citi-made-good', that's ridiculous, the characters are dear and the pace is right. Toby Malone is a true star of the film with his dear portrait of Matt, the country's boyfriend and local football hero of the Aussie Rules coming to the big city and trying out one of the big teams. It is supported by John Batchelor as the local gangster Tini. Watch out for these two. Very recommended.
