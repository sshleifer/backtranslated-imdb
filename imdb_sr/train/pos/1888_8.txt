"If I wanted to run the game, I would call my sister." "Was not it enough for you?" ... "More than enough." <br /> <br /> "You brought me chocolate." That's not the way I want to remember me. Some of the amazingly witty and often insightful quotes from this charming and often insightful movie. Dudley Moore is charming, lovely and rich. Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. The two have a relationship without a father / father and son who defines the man Arthur will become. Will he follow his heart and soul, or just his wealth? For over twenty-five years, I returned to this film, with joy, fun and joy. It's a movie to go back to, and remember what's important in life, as short as it is. Judge Miller
