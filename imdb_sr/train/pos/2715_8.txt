K.E.D. it was a great TV series and it was really one of the few that was worth scouting! I suppose that in this era TIVO and the recording device would be much better than it was in 1982. I'm eagerly waiting for his availability on DVD. with other television shows such as Vild, Wild West, Bearcats and Adventure Brisco Counti, Jr., of which I am a great fan, KED had much more intellectual quality. However, she did not suffer because of this - the dialogue was witty and the action was high. The show took place in the UK as Mastermind, and had some of the BBC's feelings, but with better production values ​​than the BBC usually had in that period. this series took place at the beginning and had too much work in my life to make time for television. I recall, however, my dear mother, who called me to remind me that K.E.D. We were on, and we would sit on the phone and watch together. Vonderful memories. Indeed, K.E.D. it's a sad loss and, if that could be done with the same quality and values ​​today, I'd love to return it.
