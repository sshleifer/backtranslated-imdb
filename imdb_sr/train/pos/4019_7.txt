Since I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, it made me even more disturbed to watch this movie. I recall he was interviewed for "Jai Leno" and said he declined the role in the big budget comedy Adam Sandler's "The Longest Yard" in this film. Obviously, Snoop was in a serious mission to prove he had heads. I do not want to overplay Snoop because of his performance in "Tenants". There is certainly a better reper / actor, such as Mos Def, who could do more with his role. But the point is that Snoop did a "good job". It seems that he can not shake off some of his protective movements and vocal reversals, but that's something that even Jack Nicholson has a problem. The thing is, I convinced him of the role and tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character. McDermott, however, gives the best performance in the film, although his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by Snoop's not so subtle play. Since I was a great reader and writer, I could not help but see that the characters and the plot are a bit fascinating. It made me worse that Snoop's character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work and to ask him to criticize him. But you know what? I'm sure many writers are like that. His character was supposed to be wrong, as was McDermott, in his own way. My only treasured criticism of the film would be its end. For some reason, he felt too hurt for me, although the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters, not by the action.
