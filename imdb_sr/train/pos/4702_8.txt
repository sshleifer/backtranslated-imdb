If this film proves only one thing, then Keaton was, and there will always be a comic in the heart, even when he avoids bullets, goes to the electric chair and comes to the wrong end of the information line in the prison. But "Johnny Dangerous" continues to prove even more. In the eighties, the ZAZ guys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the highlight of the world of genre pods. But there were several pretenders to the throne. This time, Ami ("Fast Times at Ridgement High"), Heckerling is struggling with an incredible amount of television writers behind the scenario (go and check). This sparkling joke from the 1930's movie cops and "gag" films throws almost every clip on the loop and even adds a few clich√©s that have not existed since when. Not only is Keaton always available as Johnny in the title, but also such funny guys and puppets as Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boile, Dunne, DeVito, Valston and almost every other actor in Hollywood who accidentally came in close proximity. You'd be surprised how many faces you will recognize. I know I was. A joke? Well, when they start, they come quickly and furiously, like a machine gun. Too many in the beginning counted it, surpassing it with the crazy song Veird Al Iankovic. But you have to be careful when recharging. They too must be charged too often. Everyone is trying, they seem to be having fun, and I laughed very well. In the end, however, there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could be more fun - which is not usually the best thing to think after watching a comedy. But for a slow night when there is nothing good on TV, pop in "Johnny" and be prepared for some "Dangerous" serious laugh. Eight stars. See "Johnny Dangerous" ... do not be "bastidge".
