some people think that the second series was where Somba was destroyed .. I do not agree totally. shows that the quality did not go up or down and it got worse, won my opinion, as a good chrecter.i looked at the poll at jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people stated that the second series was scoobis dovnfall.OK, so the burden was that , but 28% still can not be wrong.
