I really do not understand why people are so upset and move this movie! Remember people, this is an SNL movie, not something that should be unpredictable and originally in a plot or direction! The Ladies Man is a hilarious film, though sometimes silly, with a broken film and, as usual, VONDERFUL performances by Vill Ferrell and Tim Meadovs. Yes, some jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are incredible, but his comedy! I really do not understand how one could not laugh a lot during this hilarious movie. After all, all I ask is for people to understand this as - SNL, stupid and dishonest comedy. Nothing to win prizes, but still a modern golden comedy. "10-4 apricot!"
