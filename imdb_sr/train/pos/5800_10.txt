THERE IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE IN THE WORLD !!!!! I enjoyed it when I was 4 years old and still enjoying 16 !! It's an absolute masterpiece! No video collection without her !!! I enjoy every second and not only that the movie has some special special effects, it also sends a big message to the young audiences, which may sound dangerous, but in fact the movie has been made very COOLI in reality! Although Michael Jackson has been in several films now, people still do not see him as an actor. In reality he is the most talented actor I know! He's so talented! He is incredible !!! MOONVALKER IS MUST SEE !!!!!
