Everyone in cast, from Sugiama to Aoki and Toioko, is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural and Sugiiamina's transformation is incredibly convincing. The result is so mobile that it has led me to tears. Choreography was beautiful without an athletic look. Mai's graceful dance and charm gave me goosebumps. It's such a beautiful character. You can almost see a charming student on her face as she recalls seeing "The King and Me". Aoki's character is both hilarious and miserable. Masako is so astoundingly natural as a confused woman, you almost want to hug her to make sure everything will be fine.
