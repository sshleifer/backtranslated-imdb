Bugs Life is a great movie that is not only for children but also for adults. The story is set around the colony of ants and their fight against evil grasshoppers returning each year and stolen food (Mirror of the magnificent seven). There is some wonderful computer animation and the voices are great. You'll love it !! 8 of 10
