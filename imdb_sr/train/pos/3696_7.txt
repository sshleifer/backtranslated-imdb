Although I live in Minnesota, lately I'm studying in France and I've come across this bizarre jewel of the movie. This film was incredible. A creative and unique film, different directors gave each of them a little different in their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first instinct is an attempt to fit each of these little stories into the whole story, however much it can be done with the 2003 love. This attempt, however, makes the magic of each individual segment obsolete. When taken into account, where each of the short segments is taken as their own individual film, love stories together give a wonderful message. The film is sometimes oddly bizarre - often to such a degree of confusion - and every single segment can be difficult to track. However, the observer who closely monitors each segment, the short lines of the plot become clear after a short time. Confusion is almost intriguing; Keeps you on the edge of the seat waiting for what will follow. He leaves the viewer to wonder "Did that really happen?" however, it also makes them happy that this really happened. It's a movie in which a viewer can not decide whether he loves him or hates him after leaving the theater. The original reaction is to go and watch it over and over, only to see how these individual lives fit into the film masterpiece. it can relate. Adding to the reality of the film - here, American tourists speak English, French French and so on. The number of people involved in the film leads to an understanding of the international language of love. From illness to supernatural, the love of parents towards the love of husbands, this film covers all the basics of romantic storitelling. In its wonderful and strange way, every unique event somehow falls into place to tell the story: of all kinds, sizes, nationalities and forms of love.
