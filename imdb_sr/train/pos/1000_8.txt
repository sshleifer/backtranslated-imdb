I liked the movie. Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well made. I particularly liked the introductory scene in which it was a semi truck. A very tense action scene that seemed well done. Some of the transient scenes are recorded in interesting ways, such as shooting at a time interval, unusual colors or interesting angles. And the movie is funny for several parts. I also liked the likeness of the evil shown. I would give a movie 8 out of 10.
