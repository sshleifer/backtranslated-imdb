This great film is composed mainly of documentary footage that is currently on DVD together with Prelude to war. The great American director and narrator of the story, Frank Capra, made those films that clearly and clearly point to the main points that caused the Second World War and Hitler's ascent. Every school child, no, every American should watch these movies today because they are so appropriate. History is constantly repeated! Commercial chambers are still alive and silent; the tactics used by the Nazis to enter the country through the sympathizers, and then the communists, and now the Muslim terrorist groups, continue to work to the advantage of this evil group. Seeking and leaving Hitler back in 1935, aggressive - France, America, and England caused over 50 million deaths. The Americans, the French and the British today would be pleased to allow Hitler to do the same thing despite the fact that we had to learn from history what was going on when you let dictators violate contracts. These great films can be too simplistic for World History Lovers. They are not talking about the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because at the time America had joined with them, struggling with Hitler. This film talks about simple facts and motives that led to the horrific war.
