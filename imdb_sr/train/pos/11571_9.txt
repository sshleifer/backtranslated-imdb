`An Itch In Time 'is one of the series of domestic hits Bob Clampett hit the UK in the early 1940s, including' Horton Hatches The Egg 'and' Tortoise Vins Bi Hare '. Submerged in man's time and excessive trouble, basically is a saga about the flea that is busy breaking the terrain for a new home and a dog whose earth breaks. Since Master Elmer will give him a terrible bathrobe bath if there is so much scratches, the unfortunate dog is forced to endure the upward spiral of torment, while the builder uses drills and power tools to clean the ground. Finally, a little monster fires a fuse on a small mountain of high explosives that is piled on the back of its victim! There is a huge explosion, and the unhappy blanket covers his eyes until his last end explodes in a brilliant display of the Fourth of July! It really has to hurt, and the dog fades, but soon ends up with action and with a happy smile: "You better break it, because I think I like it!" For years, this stinking confession has been censored, but the current footprints have returned the footage, so now viewers can enjoy its original revered glory. However, the cut is a closing incision in which the cat strikes the brain after complaining: "Now I've seen everything!" It was a common crowd in the UK, but has since been purged from this cartoon and several others, including "Horton".
