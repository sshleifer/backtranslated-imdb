The Good Times was a revolutionary comedy about the first nuclear black family living in Chicago projects. Regardless of whether you live in cities, ghettos, suburbs or rural areas, this performance is still mild for watching and watching a family that is just a family, not a notion of a poor black family. But they do not stay on that. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Despite the story behind the scenes, this show was worth keeping in the air, except that I did not like to kill my father as I agreed with Esther Rolle who fought to keep the family together. But, despite all the fighting behind the scenes, Good Times was a show about the family. We all loved JJ's dynamite and his antiques. We watched Penny Janet Jackson grow a little bit. This performance was revolutionary to show desperation in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without being a preacher, Evans was always trying to do the right thing, not doing something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
