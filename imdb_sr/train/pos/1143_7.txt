I do not watch soaps. My grandmother still looks at the clock. I laughed them when I was ten (it was so easy). But this film takes a parody and writes in a new way. I thought the story was pretty funny. The fashion of the 80's - shoulder pads, embroidery and polyester - it's just overwhelming. Huge hair, high heels and histrionics - what kind of combination? And all the actors are just going to town, I will chew my parts and spit them out in a large well-written bunch. Salli, Kevin, Elisabeth - beautiful! Vhoopi - great! Robert Dovna - refreshing to see him back when he had such a potential, before the tabloid. And Garry: Why did we wait so long to see him on the movie? Leesa Gibbons - she did not miss her, but she was glad to include her as a real entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for that job at all?). Salli climbs to the drain. Luci Ricardo did this, how many times?, As every comic book by Carol Burnett does not know who and how I ended up, I could spit peanuts if I have them. Obviously, this is what you do when you're fun at a high building in New York. I'm just grateful that they did not pull out the flag flask. But it was sweet, it was funny, there were complicated complications, it was after the credits ended before it was usual, the clothes worthy of another look, it had a great role for me He has personal memories. Really, what else do you need?
