What is good about it: Some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will come under the skin of even the most demanding horror. It does not rely on hacked sounds because of its moments. Even if you've seen everything, there are still a few things in this movie that will make your jaw cap. What could have been better about: The play was sometimes straight and unconvincing. In some places he had a "shot-on-video" quality (although he mostly achieved the atmosphere he was trying to), and camera work was full of unnecessary close-ups of meaningless actions. Although the effects are really creepy, I think they may have gone to the well several times with some of them. The ending seemed to hurry, and overtook what could have been more impressive moments. The viewer was left to find out much about himself, not as a challenge for filmmakers, but because they just missed him. Still, a good little indie horror movie that is just a few steps above the average. It's worth renting.
