I just watched I. K. again tonight and forgot how much I love this movie. It's great fun and gives you the feeling that everything is fine with the world. I love allusion to Mozart from the opening with "Einstein" playing "Tvinkle, Tvinkle Little Star" on the violin to him, as Eine Kleine Nachtmusik stings during the IW testing of Ed Valters. I like the woman portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, a particularly unique situation for the fifties, the time in which the film was set. (And I was a teacher, but I stayed at home to raise my children, so please do not think I'm a stubborn female libber.) \ T Important and dignified as Catherine's fianc√©, a clinical investigator of behavior. The message for me is that we are not what we are doing, but what we have defined is much more - without markings. There are so many small edges and single-layer strips that are almost irreversible if you do not watch and listen carefully. I caught a few things in a movie that were not listed on the nonsense page. In the scene when Ed Valters spoke at the symposium, there are three instruments (a boxer, a ruler, etc.) that hangs to the right of the chalk board. In the next camera image, there are only 2. In the videos on our video, he quotes the character of Tony Shalobb as Bob Vatters, not Bob Rosetti as he appears in the movie and is on Imdb. I recommend this film. In some estimates it can be a piece, but it has much more content than many give it. Not only that, what is the big actor doing here? Watch and enjoy!
