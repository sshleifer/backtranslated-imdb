I personally liked this film and I am worried about the rating some people gave. It's a film based on a comic book and it's animated, now if you do not like comics or animations, of course this movie will not appeal to you and why you watched and bothered that it was beyond me. However, if you are a fan of interesting, strong characters and heroic (sexy) women who are shooting and saving the world (hell), you love this movie. I thought the story brought me and it was a very cool movie. Pretty anime-eskue or more like some of the American films that follow this new adult animation trend. Like Titan A.E. we encounter the version of the Punisher live. In the end, I recommend this film to a comedian and a super hero of the world, or to anyone who has an open mind in search of a fun movie.
