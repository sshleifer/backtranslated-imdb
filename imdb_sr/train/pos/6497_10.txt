I must have seen this for a dozen times over the years. I was fifteen when I first saw him in BH at the local PBS station. I bought a DVD set to see them kids and I asked them to watch it. They do not teach history at school, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. It expands their critical thinking.

Buy it for your children, along with America Alistair Cooke. Watch with them and let them understand. You'll be glad you did.
