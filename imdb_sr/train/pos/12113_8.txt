I usually stay away from TV movies because of the many ways that you know that these are TV films for five seconds in the picture. This has attracted my attention due to the unusual title and its gloomy, well-developed mood that has been established from the very beginning. While the ubiquitous rain confirmed my suspicions of the wrong story (although the claim that it was set up in California, the movie was mostly filmed around Stormy Vancouver, BC), dark and oppressive in the openly complement Olmos's excellent acting.
