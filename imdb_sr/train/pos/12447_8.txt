There are many materials from comics and novels Modesty Blaise that would be great in the film. Unfortunately, several attempts have been made and they have remained without much potential in the image. So, no, this is not the modesty you know from the comic book (currently printed in the beautiful titles of Titan Books). This is Modesty some 5 or 6 years before the first tape, and from what you can draw from her story, that's right. as a representative and technical advisor. Early drafts of the Miramak project tried to adapt one of the best novels, but they always managed to omit some of the key elements. Tarantino was not happy with any of them, and offered to remove his name from the project so they could continue. Thanks to the studies, they wanted to keep him in the process because they knew that "the character" and her world "got". With film rights close to expiration, they decided to try a very different approach. The result was "My name is modesty", a small movie directly into the video that introduces the character. The film does not represent Villie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important for Blaise's adventures through most of the stories published. What this film accomplishes is showing the power of character itself. Never loses compromise, and you never suspect that she is in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with weapons. The largest part of the film takes place in a casino, which has undoubtedly saved money on production. Does not matter. The film does not appear as cheap. Instead, it gives a fairly comprehensive (and persuasive) story to the character and shows how far ahead she thinks. If Miramak now adjusts any of the comic stories or novels, they are nicely exposed to the background of the character and will not have to spend much time on its "origin." I understand that the words "Direct-to-Video" do not inspire confidence, but this movie is worth a look.
