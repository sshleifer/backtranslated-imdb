It's a pretty good movie, but too Americanized in its predictability. Change Kung Fu for a football and Turkish family for Pakistani, and you can watch Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost as a scene for the scene. The beautiful feature that serves as the backbone of the film is the advancement of the struggle with the mysterious ninja under the highway, starting with poor losses and slowly progressing until the last fight is a victory against itself, as the Kung Fu master pointed out several times. On a different level, Danish life is discovered quite differently than by outsiders: non-authentic immigrants who make up a large part (in fact, most) of Danish citizenship, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, the humiliation of immigrants at the beginning of the film. They all display a different picture than the one we have in mind when the word Denmark is heard.
