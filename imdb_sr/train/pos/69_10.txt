I was late to switch cable channels one night and ran into this film from about 10 minutes to the beginning - every time I thought I was going to bed, something continued to watch me, even though it was the way my time passed for sleeping. This film could have been another movie against a pistol that easily slammed, but instead decided to investigate the effects of the shooting. And even better, the film continued with real life - just when you think it will take an easy and obviously fictitious exit, it turns into a turn and changes the whole look of the movie. This film not only does not follow the formula, it shows how other events often lead to and / or affect what happens afterwards. I just want the filmmakers to investigate problems with antidepressant drugs more - the kids from Columnbine who have been recording it have been for years and it was frightening to see how Deanna fired them every time they were they started nightmares. Until recently they have given things such as sweets and are just starting to understand what long-term effects medicines have. It was very refreshing to see that the aspect of the mental illness of the story received a lot of film, having a relative suffering from a mental illness, I can say that the film was dead in all aspects of mental illness. Bravo director and writer who obviously did his homework on these issues. And for those who think that some things can not happen in the hospital (I do not want to say any details), and you mistakenly wrong - I was there. The scenario was so real that he was incredible. Go buy this movie and show it to the teenagers before it's too late. One day you will be thanked for that.
