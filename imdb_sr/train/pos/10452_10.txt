I want Celine and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they were created for each other, that in a very short time in the film we want to die for each other. Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never arrived. It's about love, but not about stupid things like "notting hills" or those kind of movie. This is life and I believed in them, I believe they are falling ... This was so smart and touching. I just finished looking at him a minute ago and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them again as soon as possible. I must say that I have now become a carpenter and felt like love is only a fake, concept, but with this film I realized that perhaps somewhere, somehow, and sometimes and when, something really could have happened . I am a Frenchman and I did not know Julia Delphi well in spite of Kieslow's "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see her others because she looks like an angel and she has the perfect acting. I saw "before the sunset" (continued in Paris) a few days before I saw "before sunrise" and their thing is no matter. Both are masterpieces of work. proof that you do not have to impress your eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I am sorry for my English language, which I am trying to best help.
