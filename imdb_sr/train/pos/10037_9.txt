The boat may have sunk, but the film is not! The director, James Cameron, from 'The Terminator' repeated this with this incredible picture. One of my favorite scenes is the 'Dinner' scene, where Rose's family and friends meet Jack after saving her. Rose has a face look that every woman should have when you meet 'ONE' ... I hope I have that look when I'm in the room with my future husband. they have a link that is 'MOVIE STUFF', but it's a good movie thing. We have a greedy mommy and all of her elite who has stuck together collaborators who live from the wealth of their husbands. Rose almost suicides, but the star of Gilbert Grape rescues her. I really liked what I was hanging on the boat scene. It was a good risk. The film is long but fantastic !!! Good story, good flow, good actors !!! Go look at it twice if you want, Its worth it !!!
