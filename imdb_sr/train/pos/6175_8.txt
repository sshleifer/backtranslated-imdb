I saw that pilot when he was first shown, and I'm sure that the constant "Spirit" fans hate him because they, like Batman, Green Stirling, etc., But I obviously never got Batman enough, because I thought it was fun, in a way the same way as that. There are two parts that remain with me. First, when Denni's partner was fatally wounded, and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law and respected it. Then, he says something like, "Boy, I was stupid!" This is his way of telling Denny to become vigilant, what he does (even though TV Batman). Then there is a scene in which he tries to seduce the bad guys to let him love her, but she is not deceived, because she is too honest to kiss her convincingly! This was a great example of the "camp", which was also "underestimated," by the actor and actress.
