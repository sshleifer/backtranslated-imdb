Imagination is a terrible thing to lose ... especially when you have talented actors. The writer / director John does not waste his time watching the viewer with his protagonist. Anyone who has shared a flat with a bunch of posters will laugh. Anyone who arrived, while one maid set a ticket to the windshield, will only cry. We all wanted to get rid of a horrible wig from a man's head. These are just passages of what is being prepared when you watch "Cross Eied," an honest film that should be a stepping stone for Jones and his sense of humor both in front of and behind the camera.
