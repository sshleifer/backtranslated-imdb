I found this movie hilarious. Scams on other popular films of that time were some of the funniest I've seen in this type of film. Give it a try. If you've watched the movies that this movie is lying to, and you've got humor, you should enjoy the movie. I (and others who watched the movie with me) felt the funniest part of the film (this is not a spoiler because I will not tell you what is actually happening) was a scene with a "colorful thing" from the MIB. When they first discover the device and do not know what it is ... and then again later in the movie ... you will understand when you get there. My only appeal to the movie is that I never managed to find it on a DVD so I can buy a copy.
