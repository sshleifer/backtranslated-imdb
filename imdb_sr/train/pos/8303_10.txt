This movie literally has every cliche with just one action movie and they all work for their own benefit. Gary Busey's right from the Deadly Weapon was smart, shooting and laughing through this film with such an unreasonable abandon that he can not entertain and entertain. There are tanks, helicopters, machine gunfire, grenades and ice cream vans, and if there are not enough good reasons to watch this movie then how is the best ... Danni Trejo. And if you do not know who Danny Trejo is, you probably will not like this movie.
