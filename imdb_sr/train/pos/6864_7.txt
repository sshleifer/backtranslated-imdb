I saw this movie the first time I was drunk at a motel in Canada. While switching the channel was via Easi Lube. My friend continued to turn, but I told him to come back. Something about the name easi lube simply did not sound right. I watched the rest of the movie, it was pretty funny. I registered several names from the loan and came home to look for it. It turned out to be Chevi Chase's first film. I did not remember him in him. I do not remember much, so I rented it and gave it another branch. It's pretty funny and pretty picturesque. It's like Kentucky Fried Movie, except that it's not so funny. I like my fingers, easy lubrication, and I'm the boy for the president. Sellers skit is pretty cool too. I give him 6.5 or 7 out of ten
