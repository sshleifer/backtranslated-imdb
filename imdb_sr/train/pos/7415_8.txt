How powerful and amazing it is simply filming movies. This film says that it is a story with everyday scenes that they manage to discover the sharpness in themselves. It is true, as others have stated, that this film really makes it obviously apparent that Hollywood's lost in its special effects, overwhelming emotionality and superb climactic endings and forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told by simple realism. So much so that these characters pass by means the scene, not in a clear dialogue. One of the aspects that I really enjoyed in the film was the contrast between the two brothers, one so openly expressive in his childish way, and the other completely stoic, but both able to cause deep emotions. The older brother had to say a little, as he usually did, that it was all in his insignificant face! Beautiful cinema, great acting, excellent direction! Do not miss it!
