I can not believe this film was rated at 6.9. In any case, this film was probably one of the most discerning Indian films I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie showing a traditional family movie theater. As far as the story that I thought was great, the Shahid Capur is set on an agreed marriage with amrita rao. He's kinda lucky guy, and Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle, but the only problem is that her cousin does not attract as much attention as her aunt does not like Amrita with passion. This upset Amrita because she just wanted aunt to love her. It was also very touching to see that although the Amrita family was not rich, perhaps only a middle class to the lower class, while the Shahids family was a much higher class, they continued to treat their family with respect and did not even ask them to lower them, which was really there. I hit a nerve. This is because I really saw that people were very rude to people who did not even think they were below their standards which I consider very shallow. This film has shown that the Shahid family is ready to look at the great values ​​that Amrita was educated and close her eyes to the fact that she was not a wealthy businesswoman or anything else. All in all, this film has earned 8/10 I would like to see more and more such films are made.
