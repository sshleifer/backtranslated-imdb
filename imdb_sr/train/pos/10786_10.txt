I and my sister use this to rent this every time we get movies and our parents would be so angry at it (but they let us out) and I love it ... I can not find anyone who lives near me who knows what I'm talking about ... I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... I wish I could find this on DVD somewhere !! I would like to watch this now just because I loved him as much as a little kid ... and now I am 15 years old !!! I remember so much about it ... from where I got a little song bunny fufu and all my friends know the song, but not the movie !! I think the girl arrived by dropping a slide in her little playground
