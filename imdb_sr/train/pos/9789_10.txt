The story is told fluently. There is no interruption. The flash is incompressibly inserted into the present. Casting was great. The young Ia'ara seemed to look at the Ia'ara at that time. Her portrayal of a blind person has been done convincingly. The director Daniel Sirkin has done a great job in connecting the various actors in this story. Cinema is very good. You feel like you are with Ia'ar and Thalia walking towards the ocean to the edge of the cliff. English subtitles are very closely followed by the Hebrew script. It is interesting to note that although "Out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Aiin" Both names are very suitable for the story.
