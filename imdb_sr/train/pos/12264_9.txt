If, like me, I have a very close relationship with the world of Tintin ... do yourself a favor and watch this wonderful documentary about Herge and his life that creates Tintin. They are so brilliant and very cool productions. The whole background story of Herge and people, as well as the many different situations that he influenced, for the good and the worse, is amazing. There is a very fine and obvious connection between comics and this one. I'm sure to be in the basement and dig up Tintin's albums again. Also, the film itself is very well told and has excellent ambient sound. I really hope people find this as intriguing as I do!
