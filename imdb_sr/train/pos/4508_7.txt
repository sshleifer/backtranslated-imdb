I was impressed with the beautiful photograph in this film, which was shot at the location in Alaska. Although a technical melodrama, we see a lot of activities involving eskimi, such as hunting, dancing, building a needle, etc. Hunting sequences were sometimes on recordings, because it was easy to recognize some of the rear scenes of animals, but even these were fascinating. Fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou, and even polar bear and whales made it sometimes documentary. There was no role play, which strengthened documentary taste. The filmmakers tried to look very authentic, with the native speakers speaking only in the Eskimo language that was translated by someone on the screen or through the translation. The introduction states that, in addition to white traders and the Royal Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but that was not true. The two main characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but they were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes and make-up. But they were great in their roles and continued to have Hollywood career. All in all, the film is certainly worth a look.
