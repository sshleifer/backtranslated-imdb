The title is onomatopoeic, the sound of trams that shake the rails. It is a metaphor for everything that people living in a landfill can not have. The accidents of these people illustrate the passing tram, which represents a relatively unattainable rich middle-class life. The patos of a young boy and his beloved but sadly crazy father touches the most. This was the first Kurosavin color film and he uses beautifully shocking shades, colors that are seen only in dreams. The film is surreal and surpasses beauty. Compassion for mankind is a subordinate force, but as always, Kurosava is focused on capturing the beauty of the film. It's the masterpiece of the genius of the cinema.
