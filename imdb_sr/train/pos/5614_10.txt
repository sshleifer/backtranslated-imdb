It took me a long time to find a title in a special video in Berlin, and I was fortunate to find the English version with the Dutch language. I think it's one of the best horror moms ever. It seems strange to me that some people call this film a black comedy. I must admit, I could not laugh when I first saw it (and that was the second time!) On the one hand, Trelkovsky looks so nice and sweet in his shy behavior, but on the other hand he battles this boy on the playground and for this there is no explanation. But the most forgetful thing is, of course, his transformation into Simone Choule and the fact that he does not know who he really is. His hallucinations are the most horrifying in this film. Of course, everything is in his mind, but whether this is an apartment that comes out of that woman's side or even before he moved in - I think that's an interesting question. His schizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is horrible to see his two sides or identities struggling against each other. As a result, he first crossed his arm and then jumped out of his window. But this terrible cry - does that mean that everyone will repeat again and again and again ... that his soul is in a cage or something like that? And you Egyptian hieroglyphics and other Egyptian things? The fact that it looks like a mummy in a hospital - it's not an incident, it's a trace in my mind.
