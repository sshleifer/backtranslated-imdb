this movie takes you inside you in the early minutes and keeps you up to the end. has a very human story and very good music. Gluma Moric Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) are satisfactory. Recommended for people who are bored with action movies and want to see a good movie.
