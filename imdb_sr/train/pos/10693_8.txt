This is a great small movie, which is very unique and creative, with great complications and beautiful performances! All the characters are great, and the story is bizarre, fascinating and very interesting, and Nicole Kidman is simply incredible! It's very difficult to describe this movie, because it's really bizarre, it's comedy / romance, one minute later it turns into a thriller next, but it was still fun, and Nikolin's Russian accent was fantastic, and extremely convincing. Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry together, and I loved Vincent Cassel's performance! The end was very sweet, and unpredictable through all that! You will feel sorry for Caplin and the way he is deceived, and I thought that all the characters are really nice, and the finals are especially good. This is Nicolin's movie, and she wears it with her incredibly sexy performance! This is a great small movie, which is very unique and creative, with great complications and beautiful performances! The direction is very good! Jez Buttervorth is doing a very good job, with excellent work with the camera, firm angles and keeping the film on a quick rhythm! The acting is wonderful! Nicole Kidman is stunningly beautiful! She is incredible as ever, incredibly sexy, very cute, had one of the best accents, added a lot of presence, she had very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin and she had a very mysterious character! , she was incredible. (Kidman Rules !!!!). Ben Chaplin is great here, he is very cute, he had a cool character, he had very good chemistry with Kidman, the only thing I did not like was if he was out of my mind at Kidman, although what she did was wrong and I loved how end vengeance! Vincent Cassel is fantastic as the main loser, that he was OTT, but he was very intense and quite creepy in time, this role was perfect for him. Mathieu Kassovitz is good here, but he did not have much work to do. Other actors are fine. All in all, I recommend this! *** 1/2 of 5
