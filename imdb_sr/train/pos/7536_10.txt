A comment from the person who said Pat Robertson was evil and that his program was evil, there is nothing to compare what is evil and just. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days, people will call evil and evil good things good! He does not even know that he fulfilled biblical prophecy! If you do not know God and refuse to know him now, that's fine. He still loves you, but when you finally worship Him, and he will, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone to hell, not even you! You will go there with your decision and your ejection defines it! May God pity you and give you experience from Damascus. The Ministry of the Club 700 and Pat Robertson is one of the reasons why I am still here. On the verge of alcoholism, adultery, and possibly death, God came through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God for what he did! You have the right to say what you said, but you have no right to swear by your words. God is pitying for you.
