First think of another Disney movie, maybe it's good, but it's a movie for kids. But when you watch it, you can not enjoy it. Everyone will love to love this movie. The first time I saw this movie when I was 10 years old and now 8 years later I still love it! Danny Glover was wonderful and could not play a role better. Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and perfect for the role. Tony Danza is as convincing as Mel Clark. You can not help but enjoy this movie! I give it 10/10!
