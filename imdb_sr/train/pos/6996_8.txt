This film was a really great movie about something that affects all of us. I know that I have personally fall into this many times. Thank God that Vill Smith jumped on the social issue of text messaging while driving. People, do not do it. An hour and forty-five minutes is not enough for this. Personally, I wanted to throw my cell phone after the movie. I was glad to see other people in the theater seeing the message and throwing phones with empty popcorn bags. I decided to disable all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, make them watch this vital public announcement about text messages while driving or can kill seven people. Thanks for showing us the way.
