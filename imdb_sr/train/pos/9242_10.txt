It's hard to rate movies like this, because you rate it on production or just at a party? I saw this film about 1988/89. they say that it started a long-lasting fascination with ninjas. The action is pretty scary and the acting is of course horrible, but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninja in this film, which makes a pretty good atmosphere. What's important is that the fighting scenes, while the 'small' jokes, are really good. I must say that it was better when I was a boy, I can only now see the visible points of incredible nonsense. in the movie, but as a "relax with a few beers" a martial arts film can not blame him, he brings and is much better than the "American Ninja" style of garbage that was thrown out of the 80s with hundreds of guys in black suits, but really Not really a good fighting scene. In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, writer and director Sakura Killers has done another ninja film under the banner of the Bonaire movie "Take the Phantom" I have no idea if this should have been a sequel to Sakura Killers, but the Sakura clan is again the main characteristic, including the same logo and a similar story just this time, including the Wrath of the Ninja. He had a small sense of atmosphere, but the fighting scenes are even more widespread and sincere, they are quite terrible. <br / > So, if you're a martial arts fan, then break it to kill a few hours!
