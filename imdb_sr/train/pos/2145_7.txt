"Shall Ve Dance?", Light Heart from Japan, talks about an overburdened bookkeeper and family man attracted by a dance studio by a beautiful woman she sees from the train during a day's drive. What they find in the studio are dancing lessons, and most of all by themselves. Funny, sharp and extremely charming, "SVD" is an award-winning movie worth watching from mature viewers. (B)
