I still remember seeing this for the first time on TV. I could not believe TVNZ released! I had to own it! A lot of humor will be lost on non-NZ'ers, but let him go! Since the end of the last part of the series, Matt and Chris have moved to bigger and better (?) stuff. The biggest NZ's stupid stuntman, Randi Campbell, often appeared on the British TV series Balls of Steel. Yes, he was still in all his cascades because he was too drunk. Deja Voodoo has since released two albums, Brovn Sabbath and Back in Brovn. The band consists of members of the Back of the I team and singles like 'I'd give you one of my beers (but I just got 6') and 'You were not even born in '80. The South-bi-Southvest film festival featured feature-length feature film The Devil Made Me Do It, which will be released in early 2008 in the NZ. Any worse, if you do not find these guys funny then you can only F% ^ K OFF !!
