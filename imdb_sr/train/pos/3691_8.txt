The entire whole does not even approach the sum of the parts. No problem. This film contains a line of some of the most diverse creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the acting team. The segments are designed around the same theme, "Love in Paris," but the similarity ends there. Actually, having in mind that access to this topic from all these different directors has so many forms, it's amazing that even we can feel that we still watch the same movie. No major effort was made to turn it into a comprehensive whole. This buffet has so many great ingredients, I'm glad that nobody tried to put everything into one dish.
