Such films about young teenagers struggling with their sexuality were something unique and boldly courageous years ago, but more and more such films have been made in the past few years, which makes it difficult for films to continue to stand out. . And this film got some publicity, except for the usual film festivals on which this little French film was, as well as large festivals that always like such films about everyday topics are not used too often in movies. The film was premiered in Cannes in 2007 and has also won some awards there. The film does not stand out from others because it actually has little news when you've already seen some similar movies. but this does not mean that "Naissance des pieuvres" is bad for watching. The film is certainly a good watch, which works well for its theme and tells its story permanently, and therefore effectively, in a typical, slower French cinema rhythm. life mostly three completely different middle teenagers. Sexuality is a big topic in the film, which is processed delicately and subtly. The film makes the film and his story quite realistic, although perhaps a little predictable, because the film does not offer anything original in its genre. This type of French film will probably scare. many people for the reason they probably expect to be very artistic, with deep layers and meanings. "Naissance des pieuvres" is still a very affordable movie for everyone and you really do not have to be in euro-teen movies to appreciate this movie. It is a cute and somewhat sensual type of film, because of its subjective and visual approach. The film also becomes realistic by its actors, who do not have and have much experience in film business, but they have an authentic look and feel in their roles. Powerful individual characters give the film some nice theme and good moments. Good movie about the topic. 7/10
