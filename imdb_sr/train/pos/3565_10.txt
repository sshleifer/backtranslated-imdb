Guis and Dolls is a unique character-based game. Ski Masterson Marlon Brando is a high-end gambler who takes a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs money to play his usual game and make a fortune. The bet was that Ski could not take any girl in Havana, Cuba and the "doll" she chose was Sarah. Ski finally bribes Sarah enough to go to Havana with herself. In the end, they fall in love with each other, but later accuse him of something he did not participate in. Nathan spent the missionary shit on the night they left. Nathan's 14-year-old fianc√© Adelida (Vivian Blaine) does not approve of Nathan's gambling attempts to prevent him from doing so. However, when the film finishes, everything ends with a happy double wedding. The songs in this movie are wonderful no matter who sang it. Marlon Brando has no singing voice at all and the truth that they could call him, but it did not matter. He did a wonderful acting job (obviously looking like Brando) and he played very well his character. I saw several films with Jean Simons and thought that this film was her weakest film, and she could not sing. However, the singing is made up of Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubbi Kaie. Vivien Blaine and Stubbi Kaie were also in the original Broadway production Guis and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a great voice and was perfect Adelaide. If you love music, and even if you do not, I advise you to watch this.
