Top Columbo from start to finish. I especially like the interaction between Columba and the killer, Ruth Gordon. As a fan of Columba, I can not think of any other in which he does not put the killer in the end because he works in other episodes. In this, while trying to determine the correct order of the boxes and the "message" that the nephew has left behind, he finally merges. And the music in this episode is very good. as well as in many others.
