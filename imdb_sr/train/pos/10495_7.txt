Saving Grace is a good movie to watch in a boring afternoon, when looking for something different from regular scenarios and wanting to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the marijuana in it is such craziness! It was the first film I was looking at with this subject (drug / marijuana) that did not criticize it, but just joked about it. Grace Trevethin is a widow who lives in a small town in the UK and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide because he was full of debts. The problem is that Grace, who imagined her to save some money for her, reveals that she should pay all her husbands' pounds in debt so that she does not lose all her things, especially her house she loves so much. She had never worked before, and she is in a tragic situation while Matthev, her gardener, who found a lot of smoked herbs, decided to partner with her in the sale of marijuana to a great extent.
