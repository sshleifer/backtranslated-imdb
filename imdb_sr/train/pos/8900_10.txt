This is a great classic monster movie from the '50s! I just like the look of the 50s, like cars and music. Anyway, I love the way the blob looks. I love when everyone at a late night horror in a theater and a blob comes and ruins a party. One more thing I love is that it takes place one night, just like Night of Witches II. There is a lump inside the meteor. Whenever a blobber consumes a person, it becomes bigger and bigger. They are trying to convince people of the city in connection with the monster, but no one later believes them. Can anything stop this creature? I recommend THE BLOB !!!
