This is another movie called Madhur Bhandarkar. I'm not sure why he has this obsession to show the Child Mole *** and g * and the concepts to the Indian film audience, but I consider some of these scenes disgusting! What's new? It's a nice piece made by Bhandarkar, where he portrays the story of a reporter about the party played by the lead lady in the famous film Mr & Mrs Iier. What makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories people with whom this reporter communicates or with whom he is a friend, such as her rooms, her colleagues, movie stars, models, rich people, and others who appear on the funny page # 3 in her newspaper. Visible: This is another good performance by Mrs. Iier. It's likely to be noticed for this role. She performs selective roles, but shines in them. She is noticeably de-glamorous and less beautiful in this movie. But then, entertainment journalists should not shine the people they cover, right? Judgment: Madhur has come up with another good movie, which is very nice to lead to social problems. However, this film loses focus and is not sure what the director is trying to convey. Will they show us the splendor and glamor of rich people? or trying to show us the life of a reporter of the party and confronting him with the life of REAL's criminal reporter? Is he trying to tell us that the government and wealthy people are ruling the press? or trying to illustrate the problems of child abuse and g * i folk. Other concepts included include the unwritten rule that young women must sleep with directors or colleagues if they want to enter Bolivia. In addition, he talks about how flying aides are getting sick and tired. After a while, and resort to extreme measures marrying much older people, etc. He also talks about unhappy women and spoiled boys in wealthy families. Too too complex for the average visitor of the movie, who only wants to alleviate some stress from everyday work
