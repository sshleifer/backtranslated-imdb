After turning to Secrets & Lies, Brenda Blethin acted in an equally large "Saving Grace". And to tell you, this is not a movie you see every day. After her husband committed suicide, Grace Trevethin (Brenda Blethin) discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left him with huge debt. Fortunately, he finds a way to end the end: marijuana. That's right, Grace started to process it. Each aspect of this film is played with great effect; there is not one boring moment in it. And I certainly did not see that ultimate scene! But all the same, you have to see this movie. You may feel more than a little solemn after you see it. If nothing else, it can serve as a good lesson on financial knowledge. But, of course, there is much more to it!
