The film is absolutely silly. But did you expect an intelligent high-end movie based on the Slam Dunk comic? Really? The performance of Jaia Chou is not exactly the most direct thing I've ever seen, but I certainly enjoyed the film. Was it somewhere near the level of a brilliant that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chov could produce? Not really. Was it fun if you just take it to surface value? Absolutely. It's a movie about some Chinese idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unrealistic level of expertise. There's an evil triad-tip and a freaking guy who brings Jai Chou into all this. Love interest. It's a formulaic one, but really, it temporarily restrains the unbelief. Come on. His name is Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you signed? Do yourself a favor if you look at it - I found a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie an almost incomprehensible conversation, but we were very happy. They seem to be extremely focused on Jerusalem and on the numbers 1, 10. I laughed, I cried, I threw myself. I would watch again. Especially for this scene fighting at the bar. Well choreographed and well recorded. I especially enjoy the plexiglass pool table - I would like to play on one of them. Sufficiently soft for me, but digging through garbage.
