Paul Verhoeven (the genius and master of the film) is back with a less perfect, but still entertaining, "dirty old man," Hollough Man. The first two acts are so good that they disappoint the final act of slasher. However, I recommend this film for the special effects of MIND BLOVING (perhaps the best so far) and two nonsense on the water. Verhoeven's moral questions are, of course, provocative thoughts, and even though the film was discarded by many, this film is a fairly soft core for the old Verhoeven. The whole deal with the elevator. If there are access ladders, why are they trapped in a lab? A fun horor movie for Saturday night.
