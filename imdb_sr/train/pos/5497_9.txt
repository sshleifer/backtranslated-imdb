An outstanding documentary that gives a vibrant view of the land deeply divided within itself (for further evidence, see some of the comments on IMDb ...!). He extensively agrees with Oliver Stone's "Comandante" (which is mainly deep-fingers of Fidel Castro's hair). I do not know if Chavez is all that is presented, or another in the long line of populist Latin American "caudillos". I do not even know if he will be able to fulfill the great expectations he has obviously built among the poor majority of Venezuelan people. It's not very reasonable to expect such a film to be able to answer such questions - but certainly now I have a pretty lively idea of ​​what's on the dice, and how it feels to be caught in the middle of the coup. Someone says in the movie "making history", and that's exactly what the film feels like recording. Extraordinary things.
