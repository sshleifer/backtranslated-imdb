I was glad to see that he had black hair! For thirty years, I am a fan and I am delighted with the previous two attempts to shoot a story. I was glad that the scriptwriters updated the period to turn on the computer, right? you break it at all. In fact, I watched the film twice in a day, a sure sign that this is standard. That's what I do with the books I love. I thought that all the characters were well presented and represented early days Modesti Blaisea very well as they showed in the book and comics. I would also have to disagree with the commentary of earlier critics that bad people must be ugly. Did he actually read the books? I thought this was a very good movie and I look forward to continuing my expectations.
