When I saw it as a child, he answered all my questions and scattered all the fears or misconceptions I had. It's easy to watch because it's animated, making it unbearable. It does not have moral bias or "pre-eminent" aspects, so that no one should have any objections to it. It's a nice movie that simply gives the facts about menstruation in an encouraging way. I hope to show it to my daughter.
