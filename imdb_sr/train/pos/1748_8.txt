From the very beginning, I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is perhaps the funniest I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my home in September. Each element in this film merged so nicely. You often do not see a movie with so many penises, gays, and racial jokes that critics praise. Carell and other actors deliver every indecent joke sensational. Carell remains cute throughout the movie where you can cheer him up to the end of the film to succeed in his relationship more than you have to put it on. Supporters are brutal, each of them has some problems with the ladies themselves. One of the things about this movie is the abundance of unforgettable scenes we get. That's what makes the film easy to remember. This film will often appear when the word "depilation of chest" and "condoms" is mentioned in the conversation. I saw a group of four women in the mid-sixties. Despite the older audience, this film still filled the entire theater with laughter. \ T Office and Steve Carell. Many jokes remind me of the type of joke you would see on the Familia Gui. The film is sufficiently shallow for adolescent boys and is still cute and smart enough for middle-aged women. I do not recommend that you go to this movie if you are not a lover of cursing or if you are easily offended. However, when you are on the movie, remember that this movie is in a good mood. Jokes are not "gay jokes", they are just jokes. And they're funny.
