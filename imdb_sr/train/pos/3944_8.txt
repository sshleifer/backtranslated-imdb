This little movie has been on my "watchdog" list for a long time. Do people realize that under stress, menopause, emotionally abused women (as well as mentally retarded) were really treated by the medical profession at the end of the century? !! All the pious Christian attitudes of that time were deadly to explore true emotional feelings that would enable us to accept the souls of suffering, let alone explore what it means to accept our humanity. Can you really imagine (according to today's standards) that the books of Walt Whitman were banned because he recognized that women had feelings and emotional reactions that are as great as men? Think about it! The sensitivity of this film still encourages me, and I thank the director what he did with his eyes.
