Alive Alive is a very fun SCI-FI movie from Japan. I noticed a lot of disappointed film geeks who liked the debut film Versus of this director or his third movie Azumi. I heard that movies were soaked with blood with swords and zombies and all kinds of treats. Frankly, I went to the videotape to get Versus, but I'm fine with Alive. If you are looking for action from the beginning to the end of the wall, Alive is not your choice. There are many actions, however, it comes as an hour's payout. Personally, I think it is well done and worth it. Of course, some of the actions are as stupid as with many SCI-Fi action movies and I think that the subtitles that use the term page object can be replaced by a parasite for a greater effect. This film is brutal when it should be so weak that it should not be applied. They kept the budget for the most part by restricting all the action to an underground building (taking a sign from the cube)), but the film does not suffer because of it. Another bonus for this film is the intense Gothic idea that has been made with great artistic glow during many Flashback and dream sequences. Rent this!
