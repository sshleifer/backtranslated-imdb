Certainly, because it's a great picture and a terrific sound, it's a great home theater movie, but it's also a moving drama and an informative documentary. Parallel stories interwoven through this film will interest all viewers. Young, old, boys and girls will equally discover that we are deeply in love with all the car enthusiasts, especially the high performance machines that are the result of a generation of blood, sweat, tears, genius and persistence. Mark Knopfler and Ri Cooder soundtrack are perfectly matched with visual content and content. I do not want to give an end, but the final driving sequence in the Daisy Like These of Kuinci Jones can only bring tears to the eye. Enjoy!
