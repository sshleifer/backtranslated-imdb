It's great to see Shane Meadovs already doing international influence - LES CONVOIEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with ROOMS FOR ROMEO BRASS: an unclear class identity above the working but well under the middle, a fickle father, an abandoned urban mile, an emotional feeling of adult failure, a barely fascist fascism that supports modern urban life. But if Meadovs is an expert for formalists, Mariage processes images, and his coolly composed, exquisite Surreal, monochrome frames, serve to get away from a dirty and rather dark object, which, like Meadows from a high farce to a tragedy in a few seconds. There are longueurs and clich√©s, but Poelvoorde is incredibly crazy, an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions, whose attempts to realize them are dangerous; while single pieces - popcorn / pajon; the best marriage sequence of DEAD and DEADLI - manages to grab epiphany out of despair.
