Several times I watched this movie on DVD, for the first time I watched the other half after an hour, and then I returned for the first hour. a funny movie, thank God that there is no kiera knightlei in it, refreshing and it gives us a real insight into the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing bad about the movie at all, no real bad language or anything of sexual character that would offend family viewing. It can encourage children to explore a little about Victoria himself and perhaps less well-known characters such as Conroi and Lord Melbourne
