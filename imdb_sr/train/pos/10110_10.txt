Each story consists of premise, character and conflict. The characters who draw their game promise a triumph, and the militant figure readily agrees to this. The space of Ardha Satie is summed up with the eponymous song written by Dilip Chiter. The line goes - "palde mein napunsaktha, doosre palde mein paurush, aur teek tarazu ke kaante par, ardh satia?". A rough translation - "the delicate balance between the right and the wrong (commonly seen on the batter of blind justice in the courts) has helplessness on one plate and heroism on the other." The song recites in half film Smith Smith in Om Puri in the restaurant. influences the protagonists and sets the stage for many later events that follow. At the end of the film, Om Puri ends in exactly the same situation described so convenient in the song. The movie is trying hard to make one by one on the song. However, Chitrow's words are too powerful and, at best, with the film coincides with the song in every way. <br /> <br />
