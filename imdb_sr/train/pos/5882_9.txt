In Mexico, this film is only broadcast on PaiTV. The life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a true example of a good German and especially a good man. Talks between Tucker's character and the Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. The War of True Ideas: Two different Germans, both believe there. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: a man, a freedom fighter, a boy, a churches, and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is remarkable as Bonhoeffer. I have recommended this film much, especially in these difficult times for the planet. In Mexico, we do not know much about the life and pasture of Pastor Bonhoeffer, this is a great job to rescue the forgotten hero.
