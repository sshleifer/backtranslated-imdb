Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphi. Ves Craven. Dream Team. This is one of the best thrillers in 2005. Excellent craft. Big Eye Candy. This is one of Vesa Craven's biggest films, except "Scream" and "Nightmare on Elm Street". This could be the best. The action is one of the best things about the movie and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), who is fighting for a hotel manager, is boarding in late Red Eye back to LA. Little does she know that it was followed by Jack Ripper, Jack The Ripper (Murphi). They have a couple of drinks and finally sit in the plane together. She later revealed to her that the killer was sent to kill the Homeland Security Secretariat who is staying at Lisa's hotel. And what about this with Lisa. Well, they would have to move their room to a top apartment so they could bomb it if Ripner did not kill her father (Brian Cock). Inspiration and bringing the story really gives him extra zing, and foreign characters and humorous parties really contribute to it. All in all, definitely one of the best trillers in 2005. Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 4 stars
