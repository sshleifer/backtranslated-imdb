Well done and elegant, and yet it makes sense, this thriller would work better for fans who are not gayly interested in this genre, than the later argento inputs outweigh all directions. For lovers of these crazy Italian trillers, they will appreciate George Hilton and the diversion that his character takes and the one through which he passed. Working with cameras is crisp with graphic violence and unusual but appropriate choices and good not too much musical result. The less you know about the story, the better it works. The only thing that is not enough to maintain this as an excellent giant Sergio Martino is that the story does not have that extra sexual or psychological, or both elements to put it over the top. It is more a routine mystery, characters are well defined, but live or die by conspiracy, not according to their own virtues and defects. The recent release of DVDs (2005) is nice looking and it's definitely a way to see a movie, unless they never get projections of art houses that seem unlikely.
