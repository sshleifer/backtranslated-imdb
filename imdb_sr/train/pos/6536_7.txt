Let's be realistic; Nancy Drew was never a great literature. It is located in the same category as the babysitter club, magic house on wood, Goosebumps, ABC Misteries. In fact, it was one of the original stories about the formula. Nants are perfect, beautiful, thoughtful, "beautiful", there are no internal conflicts! and never changes. Ned is quite similar. The film was true to that style and I have to say, I liked it. It will never be a great movie, but it had the same nostalgic taste as books. He had the right amount of uncertainty for my children (8 and 10). There was not nearly an offensive language. She liked to push for a more conservative dress. Corky was a little angry. He was a little out of place in a high school campus. I never understood why he was there at all.
