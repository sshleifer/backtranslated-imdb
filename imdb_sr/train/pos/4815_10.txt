This is on my top list of all your favorite movies! It's a fantastic and insightful movie. It was historically interesting and great for watching! I thought the acting Emily Blunt was fantastic and Rupert's friend was fantastic Albert, the best actor was chosen for Albert. The costumes were beautiful, and the settings and scenes such as the opera were incredible and detailed. I just liked it, all of it! I loved the childhood scene that she was "mistreated" by John Conroy. And where her mother says she has to walk up the stairs with an adult. Once again the writers did it! They made this fantastic scenario! It basically deserves the rewards they got. (Oscar and BAFTA won Sandi Povell for costume design, BAFTA for best makeup and hair, Oscar in best artistic achievement, best achievements in costume design, best achievements in make-up. Design, also nominated for best actress Emili Blunt CDG for excellence in costume design for the period of the film - Hampton International Film Prize for the Best Narrative PFCS Award for Best Costume Design. VFCC for Best Actress, Emili Blunt.) A total of 10 victories and 11 nominations! That's pretty good! http: //vvv.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/avards Watch yourself, really interesting! Personally Rupert Friend was supposed to get a prize.
