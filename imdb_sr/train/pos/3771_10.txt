In 1991, the two best sequels of all time were published: TERMINATOR 2: DAY OF THE JUDGE AND BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEI. Of these two, I always liked BILL & TED's BOGUS JOURNEI better. TERMINATOR 2: THE DAY OF JUDGING is better made, but there is nothing like Bill and Ted. In addition to Chris Farley and David Spade at TOMMI BOI, it's hard to imagine a larger comedy duo than Bill and Ted. They are unique. Seen under the influence of O.C. Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at the local theater in LA. The two of them quickly began to write a script about two, and before that BILL & TED was born a great adventure. The film, shot in 1987 and released in 1989, has become a great success in the box office and an instant cult classic. It did not take much time before he started working on the sequel. Stephen Herek, the director of "EKSCELLENT ADVENTURE", was not interested in working on the sequel because he thought that it was too creepy and unlike the first one, so Peter Hevitt, who debuted in a feature film, was directed to direct the sequel. There could not be a better director for that job. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEI is beautifully directed. It is filled with its own unique style and energy that can not be accommodated. What makes 'BOGUS JOURNEY' one of the best sequences ever is that while it's darker than the original, it's just as fun. It does not change the characters, as most continuations do. Bill and Ted are the same cute characters that were in the first movie. This is because they were written by original writers. Most of the sequels were not written by the same writers as the first, but since 'BOGUS JOURNEI' had the same scriptwriters, it ended up as good as 'EXCELLENT AVANTURE', if not better. Just like the first, 'BOGUS JOURNEI' is absolutely hilarious, well written, fun and, above all, genuine. It is filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedy performances by Alec Winter, Keanu Reeves and Villiam Sadler. It's an unforgettable 'trip'. 10/10
