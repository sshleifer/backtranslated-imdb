Do you think it was difficult for you? You should look at this movie. Carl Brashear is a symbol of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a naval diver, should be an inspiration for all of us. Significantly, after I looked at this movie, I learned that what is shown is not even half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. works some of his best works so far as Brashear. De Niro, as usual, is as good as a southern peasant who trains him. George Tillman in his second major composition (after "Soul Food") made a big jump as a director. If you want to be mobile and inspired, you must check this one.
