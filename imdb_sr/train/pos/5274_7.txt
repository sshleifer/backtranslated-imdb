Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid. When I grew up I saw this film so many times that my dad had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy was worn out. My family got a VHS copy of this movie when we bought a new VHS system. At first, my mom was not sure this was an appropriate film for a 10-year-old, but because we just bought a new VHS system, she let me watch it. As I said, this movie is every little boy's dream? The film contains incredible ambience, great muscular barriers, beautiful women in toples, great bad monsters and jokes that you will only get when you become older. A couple of days ago I dropped the video and watched the movie again after a long time. At first I was bored, and then I began to think about how much I love this movie when I was a kid, and I continued to watch. Yes, the experience was not as big as I remembered? The acting is pretty bad, the story is pretty bad, the jokes were no longer funny, but the women were still pretty. Yes, I grew up. Although the film experience has changed for me, I still think it's worth the 7 stars. You know for good old times?
