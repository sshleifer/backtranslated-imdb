good movie, good music, good background and acceptable action. but the main thing again, like his films, man is the best actor in the idiom and can turn the dust into gold. nana patekar. This may be his second best performance after a parade (others may not agree). although other movies are not far behind. one man who will never disappoint you. Good movie though I think Shahrukh was the luxury that this movie could do. you can see in his films, others are trying hard to reach his heights and act out of their skin. but this man is really something elusive. The film is cool, music and direction is great complication, a bit slim, but the game screen and dialogue are very good again. a must vatch.
