Being from the suburbs of Philadelphia and extremely interested in local history, this film provides an excellent view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes in the city center, a railway station that no longer exists, the 30th Street Station - which still exists, as well as scenes from the northeastern part of the city. Good recordings of old houses in a row, as they appeared at that time. The film sometimes "chills" - causes the viewer to lose interest for a short time ... but the whole story is firm and very moving. Anyone who enjoyed this movie should try to watch the film "Light Victory", also with local recordings of the Vallei Forge Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and a scene from the center of Phoenixville. The military hospital has since become a college campus. None of these films are in any format and I can not imagine why. I have both of them on VHS from home recording, as shown on TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to any other history lovers out there!
