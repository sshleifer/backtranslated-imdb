There is no connection between Fortier and Profiler, but also the fact that both police series are about violent crimes. Profiler looks crisp, Fortier looks classical. Profiler plots are quite simple. Forty complications are much more complicated ... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to see the similarities ... The main character is weak and weird, but he has "clairvoyance". People like to compare, evaluate, evaluate. How could we enjoy it? The funny thing, people who write Fortier look American, but, on the other hand, claiming to prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's language or spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. Otherwise, the actors are really good and fun. The act is not superficial at all ...
