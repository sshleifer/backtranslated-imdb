This movie was a very good movie. I will say that performances are sometimes weak; but mostly, the acting is very good. The only actor who took me with his performance was Jude Lew as Harlen Maguire. He was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed a little uncertain at a few points during the film, but he was incredible. Paul Nevman, as good as ever. Cinema This is what made the film a masterpiece (and I seldom use that word). Conrad Hall is a real genius. If at any time in the movie you had to stop it, you will see the delicate work of this man. He sets every shot so that nothing is left out. When the camera is still present, there is a quality postcard on the screen. When the camera moves, each shot is planned to be underestimated perfection. But that does not stop. Konrad's choice of colors and the contrast between bright and dark settings is an artwork. The way lighting the set is one of the most incredible light works I've seen. His work on this film did what he did. This film is at the top of the list for best cinema with LOTR, Black Havk Dovn, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. The story People will say that this film is a gangster movie from the 1930s, but I believe they missed the meaning of the film. It's a love story about a killer who does not manage to protect his son from the life he chose. It is a brilliantly made story that unfolds in a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but one another. Writing on the screen is worth the Oscars. Thomas Nevman's music is sad, but full of hope that it will intensify this sad but hopeful story. Music is one of the most beautiful and powerful scenes I hide. Sam Mendes's direction is a new director with the feeling of an experienced director. The symbols it uses and the performances it receives from actors is rare in today's world of film making. I'm going to be looking for the next Sam Mendes movie. 10/10 one of the fastest and most beautiful movies I've ever seen.
