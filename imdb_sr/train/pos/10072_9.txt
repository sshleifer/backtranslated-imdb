Unexpected pleasure because I did not hear anything about this movie. It's shameful, because it justifies the broader audience. Wonderful human story with a social message that is mildly told, though perhaps predictable in its resolution. The principals acted well. Beautifully photographed with dull colors floating in gray and recording the nostalgic tone of the film. My recent breakthrough in Chinese film (Shower, way home, not one less) was exciting and I hope you continue to explore. China and its people are an incredible canvas for filmmakers. The "King of Masks" can be recommended as a starting point for anyone interested in a Chinese film. <br /> <br />
