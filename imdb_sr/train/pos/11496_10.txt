I love this movie too. I saw it when it was first shown in Germany at a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was an ambitious atmosphere. Erotic film hit the audience, and the discussion with Moritz Boerner's producer and director has always been emphasized. In his genre, it was a very ambitious film, especially when you think it was an independent movie. There are not many copies of this movie, Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and made two or three short films worked more for TV, and before he became a kind of therapist. For people who want to see this movie again, you can find it on its home page, which is not so easy to ask, but it's possible.
