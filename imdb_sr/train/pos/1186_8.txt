There is a lot of talk about "psychological westerns", but this is one of the few that is really in this genre. There are big stars with a good name, but the director is that which makes a good movie. Stevart Granger loses his British stereotype of safari hunters to play a exhausted retired bison hunter who is regarded in the West as one of the best. Robert Tailor plays newer (unlike the usual young upstart, Tailor's character is also middle age), who wants to kill a bison, and Granger's mom to work with him. They are hiring two other great acting names, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblin, to become their skinners. Granger spews out the bison he killed, knowing that he could be guilty if he died, knowing if he was going to die, the way of life of the Indians would suffer. Tailor soon reveals the sadistic side, but this is a realistic Saizm, unlike the one-dimensional sadistic modern film, created by the nerds and dumbbells. He is unsure and needs a human society. Still, it will not stop for murder. The ending confronts one another, with an astonishing conclusion. The psychological effects of what they do are well displayed.
