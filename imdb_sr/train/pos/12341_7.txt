Although Lang's version is better known, Borzag's work is not devoid of interest, far from it: its "celestial" sequences are even better. The metaphor of the train (perhaps borrowed from the end of the "la roue" of Abel Gance) is ultimately more convincing than the "up" of the heavenly world. Borzage's tenderness toward characters shows Mary's character and love behind the grave is one of his favorite items (the ending of "three comrades"). It seems that the park is everywhere: we see it even when we are in the poor Marie house. I do not think the sets are so hot, that they are stylized at fault. Movie. Borzaga never forget her social worries: in the heavenly train that goes up, the rich can not stand to be confused with distractions, but as the "chief judge" says "there is no difference anymore." It's not a big deal for Borzage (nor is Lang's version), but to ask if you're interested in the career of the great director.
