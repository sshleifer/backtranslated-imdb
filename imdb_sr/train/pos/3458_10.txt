Throwing Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was great. Cassidy personified arrogance, self-confidence, charm and wittyness-all with a cozy, evil little smile on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidi is by far the best killer (appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This special (and first) performance is my favorite Columbo episode ever - hands down. Fresh Steven Spielberg had amazing work with the cameras (yes, there were a few shots of the camera on the actors) that grabbed shades and jokes at different and intriguing angles between Columba and Franklin. Also, panoramic images in Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin's cabin house) were very impressive. If you have not seen this episode yet, then you owe it to yourself - It's a real masterpiece. Jack Cassidi was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was very contagious. His death in 1976, at the age of 49, was very sad and really tragic - he must have had the best years ahead of him. Relax in Mike Jack, you will live forever through your great work.
