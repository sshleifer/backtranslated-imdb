This film took Jerry Springer's approach to super-human power. "Wilder Napalm" is a kind of themed film I love, dealing with the idea of ​​defining charms in America by either their gifts or attempts to hide them. At the same time, the film suggests that every miracle is just a human being, and that no one should fear or worship anymore than any other human being. It was a great comedy, fun and humorous with that mildly satirical edge.
