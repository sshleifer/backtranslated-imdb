Actors play greatly, especially Kenneth Branagh. It's good that Robin Williams got the comedy role of Osiris, otherwise it might be a bit strange to see him in such a production. It's really great that Kennet decided to use the most versatile version of the text, which definitely does not happen too often ... Thanks to that, viewers can see the whole, and not the chosen ones - from the director - parts. Also - thank God that the film is in a classic form; NO surrealistic fanfaberies! Although "Titus Andronicus" is still impressive, but Hamlet is a different story, at least it is my view.
