I saw yesterday for the first time and enjoyed it thoroughly. I am a student of writing on the screen and I admired the way in which the smaller characters intervened exactly when something crucial / climatic occurred in the scene. I thought that the dialogue is very sharp and the premise of the story is rather shocking - at a certain point Barbara Stanvick flounderly flirted with her boyfriend's boy; And the revival of some passion in a husband she had not seen for ten years; And with a firearm signal 'two shots, then one' she connects with her old Dutch colleagues (the reason she left the city in the first place!) ALL IN THE SAME TIME! The moral majority must have been completely furious when they saw this film in the '50s. You like costumes and cinema and straight from the hip-hop dialogue - just to watch Barbar Stanvick and Co how to work a bunny hat is a good reason to rent this movie on a DVD. One of the best movies from that period I've been watching for a long time.
