While sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbins is a sufficient reason to see this film, additional support (including Matthau, Fri, Shalub, Durning and the ridiculous trio of Jacobi, Sax and Maher) is an additional plus. Matthau shines like Einstein, Fri is perfect as Rian's clinical fianc√©, and Shalbo's line of Einstein's gonads is, as mentioned, one of the highlights of the film. The speech Robbins brings to his public appearance is pure poetry. It is an honor for the writers to work with this foam with humor and ease. I also thought Keene Curtis was wonderful as Eisenhover. This could be considered a chicken movie, but I think everyone will get out of it. Eight very solid points.
