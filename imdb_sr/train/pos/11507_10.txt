I remember the original series live mainly because of the unique mixture of fierce humor and ghostly themes. Kolchak was stubborn Ben Hecht school reporter on reporting about big cities, and his determination and wise attitude made the most entertaining episode extremely visible. My personal favorite was "The Spanish Moss Murders" because of my complete original story. The poor young Cayenne Youth from Louisiana baiou is participating in a dream research experiment, for the purpose of dream analysis. Something unexplainably wrong, and he literally dreams of an animal swamp inhabited by the dark folk tales of his youth. This malicious manifestation requires all those who have made a mistake in their conscious state and brutally beat them to death. Kolchak is investigating and revealing this terrible truth, unfortunately, police captain Joe "Mad Dog" Šiška (beautifully sucked out by silly Keenan Vinn) and head researcher, played by the founder of the improvised Second City, Severn Darden. . Evil funny, drunken finale takes place in the sewage system in Chicago and is the highlight of the series. The peg never got anything better. Timeless.
