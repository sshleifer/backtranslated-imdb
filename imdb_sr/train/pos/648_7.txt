I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site. I must say that it was worth the effort. However, it should be noted that this film takes 210 minutes. If you do not have stamina, take it on the tape and watch it for several nights. Now, when you say a movie, what I say contains a "spoiler" and if you do not mind, it goes: Alekandre is a promiscuous bastard, a feminist and a gigolo. She lives with an elderly woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail shop and provides Alek. Alek spent days in cafes and restaurants. The story reveals that Alek had previously fertilized Gilbert with whom he lived. Gilberte left him for a less attractive man she did not like because Alek was abusing and beaten. At this point, Alex was willing to find a job and help raise his child before finding out Gilberte had interrupted him and planned to marry someone else. Accidentally, Alekandre meets a nymph nurse called Veronica, and they have established a relationship. Veronica first fell in love with Alec after all that rude sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika struggled for Alec's favor and had trophies. Finally, in the end, she discovered that Veronica was pregnant with Alec's child, and Alek asked to marry him. We assume (as Gilbert's situation has said), Alekandre will even get the job and be the carrier of his newly found love and family. There is hope! With the title "La Maman et la putain", I conclude that Jean Eustache referred to the character of Veronica Francoise Lebrun. She was a whore and then she became a mother. So, mother and whore is the same person? Anyway, what I know! French films are mostly (not all) very talkative, aimlessly political, preaching, theatrical, soulless, miserable and full of quotes. Lebrun and Leaud played their hard-core characters well and held the film together, as some of the scenes became a little lost and unconnected. Not bad. 7/10.
