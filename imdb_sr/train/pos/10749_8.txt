I rented this for my son who was recently interested in September 11th. He was then a kindergarten and had no idea what was happening. I liked what was said as a "documentary film". If there is one movie I would recommend to see in relation to September 11, this would be FREE! Usually you see a movie that has actors who are well-known. This film was not known. Also, you see a film on September 11th, you hear that a fireman or two have lost their lives by saving people. I did not feel it was either! I just rented this movie and I would definitely consider it to add it to my collection! Really well done! My heart goes to survivors and families of victims on September 11th!
