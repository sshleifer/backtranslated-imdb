Writing words <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What brave and brilliant Madhur Bhandarkar 'Page 3' destroys the glamor and glitterat glitters that resemble the pages of our newspapers and whose lives (reading of party habits) we follow with such a maniacal fury that can only be explained by our inner voyage sequence. . The phenomenon of page 3 is just as sad as the mysterious. How exactly she received such control over the printed word, and when she began to draw on the front page, she was subjected to another debate. Bhandarkar, we avoid this wisely. He deals only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. By doing this, he compiles various elements of this lifestyle. Like Robert Altman (although I do not compare Bhandarkara with Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses countless characters to improve his motive. Whether this is page 3, whether it's NRI, gatekeeper-crashhers, a new-rich, upcoming model, a social politician or author of erotic novels; all the characters are presented with the lens and each of them has a special character-sketch, even if their parts can be insignificant. And there's a complaint about the movie. Conca Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist covering page 3 for Nation Todai. Initially satisfied with her work, she soon begins to see the ugliness of this foundation, which is covered by her false and cosmetic deception. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to turn this case into a film about moral policing and avoids concentrating on only one character. Therefore, the film is not only about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as a giant machine gang, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a socialist who suffocates with social pollution, Abhijeet (Rehan engineer) - homosexual makeup artist and Madhavi Pearl (Sandhia Mridul) - sassi airhostess and Gaiatri (Tara Sharma) - an actress who is tending. It seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters (and much more) into one story, but the full credit of Nina Arora and Mano Tiagi for the retirement of the tight scenario. Dialogues of Sanjay Datta and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. Every story, no matter how good it is, can fall with a lack of true performance. Fortunately, 'Page 3' is abundant with actors, not stars. Conkona passes through her authorial role with ease. Ditto Boman. Sandhia Mridul gets the best written part, but it's almost exaggerating. Atul Kulkarni is lost, though with a signed character. Sometimes the director seems to be too interested to include as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make it look hurry. After all, Bhandarkar's attempt is to snuff out our voyeurism, but he makes it a step further. He leads us inside the photos and presents us with the creepy realities of this sect of humanity that seems strange to live in the second and distant world. These are the same people who left the New Year's enjoyment, while a few hundred miles away from their compatriots being devastated by the wild nature! Smart writing, skillfully integrated songs, capable performances and a true sense of honesty are what makes this film worthy despite the lack of fine and poor production values. 'Page 3' is the optimal way to enter the new year of the cinema. Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very good ***** Excellent January 29, 2005
