I love this movie. It's a great movie that combines English and Indian culture with issues of a feminist type, such as girls who want to deal with sports that were previously reserved for men. It shows the struggle of both individuals from India who want to break off their cultural barriers and women who want to end their gender restrictions in sports, especially in England at that time. I feel that cultural struggles are more emphasized than other issues. Unlike the other comment, I do not think this film is something like Dirty Dancing or any other such film. This move is loved by many types of people, men and women, young and old.
