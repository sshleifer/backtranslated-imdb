I really enjoyed the 60's. It was not that generation (I wait "80s") it was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for the other. One big problem in the film, however, was that the unbalanced film was in the family portrayal. According to the promotions I saw for a movie on NBC, the story was mainly about two families who were struggling with problems in America in the sixties. Maybe I missed something, but I think we learned more about a white family from an African-American family. I really think that the 60s use music to better describe the scene than any dialogue that could come out of the actors' mouth (they are all very talented.) This is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours ) mini-series. Very good movie!
