All right, first correct the tag on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not walk with his sister in the film, nor did he stop in his sister's tomb. This is Ann Rutledge, who was a very close friend of Lincoln in her New Salem. Some say Ann was actually Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support it. Now, in this film there are fiction and fiction. Hollywood has always had a dramatic license with anything under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the case in the courtroom is based on the actual event: the charge of murder against Villages "Duff" Armstrong, and although this film is largely fictional, with a lot of change of name, the viewers will continue to be the attracted screen. This is the golden age of Hollivood, with drama at its best, and Henry Fonda gives perhaps the best Lincoln that everyone plays.
