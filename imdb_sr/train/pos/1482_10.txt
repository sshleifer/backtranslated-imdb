Best movie about marriage and family. This is a very interesting thought about couples that will come to a dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision can be better or worse in our lives and the lives of our children. Real decline or the help of 'friends' - or the executioners if we leave -. The right role of families: they can help or can destroy us. A brave priest who may not be very angry and tells what could happen to statistics and reality. A couple who thinks of a 'special' marriage, live a painful story in their future own history. Who loves contract marriage? No one, after the priest tells his story? if they leave the future in the other hands, if they do not know what marriage is. That the problems are true, that life requires real engagement, guarantees, from everyone. That they are real victims of child divorce, with the real name Andrea in the movie or names. That the abortion is just an easy exit: sadness, regret and misfortune will be there after abortion. That state and social security are less and less thinking about the real problems of families. Gossiping 'friends', a disbelief for the weakness and despair of Steffania, because Tomaso lives his life as if he were alone. . Steffania and Tomasso, in the depths of their hearts, love a beautiful marriage and family, if not, why they love marriage? True and wonderful marriage depends only on the couple: each of their decisions, from every action in their lives. A family could be a place where everyone feels loved because it's his or her, just the one that exists. The scenario is wonderful. The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, an almost cynical priest! Excellent direction and script. Color and camera management, superb.
