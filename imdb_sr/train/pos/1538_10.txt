This is the best movie I've ever seen! Perhaps this is because I live only a few miles from the village, and the story unfolds, and I know how things work in this area in Sweden. The film tells the truth, believe me! And it criticizes and respects the lifestyle of Dalarna, and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more open and more concerned about the closest friends and relatives. anywhere in Sweden (or any other country) you will probably also get a lot of recognition from this movie. Thank you Maria Blom!
