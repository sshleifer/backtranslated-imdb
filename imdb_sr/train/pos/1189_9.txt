Last Hunt is one of the few Western ones ever made to deal with Buffalo hunting, both as a sport and business, and as a method for conquering the plains of Indian wars. Before the white man went to the other side of the Mississippi, the plains had once had the flocks of American buffaloes as big as some of our biggest cities. By the time the last hunt was placed, the bison was completely erased. In the twentieth century, thanks to the efforts of the conservator, there was a revival of the species population, but not just as it used to be. Robert Tailor and Stevart Granger perform together in another movie, and this is far superior to All Valiant Brothers. Here, Stuart Granger is a good guy, a world-class tired bison hunter, who must return to a job he hates for financial reasons. The partner with whom Robert Tailor has been elected. Forgetting Tailor for a moment, I doubt that there has ever been an evil, nasty soul from Charlie Gilsen, whom Tailor shows. In Devil's Doorvai, he was an American Indian who struggles against the prejudices caused by racism played by Louis Calhern. In Last Hunting, he's a racist here. He kills both Bison and Indians for pure satisfaction. He kills an Indian family when he stole his mule and takes the widow of a prisoner. Like some barbaric conqueror, he expects the satisfaction of Debra Paget's sexual service. He's really angry when Paget does not see that. No matter how often it refers to Russ Tamblin as a half-brother, I have never been really convinced that he is a part of the Indians. It's the only weakness I found in Last Hunt. However, Lloyd Nolan, spray old buffalo Tailor and Granger, are great. Nolan steals every scene she plays. For those who love their westerns, who want to see the side of Robert Tailor who has never been seen on the screen and who do not like cheap heroics, The Last Hunt is an ideal hunt.
