The real screaming situation of Farce comedians from the mid-70s this film was a HUGE hit about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I'm constantly amazed by some comedic films that are a big week, and then disappear: GREAT ANXIANCE, SMALL DETECTIVE, BLACK BIRD, DO NOT REQUIRE NOW WE LIKE ......... and do not have any profile today. NORMAN was the comedy of the month when it was 1976 and everyone seemed to see it, laughing and never again never mention it. Known for being shot on a video tape and shifted into a movie, an experiment at the time, NORMAN is a rugged, politically incorrect farce in which cabinets are thrown, which Farrelly brothers should look at today. If they did at all, there would be no complaints about his content and affection. It's very funny and it's very rude and hilarious. As it should. In fact, as a groove film from 1976 with all those tricks and clothes, it works better today.
