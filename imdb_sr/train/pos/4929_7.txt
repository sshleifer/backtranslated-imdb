I can not really condemn the film because it does. There are enough movie noir elements to be considered a noir movie, but I think it's just in the category. There is nothing wrong in this part, and this is where noir elements are decaying. Of course, the disease can be considered malicious, but I can hardly see it. The film suggests the darker side: Blacks may be trafficking in human beings, the New Orleans police are too prepared to arrest journalists. There is no attempt to examine Reed's motivations, as with Marla or Spade, nor is there any attempt to bring Blackie to the side of the people, which would make him even more scornful if Trafficking is really played. This lack of depth is what fails at the end of the film. The story is decent, the acting is good, writing and the direction are well made ... but there is nothing that this film should be coming back over and over again. It's worth a look once, maybe twice if you do not remember a few years ago and then postpone it.
