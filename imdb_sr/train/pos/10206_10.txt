In my years of attendance at movie festivals, I've seen many small films such as this one that never get theatrical distribution, and end up in $ 3 in ValMart. I just found DVD Ianka Tanks, an excellent doc, but it's sad to end up as the rest of the bottom. I loved this movie, I wanted to see him in the cinema in that's all. I'd prefer that New York Films directly translate the title. It's good for Americans to stretch a little. If the title of the film helps the American audience to investigate a random chaos, it's getting better. The cinema imitates life and visa. Also, it was disgusting to me that the subtitles put prices in dollars. Come on! The euro is not difficult to grasp, do gringo audiences with mathematics. Watching a movie, especially a single shot in Paris, the viewer should not have a corrupted effect by reminding him: I am an American looking at a movie and translating eure for me. We look forward to seeing more such actors and more than a writer and director.
