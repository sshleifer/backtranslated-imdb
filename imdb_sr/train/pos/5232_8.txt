This film is a journey through the mind of the screenwriter caught up in his paradoxical philosophy. He examines all the apparent question "who am I" and "what am I?" It's a brave and stimulating company. There is a bunch of beautiful paintings, a parachute similar to Escher, Escher's resemblances that resemble the drawing itself, or the deletion of oneself. We are increasingly following the writer in his agony about what to say and what to record; we see him telephoning with his wife who went to Peru, leaving him to take care of their baby, the task he does with less and less attention to everything He is so preoccupied with his dilemma that he hardly looks at the child anymore. His wife returns and realizes the scene, destroys his notes and helps him to cross the last threshold until he is erased. Interspersed with images that attract the eyes and ruin me, the story is mostly philosophical. These are the Maya Whales, the world of illusion. The film's paradox, however, is that he needs a lot of conversation and reflection to prove that thinking should stop. Over the course of more than two hours of provocative beauty and quick philosophy, the film made me want a silent or shorter film. If it was the purpose of the creator, he succeeded quite well.
