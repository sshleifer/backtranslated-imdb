Larri Fessenden was hit by the majority of comments on this forum. Well, the worst mistake, obviously, is the marketing of a movie and the way the DVD might be targeted. Apparently, this is not a real horror movie, at least not for people who expect something to be bloody and immediately satisfying. "Vendigo" is basically a movie that seems to be told by young Miles. Things children do not understand easily remain in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the threatening world that they can not understand. It is obvious that Kim, mother, psychologist, but there is no idea what is happening in her son's mind. This is also a story of alienation. It is clear that father, George, is a far-fetched figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in another world. . This part of the state of New York, with its winter landscape, bare trees, plays a desolation in the imagination of a little boy. It does not help to encounter a strange figure in the city, it creates even more doubts in his young mind. In the end, Miles's world comes to him and he can not do anything, even evokes the Vendigo spirit. The film goes well and behaves. Patricia Clarkson is great, no matter where the film is. Jake Veber is perfect as a distant father who has the opportunity to approach a son he does not understand. Erik Per Sullivan, like Miles, transmits inner unrest in him. I thought it was extremely effective because Miles's whole film was about what was happening around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as an intimidating Otis, a man who despises the world for the way he has fallen out.
