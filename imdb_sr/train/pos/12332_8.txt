Since I have seen a few short films on horror films marathons several times, I believe it is a witty parody that is cut to the main point of its reference. Although the topics of the raw material and stood for today's viewers, it's not a waste of time. Although the student film is a small cause for excuse, the evidence is that it looks like it was made with budget attention from little to no-test. As noted by the second reviewer, it's less than ten minutes, which is enough time to clean the palate with a toast of joy, sit down and rest in a movie. <br /> <br> I think this short bread of the film should be enjoyed as a cover for the title reference, and the viewer should relax and turn around.
