In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, The Touch of Evil), Orson Velles gave him the role of lush men. In "The Ladi from Shanghai" it's the only way to see him as a victim. The role of the culprit, he was given by Riti Haivorth, probably because he was in love with her. That's why it's an interesting movie. But the story is excellent for me too. The direction is genius, as usual with Welles: the two scenes are particularly brilliant: one in the aquarium and the last one with mirrors. This film is brilliant. (10/10)
