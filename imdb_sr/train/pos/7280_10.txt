watching this as a child. Although I will probably consider him terrible now, that was awful, as I was only seven years old. I also remember that I worked on a puzzle tomorrow while I was watching, so I did not pay much attention. However, the scene with wavy bumps has been burnt since. I asked many people whether they saw this film, but without success. Twelve years ago, one person mentioned that he probably saw it, but he meant it only as a dream; imaginative buffoon like wind. It's not a dream, my friend. Do not dream now. Again, I have not seen it since then, but I can not wait to find a copy and put it in my VCR. Everything that can stay in my head for 23 years deserves '10'.
