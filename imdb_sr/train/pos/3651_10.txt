Pandora's watch is among the best thrillers you'll ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you'll ever see. A very faithful adaptation of the novel by John J. Nance, who had a terribly realistic scenario in the novel, is still here. Despite being made for television, this is the first party. The actors are brilliant and so well slip into the characters from the novel to think that they are reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson moves out of the MacGiver shadow and gives the best performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is a great role ambassador's assistant in the role of proving she can be a good drama actor. Daphne Zuniga is as great as Dr. Sanders and despite being a man in the book, he works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, as well as the rest of the support, are top-notch and fit into their new colleagues. Of course, there are changes in the story (including a slight change) in the end) but these changes are better compared to the novel. The action is realistic and very visible in order to make sure that this presentation has made this the best plane set by the film from the original aerodrome film. Production values ​​are high and although special effects may look as good as they did a decade ago, they are doing well. The sets are great, especially the headquarters of the CIA and the Oval Office, which show that filmmakers have spent a lot of time doing this. It does not matter if you first see this and read it, then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both, and you will not regret that you lost four hours for this movie and as long as you need to read the novel. This will leave you breathless.
