I would not dare say that this film is better than the original, but it is very good in its own right. The comedy in this movie is as good as the original, but there are so many scenes that make me laugh just thinking about them. that's what makes it so shiny. Peter Hevitt works perfectly with the film. The core of the original movie returns to its characters in this movie and everyone is doing a fantastic job with their roles. I do not care what someone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed seeing Ted in both of these films, as I did to Bill Winter. I was very happy that George Carlin is returning to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr., starring Ted Logan, makes a good job. The scene in which Ted owns his father's body and Hal London Jr begins to act like Ted, is a great scene, and he is impressively good pulling out. I can not forget to mention Villiam Sadler as Death, he made a complete movie for me. The rest of the actors are also good. If you liked the first version of Bill and Ted series, I hope you liked this movie as well. But do not expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the movie, thank you for reading, -Chris
