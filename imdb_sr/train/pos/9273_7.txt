In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people continue to live their lives, mostly doing things you would expect, such as going to football matches to cheer for the national team because it is in the race to qualify for the World Cup. Except that women are not allowed to go to the football stadium to watch the game. Often a funny little movie follows a small group of women who are caught sneaking into a football stadium and a small group of boring people. soldiers who ordered them to keep them in a pencil for keeping right in front of the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to cheer for the team (nothing subversive there), and the small human touch about the lives of all, is added to a completely fine commentary on humanity in relation to ideology. Amateur acting, good script and dialogue, really nice movie. Bend It Like Beckham, a kind of warm heart and joy in everyday interests and pleasures of people.
