I could write a sufficiently large commentary on any of the characters in Gundam Ving, they could lead a series with their inner conflicts. Instead, we get 8 great tracks that lead us through 49 golden episodes of Anime Bliss. It contains a dialog that can rotate in the head for months ... and then return and extract a new meaning from, a masterpiece in script writing (although it has a typical characteristic of Anime that there is a difference between the subtitles and English Dub). There are abundant concepts and philosophies that tell you to think about your own attitudes. Relationships between cold insensitive men and the love of female characters is a stand-alone aspect of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relene, and Milliard and Noin are pleasure to watch. Apparently the dismissal of a man is supported by inner turmoil that make love (a word never mentioned in the series) of the women necessary for them in their cruel surroundings of soldiers. Women jure aspects of men that I rarely, if at all see, make the leading men even more mysterious. It takes Heerou all 49 episodes to show some concern, but he arrives there, and when he does, his big payout. And there is a huge battle of robots. It's fun to watch great sequences as good as any Hollywood epic combat scene. Any person who was less interested would see a giant robot fighting as a stupid feature for cartoon kids, which became clear when I'm trying to recommend this series to my friends, but they're wrong. Many of the giant robot robots in Gundam Ving contain a large dose of pathos, usually in connection with young rebels fighting for what they believe in an oppressive society that makes their beliefs obsolete. Throughout each episode, Gundam Ving can not be boring, it's an amazing, provocative study of the potential of the human mind and body.
