One of the most provocative films ever with a great cinema supported by Mc Clarens Lisp and the stunning quote "do you believe in love in the first place?". catapulting movies with flawless integrity. Gabby (AKA Joei), starring Eva Longoria, obviously liked the film and the role she played so much that she could not even try to mention it in her filmography. Lol. The best part of the film would have to be without a doubt, the heroic rescue by the MC clure while he saved a young 'disabled' kid with speech impairment .. which I can add that has worked to perfection! The use of the sound effects of James Kahil is incomparable even to this day. The bust of the drugs that he performs early in the film is pain in reality. When I first watched this movie, I was so compelled to dislike Gang Inthused's brothers from Southside and CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). This is far from one of the most encapsulating cracks Cahill has devoted to shooting. Personally this film has a sentimental value for me and I will take it in the near future. That's if I can find it anywhere, LOL!
