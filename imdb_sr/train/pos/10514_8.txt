Emma is a terribly flawed film based on the classic novel Jane Austens. I did not read the book, so I really did not know much about the plot, and yet I predicted almost the whole plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of poor writing or directing. The film was, for some reason, very funny and I loved it. Of course, there were all the scenes that I did not like, but most of them were very acting and funny. Gvineth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as Heroin in Emma. The film also stars Tony Collette (who is good, but he was much better) Evan Mecgreger (who was also better but still very good here) Alan Cumming (Who was never impressed and who is exactly the same) and Jeremy Northam Which performance is pretty woody at first glance, but actually pretty subtle, even if it was not necessary) There was much better adaptation of Jane Austen's book, but this is still very fun and worth watching.
