the film is much more sophisticated and more intelligent is his research of sexual tension from such American attempts as 9 and a half weeks ... the scene itself in the courtroom ... with a pair copulating in a cage while the heroine prays for their orgasm. It's amazing ... I did not see this movie for 20 years ... but it made indelible images in my mind ... it is rich in textures and successful in creating a world in which sex is the engine of all activities, and at its bottom is a fearful fear that lives in all of us ... the shop is European, and it's a bit wobbly, but so does life ... especially when you are 17 and have a constant weight ....
