My interest was raised while I was passing and I saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia, so I thought it was OK to see what this is. I'm so glad I stayed on the channel. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sorrow, some above the top, but a wonderful time to have it. I'm looking at this and it seems to me sad because of all the nastiness that the film industry exposes and these beautiful gems go over. Try Iphigenia and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I even enjoyed my children (27, 25, 20 and 17). The dispute begins, however, the drama is being built and you will be attracted to the story. Watching this wonderful movie made me complain in several Greek tragedies and pathos.
