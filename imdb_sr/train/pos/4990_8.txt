As other reviewers have noticed, this is an unfairly neglected film from the time of depression. Directed by: Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Sverling (left in the sky, a westerner, a life-saving boat, etc.), this is a stubborn, well-structured and realized move about the inhabitants of New York City. . These are people, beggars and women who are forced into prostitution, but they are a community of people both good and bad, with a commitment that is as complex as any group. Perhaps it is primarily among many wonderful qualities of this movie. is the contrast between the characters of Spencer Tracy, Bill and Trine Lorette Ioung. Strongly speaking, physically aggressive, and apparently fearless - but Bill is not the character that gives this film his sense of survival. As he murmurs, Trina actually hangs firmly (if this term can be applied to a figure that is so feminine). Her attachment to him is obvious and complete. When she becomes pregnant, she says she will raise herself if she wants to leave, or "I'll even give up the child if you're just happy." Such is the dignity of the play Lorette Ioung (at age 20) as a fairly simple character, that she is neither weak nor dependent, but a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds her and wants nothing more.
