I saw this film when I was 13 years old and really liked the plateau who later acted in various moves like Kimberly Drummond. I do not think it's trash. It should not have been a continuation of the documentary. It's just a cute kids movie about 3 kids who go after men trying to find a boggy stream of monsters. Men get hurt, and children save them with the help of creatures. This is a good movie for children, without the real violence of a few small robberies, but good entertainment for young children.
