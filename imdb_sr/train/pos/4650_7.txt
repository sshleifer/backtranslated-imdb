As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I enjoyed the beautiful Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) flight scenes in this film. One of the rare disappointments was the EVS 39 coaster, in this case an inert RB 75 (Maverick) missile painted in black with the letters "EVS 39" in white. Really, sweaters certainly do not look like this, at least not the ones I've seen. But besides, it's a fun movie with a very fun ending (the last moment). Anyone interested in seeing various Swedish military units, including now the legendary SSG, should see this on the film. <br /> <br />
