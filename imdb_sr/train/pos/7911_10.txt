As a kid, I loved computer animation even though it was extremely limited and the tools were almost non-existent. This film, while sitting in awe and watching incredible images and almost hypnotic music, formed a desire in me to create moving things in a computer. This is a complete package, between music and videos, which really enrich one or two strokes. If you know any child who wants to engage in computer animation, this MUST YOU HAVE. Almost, almost 20 years later, I regard this film as one of the three best favorites. The originality, I think, is still unprecedented by most of today's McMovies that Hollivood is releasing. Right now, I want to see if I can make it again; if imitation is the most sincere form of flattery then this film deserves TON imitation =)
