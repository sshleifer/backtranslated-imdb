I absolutely loved this show. I watched him from the time he first appeared in the late nineties to the last episode. In my honest opinion, it was a wonderful family drama that has been so rare these days. Definitely shov you can watch with a friend or your kids. Yes, things changed little with Joo since we last saw her in the books, but she's still attracted to great stories and good lessons. The actress who plays Jo Bhaera (Michelle Burke) works beautifully as an actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). children and students learn. I recommend this show to everyone.
