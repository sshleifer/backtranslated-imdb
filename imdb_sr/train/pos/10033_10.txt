The movie "Titanic" makes it much more than a "night of memory". It writes a tragic event of history about which will always be spoken and will never be forgotten. Why is she so criticized? I have no idea. Could / will ever make a movie like a Titanic that moves and touches every time you watch it. Would you ever be able to replace such an epic masterpiece? It will be almost impossible. The director undoubtedly had the greatest influence on the film. A simple film about catastrophes (boring for watching) turned into incredible romance. Yes, I'm not a romantic guy either, but that would not bother you, because you will never see this romance. Guaranteed! Incredible effects, to music, to a sublime acting. The film creates an incredible visual and wonderful feeling. Everything looks real and lives. The legend "TITANIC" is brilliantly displayed in all classes, it also seems to be too much accommodation. The acting was a real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best in role playing. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so great. I suppose it does not need much to talk about. The action is simple, the acting is brilliant, based on a true story, probably more than half of consumers watching the movie will share tears, thanks to an incredible ending that can never be forgotten. Well, if you did not see this movie that you missed something Hester, and a movie to idolize for Hollywood. Can it be better? Not at all. The most moving film of all time, do not listen to people, make sure of yourself, then you will understand. Landmark. (do not be surprised if you cry)
