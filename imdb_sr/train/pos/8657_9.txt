It's amazing that so many people I know did not see this little gem. everyone who addressed me came back with the same reaction: WHAT IS A LARGE FILM !! I've never had much to worry about Brad Pitt (although his turn in the 12th apiary and combat club shows improvement) but his performance in this movie as a psycho is disturbing, dark and accurate on target. All the others in the movie give excellent performance, and slow and deliberate pacing of the film greatly improves the process. the sense of fear for characters continues to grow as they understand what is really happening. The only thing that keeps this from 10 in my book is that compared to what was before it, the ending is a bit too long and too exaggerated. but it's the only fault I can find in this cult classic. If you look at this movie, try to create a carved directory for the best viewing option. Estimated: 9
