High atmospheric cheapness, which shows great ingenuity in the use of props, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) in order to create a creepy and tumultuous texture. The story is overwhelming, acting is only functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop the entire visual narrative. This film is recommended because of its mood and texture, not because of its story.
