Farrah Favcett is wonderful in this powerful drama from 1986, starring Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape the claw of a potential rapist. Well done for Farrah for the nomination for the best actor of the Golden Globe. When her rapist Joe (greatly acting James Russo) comes to her home, she shares with her roommates (who are suitable for it.) out!), Marjorie has to play along with Joe's scary demands . It's for some disturbing and shocking images! When her roommates return home, they are stunned (at least) by Mariorie's actions, and the great performance of Alfred Voodoo, who desperately tries to persuade Marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police, makes the movie even more sharp. I consider that Diana Scarvid is rather irritating, but when Joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all, it makes the movie a very emotional part of the drama. All in all, the extremities are brilliantly thought-out and a good acting movie and I've probably seen it hundreds of times to date! Well done for everyone involved.
