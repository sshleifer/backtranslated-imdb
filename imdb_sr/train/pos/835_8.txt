Pierce Brosnan, the newest, but not James Bond, is a killer. He's very good at what he's doing, but the old man is tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as a real and tight businessman. Now that the story opens, the film shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one night they drink at the bar and start talking. Then suddenly you find that these two people are gathering during a series of events. The story is great, the acting is top quality, and humor is hilarious I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be so funny, but he really is, and I have to say that this movie must be seen.
