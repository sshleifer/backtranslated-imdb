Ossession is in a very bad condition, but now it is undergoing a full recovery in Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is the "Master Positive" second generation that originated in the press that Visconti managed to hide from the fascists. It was scanned for Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data) and then processed using DaVinci Revival restoration software. After that, there is physical work left and we do not expect to finish before the spring. Somewhere next year it should be available on DVD and we hope it will be announced on HD DVD. This film is wonderful and we hope that the renewal effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come.
