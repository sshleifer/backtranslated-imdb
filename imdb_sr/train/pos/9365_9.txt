I saw it on the projection last night. I was totally disfigured how much this film is better than what I expected. There are not many movies that can combine a dark comedy and a current drama about events without breaking into the conclusion. it makes it much better. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. He was funny and much more fun than most of his latest comedies. Don Cheadle was as convincing as ever. This film is not funny as Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good pace. I would say 90% of the audience laughed for most of the movies. Half the time, the movie slows down to deal with the dramatic end of things and it's really a nice job to link it all together. the thing they chose to ignore and focus on the relationships themselves.
