All except Tigerland are focused on the real war and the people in it.Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. one of the most significant representations of a man who is testing the war, and the absurdity of what has been done in many war films, but rarely in a training camp, and this is a very complex character, whose method of dealing with his feelings and emotions is the driving force of this film God's character makes this movie so good o did not get a great release.
