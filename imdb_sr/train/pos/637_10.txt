Okay, this show is nothing but wonderful! He has a great story and plot and great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is so handsome and perfect for the role! He's great at Hollywood. He has a bright future! This show is better for a long time because I really love this show and I hope it has a lot of success! That's so interesting. I was waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here, and that's great! I'm recording too. I can watch it whenever I wish! It's only bad once a week. I wish it was at least twice a week because now I want it every day on Tuesday! I hope you like this show! ~ Ashlei ~
