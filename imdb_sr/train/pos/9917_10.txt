This is the most straightforward documentary I've ever seen. It was a simple and beautiful view of the wonderful idea. Based on the photographs of hidden industrial areas focused on China's modern industrial growth, Edward Burtinski is reviving the confrontation with problems that we so easily chose to ignore. Without political parties, this film is a neutral moving picture of the reality that our Western societies decide not to educate us - by-products of economic growth, externalities paid by citizens of less developed communities, the source of our comfort and waste of our consumer lifestyle . /> Unbelievable, heart-breaking, it's impossible to ignore. This is a challenging journey, but it is worth taking it - please stop staying in ignorance and at least see these photos of the truth, without any pressure to deal with these issues. 10/10 definiteli!
