I saw Jack Frost at 4:00 in my local store and I thought it looked pretty good for a low-budget movie so I bought it and I was right that it was good. To begin with, this film is about snowmen murderers, so it's something that he's laughing about and the way he looks it was funny compared to the Snowman on the covers. The acting was fine and lines that Jack Frost said I laughed "I just fired you for the smoke" and "The worlds that were the brightest of the snow" how ridiculous and camping it? The story at the beginning was pretty funny and stupid. "Jack was fast, Jack was quick, Jack put his eyes on the candlesticks." If you are looking for a B-Movie comedy of horror that is full of games, then check out Jack Frost out. 10/10
