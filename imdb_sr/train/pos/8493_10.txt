This is a great movie! The first time I saw this movie when it came out. I recently watched this movie and I still remember it. Many of the movies that we watched while we were younger look do not keep them when we look at them later in life. The film is actually a great example of the 80th type of films made then. Keaton is at its best, all actors have really done a good job, and Ron Howard was very good at telling the story of a movie, rather than forcing it. The speed of the movie is fast with a few slow spots and watching the 80's cars is too funny. Since the 1980s, I again liked to see the ugly stain. The film is a great film for all fans of comedy and lovers of the 80's.
