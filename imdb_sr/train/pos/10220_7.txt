This hasty line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It's funny in its own terms and quite ridiculously unintentional.) Only two sisters are really bad. Man, are they too bad! One is given a pinup image and rude comments where she goes. The other rose to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has these sensual, slightly separated lips. And, to give nothing, it is even worse than the other. All three sisters play starlets. The man who enters their lives plays John Bromfield. He had a career. This looks like the first mainstream soft-core porn ever on the market today. Well, of course, not the first, but the bloodiest at that time. Girls are worn as little as possible and do not forget about the members of the female audience: Bromfield is shown by shave the electric razor - the fetish is this? - naked breasts. He is also shown wet in a bathing suit. And here is the real plot: the girl is damned. They are prone to suicide - or dramatic deaths that can make them look like suicide. The film is not bad. I really do not know where it's shown. Maybe it's made for drive-ins. Somehow, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here. Women are scarce dressed. Often it resembles silly magic covers such as Police detective or novel jackets. But it seems to be the main focus. Not everyone in the movie loves him, but all the girls love him. And I think the audience is also intended. It's a lot of fun - and under your own conditions.
