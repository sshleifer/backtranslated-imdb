Interestingly, Brosnan's performance is more realistic than James Bond's original novels in relation to liaison films. He's a neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic, and a lifelong woman. This is a perfect pause for him, even if the bart icon is docked. "I'm a mess, a parody of myself," he says. There is nothing better than that. I just finished reading Dr.Noa, and this is actually the way Ian Fleming showed James Bond. I personally never liked Brosnan as a Bond because he was too well fitting the icon. He did not have anything to personalize his character, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's great to see Brosnan play in reality and splashing out of the wall. A shallow character that attempts to understand the deeper emotional and psychological problems that it does not deal with. It's an impressive display, and since Greg Kinear founded it, it's just poetics. This film reminds me of the little dynamics that has been established between the main characters in "Mi Blue Heaven", but even more authentic in their coping mechanisms.
