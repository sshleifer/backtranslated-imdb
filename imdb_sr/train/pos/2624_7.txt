In this film we have an incredible opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbai in the movie when they're not showing - what a lot! This film returns even before Simba and (probably) immediately after Kiare's birth. During the first movie, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)" is a funny, fun, exciting and surprising movie (or a sequel if you want to call it). All of you are waiting for a surprise and a joy! While Timon and Pumbao are watching a movie in the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbao have arguments about what the "Lion King" is doing. "They will start watching, because Timon wants to go to the part that he and Pumbai enter and Pumbaa wants to get back to the beginning. " They have a very fair compromise watching the film of their story, which awaits ... Begins Timon's first home ... For anyone who has a good sense of humor who loved the first films for almost any age, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
