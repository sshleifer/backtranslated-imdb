I was not sure what to expect, but I'm glad I went to see this. A smart, slightly distorted comedy that makes you think. I was not quite sure that the director could create "nothing," but leave it to Mr. Natalia and brilliant individuals in C.O. Create another low budget set that looks real (real as it can not be). It's worth your time and money, if you have a chance to see this, go. You'll be glad you did it.
