I gave this 10 out of 10 points. I love him so much. I am a child of the 80's and completely in heavy metal for many years. These are the reasons why this movie loves me so much. It's great to see those posters in the bedroom of that boy (Judas Priest, Lizzi Borden, Raven, Tvisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection (discovering the wicked by Ekciter, the Rise of the mutants shock metal of Impaler and Killing is my job from Megadeth ). Also, the sound record of FASTVAI is completely incredible and fits perfectly with the plot. If you are in metal then TRICK OR TREAT is your friend. Do not buy and do not watch this movie for OZZI or GENE SIMMONS because they are in the movie for a few seconds, watch it because of a soundtrack and a story that will bring you back to the glory of the 80's. After that, you will not be the same person.
