Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / chiller from 1990, released here in the UK under the label "New World Video". It's a desert movie about horror about a group of young friends who are party for the weekend, just to kill one by one an unknown force driving a dangerous black truck !!! This movie has some horrible scenes, and some here and there, but I have to say that the acting was so poor, even with low budget standards! But the film was a strange habit and I liked it, and I never slept or turned it off, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this movie 6/10, but when I saw how this created the money in that way, I had some good moments up and uncertainty, I had some good nudity and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was also a hot one! I'll give him 7/10.
