It was difficult for me to follow up to the extent that it seemed like they were getting into the middle while I was trying to make a head or tail from those who fought who and why. One of the problems is cultural / linguistic. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem that we know little and because we simply read the English subtitle, we inevitably lose some of the subtlety. The other problem is that it seems that there are only half of the explained turns and coincidences. However, it is unlikely that there is a completely bad Miiki film, and that is certainly not the case. An abundance of stylistic violence and bones, a window on some of the orthodox sexual events plus the family aspect. All in all, a decent ride, but perhaps checking the story can be helpful before watching this.
