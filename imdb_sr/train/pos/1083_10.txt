Another example of Cari Grant's unique talents. The performance worthy of the Oscars, once again was rejected by the Academy. Mr. Grant keeps a gamble from the silly to the gentle in this beautiful comedy about a man who decides to leave the big city. The construction pitches of the house were well inspected and became the basis (loose) of Tom Hanks's modern car, "The Pit Pit". Free sex, this film is unavoidable.
