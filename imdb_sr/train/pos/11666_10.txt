SECRET CELY is perhaps the finest film I've seen from TRIPLE BELLEVILLE. Although stylishly very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (open 2D sequence), KUNG FU PANDA, incredible artistic direction, production design, background / layout and color richness that is a feast for the senses. KELLS is so gorgeous - almost gothic in its schedule (somewhat reminiscent of Klimt), beautifully flat in a general perspective, decorated with a Celtic and illuminated design, but the characters are so simple and attractive - it all works nicely. You fall in love with characters from the moment you meet them. So you are attracted to every detail of the story and every move of the pencil and brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone in the Cartoon Saloon (and their extended crews) achieved with this small budget / FAITH small movie crew, is absolutely startling. The basis of support among our animation community is phenomenal. This film takes away the breath and buzz among our colleagues in recommending this film to spread like a fire. We congratulate KELLS on his numerous awards, the nomination for Annie and his current qualification for the Oscars. All this is a very deserved nod, really ...
