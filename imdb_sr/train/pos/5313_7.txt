Since I am not a fan of any post-film "Johnny Waters" "Desperate Living", I was warming up for "Pecker". After coming out of the underworld, Vaters produced trash-lite versions of his earlier works (Cri Babi, Polyester, Hairsprai), which looked hard and tasted as hard-boiled liqueurs to hard-working fans. An attempt to repeat early success is the mild, silent, modest commentary about the glories of the glorious and pretentiousness of the world of art.The waters clearly know this subject also because it also exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the majority of amateur pop arts ever created that you could not imagine anyone can give if it's not decorated with Waters m named Edward Furlong is as good as "Pecker" and Vatersov nehistrioniƒçki style is easy with the subject.
