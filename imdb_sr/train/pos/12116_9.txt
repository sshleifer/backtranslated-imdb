... that the version of this film Bette Davis is better than the version of Kim Novak. In spite of all the other comments written here, I really love the version of Bette Davis, although the Novak version has a Coherent line story. However, Davis Mildred's unusual emotions seem to me more suitable for a crazy girl who seems easy to become a prostitute. And these are the crude emotions that make up part of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has emotions of despair, failure, "otherness" - the strong emotions that he suppresses. Davis Mildred, on the other hand, shows his emotions immediately and without censorship. It has no feelings of desperation, or failure, or "otherness"; Rather, she just survives as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era. Novakov portrait was more vulnerable to Mildred than Davis, almost through the whole movie. Davis Mildred ** was never vulnerable until he had to go to the doctor and beg for help. And when he rebukes - for her method of keeping the body and soul together, and for the continued exploitation of her love for her - she frees the undoubtedly most fearless rejection of the snobbery from what you've ever seen on the screen: "I wiped my mouth! !! "Novak's vulnerability was great. Davis's realism was monumental. IMDb votes agree!
