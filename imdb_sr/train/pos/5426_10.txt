It's time for Gunga Din to be released on DVD. I can not say exactly how many times I watched this fine movie, but I never get it. The main actors worked well together. Victor Mclagen (Sgt McChesnei), Cari Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an invincible team. I can not simply overcome their accomplishments in India. Your first look at the sergeants is three when you see them fighting with other soldiers around the so-called treasure card. Three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communication line and they enter the mostly abandoned city - or they think so. They get involved in the necessary repairs and soon find several "hide themselves." Shortly after being attacked by a group of lunatics and barely managed to escape back to the base. Later they are sent to another the mission that gives Sgt Cutter the chance to go in search of gold with Din They find a temple of gold and are trapped by the evil Kali fans Din is sent to get help and Cutter gets caught McChesney and Ballentine soon arrive with Din, and they are too trapped. Faced with killing, they helpless see their regiment coming to save them. executives watch and will just prophesy a sudden attack when a wounded Din pops on the golden dome and hits his hull, which then warns the British at the ambush. In doing so, Din has been killed. Soldiers attack evil and soon defeat them. In the end, Din is honored because he became a Honorary Corporal in the British Army.
