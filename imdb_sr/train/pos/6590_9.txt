Intelligent, Curse and Exciting, "The Invisible Man" peaked in 2000 among the usual Sci-Fi settings, balancing Farscape's fantastic art direction and sometimes a melodramatic script with persistent, cynical complications and modern noir dialogue. The performance stood between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Togo" on the gauge of credibility, but there was no denying the fact that "I-Man" characters surpassed the caricature. Even the characters who were at the forefront of predictability such as the guardian, clerk and Eberts were given a waiver of the formula. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventrescu had chemistry that evolved and moved elegantly, making it even more important team of writers and directors who are turning around the neck. The effects are never allowed to overcome the plot, and science is only sometimes at the frontier completely incredible. The lowest points of the show are still fun, and I've never seen such a busy pilot episode. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should boast, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD issue of the show. Every time I encounter the Hercules: The Legendari Journeis marathon on the Sci-Fi, I turn my eyes and sigh, I regret the excitement and the possibility of a television science fiction presented by the "Invisible Man" and his species.
