The 52-Pick Up never got the respect that it should have. He works at many levels and has a complicated, but later story. The involved actors give some of their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roi Scheider and John Glover are perfect actors and give deep-hearted portraits. Vanity is also important, who should have invested this in a serious acting career in view of the unexpected skills shown by Kelly Preston, whose character will persecute for a few days. Anyone who loves action in combination with a complex complicated story will enjoy this.
