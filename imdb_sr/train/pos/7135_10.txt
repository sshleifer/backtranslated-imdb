This has to be one of the most beautiful, moving films that leads to thinking. It's a good family party, and at the same time it makes you very serious thinking about the problems. Every time I see "Zack's spirit riding a bicycle through a barrel, I can not help but cry my eyes." Performing John Thaw is so touching and harmful that he is no longer with us, an extraordinary movie, full of characters.
