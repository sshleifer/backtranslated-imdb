An odd couple is a comic gem. One of the happiest scripts ever devoted to celluloid - surpassed only by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: obsessive compulsive Felic and messy, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because it is impossible to live because of an irresponsible attitude. Felicia's wife leaves him at the beginning of the film, and after an unsuccessful suicide attempt, he starts playing with his poker friend Oscar. That's when the party starts. The whole script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one-liner liners. You are probably already familiar with "F.U." joke, but he still works great for Matthau's comic timing. My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to purify his sinus in the restaurant, and when the pigeon's nurses are enchanted with a very pleasant Matthau and Lemon completely outside his element. This requires a repeat of the review!
