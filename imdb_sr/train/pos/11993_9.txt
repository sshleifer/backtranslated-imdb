Together with the Darkwing Duck, this has been unjustly canceled. Disney is in decline from Tarzan and we need this kind of shoving to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sounds familiar?) The theme of the theme is also appealing. Of all the villains, who are great in their merits, Toni Jai stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo sound very similar to the voice of Jungle, which is not a bad thing at all. Actually, it's pretty inspiring! The animation was on the spot, and the script had a lot of fun, which for years has been seriously missed in animations. PLEASE ADD THIS BACK! 9/10. Bethani Coke
