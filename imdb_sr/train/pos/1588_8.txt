* What I like about SPOILERS * Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bines) goes to live with her older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she does not know half of the wretched things that will happen to her from now on, not just her, but also her sister, her friends Gerry (Vesle Jonathan) and Tini (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (McMillian), Vince (Nick Zano), Valeri's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rek), first boss (then firefighter and husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), boring colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and another boss Peter (?) If you do not have a funny bone in your body, please and skip this; if you only love a sophisticated comedy, this is not for you; if you like a funny, sometimes touchy show with two hot chicks that can act in the lead (and no one else's incredible 'Mari Cherri' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main line), then what the hell are you waiting for? Welcome to Casa De Tiler! What I like (2002-2006): 8.
