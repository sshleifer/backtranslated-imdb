I saw this film at least fifty times and after I watched it last week for the first time in a long time, I still felt it. incredible actors, including Vhoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia earned an Oscar nomination for her short, yet powerful Nettie show. You will experience every human emotion while watching this movie. I laughed, cried and got angry. Like most great films, the Academy reviewed it with a lot of nominations, but without a win. But this film, without a doubt, is definitely one of the best movies of all time.
