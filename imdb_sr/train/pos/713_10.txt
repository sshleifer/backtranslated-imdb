this movie is great. somehow. The Dozen really speaks a lot, or does a lot, but it's a terrific movie to watch for how stupid it is. Secondary school takes over evil ms.togar who hates the only thing that all students like, rock & roll. riff randle get all the cards for ramones shov, and this film of peaks with the takeover of the school led my riff randle and ramones. this movie has everything, bad script, questionable direction, bad actors (eg clint hovard & pj soles), awesome soundtrack, extreme coloration, these elements and more come together to do this, what is a classic. > Note - During live frames, note that Darby's crash calls in the front of the audience. neat-o.
