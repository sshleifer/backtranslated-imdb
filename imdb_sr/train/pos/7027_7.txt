"Bie Bie Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it's fun and accessible to many audiences. The original movie could have been wonderful, with Dick Van Dike, who re-presented his signature role in Broadway, but instead they dealt with the action, so the film was very unsatisfactory. This reconstruction, which was broadcast on ABC in 1995, is far more loyal to the original script, and includes some original songs that were used in the national tour on which this film came out of which were starring Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (choreography of this Jason Alekander is completely different from Dick Van Dike, but acted well as Albert, (before his "Seinfeld's" days, he started at the Musical Theater.) Vanessa Villiams is perfect for Rose. Their great work is from Tina Dali like Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (the role he played on a national tour). This film is not without problems. The main responsibility is Chinna Phillips, who, no matter how attractive she looks and looks too old to be teenager Kim. George Wendt is somewhat embarrassed as her father, a little throwing the number of "children" (the number of original actors Paul Linde stole from.) But all in all, this is a wonderful, well-made film that is a material deserved.
