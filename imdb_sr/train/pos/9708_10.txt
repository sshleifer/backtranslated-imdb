I have never seen this program before, even though it was recommended by my family members. Surprisingly strange, my girlfriend lives in Hadfild (a location for shooting) and she pointed to several sights when I first visited. watch. Except that I recognized some of the sites, I found myself not the least surprised. The BBC was once again responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world. The TLOG easily ranked there with Red Dwarf, Favli Tovers and Monty Python as probably the best. Just enough to say that I am now tied to the program. The characters are extraordinary and show unusual depth while retaining a terribly realistic edge. The look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects sometimes a gloomy feeling in the north (there is no disrespect towards Hadfild that I found a very pleasant and warm place). I just hope that it will continue its originality throughout the entire journey (based on the 2nd series which concluded its replay in the UK last night). Good made BBC !!
