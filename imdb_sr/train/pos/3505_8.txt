I have no idea how IMDb sortes reviews, but I know that, as often happens on Amazon.com, there is a striking number of very negative comments about this movie that repeat the same, somewhat obscure speech points, almost literally. Campaign? Only IMDb knows. As for this film: it's okay. It's a funny, cute and very simple movie. It has been more than a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, lived in Cuenca and visited relatives in South Bronco. But I did not find anything inaccurate or exploitative about these children. Is Grandma a bizarre figure? Yup. Does dialogue and complication admit this? Yes, thank God. Are the other films placed in the LES and which include Dominican / Puerto Rican children? You can bet. Does this make this film a crime? as some of (on my eyes, astroturf) comments suggested? Hard. Let them flourish a thousand plastic flowers. This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi High. Scoff in comparison, but we never had the point and touched on, in essence, the humility of the purpose and gentle spirit of this film. However, I would like to know the side story. Behind all this! : -D
