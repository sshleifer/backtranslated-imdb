The funny and discerning perspective of world dating is shown in this comedy, for the first time, writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds when four male protagonists meet once a week at a local dinner to discuss their troubles. We meet Breda: a handsome, mural wall with a quick spirit and a sharp tongue; Zeek: cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: a sexually confused, nice guy with affinity for hand cream and masturbation; and Eric: A married guy who nurses his weekly meetings with his friends in the hope of gaining an enlightenment of a boring and banally married existence. Challenges and troubles in male single lives in New York City are funny, reflecting that Sex in the City and a new comedy of HBO's mind of a married man, and bring inspiration to light scams. The story has a turn when the three singles meet Mia - Amanda Peet's witty actress - and everything falls on her. Everyone entices them with their unusual ability to adapt to the person they expose. When they realize that everyone met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose her friendship. It is a realistic view of the world of dating, which the critic failed to recognize. In the ordinary language, they missed the point. Here are the protagonists of the caricatures of the right people. Exaggerations are hysterical, mixing satiety and humility, and they should not be taken as seriously as critics criticize. Watch this movie, laughing from start to finish.
