Scanners II: The new line is as good as the classic scanners of David Cronenberg, scanners were made in 1980, and Scanners II in 1991, so their eleven-year gap between two films. The film shows the style of the scanner which is a good thing; there would be no Scanners without a head blast so Scanners II has a scene of an exploding head that is just creepy as the first. Scanners II: The new order has some other imaginative bloody scenes that are well done. Scanner II: The new order is a new idea about the series because the Scanners are used as the vengeance for the chief of police and a group of scientists while the young scanner named David Kellum does not disclose that it is used and decided to revenge. Scanners II: The new order is a great sequel to sci-fi classic scanners by David Cronenberg and should be seen. Look at this. 10/10
