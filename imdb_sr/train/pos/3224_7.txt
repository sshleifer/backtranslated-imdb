I watched this film, expecting what I got: good science-fantastic cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with a very limited role. A military robot, you must not show emotions using facial expressions! Hovzat? Something like asking the giant to perform a big arie while being gagged and duct-taped. In spite of the verbal and expressive fingers of the foxes, Russell entails an incredible characterization. His robot becomes a man, despite limitations. Great job! As usual, Jason Isaacs ensures that he will enter history as a great portrait of an impeccable criminal - the one you would like to see drawn and divorced. Connie Nielsen was cute, soft, motherish and beautiful. I'm not sure how much my impression is based on her acting and her physical beauty, but it was difficult to take her eyes off her. Unfortunately, the role of Gary Buse was too small and limited. Most of the action is standard, with a lot of weaknesses, but since it has a sense of science fiction, I do not see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. By the end of the story, a good guy wins, and the grateful audience gets a lot of emotional satisfaction. Yes! Such a problem that thinks Russell did not do a good job is the same kind of weakness that missed the whole thing.
