This is a wonderful movie. The real story of the relationship between father and son. This is far, Tom Hanks at its best. Tom Hanks is really out of this movie. He usually has good roles. Nevertheless, in this film, he appears in this film as a bit big, but still pervades the smell like a rose, even to the last scene, the assassination of his character. The actors of this film are well-assembled. I also love the part when there is complete silence when the character of Hanks shoots and kills all men in Mr. Rounie's group. There is something cold but still deeply soundless in that scene, simply emotions. I like to see John Rooney, the character of Paul Nevman when he realizes before he sees him, that the image of Tom Hanks is sanctified, and he knows that his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie I was thrilled and I knew I had to get out and get a video and since then I have it, adding it to my collection of my favorite films of all time. Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this movie has a special place in me.
