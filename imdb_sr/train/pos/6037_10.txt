What a great British film, screaming laughing and sexy Gary Stretch too, and oh, lots of bikes and beautiful village villages. Members of our club ARROVHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club appear in it as ektras! Hoorai !! There are some really hilarious pieces, good acting, a good idea. I met the director, Jon Ivaia at the show in Vareham, Dorset. A great man on earth and a good laugh. This movie must be supported, because all of the big British films should be! Please go and look at it if you can, they have a website with theaters that they show, so find one near you! /> <br /> I can not wait for a DVD. Some of our cyclist friends have already seen the movie two or three times and can not get it enough. Amanda
