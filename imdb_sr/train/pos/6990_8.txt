White Lugosi appeared in several of those low-budget coolers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better. Liquid from their bodies, so that he can keep his old wife young. After the journalist and doctor spend the night in his home and discover that he is responsible for the death of the brides, the next morning they report these murders to the police, and a crazy scientist is killed and killed shortly thereafter. In this film, you have almost everything: scientist assistants consist of old faith, humpback and dwarf (her sons), thunderstorms and ghost passages in the White House. White and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than in bed in the movie. Body Vanishes is worth a look, especially for lovers of White Lugosi. Great fun. Rating: 3 stars from 5.
