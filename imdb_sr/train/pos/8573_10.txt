In 1996, "101 Dalmatian," Cruella De Vil was arrested by the London Metropolitain Police (God blessed them) for attempting theft and killing of 101 puppies - dalmates. All covered with mud and hay, spent the next 4 years in the "cans". Now, four years later, she was, unfortunately, released from prison. I say, it's about 28 years old - in the years of dogs. So, in 2000, Disney decided to release the successful version of the classic live film entitled "102 Dalmatians". In it is added the 102nd Dalmatian family (Oddball is the name, I mean, I should know this because this was recently shown on television), and the puppy did not have any seats !!!!! Likewise, while Cruella (again actress Glenn Close) fled again, she wanted a bigger, better coat - made by one more puppy !!!!! Especially I liked the song on the theme - I'm sure everyone loves the song "Atomic Dog" from the 70's. And now we hear a little bit in this film. "102 Dalmatians" is such a great movie that I keep wondering - WHEN WILL BE "103 DALMATINE?" ??? LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
