You know, Robin Villiams, God bless him, is constantly filmed in the leg lately with all these stupid comedies he has done in this decade (perhaps with the exception of "Death to Smells", which was bombarded when it came out but now it's a cult classic) . The dramas he has recorded lately are fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". The "Night Listener", despite the central reviews and quick release of DVD, falls into its best works, a period. This is a very frustrating story, although it does not include a serial killer or anyone else that is physically dangerous. The film concept is based on a real case of fraud that has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read the autobiography of a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered terrible abuse and eventually became infected with AIDS. That story touched me until I read the online reports that Johnson might not exist. When I saw this film, the confused feelings that Robin Williams displayed so brilliantly showed up again in my head. Tony Collet is probably the best drama performance as the ultimate sociopathic "guardian". Her role was far from those she had in movies like "Little Miss Sunshine". She even looked at the camera where I thought she was looking right at me. She needs a good actor to play such a role, and that's the underrated (but well-reviewed) role that makes Tony Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation who has not even been nominated for an Oscar (since 2008). It's amazing that there is at least one woman in this world who is this, and that's terrible. This is a good, dark movie that I strongly recommend. Still, be prepared to be upset, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling in the end.
