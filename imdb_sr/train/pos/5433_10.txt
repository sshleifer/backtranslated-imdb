This film is one of my favorites of all time. Cari Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks ml. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy are all in one. The final scene of the battle that is still present gives me a winter and the ending always leaves me in tears. If you have not seen it, I would recommend it.
