"Woman in Black" is one of the most horrifying British stories of ghosts ever made. A young lawyer, after he arrived in a town to deal with the dead client's property, was persecuted by a mysterious woman dressed in black. Extremely spooky atmosphere and fears are calculated and provide the maximum possible effect. The action keeps viewers deeply involved and the finale is quite disturbing. The acting is excellent and tension is sometimes unbearable. a truly horrible horrible movie gives this look. I dare anyone to watch "Woman in Black" at night with lights off.
