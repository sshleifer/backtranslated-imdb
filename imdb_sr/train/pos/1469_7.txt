I admit I create great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it (and they are not perverts!) As it must be seen. And that must be seen! Just do not expect to surprise you. Freudian psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the film, but it has too much perversion and does not stop at the end. Some of the good things are the analysis of Kieslowsky blue, most of David Linch, some Hitchcock and maybe some more that I missed (I just remembered ... Dogville), and I usually do not miss things but are too obvious or loose in the air. Besides being repetitive, making him too long, the documentary is nice in the sense that it notices some perversions that our unconscious, and thus commercial success, most trillers have studied and used as the basis for this theory. I really enjoyed the energetic tone of narration and the efforts of Mr. Zizek to revive Freud's theory, which has long been fainting, especially in North America. Again, that's the way across the top and I believe it's not a waste of time because I believe that most people have a gloomy gratitude for death and blood.
