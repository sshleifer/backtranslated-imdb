In what is truly a diversified actor, this show hits FOKS. It's the kind of sitcom growing on you. If you're just watching a 1 show, you may not really like it, but when you watch two or three - hang on. . As today, the topics are very mature. Humor is usually very mature. Often, the funniest parts are pieces in which mature topics clash with the innocent. Red (Kurtvood Smith) veteran actor makes a very good type of humor on this show. Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this ensemble. Danny Masterson, the oldest actor of "children" is also good. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better in earlier performances as a natural redhead (who got the idea to make her blond?). He often shows a very good talent and comedy. It looks good and without makeup. This is one of the better FOKS entries in sitcom and it's the most successful live action ever since being married to children
