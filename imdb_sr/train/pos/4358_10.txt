Okay, this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" in order to make up for the wrong rating from a bitch who gave this film a zero or 1 star rating. Each of these segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for talented filmmakers ... of which three have achieved notable success in major Hollywood productions. The performances range from rough to very impressive, with significant breaks by Bill Pacton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove can be great melodramatic as well as a psychotic hypnotizer of bizarro-strobe-lamp, and Lance August deliberately looks blurry as a victim of the lab. But all in all, there are great laughs and some really scary moments. It's definitely worth watching, so judge for yourself!
