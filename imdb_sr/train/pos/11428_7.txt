Thinking about this film, I can imagine two more that will help put it in perspective. One relatively forgetful, but covering the same geography, the Coup de Torchon, the other thousands of miles away and much larger in the range is unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis has produced a film that has some of Indochina's great backbone, a complex and unconvincing relationship between France and its colonial subjects. his dignity among his peers and his white bosses. I was also hit by the relationship of love / hatred between him and Aimee. This second gives the film a driving force, and this one connects this film to Indokin. It is never certain what motivates everyone, although some characters are needed to remind us of colonialism. That's the cynical side of the story that binds him to Coup de Torchon. Their scandalous story, maybe even more interesting in a distorted way, but Denis gives us a reminder of how it was with all the tensions and unresolved relationships. The French journey at the beginning and the end of the film offers another interesting side of the confusion that we have in the Western world when we look at Africa. He says that when he came he wanted to call every brother. He came home, but they thought he was a little crazy. France, a character and a girl, grew up in Cameroon, but they do not fully understand what it is, although I can remember how it was. <br /> <br />
