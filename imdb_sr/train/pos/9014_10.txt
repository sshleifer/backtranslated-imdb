Shamefully, before I saw this movie, I was not familiar with Helen Bonham Carter. I had to do some research, to make sure it was not really affected, as well as its character, with (well?), what was it affected. I was in absolute awe for this wonderful lady. She pulled it impeccably. Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the ultimate wishes and needs, for a unique young lady, could be interpreted as gentle and romantic? Well, they can be, when real artists present them in the right way, as they did in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention how beautifully beautiful Miss Carter looked in this film. I often said that it is the most beautiful creature ever adorned by the face of our country, but it seems that she did something in this film. I hope that any one of you watching this movie will enjoy as much as I do. Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion.
