I watched the first series greedy, but I was wondering if I would be back after a long break. However, I got into one episode of the series 2 and I was again hooked. This is a really great TV; revolutionary things such as Mission: Impossible from the 1960s. The characters are well rounded and expand as the series continues, they change as they adapt - some easier than others - to their new surroundings, but they remain smart in character, and yet it is more than possible to have sympathies for someone you would not think of you could ever feel sorry for when something really happened to them. I hope there will be many years of 'lost' to rejoice - and in fact I do not mean it all if I never get the answers to all the secrets!
