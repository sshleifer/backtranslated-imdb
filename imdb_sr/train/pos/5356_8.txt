The man who runs is not a great movie, it's actually a little stupid. But that brings what you want in Arnie, and that's action and fun. I do not see how nobody could enjoy this picture, it's so stupid and on top, it's almost weaned. Otherwise, this is probably one of Arnie's most attractive films.
