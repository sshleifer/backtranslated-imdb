... and if you are very, very good, it will look like a moon above the Paradise. This movie had a bit stupid story, but it was fantasy, and casting and acting were great! Dreifuss was as perfect as an actor, full of all the small neuroses and vanities that you imagine the actors have. See what the actors are behind the scene. It was one of the best Dreifuss roles, just as his character has the best role in imitating a dead dictator! And the farewell scene: like something from Casablanca, indeed! Raul Julia was awesome as the head of Parador secret police. He gets some really funny lines, some of which are homage to other films, such as "Circle the usual suspects!" Sonia Braga was great as a friend - besides being a really hot number: "You should get an Oscar for tonight!" Let's not forget Johnny Winters as an agent of the CIA and several visiting stars who play by themselves: Sammi Davis Jr. All in all, an unforgettable mess under the parading moon. -R.
