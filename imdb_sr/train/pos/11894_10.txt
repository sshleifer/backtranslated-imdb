A truly wonderful heroine who, alternately, surprises and frightens her with swallowing, fights with mattresses, passes into the closed door ... only a few moments that glitter in my memory of the 'Nude Truth'. I loved what I captured in this show: pleasantly stupid complications and some good auxiliary characters provided the setting for the diamond emission - Tea Leoni as, 'Nora Vilde'; sweet, clownish and wonderfully covert accidents - How refreshing to see an actress who can clown - it's no wonder that Holliood does not know how to throw it. But where-oh-WHERE are DVD editions? The amount of bleeps that are released is incredible to me that this little gem remains buried. (Someone corrects me if I'm wrong.)
