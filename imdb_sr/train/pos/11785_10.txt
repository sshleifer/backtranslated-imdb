I do not know exactly how to explain "Darkend Room", because to summarize it would not do justice. It is an essential Linchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I would say that this short is definitely more on the "Mulholland Drive" end of the Linchian spectrum, unlike "The Man Elephant" or "Straight Story." It's hidden on Linch's website and it's a worthwhile search.
