In Cinema Retro # 2, it was discovered that Mark Lester's voice was actually named by a 20-year-old woman, Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered perfect for the title role, director Carol Reed was not at all dissatisfied with his singing abilities. The secret was discovered by a documentary from Great Britain in 2004 titled "Oliver! After Thei Vere Famous". Greene was paid 400 pounds for her work and had to agree to keep her secrets, as did Mark Lester. They kept their word and discovered this fact as part of a TV show decades after the release of the film. For the record, Mark Lester withdrew from acting and practiced osteopath in England.
