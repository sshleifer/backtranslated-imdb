The endless limits of our inhumanity towards our species never stop. This truly amazing story of the terribly abused and largely unhealthy population is convincing, well documented and furious. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by the behavior of my country, and this is just another in our long catalog of international humiliation. We smoke. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I've ever seen, but it prompted me to see what he had done yet. My only objection, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this travesty and terrible cooperation between the US and British governments, demands that viewers / citizens be accomplices in our inactivity ... but does not suggest how to help . I do not know about Britain, but America has made it almost impossible for citizens to participate in their government affairs. Gest in the right direction could help these islanders.
