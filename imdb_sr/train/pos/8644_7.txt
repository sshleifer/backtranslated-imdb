**** = A masterpiece that is recorded in books and never forgotten *** 1/2 = classic in time; simply must see *** *** = Strong, valuable, very fun piece ** 1/2 = Good film, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws. br / ** ** It can still be considered good in the fields, but this work has serious problems or is limited by inevitable elements that are considered inevitable (eg genre). * 1/2 = Basically a bunch of nothing caused by the treasured moments BOMB = Not visible quality - California = *** - No rating (for strong violent materials , significant sexuality and dam k) <br /> <br /> This movie I rented expecting celebration cheeks Brad Pitt in the summer block, but is happily surprised and disappointed. This is actually more drama, and very gloomy about it ... I remember some emotionally intense Duchy voice transmitters. Pitt is playing his perhaps most sexy movie ever with a stunning talent. Having begun as a hopeless but harmless "white waste", the husband realized himself as a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a messy mind. During some of the later stages in the film, it was hard for me to watch it - it was unpredictable and terrifying. This proves very good writing and acting. The whole film is filled with bizarre, sensational scenes that have forced me to hold my breath no less than once, and I do not mean action scenes. I mean the dialogical scenes so brilliantly made that I crawled out and dazed what I saw. It was like watching a rhino and a lion in a cage and watching while biting one to the other. I am again impressed with the screenwriter; whoever did it impossible: mixed oil and water. I also enjoyed the performance of Juliette Levis very much. It's so rare that this talented young actress looks like it's a joy this time. Some of her moments in this movie brought me to tears. I think. The emotions that this girl can wake up in your head are incredible, and clearly I remember that I blurred a few blurred eyes on several occasions. I almost feel like I'm cheating on the quality masters that the filmmakers showed just by giving "KALIFORNIA" *** rating. But the dark feelings she causes are too strong and depressing to get up. I believe that everyone should see this movie. I really know.
