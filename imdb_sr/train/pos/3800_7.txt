The world of dragon hunters is a 3D world caused by gravity. Platoetides, pieces of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere until the ground can be seen anywhere near most characters. It's a world that resembles Neverending Story, when Nothing came to eat the world. It's just strange enough, it's a bad guy and a World Gobler. This time, it's a huge skeleton of a dragon with his eyes on fire. Heroes are a great but quiet warrior, a boring and greedy assistant who manages the entrepreneurial side of the duet and the strange useless animal. They are joined by the dumbest girl in the world who, to my sadness, did not die of horrible, painful and I hope for the early deaths. Voices and sounds are top-notch. Too bad the story is as simple as it can be imagined. They are going to stop the World Gobbler, they reach him almost immediately, defeated him. The end. There is no real development of character or reversal of the story. Not even the ones I would expect from a movie with such a complication. Conclusion: It's a cute thing to watch, kids will probably enjoy it, but that's all. There is no depth in this world (poetry).
