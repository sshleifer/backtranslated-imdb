Poor DVD quality video is the only reason I gave this film 9 instead of 10, which could have been much better, this movie deserves. This is truly a movie that covers several topics at the same time. If you do not like movies about serial killers but are fascinated by the stunning bureaucratic culture of the former Soviet Union, this film is already inevitable. I can not compare it with the "Quiet" lamb for several reasons. The way the serial killer is shown is done much better in the Citizen Ks. See some details of his private life because you "travel" along with the killer, giving you some idea of ​​the source of his constant anger and Sexual Frustration. The only other movie I've seen is as real as it was "Henry - a portrait of a serial killer". If you've been fascinated by this movie, you must definitely look at Citizen Ks.
