Five deadly poisons are a big kung-fu action movie wrapped in a mystery. There are all common signs of kung-fu flick: great choreography, terrible synchronization, different "styles" of the struggle, and a wide range of extremely exaggerated, often cheerful human emotions. However, the plot is certainly better than the average. It is interesting and keeps your attention during the scenes without fighting. Occasionally he is even capable of turning on the audience, as when the K's character gets a horrible injustice. Another thing I like about five deadly poisons is the beautiful ease of morality and the theme of the movie. Almost everyone gets what comes to them. Cowardly, greedy and corrupt wrinkles. Poor guys, consumed by selfish greed, were ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backs. Good guys use teamwork, planning and integrity to overcome the odds and go to the top. Poison Clan rocks!
