Probably we could skip something from the beginning - I'm not sure why this starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If that was because they started in the Mediterranean, they could have come closer to modern Lebanon. One camera and crew arrive to the Bakhtiari tribe, this is the start of an incredible 48-day journey. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this incredible walk through what looks like Karun. They use rafts that stick to the surface by inflating goat skin - you can see where heads and legs are removed. The other "coast" of the river was very steep - I guess it's an increase of 60 degrees. Just watching this was amazing, but there was still a lot to come. In order to reach the pasture, they also had to cross a large mountain that had about 4 meters of snow, if not more. Being able to climb this mountain was quite incredible by itself, but they (and all animals) climbed this mountain of barefoot! Yes, boss. The only drawback of this documentary are some of the inter-titles with bad humor attempts. If you want to see a documentary from a quiet time or incredible challenges with which this tribe not only faces but also conquers. This is just an incredible document of a little-known group of people who are confronted with all sorts of challenges.
