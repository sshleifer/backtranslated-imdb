First, this is the funniest movie I've ever seen. Includes perfect time deceleration, sexual humor and smart imagination. But it goes deeper than that. Souler Opposite is an original love story (something we do not see often) that gave me hope that there is love there, that two people who love themselves can work through their misery; and that such a comedy about life (something I think we all should have) can be accepted by people who are really important. Chris Meloney gives such a convincing performance as Barry Singer that he should have won the Oscars. The film is brilliantly written and I hope to see more films from all involved in the future.
