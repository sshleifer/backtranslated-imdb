This great game of Marvel's superhero gives the right to respect by staying true to the comic strip. Of all Marvel superhero games that were so weak with poor graphics and play, Spiderman is improving in both departments. He also has the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics. As you would expect, Spiderman does everything that a spider can do. He works more than centering. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he does not use the Web in fighting, he also strikes and shoots. Spidey has a full-time job as he fights with Venom, Rhino, Misterio, Scorpio, and Dr. Look for Captain America in the karma. Most levels are challenging, but some of them require patience. The only complaint about this game is that it's so short and it can end in less than three hours. If you are a real Marvel superhero fan, this game is for you, but do not expect to play for a long time. Better luck in "Spiderman 2" My Score: 9 out of 10
