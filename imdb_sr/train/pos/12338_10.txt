Joan Fontaine plays a villain in the Victorian era film. She convinces a married woman with a lover on the side and also sets her eyes on the rich man, Miles Rushvortha, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is as good as Miles. Miss Fontaine has done her part of perfection - at the same time she was tricky, calculating, innocent, frightened and charming. An actress with extraordinary talent needs to pull it out. Joan Fontaine looked absolutely beautiful in the elegant costumes of Travis Banton. In the film is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I recommend this film.
