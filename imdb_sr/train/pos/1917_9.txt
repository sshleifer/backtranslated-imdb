It was a wonderfully funny comedy with great acting. John Ritter and Katei Sagal perfectly acted as parents, and the children were brilliant. Kalei Cuoco was a good choice for playing Bridget, which was some sort of toned version of Kelli Bundi from Married vith Children. Writing and performing were first class. Unfortunately, John Ritter was killed during the series, and this made things worse. They had to struggle to change the show and bring more members, which was obviously an embarrassing situation, but they acted well. James Garner was a good addition. It may have been longer that Ritter lived. I was especially pleased to bring Ed O'Neill to a place for guests. That was great. *** from ****
