Original animated Dark Knight returns to this adventurous film that opposes Maski Phantasma in his cold. There's a lot of intelligence in the Mystery Batvoman, much more than Batman forever or Batman and Robin. In the streets of Gotham there is a new fighter for crime. She dresses like a bat, but she has not grown up Batgirl. And Batman denies any affiliation to her. In the meantime Bruce Vaine has to deal with common romances and detective work. But Penguin, Bain and the local mafia make things a bit more complicated. I did not have much hope for this, because I was very low, but poor Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn ') I liked it so much!), but I was thrilled with imaginative and exciting pieces, a smart complication and rude sense of humor. This is definitely a movie without which Batman should not be. Keep your ears open for a truly appealing song called 'Betcha Neva' that appears in a visible place. It is a pity that the DVD is not so big. Do not misunderstand me, there are some great options (short "Chase Me" is great) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but ... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan. Batman: Mystery Batvoman was shot and recorded at 1.85: 1 but this DVD was presented at 1.33: 1 versus widescreen video clips that are featured on features that are cut off on both sides. I find this extremely embarrassing since Maska Phantasma is presented in an anamorphic widescreen. Varner had to re-publish literally dozens of movies on DVD because people complained about the lack of an original image ratio on some titles. Why they chose that same mistake is out of me again. I would give this DVD 5/5, but the lack of OAR brings the total score to 4/5. It is a shame that videscreen would have an excellent DVD package.
