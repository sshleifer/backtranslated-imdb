This is by far one of my favorite films in American pie, mainly because in most other major characters (one of young Stifler's) it always seems unrealistic in nature. For example AP: The Naked Mile. You have a teenager surrounded by naked colleges, and one is especially hot on his quest to free him from his "virgin" problem and he ends up with stopping the middle part and rides his horse back to sleep with his girlfriend, he gave him a "pass without guilt" for the weekend. I can understand the romantic aspect of the whole thing, but let's be realistic; most people who watch these movies are not particularly looking for a romantic story. While the newest part finally looks like the audience and the good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and feel the scent of the rose and as always Mr. Levenstein gives his "perfectly natural" humor for the brow equation and has achieved a touchdown with this new film.
