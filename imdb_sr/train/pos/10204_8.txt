Although not the best Anime I've ever seen, but I enjoyed Ladi Death. I never read a comic book and I saw it in the video and decided to give it a chance. The animation was OK, I got an anime feeling from the 80's from it, which is what it is for me. Why everyone else hates it is beyond me. Character development was fine. I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death Eye. for you who do not like it, he obviously did not pay attention. Lucifer tells you how this is happening, and she used his words. The Cremator was a good mentor / soldier for her. His dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of film. I think that all who have touched this have to look once again and consider. because everything that people have realized can be said about the favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
