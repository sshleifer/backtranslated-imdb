The performance of Oscar-winning caliber Petar Falko in the role written by Oscar. I loved the nuances, a balanced research into a long-standing marriage - how often do we get it in movies, where the film usually ends when a boy and a girl are gathering? This is an adult film, a complex view across the eyes of all sides - husband, wife, son - how they all adapted to each other in the past and grew up during the story. On top of that, it gave me about 10 great funny gigs, and I'm one of those people who usually sit around unwashed when the rest of the audience laughs. This was one of the few really fun movies I've ever seen. Great, original jokes.
