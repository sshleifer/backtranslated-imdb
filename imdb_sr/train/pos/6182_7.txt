This mystery of murders with musical numbers is long on the atmosphere and character, but rather short of uncertainty and conviction. Based on the Broadway Shovman theater performance by Earl Carroll and others, he combines a dance story with a backstage ambience (the murder investigation takes place at the premiere in the stage where the music show is set). The actors are impressive and diverse: stubborn Victor McLaglen as a police investigator and never looks idiotic on any shovgirl seemingly; Jack Oakie (pre-war Jack Lemmon or Jack Lemmon after the war Jack Oakie?) As a disturbing director who has to coordinate the stage performance as well as the chaos behind the scene; Conscious Jessie Ralph as a lover in a wardrobe with deep, dark secrets; Dorothy Sticknei, who at the end has a stunning monologue in close-up, as a trembling maiden madly in love with male lead; Carl Brisson, a Danish star, as well as a very male leader, rang the classical "Cocktails for Two" not once but twice; Kitty Carlisle, operatively delivering "Where They Come From and Where They Go" and other Johnston-Cosl songs; the magnificent Gertrude Michael, who has prematurely grown from us, as a wicked, witty entertainer whose love for Brison has been rejected; usually funny Tobi Ving, who is here in the middle of a funny-joke joke. When a complication complicates out of control, there is always an interesting performer or a fun and melodic music number that will distract the observer. The most famous sequence of the film is the "Maruana" number, led by Michaels, but in addition to its controversial history, it's really one of the few music offers. All the songs here are set as if they really could fit into the standard space of proscenius in the theater, unlike the fantasy-style fantasy style of Busby Berkeley.
