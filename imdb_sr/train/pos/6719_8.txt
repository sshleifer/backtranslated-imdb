I like this film, because it's a fine film work, made by people who are caring enough to make it art, not just home movies. He is filled with Greg Nolla's Super Surfing movies and amateur videos by others who joined his 50 year old passion. However, it has been expanded to a degree of aesthetic glory. It's filled with artistic talent and athletic talent, no matter how trivial you might think surfing is athletic. Surfers are not astronauts nor test pilots. Nor are surgeons (maybe) or doctors (maybe again). He believes in a search for a surfer. He believes in the beauty of human stupidity. He believes in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of the war. Surfers celebrate the break of war on the northern beach of the Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese niles fifteen years ago. It celebrates the collapse of a country that fought a cold war - instead of a hot war - with Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It's dangerous, but only a little historical. I suppose that Alexander the Great would not celebrate for his surfing technique. He had to come out and win several tens of countries to get the favorable press he received. This film does not have military heroes. No weapons. The only surf-surfers on the beach have a beer and a shop for surfing boards. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It's the joy of exhaling.
