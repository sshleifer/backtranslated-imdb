Cinderella is a wonderful movie, with beautiful songs. In fact, it's one of the best 1950s movies. I think that all the characters displayed incredible. You can see the cruelty of Cinderella's shepherds and her stepmother, the sweetness of Cinderella. The mice are funny and sweet. I think they have changed the story a little, but I think that's the best. It's such a good movie, and I do not think anyone can resist it deeply. I give it 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But it's definitely a classic.
