are in mind the writings of Stephen King and the memorable childhood filled with terror from stories such as IT - as completely opposite. There is no terror in these childhoods that any of your friends - who are still friends for 20 years - are remembered or seem to suffer. The mountain is described as a friendly push, may be occasionally described as "gathering" one or more of them, but everything is forgiven. There is no * angst * embedded as a movie, and participants in later life describe relationships - all we see are young people who grew up at the same person's base. Mature, but essentially the same people and the same structure of power. Totally incredible! Not only because of the fact that people can actually grow up relatively untouched by social conventions - but that friendships can actually last. In this sense, this film is a tiny Pearl - as it is supposed to be the intention of the film: A portrait of unshakable emotions that connect people. What, when viewed contrary to the films of later years depicting the dark side of childhood - violent inhibition in Bowling for the combine is what easily comes to mind, but since the mid-1980s, with the growing admiration of children and childhood (accompanied by 1000 films , animations and series directed straight on children), several films and documentaries managed to portray the dark sides of growing up - abuse, loneliness, pushing into eczema - which resulted in adults with dark and distorted minds. /> And here's the movie, which says: It is possible to have a happy childhood, look 'here'! Thank you for this. OR the illusion counterbalance ... 8/10
