Liam Neeson depicts the Scottish legend of Robert Roi McGregor from the early 18th century. He's a real actor. He enchants the audience with his charisma as he does in all of his roles. Jessica Lange is as great as his wife Marie. Marie is such a beautiful woman. Her love is that Rob Roo is a legend, but this is his passion that makes love immortal. They need each other. Tim Roth as evil Cunningham is perfect; In one way or another, watching a movie, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scottish landscape is beautiful. The environment and weather conditions are fairly well presented. If you love history, romance, passion and love, you will enjoy Rob Roi. There is violence and blood, but this is inevitable in bringing this story as it should be said; There is no unreasonable violence. And you must listen carefully if you are not accustomed to the Scottish accent. One important point making this movie so good is that no actor or actress is not glamorous; they are dirty and look unattractive in different scenes. Their skill as actors attracts you, do not rely on brand names, popularity or attraction of sexual symbols. This is something special.
