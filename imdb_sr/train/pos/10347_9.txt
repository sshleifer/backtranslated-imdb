A wonderful smaller film, juggling comedy and detective, romantic and dramatic genres, like Ken Kenan Williams (Melvin Douglas), balances his loyalty to his girlfriend Makina Carroll (Joan Blondell) and her duty to become a detective. This hawk-podge may not attract all viewers today, but in its time, he had something to offer to each member of the film family, and the resolution for a rather tired plot in relation to duty is genuine and refreshing and worth the wait. "The Amazing Mr. Villiams" contains what must be among the most unusual dates of blind films in the history of the film, and its brilliant comedic repertoires of the spark. Melvin Douglas tries some of the best words: "I would walk the main street in the Turkish towel before I let every woman control my life!" And the jungle Joan Blondell allows his sticks to fly with a typical suicide: "Good sadness! You look like my aunt Nellie!" Crime Solution is a standard price, although fine character actors help to make the material come alive. From today's perspective, "The Amazing Mr.." may be the most interesting because of his insightful gender commentary as a socially defined construct, which is even more susceptible to its seemingly rigid boundaries. Although much of the gender commentary takes place in the superficial battle of the sexes, it is sometimes subtle and penetrating, playing not only in some finer details of the film, but also in the battle of genres that reach the culmination of the final scene.
