One of the best comedies ever to come out of Britain. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are great actors and performers who seem to be at home with a drama like the comedy. Fully supported by their writing partner Jeremy Dison, they have recorded a series with the most striking characters in recent years. Little Britain pale into insignificance as a bad imitation of their ideas. Consistently genuine and revolutionary I'm sure that as many people hate these series as they like them, but I am equally sure that no one can have an opinion on LOG. I have not yet seen a feature film, but I've heard good things and bad things so I will reserve a court judgment. The original radio series from which LOG came came was as innovative as the TV series. I do not know if the TV series has arrived in the United States, but I would be fascinated to see how the American audience found the strange English humor
