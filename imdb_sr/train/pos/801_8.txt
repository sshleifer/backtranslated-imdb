I suppose that EAT is now chronologically considered to be the very "last" entrance to the popular saga, and that is very good, as are several of them. I liked that this sequel was directly after the EMPIRED INFLUENCE, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skivalker as a character (and Mark Hamil as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about Evox, they were not so bad. I enjoyed a thrilling search in the forest and I felt that there are many well-understood emotions in this chapter. Completion (with some new additions, I suppose?) It will intertwine all 6 chapters in a fantastic fantasy story. I know that many of the real fans of Star Wars hated George Lucas for the changes he made in original movies, but to be relatively new in these films is too late in life and there is no lack of what I did not already know, I think he made these 6 films perfect as a whole. Oh, and, err - Carrie Fisher looked pretty tasty in her scarce clothes.
