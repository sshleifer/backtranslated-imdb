For anyone who may not know how the actor's movie was, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous and really does not make sense. It's full of clich√© situations, exhausted lines, melodramas, comedy ... you call it! But Amitabh Bachchan can do everything convincingly, and this film is by no means an exception. Everyone turns into a decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Vaheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smith Patil ... But Megastar is the one who oversees everything with his high presence. Without him, this movie would be a non-starter ... The story is about the separation / wrong identities / misunderstandings / love / hatred / loyalty / good / evil - everything, really! Amitabh is a brilliant performance at all points, otherwise stupid! Did I mention that this is ridiculously funny?
