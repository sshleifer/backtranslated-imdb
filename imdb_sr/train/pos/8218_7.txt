When Harry Callahan stood up for years, an inevitable old man with a chip on his shoulder had to find himself in the game. Callahan, sometimes seemed fragile and unreasonable, his behavior was unbearable. Luckily, this film has set aside a little time to develop a different kind of story, which could have been reinvented by Dirty Harry and the whole genre. Although the film was short in it, it was still a great addition to the series, even if it became a little untoward during stupid fashion trends and Nev Weave Music.
