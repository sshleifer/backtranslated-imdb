enjoyed the film and an effective Confucian crime drama, the old order survives the threat posed by a young, gentle, greedy man, without a doubt presenting a modern society. I thought the end scene was weird and it could not understand if we believed that the big D was punished because it was greedy or was part of the plan for a long time. I loved the scene and once in a Chinese film, violence was not a choreographic fest of martial arts. What always entertains me about HK movies is that the main influence Britons have on introducing 'yes' and 'forgiving' in the local language and it's fun that, long after we left, they are still there.
