First and foremost, the only reason people are concerned about this film is that I can not stand up to a few parts of a true story that is "changing". So guess what? Peter Jackson's film was not a perfect performance. Good enough. This is a very nice movie. The wallpapers are beautiful and taken from the famous Tolkien artists. The film covers about half the trilogy (Fellovship of the Ring and up to the Battle of Helms Deep and Tvo Tovers) and is moving at a good pace. Casting the voice is superb and most characters seem to be imagining. Samvise is too ugly for my tastes, but Aragorn looks great. The film has an excellent result that fully supports the movie. If you enjoy good fantastic stories, but you read hate (books are even better), try this movie, keeping in mind that it was made 20 years ago. The family follows almost the same line as Ralph Bakshi (Jackson has often said he admired Bakshi's efforts).
