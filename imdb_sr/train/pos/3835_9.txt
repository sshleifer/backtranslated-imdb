This film is incredible - it's just like a nightmare. A bizarre story, dark decors, a bunch of insects everywhere, the idea jumps and surreal dreams ... Really great! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. It seems like David Linch's films: a strange story, bizarre dreams, red curtains. Nuit Noire almost does not contain a plot. It is a series of surrealistic events, nightmares and meetings. It's a disadvantage. If the film had a fascinating action full of tension with an incredible disappointment, I would give it 10 out of 10. But that's missing, and that's why I gave the movie 8. Nuit Noire is a movie worth watching. Search this DVD and you will receive a reward!
