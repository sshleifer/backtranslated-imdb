I think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had. Just Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks to write, record and edit the whole thing that I think is an accomplishment in itself. Although this film is not for the masses (as a young innocent teenager has been murdered and there is homo-erotic involved in the story) I think this film is a tragedy in your heart and the deeper you are involved in the story, the more sad you feel. more towards Heaton because of the love she feels, but she does not come back. This is one of my favorite British films that I enjoyed greatly and watched again. I think it's a pity that the movie is not heard at all.
