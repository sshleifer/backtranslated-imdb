Claire Denis has repeatedly shown that the film does not have to tell the story, it is enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make them what they want. Obviously, the idea within a non-linear film is the older man living on the French-Swiss border, a man dedicated to his dogs, who still have lovers, but whose heart status is increasingly endangering his life. He has a son with a small family who rarely meets with him, but when he discovers that he needs a heart transplant, he decides to go to Tahiti through Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and again ignited a long relationship with his son who had form of Tahitian women many years ago. What Denis is doing with this draft story is to use his camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature, human interaction with humans in relation to animals, and so on. Much of the time 'movie' does not make sense, but that's because we try too hard to connect all the points that are exposed to us in beautiful pictures. Life is somehow like that: we watch, watch, observe, integrate, process and make what we want from him. Using this form of filming (just as she did in a strange, beautiful form) 'Beau Travail'), Claire Denis developed a signature technique. Whether the viewer finds rewarding the finished product has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually impressive film, but many viewers will consider it to be too much of an overly long discourse. Maybe it will change the look again. Builds Harp
