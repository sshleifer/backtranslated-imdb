I really liked this movie, it was fine, and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard, and many other classical singers, is very good in his work, when you see him in a musical movie, you know it will be good! I suggest that people watch this heart warming, sad and special movie, if they want to know more about Richard! Outstanding! Fresh!
