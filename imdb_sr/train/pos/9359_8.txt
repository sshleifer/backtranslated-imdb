The feeling of this film was incredible. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. Having played a very shy and brittle character, he took his ability to the very edge and really played a role. His character was really interesting. I can see how I'm reading the script for this film, and not being half as interested in the role Sandler gave me. For someone who plays primarily comedic roles, he has taken a serious role in what looked like his own enthusiasm and contribution. I especially liked the scene in which Adam and Don's characters drove a motorized scooter around the city. I met a moment, because Don seemed to testify to one thing that Adam did to get out of it. With his video games, music and many other things he did not think about the past, the ride of his scooter with the headphones seemed like an escape from his thoughts. This film is definitely worth watching.
