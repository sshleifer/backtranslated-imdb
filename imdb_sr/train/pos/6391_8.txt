This film was captured at the International Film Festival in Arizona. I did not expect much (although the director of the festival told me that this is one of the best films). Five minutes was sold. Filmed in BiH on a small budget, this film is hilarious. The acting is solid, writing is firm and the appearance of the film is sturdy. The play is probably the greatest discovery, since most films shot at low budgets usually have an amateur or stage acting. Not this one. It contains one of the most convincing, early, and entertaining displays of the character of Tourette's syndrome I've ever seen. The plot is intricate, not to be confusing and indecent, without being unnecessary. If you get a chance, check out this movie. Film makers like Majkowski (I hope I'm right) deserve a chance to send their stuff to a wider audience.
