The world consists of two different types of viewers ... There are types of "English Patient" who can not try to enjoy anything that is not high enough to appear on PBS, and there are "Happi Gilmore" types, for which is an hour and a half genitals puns definitely worth $ 7. Sure, there is a ton of gray zone, but you know which side you are relying on. If you are a person with an English patient, save time, save money and save everything his "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid" comment. I know, you enjoy the disdain of every movie you n He likes it, and with every person who loves them, but maybe you could just give up once. But if you're the type of Happi Gilmore ... go look at this ... You'll be ridiculous. Tim Meadows is he created a harsh figure, and Vill Farrell continues to be hilarious in everything he does. Go look. You will be glad you did it. And that's fine.
