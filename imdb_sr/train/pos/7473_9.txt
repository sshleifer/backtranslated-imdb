Strange, this version of OPEN IOUR EIES is mature and more tinted. With the help of a ni≈°an, Crove's script is much stronger and more pronounced than Amenabar's original. The Spanish film maker needs to get credit for the first thinking about the story, but there is no doubt that Crove has improved - if only a little. Note that you have no idea what he was leading to OPEN IOUR EIES, but you know almost everything about the leadership in VANILLA SKI. That's what I mean by "fleshed out".
