This game is fun and has a complication that you can expect in a comic strip. Spiderman is framed by a mysterious scammer. The city is flooded with strange gas, and symbiots like Venus and Carnage appear throughout the city. Who stands behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Looks like he turned a new leaf. It seems that the poison is not included, as it is justified that Spiderman obviously cost him pretty good pictures. Well well from other heroes and many villains later Spidey will discover the mystery. Fighting is basic and not difficult to pick up, battles with bosses are pretty fun. You can collect comics, running out of the web and it's fun to cross the city. However, it is also a weak point. The swing is not as big as everything you do to hover through the city until the Spider-Man seems to be adapting his net to the sky. You also do not have much of a maneuvering website or in particular compared to the Spider-Man 2 movie movie. However, it compensates for the pretty bad swing with other elements, especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Misterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for one wild action.
