While the film feels sometimes, it's worth it. Gordon directs in a style that reminds you of Vonneguts writing styles. Ruthless, imaginary, ironic, strange and dark, this is a movie that will stay with you for some time, asking for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are incredible. Sheril Lee is also beautiful, in a role that will remind us Linch fans on her Laura / Maddy Days. Do not miss this!
