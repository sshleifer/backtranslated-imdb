Abhai Deol meets the attractive Sohu Ali Khan and welcomes the "Hello Sister" !!! This sets the tone for the remarkable debut film Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle-class girl, escaped from her home in Nainital and came to Delhi to marry her lover, Shaian Munshi. But Shian does not appear, leaving Soha broke and alone in the big bad world. . Abhai, a low-class guy is being converted to vulnerable Soha and helping her find work and stay in the nursing home. Slowly romantic blossoms and Soha suits to marry Abhai. Then Shian re-enters Sohin's life. Sensitive film with a very unusual story, lovingly shot in Delhi, revolves around delicate Soha. This well-made movie has moments that will forever remain engraved in memory? clumsy first kiss and Abhai's quick excuses; Abhai describes Sohu as a "ladder class" and quickly adds "she does not like"; he gave him the magic Sohi and invited him to come out. Music is good and music in the background is great. In the scene where Soha runs and hugs Abhai, the soundtrack disappears. Silence conveys both discomfort and gentleness of relationship. The fierce ending makes a bitter sweet film, memories that will stay long for a long time. Must see that I will evaluate 8.5 / 10
