Despite the lack of logic in the story, Kill Shot is a very fun movie. Through a moving show, Kasper Van Dien brilliantly showed the emotional split between a rich father and his wrong son. Each member of the supporting box relies on a solid performance, accentuated by the live acting of a young Asian man whose name I do not remember. A shockingly tragic ending can undermine some younger viewers, but in general Kill Shot really brings a deadly blow.
