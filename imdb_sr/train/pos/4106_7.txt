This is definitely not an intellectual film with a deep mission, so I really do not think there's too much to be understood in case you are not Czech. It's just a comedy. Humor is simple, quite fun and sometimes, perhaps, a bit morbid. Some actors and characters are very similar Samotari (2000) (Jiri Machacek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimir Dlouhy) so they are authors. But it does not matter, the genre is really different and these two films should not be compared in this way. A single non-Russian hand will not try to give you a lesson, it will try to make you smile and there is a chance that it will succeed. Not bad film, not ingenious, but I enjoyed it. Some scenes really worth seeing.
