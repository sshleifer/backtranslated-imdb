This movie was great! I am a teenager, and me and my friends all love the series, so it only shows that these films draw attention to all ages. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartolomey says "pink faces" when he talks about his baby daughter. He's such a good actor as Erin Cottrell. So they are well-mated and have so great chemistry! I really hope that I can work together again. They are so attractive people and they are very good actors. I finally found movies that are good for watching. Lately, it was difficult for me to find good films, to show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not naughty.
