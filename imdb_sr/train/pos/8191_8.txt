Impossible planets and Soton's Pit together make two of the best episodes of the 'new' doctoral second season. Saying this, it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of Kuatermass and Pita (1967) into the outer space, with the history of the universe intertwined with the history of the Beast 666. These episodes reinforce the emotional emotions of the connection between Rose and the Doctor, while emphasizing Rose's growing self-confidence, establishing her as a non-completely equal-but-but-gaining partner with our beloved Lord Time. It should also be noted that Matt Jones is a stylish script that reduces the occasional over-reliance on a doctor's line, as well as the performances of the entire actor, most notably the outstanding Shaun Parkes as Captain Zachari Cross Flane.
