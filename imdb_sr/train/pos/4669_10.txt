If there were two more charming performers from Peter Ustin's and Maggie Smith together in a more charming film in 1968, I do not know who they were. I saw this wonderful little satire jewel for the first time 25 years ago at the age of 16, and I think that every year I have not managed to sit back, I look back as lost. It is intelligent, unusual, neat, sweet, sweet, slightly subversive and completely enchanting. The romance of these two social misconceptions is also richly comic and terribly touching - never more than in the desperate attempt of Maggie Smith to bring the right card on deck, a scene that is both sadly funny and perfect miniature portrait of cordial loneliness. And that ultimate frozen frame on Ustin's troubled, worried face as he asks: "Are you okay?" - Has anyone ever made the appearance and sound of loyalty so perfectly and honestly? I would never want to know anyone who did not like this movie.
