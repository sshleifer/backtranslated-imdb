I have seen a few comments on Brand using a South African accent, some of which considered it to be a mistake. When this film was filmed, racism and discrimination were very strong in the south. Jim Crow's laws were still in force. Civil rights were in the air. Could this be a subtle social commentary, a southern man who is in love with a woman of another race? In the same way, MASH was a subtle critic of the war in Vietnam? Any thoughts? Another comment was that Mioshi Umeki appears as "cold". Anyone who was in Japan would understand. The Japanese, at least in my experience, did not show emotion to strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men who met with males. Americans in Japan were completely alien to this culture, and blunt attempts to get to know women were shocking to women. One of the characteristics of the Japanese was to smile when they got up or embarrassed, which many US soldiers took as a sign that their progress was welcome. Also remember that at the time presented in the film, Japan was just defeated, and the occupying forces were burdened with reluctant acceptance. I think that Mioshi Umeki gave a very credible idea of ​​what her situation would be like. Watching her interaction with the American actors has brought back some memories of my experiences in the country. I managed to meet a couple of beautiful young ladies who, after convinced them that I was not a typical American, learned the language and their culture during their stay in their country.
