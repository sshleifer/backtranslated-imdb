This is a movie that everyone should see if you want to see a great acting. Mr Thorn and Ms. Farrel are doing an extraordinary job. I think we should have it on TV again so that the new audience could enjoy it. Beautiful performances. It gives you the real feeling of what pioneers have to go both physically and emotionally. A great, unexamined movie. It was done when Mrs. Farrel was very young. I always considered it to be comedians, but it is certainly not a comedy and she is wonderful. There is very little dialogue, but it only makes it seem more real. Mr. Thorn, as always, is a great presence and only his breathing has a great feeling. I have to watch the movie.
