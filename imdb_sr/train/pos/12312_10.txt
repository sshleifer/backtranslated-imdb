I can not believe a movie that can be made so good in 1987 and is practically unknown in the west. Not to repeat other reviews here. The result is very good and it moves. Literally it means "Dawn please never come" - when it comes, the wonderful spirit and lover will forever be separated. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look great. I enjoyed Joel in God of Gamblers and many Leslie films including Better Tomor.
