It's time for Hollivood to sit down and take it into consideration! If the actors act on the snow, all you have to do is bring the animators who worked on this little miracle. The Renaissance is probably the first animation film to forget you do not see human beings. Although there are voices from the actors (Craig, McCormack, Price, etc.) Some of the best I've ever heard, even then the emotions that show cartoons are disturbing. This style of animation is not new, but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a vivid picture. Ironically, such a technical spell makes you forget that this is actually a very good movie. The development of pacing and plots is wonderful, and the dialogue is sharp. Land: The disappearance of a top mega corporation employee reveals a story of fraud and corruption with a hero on a cold heart at the forefront. I can not say much, not to give up everything ... except that your movie is held at the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you without words. Must be watched .. even for 'adults' who laugh with 'cartoons'
