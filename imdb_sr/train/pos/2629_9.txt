I was not sure when I heard about this. I was thinking about how Disney became stupid. I was wrong. I found it very good. I do not think it's the King of Lions, but it's cool to see the other side from a certain point. That was very funny. Also, it was not one of those banal disney sequels when the animation was bullshit, it was like the animation of Lion King. The only thing that blew me out was the whole movie thing through the movie. Do not give anything, but you'll know what I'm talking about. I also enjoy having fun that it was great that most of the actors from the original came back. It was a very good movie for everyone.
