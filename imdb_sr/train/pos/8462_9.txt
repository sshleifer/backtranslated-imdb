I just recently bought a collection of one of these great series, and even after I've just watched three episodes, I'm still hypnotized by the elegant style of animation and slow, but deliberate narration actions. I'm still a fan ..... with some minor pains. Although this story in Gaga Saga is very cool and has what the previous series had - a stylish sarcastic way to talk about warfare and not leaving the need for control or power over everything (sounds familiar?) , I have to say that this becomes a bit too dramatic in continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their constant need to be concerned about everything that is happening and what should be done to prevent the OZ group from succeeding in its plans (especially the figure called Vufei ... I mean he shouts more than an American character in a soap. Advisor, will you?) <b /> <b /> In addition to excessive drama (I think it mostly comes from the English dubbing voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will still impress me again. I mean, it can always be worse. It could be like a recent sequel, SEED ...... eeeevvvv, talk about mellows-dramatic .... I'll talk about it later.
