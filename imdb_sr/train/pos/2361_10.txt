I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I work in a medical institution. Over the years, I have seen people die from haemolytic blood transfusion reactions, attended a number of blood-related pathogenic conferences, and have seen several patients who are seriously ill with blood transfusion pathogens. I also heard that several Jehovah's Witnesses were told that they would die if they refused blood, and after 26 years on the field, I never saw it happen, leaving the question "is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community in great benefit of the battle on this issue? "The question of Jehovah's Witnesses is a moral question. "You must abstain from blood" is not a ambiguous statement. Thank you for this film and allowing comments on it.
