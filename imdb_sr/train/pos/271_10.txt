Everything is about Mitya. I loved her in this. And did not it look fantastic?! I love these popcorn movies on Sunday afternoon. This is like one of those attackers who always go on advertising in the worst times. Richard's character was completely creepy. I went out with such guys. Well, not so bad. I wish Zack was not killed. He was cute and he was very easy to see. I love those Stalker type stories. He always makes me stand up and make sure the doors are locked. My husband usually does not like these kinds of movies, but he actually went through the whole thing with me and actually enjoyed it. I can not wait to see what Mitzi will do next!
