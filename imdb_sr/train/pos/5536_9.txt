In fact, I really enjoyed this show. Even as a young man I was interested in all sports, which included horse racing. It will always be difficult to make a series based on corruption in races and at the same time get permission from race tracks to record a recording of this controversial topic. One episode I remember especially was concentrated around a horse that was expected to win a big run that looked a bit unusual. The syringe was found on the first floor and everyone thought it was drugged, but nothing showed up in blood tests. It was too late to realize that the horse was not doped, but that his knee was removed. As driving a car without oil and stopping the engine, the horse broke with tragic consequences.
