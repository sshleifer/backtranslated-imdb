The Beta Page was an icon suppressed in the 1950s, when it represented sexual freedom that was still a decade far away, but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol works perfectly with Scandalous Betti, a small city girl with ambitions and a big body. Her acting career did not take place anywhere, but her body brought her to the peak of fame in a recognized department. Photographed in black and white with color interplay when it comes out of the world of exploitation in New York, this made for TV (HBO) film has good production value and very faithful support. The problem is that it is quite emotional. It is difficult to form a attachment to the character, since Bettie is portrayed as a person that is rather shallow and na√Øve in view of the job she was in. But it is certainly worth looking at the history of that time and seeing a severe government repression that was a feature of the fifties. 7/10
