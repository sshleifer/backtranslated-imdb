I saw this film in the movies when I was 6 or 7 years old. Then I loved him and I recently came to own the VHS version. My children aged 4 and 6 love this film and again and again looking to watch it. I enjoyed seeing it again. Although I have to admit that it is not so good on a small TV. The songs are very sweet. My daughter sings them all over again. Hope this helps.
