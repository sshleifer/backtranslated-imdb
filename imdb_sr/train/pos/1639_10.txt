Incredible actors, beautiful landscapes, sharp reality. I will not elaborate all the comments of other reviewers because you got the picture! However, the movie is not funny. The reality is slaughtering pigs and other cattle in order to survive. I also have a book about Elinore Randall Stevart. I read it a few years ago, I had to read it again, because I was just watching a newly released, remastered DVD movie. I tried to buy a video for several years, finally bought it from a video store that stopped working. But Iippee! DVD is now for sale, I bought it at amazon.com. It's not cheap, but it's worth it. This is a movie I will watch for the rest of my days!
