The lonely depressed French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on a holiday in summer, met and falls in Cedric (magnificent Stephane Rideau). Quietly and slowly this is a very frustrating movie. On the one hand, I was absorbed and I really felt like two boys. On the other hand, I became disturbed - the film was constantly flashed from the past to the present without rhyme or reason. It's very confusing and meaningless. SPOILERS AHEAD !!! Also there are tons of holes for plots - Mathieu, at one point, does something that ends up in the hospital. What is it - we never said! Then he breaks off with Cedric and tells everyone to live with him. Why? We did not say. Then he unexplained the other guy at the end. Why? No explanation. Clearly Cedric likes Mathieu and Mathieu lives in the same city, so ... However, it is a tribute to a movie that cares for you so much. Only things are explained! Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. He is tall, handsome and has a nice body - but he can not work. His idea of ​​acting is sitting with an empty face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. He is very handsome, has a very nice body and is one of the actors. He also has incredible sexual magnetism about him. She has a full frontal male nudity, a lot of kissing and a pretty explicit sexual scene in a movie that is great - most movies are away from showing male and female love scenes. This does not help and helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other. So, frustrating movie, but something worth seeing - especially for Rideau's naked scenes - that is, you like handsome young men! <br /> <br />
