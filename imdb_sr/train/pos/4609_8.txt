Probably the best movie of Jack Chan in the 1980s, and the one who put it on the map. The scale of this self-directed police drama is visible from the opening and closing scenes, during which the squatter villages and shopping center were demolished. It is clear that there are differences between original Chinese and synchronized versions in English, and many jokes fail to find themselves in this other. The latter also interferes with stars that do not sound anything like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing that synchronization corrected was the trial at that time, the trials in colonial Hong Kong were in English, while the original had this scene in Cantonese! Nonetheless, Chan is fighting style and martial arts choreography inject humor wherever possible, so that the non-Canton audience does not miss much. After all, it's not a dialogue that provokes Chan, but action and painful moves. The story is easy to track: Chan plays the uncensored Hong Kong detective who deals with the gang of gods (Cho Ieun) and is assigned to protect the star (Brigitte Lin). The action is excellent from beginning to end and there is not much time to breathe between. You will never be able to think, but what's fun and well-connected movie. This is one of the best martial arts films.
