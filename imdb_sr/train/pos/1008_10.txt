I entered this excellent program in season 4 and since then I've seen all the episodes that all episodes on DVD have gotten better and better with seasons 9 and 10. Now maybe there's no Richard Dean Anderson adding Ben Brovder and Claudie Black still showed strength and originality even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, now the sci-fi channel has freed itself from this incredible show without any hope for a season of 11 years. Atlantis is still strong in its 4th season. And there's also a third spin in works where the star gate franchise is not near the dead. This TV show must be seen for all fans of science fiction and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to attract all ages and all sorts of people. Watch IT !!!!! 10/10
