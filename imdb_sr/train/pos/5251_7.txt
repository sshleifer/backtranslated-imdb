Good "Vaine's War" has long since disappeared and since then they have been difficult to snl off-shoot movies. Of such film intangibles as "It's Pat" until the last 80 minutes of the "Night in Rockburys", many have undoubtedly lost faith in any other skate ever making a successful transition to the silver screen. Do not be afraid, because Tim Meadovs goes through the dots. the well-written action keeps the public's interest to the very end and while remaining faithful to the character of Leon Phelps presented in the five-minute skate, the story allows the character to develop. humor (mostly consisting of sexual jokes) is fresh and interesting and it seems to me a more intense laugh than in any movie lately. It's just a great time if you do not feel too serious. Tiffani-Amber Thiessen from the "Saved bi the Bell" glory, appears in the movie and looks amazing. Finally, Billy Dee Villiams, who survived his Colt for 45 days, gives the film a touch of class. and for those who are foolish filmmakers like me, you will find that this film is eminently quoted, "ooh, it's a lady!"
