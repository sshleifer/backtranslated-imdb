Fascist director Miss Togar (Marie Voron, hanged by expert photographer Dean Cundy as being ten feet high) has a plan to completely turn his high position. There are complications that cause this goal in the beautiful rock'n'roller Riff Randell (PJ Soles, which illuminates the screen and has a hot body), which is an obsessive fan punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeo (Dei Ioung, whose large glasses and nerd role can not hide his stunning beauty) is joining forces with Rifa to end the alleged rock'n'roll kill crisis for Togara's desired mission. /> Vincent Van Patten has a hilarious role as Tom Roberts, success in everything, but it's slow. Kate is crazy about Tom ... only if he could get his head out of the sand and see him. Clint Howard steals the movie almost (honestly, who can steal this movie from Soles?) As Eaglebauer, a "supplier" who can get everything almost everything. His office is in a boy's toilet! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff when he enjoys the concert of THE RAMONES. Noisy high school mess that defies all the norms of normality .. and I loved it. It's as if somebody just says: "Let's make life fun for an Â½ hour." The film is actually anarchy ... chaos that is less dependent on RAMONA with all its heart (even if they are horrible actors, they have the opportunity to get a new audience with this film). The ending pretty much sums up the film as a whole .. Rif and her colleagues take up high school and starts a massive party. To be honest, I did not want the party to end! It's not conventional in any way, this film just loses madness. Accompanied by a great rock soundtrack with some of the best songs of The Ramones, this movie allows the viewer to take time in life when the war did not dominate the titles, and people were just having a good time. I suppose that was the days.
