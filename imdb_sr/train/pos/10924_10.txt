I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I am 26 years old, and my friend is on DVD. We got the case of beer and watch this classic! He lost none of the original kung fu cold! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, this is what must be seen ... DVD is available. I believe this film is also called Pick Iour Poison. Watch it soon!
