After watching this movie, I feel like I know a little more about the US. David Linch is synonymous with the value of shock and it's strange because of strange things, and really these elements are not missing in The Straight Story. However, this is in the light I did not see from Lynch before. We start with a simple family living a quiet life, but we end up with a series of absurdly interesting characters with depth in their lives that can not be obvious from their introduction. The bar scene with two World War II veterans who were discussing events of fifty years ago, and how it still influenced their current lives and emotions, was particularly moving. If you are looking for Vild at Heart or Dune, do not look here. But if you're looking for real people with real stories, this is a movie for you.
