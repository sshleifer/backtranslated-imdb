David Zucker has directed one of the most beautiful comedies of the year with this stupid Farce. Yes, it is a matter of acquired taste and it depends on the richness of the sofomorian hedges, but it is consistently ridiculous in contrast to some recent comedy efforts. The film is filled with various jokes ranging from obviously obvious to subtle species that you have to pay attention to everything in the box or you will probably miss them. Like his previous efforts that include "Avion!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun", humor flying almost every second. There are so many things to do, it's easy to overlook a few who fall. What distinguishes this film from other pale imitations in the genre has led to a real story. While others have depended on ridiculing too many famous scenes in almost random films (take "Mafia!"), This film tells a new story with nice characters. He deals with sports films in general, as well as satirizing the right sports industry, instead of hunting some specific films. Even for people who do not care for "South Park", its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make up a good number of leading actors in natural chemistry. The movie also makes an extremely effective use of the athletes', athletic announcers and other celebrities, especially a hilarious piece with Robert Stack "Unsolved Mysteries". By the way, stay with the credits for the final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has achieved, in words, perhaps using a film mix of sports, domestic dancing.
