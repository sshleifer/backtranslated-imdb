This is the best Chinese movie I've ever seen and, in my opinion, much better than Hero or Chrouching Tigers, the Hidden Dragon. The film is a unique combination of several genres: it's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most unlikely thing is that it really works in all this! This film definitely succeeds in my top 5 and should be pleasing to every movie enthusiast. Action sequences have traditional unreal jumping and even flying, but the way the image differs from Hero style and flying always looks great and usually makes sense (spirits can fly) See this movie, you will not regret it . 10/10
