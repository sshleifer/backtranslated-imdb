Looking at this movie, I was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my glass. Especially romantic fantasy. I knew little that I had traveled through film magic. Everything in the film from complication to dialogue to effects was very close to perfection. Claire Today is like a star in the movie. From the beginning to the end, you are falling in love with this person more and more. Michel Pfeiffer is a predominant evil witch who wanted to capture a star for eternal youth and beauty. Robert De Niro is a cute character who gives the audience the greatest comedy comedy because the film gets on the edge to the climax. All in all, it was a film that surprised me and delighted me as a fan of film. If you are looking for a fun and fun movie that will be fun for both children and adults, Stardust is the way to go.
