I recently watched it on the Sundance Channel. The idea of ​​the film was to bring many filmmakers, celebrities in their own country, to record short films, eleven them, all in one film, concentrating on only one theme: September 11th. in this film I could say why these filmmakers were great in their country because he had all the elements of a great movie. The film begins with a film from Iran in which a teacher is struggling to teach students about what happened on September 11, which they are failing to achieve later. The second film from France includes a deaf woman who angrily writes a letter to her lover until she is aware of what's going on. The next film from Egypt implies that the director talks to a dead soldier about recent events, not just about terrorists 11. September, but also bombings in other places. Then comes from Bolivia where the girl teaches about the events of September 11th and believes that they must marry them. <br /> <br / The next from the country in Africa where a group of boys follows a man they believe is Bin Laden. The next comes from Mexico in which nothing is displayed but the sounds of that day. The next from Israel involves a journalist at the site of a bomb blast in an attempt to get the report, but it's often talked about attacks. There are other movies that I can. Remember at this point, but everyone is powerful. It will restore your emotions from that day. 10/10
