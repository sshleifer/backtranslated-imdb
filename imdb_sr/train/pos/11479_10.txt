This film was excellent, somewhat frightening, but great in that. For those of you who have heard of the columbine and know the story, she gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. In the background of your mind you know that people think about these things, but you never understand how bad it is, and this movie makes you understand. That's serious. It also makes you two times before mocking someone who is safe. I read a book about a Colombian massacre that made me think, this film is worrying me and scaring me to death. On the other hand, this is how to kill a serial killer guide. I recently received a threat and I ruined it without thinking, but after this film I think that everything should be taken seriously. Some people are crazy and you never know what they are, so take it seriously and do not judge someone.
