In my opinion this is one of the best performances of Barbara Stanvick. She was one of only a handful of actors, then and now, who could say more with one glance than the whole page of the dialogue. And I was lucky to see the original and uncensored movie, with an additional 4 minutes of additional shots. It's a shame that the film is so short. Lili is a young woman who barely holds him together working for her father in her illegal act. Her only relationship with anything is her good friend, Chico, who was beautifully played by Teresa Harris. Although Chico is an African American (and the white woman is the best friend of a black woman in the 1930s she was controversial as the subject of this film), and Lily did not have a special relationship. And it's not sexually. Only 2 women were stuck or pushed into a situation beyond their control. After Lil's father dies, and she does not know what to do, she was told she had the power to go out and get what she wanted. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the whole point of this movie. Then "they" had to go and ruin the last few minutes. So, up to the last few minutes of the movie, it's a great movie and it's worth watching it. The "lesson" of the film is still valid today, and I am sure it will be 100 years from now. Women, it's terrible what Lily is doing to get what she wants, but she works. People, keep in mind.
