Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film that has traditionally portrayed evangelical stories. The music is great, you get the real feeling that the world of Jesus looked (and I was there), and June is the passionate part of Mary Magdalene. And Cash's narration is good. But ... 1. The actor who played Jesus was wrong. 2. There is no fencing story as Cash puts into its music based on faith. 3. Since it's ineffective, I doubt we'll see this again. I would like to buy a CD.
