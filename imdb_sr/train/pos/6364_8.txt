"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was everything they showed to be. This is not often the case. Most of the times, shows only the best parts, and then the rest of the movie is horrible. Not with this. I was pleased with the initial complication, although the sub-posters were not. The animation was not broken as "Shrek", but it was still good. The story and story were well presented, and in them there were only a few slow points. This is still of interest to you. I enjoyed this. "Atlantis" gets and keeps your attention. You have to think a little, but not too much. When you think about it, you can understand what needs to happen, but you really do not know for certain how this will happen. Michael J. Fok, while Milo was an excellent choice. His personality fits nicely. Commander Rourke was well-chosen with James Garner. His character reminded me of his performance in Maverick, which I also liked. I really liked the acting Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. Her ability to play without stupidity makes the film more interesting. It's a shame he's a criminal. Over all, it certainly worth (8 of 10).
