I noticed that NOVA NADA and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK in TOP 10, but this one is not even in the TOP 100. This film has a bad reputation for Evox, but there are so many reasons to love this film: - Han Han Solo's rescue from Jabba: This official is finishing Han Solo in a debt sub-loan that was established when we first met a character in the new HOPE movie. - The car was finally discovered: Well, this may not work now, when the forebears came out, but this was the first time we saw Cara as a child. Speeder Bike Chase: All right, this was a moment of special effects. But it was definitely one of the most exciting and exciting moments in all the films! - Climax of 3 parts: 1) Battle of Endor (led by Hanoi and Leo) 2) Luke faces his father & The Fall of the Imperator 3) Destroying another star of death (Land's moment) < br> <br> Final celebration with our heroes: As I said, this movie gets a lot of shit over Evok, but I think it's kind of cool that while the whole galaxy celebrates PAD EMIPAR, our heroes have their own private party in the forest with each other. All in all, this was an excellent chapter for our heroes and a convenient end to the STAR VARS story.
