With this topic, it's easy to take cheap recordings. You know, the guy with hairy legs tries to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar works best to make Gerald the right person, someone you care deeply about, and as a result feel that it's hard for him to try to live as Gerald and Geraldine. And not just that, but like Geraldine, he looks HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julie Valters is electric. These are two characters who feel love for each other, and this happens even when they simply look through the breakfast table. Even the potentially cheesy sub-story of corporate downloads is convincing, and you end up in the end at the end! At least I am!
