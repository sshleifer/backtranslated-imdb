This is probably one of the worst movies ever recorded. It's horrible. Is it so good? It is probably best not to look at him expecting a sharp plot and something fantastically clever and fun because you will be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it so that you can see 50 million vases and Goose's fantastic hair / bad English, you are right for a treat. The more difficult it is to think about a movie, it's even worse, unless it's competing to discover the most fascinating, in which case you have watch classes. I would really recommend this film for boring or arrogant Smap fans. Even then, the latter should be a little more careful, because Goro's Japanese fans were a little upset about it, they thought it was selling. (He was not real, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) could do it for him).
