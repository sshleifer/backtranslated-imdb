I'm not sure that I understand where all these enthusiastic anti-criminals are talking about this, it may be that some people like to talk about things. The film is certainly imperfect (uneven action, some may have had difficulties with changing times, the actors were too willing to go to places that I would rather not go, etc.) but IMHO had some things which compensated for imperfections. First and foremost, I LOVED myself 'breaking rules'. NORMAL when you leave the house with the haunted, the villains leave you alone, giving you time to rebuild, get friends and find the mysterious paranormal type. NORMAL (half-spoiler warning) when you hide underneath the blanket, they can only lead you through that little opening through which you wind up. NORMALLY eventually the ghosts somehow became less creepy because you found that they were only misunderstood, or were released, or whatever. Second, the production was exceptional. While the film was a bit of supernatural with special effects, the short ones were very well made. Probably not the best film for those who think that Freddie and Jason are the ultimate kind of horror (nothing against them, they have their place), but great for those who have started to accept conventions healthy for almost and have no problems with weather distortions.
