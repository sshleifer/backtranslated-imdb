My favorite character in movies, but in almost all Zorro characters, has a small piece of fabric like a mask, and if a criminal can not tell who is under that fabric then they are crazy. But in Reed Hadley's "War of the League of Armies" (1939 series), the mask fills the whole face, making it a real mystery about who Zorro really is. is one of the best characters in movies and brought him to date, I think that Anthony Hopkins in "Maska Zorro" (1998) is a pleasure. My interest in films is huge, but I love a series of 30s / 40s .... Bond2a
