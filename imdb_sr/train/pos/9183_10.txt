This wonderful TV production by the BBC (not a film, as others wrote here) about the love of "Jane Eire", starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester, and Zelah Clarke as Jane, is the best version so far, since it is the most trusted novel of Charlotte Bronze in concept and dialogue. Classic becomes classic for very specific reasons; when movie producers begin to mix with classical blood, then this classic is destroyed. Fortunately, the producers of this "Jane Eire" came up with respect and loyalty to the original, resulting in a spectacular infectious fabric that is worth seeing multiple times, enjoying the multilayeredness of sweetness and pleasure and uncertainty. The performances are wonderful, the music is fine, even the Gothic design of the house and the openings are beautiful, and they set the true tone for production. My only criticism, although small, is that this version, like any other version ever made by Jane Eire, ignores the Christian influences that built Jane's character and influenced her moral choices. In today's modern world, women in Jane's situation would not think twice before staying with Rochester after finding out that she has a crazy woman and that she is still married to her. "Oh, just be divorced," she would say to her man, or would live in sin with him. But Jane Eire knew she could not be satisfied with this course of life and respect. Why? This decision was based on the fundamentals of the Christian faith that she had learned since her childhood, not from the brutal Kalvinist institution Lovood, but from a Christian example of a true friend, Helene Burns, who died and did not turn her face. One day, I would like to see a version that better describes these influences in the adaptation. A classic novel that ends with a heroine who writes, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus!" the foundation of this faith should not be released.
