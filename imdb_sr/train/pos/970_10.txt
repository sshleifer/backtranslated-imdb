I saw many movies in my time, but from each individual there were very few selected ones that were really good to me. And I'm a 19-year-old man who is impressed with this film directed at the younger audience. This is a very underestimated gem for those who watch foreign movies. Almost all the acting is convincing, the graphics are decent (for which you will not even worry while watching a movie. Believe me, bitching about graphics would be a stupid thing), the story is well written and It's a movie that everyone can enjoy not only children. Here's basically what this movie made me do. One, I laughed ... a lot, two, I made me feel for the characters as you suppose, and three, it's a very exciting story. By the end of this film you will feel good. Of course, what anime there did not contain was a young kid who turns into a great warrior and whatever hits a lot of evil. It's a formula that is used a lot. But, in this case, it is forgiven, because although they use dolls for some characters and some average graphics that you would see five years ago, the appearance of this does not need to be evaluated. It's very touching, the ending is genuine, and keeps you in the movie as it's supposed to be. If you still try to compare this with other movies such as "The Never-Sting Story" or whatever it will be your opinion. Watch how you and you will enjoy. It's been a long time since I was impressed like this. The only other movie in which I got this feeling was when I saw TMNT the way it came out. There is something in this film that I felt about the TMNT that made me really love him. So do not over-analyze or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy.
