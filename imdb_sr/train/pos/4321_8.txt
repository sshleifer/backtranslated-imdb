I'll keep this very brief. I believe this is an outstanding movie. I see that other reviewers who commented on the effect of being poorly written, poorly recorded, have a terrific soundtrack and, worse yet, that it is not realistic in their lifestyle. Okay, maybe it's not entirely convincing for the full length, but this film carries a message of hope that others have missed. I hope it is not too late to save people from the terrible things that are happening in many lives. Gang violence is real, is not it? Is it okay, no! This film carries an important social message that cynics may not like, but who still needs to praise, not to downplay. I watched the movie with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with equal enjoyment and every time with the feeling that the world could be better and can not be saved (good until 2008). 9 out of 10 of me for this. In my opinion, it's almost perfect. JMV
