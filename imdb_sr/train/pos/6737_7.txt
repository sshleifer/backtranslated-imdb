The director and two LAURA stars (1944) were again accepted for this solid policy: Dana Andrevs is the criminal's criminal who becomes a cop who breaks all ties to the past, but can not keep the inherited violent ways under control while examining the suspects and one night , he goes too far; Gene Tiernei is alienated from her victim's wife, an adorned war hero who embarked on the leading city racket and Andrew's first enemy, Garry Merrill (who was himself a protégé Andrews Snr.)! As usual with Preminger, this is a well-designed movie with a significant introductory series of credits and revived by a good acting hat including Karl Malden (like Andrew's current superior), Tom Tulie (like Tierney's Taxes for Taxi Drivers) and Neville Brand (as Merrill- the main actor), with considerable support, and Craig Stevens (as a slut, a victim who fights a woman), Berta Freeda (like Andrevs's cute partner) and Robert F. Nolan (like Andrevs's rigid outgoing superior). Since he has already warned him to correct himself or not, Andrevs panicked and starred Stevens a few hours after the killing to put the police on (in this case) the wrong traces of Merrill; however, after Tully becomes the main suspect (until Andrevs and Tiernei are romantically involved), a policeman goes to Merill's lair, intending to move away and 'install' a racketeer for his own murder! It is clear that the protagonist is a complex character and Andrevs faces the challenge with first-class characterization that is typically complemented by the Fok noir style.
