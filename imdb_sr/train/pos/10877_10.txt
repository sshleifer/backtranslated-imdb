I saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although we just two of us got out of the cinema thinking that it was cool, the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. Well, that was because it should not have been taken so seriously, basically it's a movie that ruffles horor flicks and a damn good business. It seems that another movie comes out like that, umm ... ?? So this is Aussie, and originally !!! Jessica Napier performs and Sarah Kants has a definitely bright future in acting! I hope to see them more. Molly Ringwald was a good move and Kilie was an even better move. Impossible princess was the queen of the screen !! I recommend you take a look at this film, because you will guess all the way to the end of the relationship with Raffi, Hilari and a movie that never ended 20 years ago.
