This is a very cold, and generally well-designed drama. I am very impressed with the film, not only because of complication and top-notch acting, but it has also made such a unique film. Most movies that include a spy or war are full of hungry Britans or mighty battles, but not these. It's not about this kind of war, about the war between a man and his life position, an American spy in Germany, who is a supporter of evil that no one will ever forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic attitude must remain a secret government. Returning to America, Campell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi haters, providing interesting conflicts both internally and externally. Nolte more than pulls the role, and fits well into the story for what she's looking for.
