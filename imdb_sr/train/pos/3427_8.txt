This film illustrates the worst part of the surviving war, memories. For many soldiers, men and women, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I recall my father and his brothers who returned from the Second World War. For one of my uncles, the war has never ended. He survived an invasion of D-day, something similar to the first 20 minutes of Ryan's retention. For him, memories not only retained, but tortured him. He became an alcoholic like some of my cousins, his sons. For the next 60 years, and set up soldiers in a different war, in another country, the result is the same. When I saw it at KC FilmFest, I recalled that there was something about a war that never changed. Young men and women idealists are not spared emotional distress from what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war, you will leave with more sympathy with soldiers trying to do what they believe or have told them to be right. The mark from the Vietnam War lines speaks for everything. "The first victim of the war is innocence."
