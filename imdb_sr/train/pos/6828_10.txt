Broadway and film actor - director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary's Babi) is creating a masterpiece with this 1977 film. In it are actors Gena Rovlands, John Cassavetes, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stevart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson, and there is comedy Peter Falk. Premise of the film: The older stage and film actress (Gena Rovlands) are reassessing their lives once a fan dies in a car accident trying to get an autograph. The film has a slow pace and a dark, humorous, terrifying quality. It has a film look of the 1960s and even reminded me of Polanski Rosemary's Baba without a supernatural horror. Fears here are the ones that every successful actress has - she has grown old and will become useless in her career. Moreover, she feels that she has lived a life that does not have true spirituality, humanity, and merits. She lived only for her career - there are no children, no charitable deeds, etc. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the flesh of this film. It's falling apart. It's in crisis. Gene Rovlands is really intertwined with the tortured character of the character and works pretty well. She is a great actress and a 70s film refreshing contrast often with violent films from that period and films about disasters or adventure thrillers. It's a film with lots of deep emotions, but it has a cool, cynical feeling, like Cassavetes criticizes the mainstream films and actors of the 70's. Either this or this film is a product of the '70s, which was itself cynical in many aspects - Nikon's deception, Vatergate, Vietnam, etc. with an unpleasant mood. An honor for the underrated and late director Kasavets who died in the late 1980s.
