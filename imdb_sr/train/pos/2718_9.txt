Last year, we were honored by two films about Truman Capote, who wrote the book from which this film was shot - Capote and Infamous. I can not imagine a movie like this was made in 1967. brutal brutal drama; elevated to the status of a film classics by master directing by Richard Bruce (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Professional, Blackboard Jungle). in this film, there are so many problems lately that can be associated with his depiction of the killer in this movie. This is the movie that stays with you after watching.
