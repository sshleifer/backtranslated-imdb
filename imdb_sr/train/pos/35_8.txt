When I saw the elaborate DVD box for this and horrible figure of the Red Queen, I was sure that I was in great disappointment, but a surprise, a surprise, I loved myself. Convulsive nonsense, of course, and unforgivable to make such a complicated outburst rush to the extent that he can barely read the subtitles, let alone take into account the ridiculous explanation. However, this film is a dream. Incredible ladies in the phenomenal suits in beautiful ambiences and the whole thing constantly on the go and followed by the beautiful Bruno Nicolai soon. He may not be Morricone, but in those lighter parts it could be that way. Really pleasing with lots of colors, lots of sexism, some bloodshed and minimal police interference. Great.
