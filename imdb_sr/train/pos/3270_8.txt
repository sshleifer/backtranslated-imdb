Writers Perry and Randy Hovze made a very interesting story in the "Chances Are". Using the idea of ​​a reincarnated man who returns to his ex-wife's home years later, the plot has unexpected, beautiful turns. Twenty-four-year-old Robert Dovna Jr. offers a wonderful performance, with the help of Cibil Shepherd as a widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. This trio has the right chemistry for this cap, playing each other with a graceful style. I watched this movie several times on TV, and every time I considered it the most pleasant.
