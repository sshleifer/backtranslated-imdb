This film was incredible. It's an inspirational cinema. The characters are fully developed through the truth in which the director Luca Valker brings a film. I recommend this to anyone looking for that special movie that shows a human being in a human condition. Luci Vlaker shows the beauty of the landscape. This film is a real example of a man against nature and sometimes a man against a man. Internal turmoil and triumph are enormous in their subject. An interesting topic is how Tiebtans see blindness as a sign of demons. This film casts light on a particular culture that has never been shown. Luke Valker gave Erik Veihenmaier a voice when he would not otherwise be heard. Thank you, Luke, for being honest with your vision as a director.
