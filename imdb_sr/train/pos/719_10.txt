Although this film is the best thing, it is perfectly removed. This film, without a doubt, must be considered a modern classic. Basically there are two types of films I like - movies with depth (chicks, if I have to - I blame the woman for this) and foolish comedies in which I can relax and relax. This film is the perfect example of this other. My friend sent me to this film shortly after its release. Considering me somewhat shallow, he told me, "You have to look at this movie, that's just your type of film." Coming out of offense, I began to look. I know that they mentioned Ramones a million times, but when you see them, I said, "Hey, that's The Ramones." My friend replied: "I do not know they were a real band." I had my moment of glory. This film, although now a bit dated, must be seen for Ramones fans - or anyone else about it.
