Vinchester 73 receives recognition from many critics for the return of the Western after World War II. Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for a great direction. Jimmy Stevart does an excellent job, but I think Stephen McNallei and John McIntire steal the film by showing them two bad guys involved in poker high stakes with the precious Vinchester 73 who goes to the winner. This is a good scenario with several stories that are happening at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Ioung Bull. Thank God, in a few years, we would begin to let the Indians play in Western movies. The film is black and white and recorded in Tucson Arizona. I would not put Vinchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane, but gets an above-average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
