Before we start, I have a fear of dentists. This film gives me a damn and even makes me feel. That's what I love in this movie. The film is boring. For that I take 3 stars! Warning * Spoiler Alert * The movie revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone who just learned that his wife cheats on him. Soon begins to have hallucinations and begins to torture his patients, killing associates, and even tortured his wife to death and killed the man with whom he had an affair. The film is very bloody and bloody. I'd recommend it if you're up. I give this film 7 stars from 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your normal everyday dentist!
