The meteor falls from the sky and awakens a plesiosaur that has long been used to terrorize the area around Lake Crater. While the monster eats the local population, they try to discover how monsters are killing. Recent attempts to send old film about horror and science fiction like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass somehow have fallen out of films like Crater Lake Monster that are available for display. It's a movie that's underlined and sent only this is the real thing. All these films are trying to be without language in the face and therefore much more fun. This is the real movie in the movie that had an accident to come as Star Vars changed the way we look at special effects. A monster, a mixture of stop motion and a head of life-size, is a charming strange little beast. Film creators spoil the audience with frequent images of the monster and his death. It is certain that everything is false, but are not movies about the suspense of disbelief? In fact, I think it's really cool monsters, which is what it is. This film I like on a low-budget disk in a way. If you want a true authentic drive in a monstrous movie, do not look for further. This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar films of lake monsters (Boggi Creek, etc.)
