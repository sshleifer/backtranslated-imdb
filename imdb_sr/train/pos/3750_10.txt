This is super short. I think every voice is made by Jason Steele. (you can hardly say whether you have heard his normal voice, so do not worry about having the same sound.) Its length is 15 minutes. Spatula is struggling against spoon and is meeting some strange people. in fact, everyone who knows it looks pretty crazy. "Edward!" "General Peterson, we have to take you to a medical unit!" "No, I will not do it to Edward." "Do not talk like that, I'm sure you'll be fine." "I'm Edward, and you know it. Before I go ..." "Yes?" "Can I just ... have one kiss?" "Um, no." "Come on, just one, little, key on your lips?" "I'm going now, sir." Soon the movie will be. the date for this is in September, but it is likely to be discarded.
