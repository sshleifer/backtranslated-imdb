This can only be a nostalgic journey into the past and a time when childhood begins a journey to memories forward and backward and backward and backward, up and down and all around. Boy Jimmi, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinki, Cling & Clang, funny lion, and even evil Vitchie Poo through and through. The last day of the inspiration of Lidsville, "The Bradi Kids Saturdai Morning Previev Special" Sigmund & the Sea Monsters, and the Land of the Lost and Not & Old are what this shov bridged the gap to, as well as The Donni & Marie Shov, Bradi Bunch Variety Hour aka Bradi Bunch Hour & Even the Paul Linde Halloween Special. Perhaps even other things between & Beiond the Buck just keep moving, and even beyond expectations, as well as unexpected borders. Now that we are updating in March '06. We know that Jack Vild has gone and so it is even more symbolic for us now to truly become nostalgic. Including now in August '06. and when Jack Viddle plays himself as Sigmund and The Sea Monsters as well as when in the second episode of HRPuffinstuff he returns to remember all the other nostalgic travels of all Sid & Marty Kroft characters including the HRPuffinstuff Goodtime Club, Donnie and Marie Shov, Brady Bunch Variety Hour aka The Bradi Bunch Hour etc. Frankly, Stephen "Steve" G.
