The action of GOODNIGHT MR TOM on paper seems to have a great dose of maudlin, a sick sentiment. But talented director Jack Gold is an expert in touching emotions in the right way, and he appears as a convincing, deeply touchable war drama with excellent production and main performances. One of the best, if not the best film from the 1990s, which would probably have been even more successful to be published in cinemas. The evacuation of children to towns and villages in World War II villages was, of course, a common practice, but in the case of a boy here it was twice as important for a poor home life in the UK capital. the home front still does not move, and the construction of the film until it starts to grind, the foggy finish ends leaves us with a sense of optimism in spite of what happened earlier. It's almost (but not quite) worthy of comparison with the finale, it's a wonderful life (1946), everything is a modern classic.
