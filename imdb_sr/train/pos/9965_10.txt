Perfect for families with young children looking for carefree, non-violent movies that are fascinating for the child and fun, even if they are totally outcast, for adults. It's not a bad movie for a low-budget job. Children will be impressed by the Santa Claus workshop and "magic" that allows him to enter homes through chimneys that seem too small, or homes that do not have chimneys at all! preventing a nasty devil named Pitch (complete in classical red clothes with horns and tail!). They will sympathize with the poor girl who is the greatest desire to have a little puppet for love. And the poor little rich boy who just wants to spend time with his parents forever absent. And which child does not know someone in a school who is just like the nasty boys Pitch hired to help capture Santa Claus and destroy Christmas? In the end, everyone, including bad guys, gets exactly what they deserve for Christmas! The film will admire the children and Santa Claus and the message of love you deliver to people around the world. /> <br />
