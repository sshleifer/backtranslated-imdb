Writer-director Brian De Palma is best known for his series of films called, somewhat unjustly, "the Hitchcock imitation." Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not discard Hitchcock; he borrows a story or elements of characters that may have been seen in Hitchcock's film, and then spreads them in a more violent, more modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for the death of a dead death with a humorous humor. and it's probably best for him. The story includes a serial killer who is crossing and lurking and burning housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street whore (played by Nancy Allen). from "Psicho", but De Palmina's soundtrack is also technically genius and darkly creative. The museum sequence is especially well rated and arranged; The scene of the lifts is also one of the most prominent murders recorded on the film. "Dressed to Kill" may not be a complete original, but I would say it's definitely worth your time. Rated R. 105 minutes. 9 of 10
