A soldier is not as bad as many have done. I found the movie to have some of the sacred, cynical humor as it is in the Star Trek of Paul Verhoven. Lack of dialogue and top action is intentional and contributes to the atmosphere of comics. One special bit-bit stands out for me - Todd has the names of several tattooed space warfare campaigns. on the chest, and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For those who are unconscious there, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in the elite last rows of Rooney Battles in the Blade Runner. Imagine that Todd could fight with the Andorian troops as Roi was the weakest. Perhaps scriptwriter David Peoples was nostalgic? I will give this 3 out of 5.
