Thanks Jimn Magon, for creating 2 of the best Disney cartoons ever. This show has improved greatly over the years. As a kid, I did not like that, because I thought it was a Ducktail game that at the time was my favorite Disney thing (like Grandmoffromer). Then later, although it was good, but not great. But after I read the reviews, I decided to give another chance and bought a DVD set and I looked at the entire pilot on the first day I got it, and I was very pleasantly surprised. It's still my favorite episode, although the series has seen it. And at the end of disk 1, I knew it would be top tenner. The characters are so complex and charming. My favorite must be Vildcat. He is absolutely funny and cute for lifting. My next favorite is Baloo, the best pilot in the show. I see why Jimn built the show around him. Then it's Kit Cloudkicker. He & Baloo have the best relationship in the series. After that, Louie. Jim Cummings perfectly mastered the original voice. After him, Rebecca. She laughed me a lot, and I believe that she and Baloo eventually marry. And in the end (for heroes), Molly. Although I am the least favorite, I still love her. I think he's a very sweet person (much better than Webb's Ducktales). And the villains were very original. Don Carnage and his air pirates always break me, Kahn is cold and merciless, and Thembrians are always fun. As already mentioned, the stories are moving from funny (Time Waiting Bear, Romance of Red Chimp) to nothing touch (The Old Man & Seaduck, Paradise Lost), to fun, fun and exciting adventures (looking for ancient blunders and my favorite Bell Bells). These are just some of my favorite episodes. In any case, Talespin is the best Disney, except Gummy Bear. GB had a decent amount of my favorite character (Cubbi), while TS did not have enough Vildcat. But in the end, Talespin remains a classic. BOTTOM LINE - 10/10 6th best cartoon ever.
