When you compare what Bryan De Palma was doing in the 1980s for what is now fun, his films continue to look better and better. "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out", "Bodi Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Vai" are top-level works by the filmmaker at the height of their power. This is a pure Hitchcock with 80-pervading perversion, a gentle story about lust and murder with many turns, huge help in style, stunning Pino Donaggio scoreboard, and trashy, giallo-inspired plot. work with cameras and chicks, shady characters help overcome logic holes, while great performances by Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director ), Nancy Alen (then De Palmine Wife) and Mike la Kane do everything Let the virtuoso lead you to a surreal, horrible, erotic puffy odyssey and you will enjoy in every frame "Dressed to Kill".
