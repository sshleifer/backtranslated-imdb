I must say, although I despise such performances, a shocking horror, I am a girl, I feel that I have to express my opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez before I saw Jackass and I think it goes beyond Jackass in terms of making the program. The story lines and interviews are interwoven to create a more interesting show. I saw a few minutes of a movie about Jackass some evening and I could not believe it was badly composed, it all just put a line for a joke after a joke without any connection between anything. It must have been the fastest easiest release ever to be edited, shockingly amateurish. While drinking vomiting is not my thing, as far as a significant fun show is concerned, Dirty Sanchez is away from Jackass's league.
