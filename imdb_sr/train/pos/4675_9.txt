At the Tribeca Film Festival, I saw "Shadow Brother", and two days later I was thinking about it. The story of the scattered son (Scott Cohen) who returns to the work of the family custom of furniture after staying in jail, offers all the necessary qualities of solid drama - unforgettable characters; sharp, cautious dialogue; sensitive use of the camera by a visual visitor. But more than that, it is something that is very rare today in the multiplex: an uncompromising vision of a mature sensibility. Talent of the director-screenwriter Todda S. Illina seems to appear in full brilliance, but we realize that he (as well as his protagonist) paid his debts. He knows how real people are struggling in this world, and he knows how we yearn to see - or at least to experience - success. However, Iellin respects his audience too to smash happy smoke at our back. In the end, we see that Jake's triumph does not lie in commissions, or even in respect of his family, but in a "job" that he could not abandon if he tried. Essential theme in the world (especially in the film industry) that can not be raised above the "end-line". This film deserves a wide audience.
