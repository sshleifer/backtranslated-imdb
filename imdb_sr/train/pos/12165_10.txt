Frohnland is one of those intensely unpleasant situations in which you finally laugh at the wrong time; and just when you realize that you do not need to laugh, you have reached the peak of loud noise; and as you look around you on the sprightly white faces with your wide open eyes open and glazed eyes, you feel the piercing pain that begins in the pit of your belly and you suddenly hurry on your throat and ... well, you realize the point. But for all your inconvenience and facial blows, Frownland is truly an incredible piece of work that, after looking at the unarticulated riot of the protagonist and all of his pathetic troubles and incidents, makes you want to scratch in your eyes and at the same time, you feel that you are very sorry. It would be much easier for me to simply get out of the movie Ronald Brunstein, but for some crazy reason, I felt the unwavering determination to keep the course and experience all the grainy irritations that the film can offer. If somebody lit you, you usually want to turn it off: Stop! Kap! And Roll! But with this movie, you want to watch how the flames slowly swallow your whole body. You bear the pain - perhaps out of ignorance, or some unknown masochistic curiosity that I can not even try to explain. Unfortunately, the mainstream cinema will never allow this film to come to the theater next to you. But if you get a chance to catch it, get ready: take the bag for dogs.
