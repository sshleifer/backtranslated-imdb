First, do not go into the Revolver, expecting another Snatch or Lock Stock, this is a different type of gangster movie. I saw a gala evening and this film was definitely shared by the audience. It's a movie where half the audience will leave a thought. WHAT was it? It was terrible, and the other half would leave thinking WHAT was it? It was cool. I personally love movies I do not understand, for example, Mullholland Drive, and Usual Suspects, so I enjoyed the Revolver. Although it is definitely not perfect. I saw a big turn that was about a mile and a half, at least part of it, and although sometimes some free ends were unexplained, Revolver leaves many questions unexplainable for no reason. Also, some scenes, such as animation, and the scene on which Sorter is going to kill (actually one of my favorites), although they seem to have terrible scenes for watching were just because they were terrible to watch, not because they fit in the movie. However, there were also many good things. I thought the performance was excellent from all the major actors, Jason Stratham, Raio Liotte, Vincent Pastore, and even Andre Benjamin (who was a pleasant surprise). This film definitely kept my interest, with one big, tense, action-packed scene for another. When Rai Liotta was under the table ... so you have to see him. The script was extremely well made, and the soundtrack, like most Gui Ritchie films, was great. Although a step below movies such as the Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, there was still a fantastic fast paced, psychological, action movie, with lots of turns and tons of scenes that you will remember long after ending the film.
