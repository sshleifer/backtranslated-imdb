I did not give this film the perfect result to be honest with respect to big classics such as Citizen Kane and Seven Samaurai. However, this film is so beautiful, it's really a shame that it's so bad for an IMDB general voter. However, an IMDb voter relies on geeky, and "Paulie" does not qualify for that. The only acting criticism I can suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg did not show the perfect kid that kitty. I'm sorry, but I'm asking a six-year-old child to leave Dustin Hoffman while Rainman seeks an impossible film. Moving past this small complaint, the movie has the best of many films: a friendly trip on the road, a con-game, a hero as a friendly party-animal (parti-bird?), Disnei-humor for the young and old , etc. Toni Shaloub wears his role as a pair of comfortable jeans. It looks like it's normal for him. ("I am Russian ... I like long stories.) I do not like mango, but he almost makes me go out and buy one. Watch the movie and that will make sense. Buddi Hackett and Cheech Marin make very suitable performances in the film. The roles that fit pretty well into what we all know about them. The only surprise for me was that Jai was Paul's voice, and in the end even it works well, putting parrots and antiparous together As a team and creates your magic. If you are trying to find a movie for yourself and children who is neither offensive nor boring, "Paulie" is with an ideal candidate, but I will admit that the lucky moment for my review Paulie is. The car air conditioning died, half of the restaurants had cold cooling (as did our hotel) and I said, "Let's watch a movie in which the air conditioner works So are we. So we cooled down for less than 100 minutes, entertained and gained the experience of the heart. When I recently saw it on VCR under less emotional circumstances, I realized how much this film was made. It's a sleeping film that you will not regret.
