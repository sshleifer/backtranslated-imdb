Steve Carell enters his first major role in the 40-year-old Virgin since he only had ancillary roles in Bevitched, Bruce Almormi, Anchorman and his work at Daili Shov. comedy that Carell really does. You can say that Vill Ferrell influenced his "comical air", but Carell takes it to the second level, everything he does is innocent, loving and hilarious. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. like myself), perfect support and brilliant tracks charm the audience throughout the film. The script was perfect with so many brilliant lines that you would want to look at the movie again to remember them all. The music corresponds to the big tone of the film, and you can say that the director knew what he was doing. Filled with sexual jokes, some nudity and lots of languages, this movie is not for everyone, but if you like wedding brides, a leader, or any movie in that direction, you will absolutely love the 40-year-old Virgin.
