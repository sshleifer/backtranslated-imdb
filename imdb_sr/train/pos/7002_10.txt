Vill Smith once again in his film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade, corrects his injuries in a way that will touch even the hardest hearts !!! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian director Gabriela Muccino gathered and created a masterpiece that I recommend you buy and hold in a movie collection because you will never get tired of seeing / feeling this movie !!! I have the highest respect for Villa Smith because he is not only a brilliant actor, but it can be said that he has a sincere love for people and a life that made him perfectly perfect for the character (IRS agent Ben Thomas) who played in this film. You will find yourself feeling his pain and anger, frustration over his love for Emily, played by Rosario Davson, who was otherwise fantastic as usual. I fell in love with the fact that their characters fall in love. Voody Harrelson also starred in this Top Notch movie. It's very difficult for me to write this review without sharing the key points ... All I can say is that you also watch and when you are sure that you do not have anything to stop you, remove the phone from the headset, sit down and take ready to start trying discover the mysterious life and past of IRS agent Ben Thomas ... I thank Vill Smith for another great movie !!!
