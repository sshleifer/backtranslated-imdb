Ultra-dark criminal drama Pou-Soi Cheang, director of Home Sveet Home. Tonally, that reminded me of Billy Tang's Run and Kill, although it's not so polished. However, this is an appealing, defective crime against Cambodian loner Pangu (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. As he escapes from the scene, he kills the partner of Sam Vai, who, in order to add insult to injury, is in the middle of a deal with his dying father, so Sam begins a crazy, obsessive search for Pang, leading to a dozen dead bodies and ruthless violence . Lately, there must be something in the air, because I've never seen so many people measuring each other, as I've been lately. This is a gloomy, nasty thing, which makes me so biased towards her and I welcome her negative vibration. It's a visual stop and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, they were all scrolling down until every character in the world of screaming. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds the depth of the story and creates an unexpected fourth act that can boast of the fine act of grotesque operation.
