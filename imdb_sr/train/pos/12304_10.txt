This is a great movie. I like where Ning goes down to take his ink, but the skeletons are chasing him, but luckily he avoided them, opened the window and did not even notice them. kiao kian is also very beautiful. And when he caught the needle in his ass Ma, his hysteria. and when she says that love is the biggest thing on earth while standing between two swords too. then the part where they eat their cakes while watching how a guy kills a lot of people. then you see singing songs while running to escape from the wolves. Love scenes are romantic, kiao kian and ning look sweet together. add a comic time, a giant language, and you have horror, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention the top special effects for the 90's.
