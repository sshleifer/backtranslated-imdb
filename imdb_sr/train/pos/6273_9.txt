I really liked this movie, that, I know it was pretty far away, there is no way that the Shelby car managed to stay on the road as the 540i with its control pulls other gizmos, but in addition, the entire movie is well assembled. Cage was as good as usual, and the rest of the actors were also pretty good with the exception of Brit Bad Gui, it was a bit too "too", was not it? In any case, great movie, great cars and great acting. I took care that my car was locked and alerted to my remote-controlled garage that night. :)
