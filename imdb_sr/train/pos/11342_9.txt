Every weekend I watched Pufnstuf when I was about 10 years old. It was right after Bai Citi Rollers. One day I saw him on Famili Channel and recorded for my three year old daughter. I forgot all the things I liked as a child, a magical flute, a broomstick, Vitcheepoo Makeup. This show is extremely low technology. The mayor is certainly the precedent for the mayor of McCheese, and all are stuffed with dull eyes. But children love these things. In a way, they would look at the guy doing a sockspin rather than sitting in front of a high-tech computer animation. There is a (mild) slapstick, but no topic for adults, such as sex or dying people, and children accept Jimmy's plans. Children think it would be proper to wear a smoke bag and convince someone that their house is burning, and I loved that every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky, she thought Vicipo was flying overhead. Music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really liked it. She sang in the car "it's different, it's different, lonely". My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and is still one of her favorites. I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is underway. I really hope that they will try to keep old tastes and not to do anything similar to computer animating characters, etc. I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf.
