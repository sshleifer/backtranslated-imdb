Shintaro Katsu, the best-known by Zatoichi, re-starred in this third and final film in Kenya Misumi (mostly known for "Lone Wolf and Cub"), directed the saga of Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami, and the big dicked fights with the ninja, the rape of "ghosts" and the discovery of suspicious ventures in the shogunate treasure "Hange's plot" somehow got stagnant and repetitive. What once was the novel in the first movie was no longer. Fortunately, this one was better than the other. Because I have more humor, I'm just glad that they decided to stop on a trilogy (Mr. edam Vas Lucas) My class: B DVD Ektras: Just trailers for all 3 Hanzo the Razor films Eie Candi: Aoi Nakajima frees Both tits, Mako Midori just left
