How can anyone say this is bad, that's beyond me. I loved this show before I saw her. For three reasons: 1. The story intrigued me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore bad comments and please watch the entire first season before you decide it's bad because I know you'll watch the first season to love and go out and buy Season 1 as Season 2 on DVD and then join the campaign for season 3 Made! I hate Fox and I'm sure many of you "Dark Angel" fans hate. They have something for Canning Good Shovs! Do not you agree?
