Cosimo (Luis Guzman) said in prison about the perfect robbery. Since she is behind bars and can not do it alone, she must leave her to her girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). The brothers Anthoni and Joe Russo are the directors of Velcome to Collinvood (2002). It's a criminal comedy, which is often very funny. You can not help but laugh when everything goes wrong with those guys. Villiams H.Maci plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockvell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andi Davoli is Basil.Gabrielle Union plays his love interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays Pero love interest Carmela.George Cloonei (also producer) plays Jerzy, a tattooed type in wheelchairs. This is a very funny movie. I certainly recommend it.
