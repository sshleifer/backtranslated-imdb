This is the best comedy I've ever seen! but not everyone can understand it, you have to be from Georgia to understand this incredible movie! :) Overall one of the best films I've ever seen ... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all supporting actors who play very well, but acting Kote Daoshvili (Father Germogel) is in my opinion best act as a side role history of films :)) in this film are played by many Georgian stars such as ipolita kvichia, sergo Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze ... all the stars in the Georgian cinema :) plus in this movie the great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course director of the movie Georgi Da elia is one of the best ...... I recommend this movie to everyone, but remember that you need to know a good Russian to watch this movie
