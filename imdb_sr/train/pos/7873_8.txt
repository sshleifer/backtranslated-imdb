Page 3 is definitely a very enchanting and enchanting eye opener that very cleverly exposes the hypocritical lifestyle of Mumbai's elite. From fake kisses to scrambled laughs, it does not leave a stone that would reveal the shocking lives of the rich and famous. In every dark corner of the globe and the globe lurks back, gossip, corruption and scandal. Humanity and generosity are analogous to the oasis in the desert in this world where social darwinism is the dominant mentality. Everyone continually craves for more money, more fame and greater reputation, forcing them to work out the harshest things you can imagine, starting from signing film contracts at a funeral to abusing children. Everything is possible in this metropolis where there is such a huge gap between the social classes. The audience sees the ugliness of these two classes of the eyes of the protagonist. She looks at the staggering atmosphere and the staggering frenzy that the social people live in. Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a beautiful trail like the ash Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. A great movie with excellent character development!
