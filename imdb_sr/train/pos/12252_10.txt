I really enjoyed this adaptation "Emma". I've seen her many times and I'm always looking forward to seeing her again. Although it lasts only 107 minutes, most of the new plots and sub-lots have been developed in a satisfactory way. All the characters are well displayed. Most of the dialogues come directly from a novel without any jokes jokes added as in the Emena Tompson Sense and Sensibiliti. As a stranger, I especially appreciate the perfect dictation of actors. The costume and costumes were beautiful. I believe that this version is entirely at the level of the 1995 miniseries "Pride and Prejudice", but then the producer and screenwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a really good job showing Emma, ​​which Jane Austin said would create heroin, but she would love to. She is snobbish, but she has enough youth and inexperience to be even more cute. Mark Strong was also very good at presenting Mr. Knightley, not so easy, I think, although he has no charisma shown by Mr. Darling Colin Firth is proud and prejudiced. Even the final scene (Harvest Festival) that does not happen in the novel provides a suitable end, unless it shows that Emma is cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill, while in the novel she was completely reconciled with him, even told him she would enjoy in duplicity, that he was in his situation. Strange deviation from the loyalty that is otherwise shown during the film. I think costumes are more beautiful and more elaborate than in other adaptations from Jane Austen's novel.
