I would say that it was time, this film was awesome ... and that, if you do not have the desire to become a Christian, then why are you bothering yourself? I saw this film after I was already saved and found it to be very touching. Now I see that these films have been taken to the second level and have created the Left Behind series ... they are a close comparison and are definitely more modern to reach people. I think that in order to really judge this film, you should see it, there are 3 or 4 in the series if I'm not mistaken ... do not use our comments to judge, watch the movie for yourself! ! God will bless you if this is the reason you are watching them.
