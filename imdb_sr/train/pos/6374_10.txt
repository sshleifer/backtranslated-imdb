Atlantis was much better than I expected. In a way, she had a better story than other films that were focused on more than a year. Although this film occasionally demanded a lot of attention. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some of the younger audiences expected a comedy, but they got an adventure. I think they are all tired of the endless parade of extreme parody. Many of these children saw nothing but parody. After a short time everyone looked very intensely watching Atlantis.
