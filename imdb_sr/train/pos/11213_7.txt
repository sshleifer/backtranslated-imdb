This second film is as interesting as the previous, except that there is no uncertainty. We know what he will do and what will happen before he even appears on the screen. Then the pleasure comes only from the way in which the tricks and their succession differ. We know that the car will be dynamite, it will lose the wheel, that the car will have a collision, just to talk about the car. And this is happening. Now you can find the details and details in the movie. Obviously, some stupid woman might have to bother him, but he must come, but we know that he has already seen through it and that he knows that he is trapped in a trap. How will he get out? You have to find it yourself. And do not worry about getting the main dealer, but how is the other story. Speed ​​does not match with our busy beaver on the river. We also know when it will be wounded. They did not know what kind of jackets were bulletproof jackets. True, it has recently been discovered that some GI did not have such equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a film? This insistence on hunting traffickers and this blindness that does not see that the ban is the one that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value that could ever stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the power of evil. Why not simply legalize this product so that it can be properly observed and monitored? When something is illegal or is pushed off the road, it's less fun to use them, work them out. It is forbidden or limited that is attractive. Dr. Jackues COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and University of Versailles Saint Kuentin en Ivelines
