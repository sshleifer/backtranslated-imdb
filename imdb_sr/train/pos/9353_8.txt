(2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dilon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Rae Allen, Paula Nevsome. Sometimes he influences and sometimes moderately dramatizes the fundamentally depressing man who lost his family on September 11th (Sandler in his best role as a "Punch-Drunk Love") who turns reunited with his old chemists from college and friend (Cheadle) continues to do impressive work with every role to date), a prosperous dentist who seems to have all that ?? family, wealth, happiness? but he really sees an ally in freedom with his personal lives of his troubled friend. Written and directed by Binder (who plays Sandler's former best friend and actor's accountant) with equal humor and genuine pain, the film works best when two stars share the screen while the last act does not fall into the almost movie movie Seven-Day Grass with a solution to the present things.
