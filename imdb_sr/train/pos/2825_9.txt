This film was a surprise. I did not expect much to be honest. The first Hollywood movie Grete Garbo? So what? Probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated waving of hands and distortion of the face that often show low-quality silent films. Well, did I make a mistake. Greta Garbo must have just shocked people from the studio as much as she, because her film made a star and deserved it. She instinctively realized the power of only a calm standing, or simply maintaining a meaningful expression for a long, momentary moment, so that its effect could be felt rather than just seen. I was constantly thinking how this modern actress got into a creaking silent film? She was only a year and a year ahead of her time. The story is not so interesting, it's the usual story of love that was found and lost. It's just Garbo's appearance as Leonora, a poor rural girl who feels well in the big city and then returns to get the man who escaped, giving him life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is usable, but his character is never really developed and he is humiliated by scenarios. At one point, he was made to wear Garb's clothes, left it in silence, and then shamefully returned and returned to them. And let's not even talk about his terrible final scenes with Garb and his wife. Too plain, he did not have much career after this and I can understand why. But he is sufficient as a slightly mystifying object of Leonora's obsession. In this movie there is an absolutely fantastic line that only speaks everything. "Leonora, you're becoming noticeable." Yes, obviously. If you really want to know what is going on without seeing the whole movie, just watch for the last 30 seconds or so - Garb's look as if sitting in a luxury car says everything. "She must be so happy she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all. I have to see this again, Garbo is incredible.
