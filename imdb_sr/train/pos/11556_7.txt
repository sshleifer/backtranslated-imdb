Jack Lemmon and Valter Matthau started and ended their career together. Remember the worst of the elderly and the strangest couple who ever laughed, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollivood's favorite comedies over the last 100 years. Not as "rude" as Prior and Wilder, they were the classic comedy team that reflected the modern routine of the Mark brothers. Like physical comedy, as well as the mixture of chaos that Marks, Caplin and Keaton were so famous about. In a strange couple, Lemmon and Matthau play the complete contradictions that create chaos. Physical comedy is unique as Chaplin. The joke is usually opposed to sending a joke to another. It's not your typical movie, it's somehow a comedy with two old people who are opposed by two young teenagers in the best years. Chemistry between Lemon and Matthau is fun enough. Although this film is not for everyone, this is a great comedy.
