This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I watched everything happily one night on TV. For the first 5 minutes I thought it was film B, but after that I realized what an amazing product it was. I have suggested to some friends to see a movie, just to tell me it's a bad B movie. How wrong. Superficial criticism. <br /> <br /> I think the film is almost a product of genius! The famous director has done a great job here and it's a shame to say that he was out of the game all the time.
