Aion, who shouts about how this film was shitty or had no conspiracy, must have been looking for "Jean de Florrette". HELLO! this film is made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way or form. I would also like to remind those vintners that if you're going to get the shit out of this movie, it seems they miss the point. This film is obviously made for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor" which seems to me only a bunch of nonsense. The point is that everyone has the opinion and you should be a little more grateful that some humorous sense of humor may not be in accordance with your own, before you crack your mouth. Thank you
