I would love to make movies for children in this way; dark and deep. There was a character development (and Charlie is a symbol of a dynamic character), plot development, top animation, emotional involvement and a rational, relatable and consistent theme. If not for a handful of songs and dances, you would never think it was a movie for kids, and that's why I give him such a high rating. This film is a great movie, let alone a children's movie. What brings me to my second thing: this must be the darkest "kids" movie I've seen for a long time, it comes from a 22-year-old. I would be shocked to see any child under the age of eight years who is not completely terrified to a large extent in the second half, and some of the first half of the film, and it ends with one of the saddest ends you've ever encountered (ala "Jurassic Bark ", for those of you who are Futurame fans), and that's what makes this movie so good. Just because the film universally evokes emotions that we do not usually like to feel and assume are bad, does not make the film itself bad; in fact, it means that she succeeded. Good funny movies should make us laugh; good horror films should scare us; Good sad movies should make us sad. I mean, good movies should move, not only to entertain; This film kicked me. Also, this film is incredibly violent according to today's standards for children's film and contains a theme that according to today's standards may not be suitable for some children. Parents, I'd say you're looking at first. I usually do not say anything about these things, but yesterday I saw it and that was a surprise for me.
