This was 101. Eddie Robinson and his last film, and he died of cancer nine days after the recording was completed. All this makes his key scene in the movie even more painful. Although some of the styles of hair and clothes are somewhat obsolete (also keep in mind the video game shown in the movie), but the subject of the movie is quite timeless. Heston said he wanted to make a movie for a while, because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation. A few things make this movie a classic. The story is solid. The acting is top-notch, especially in the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with the nice performances of Coten and Peters. The music is absolutely perfect. . The blend of Betoven, Grig and Tchaikovsky in combination with pastoral visual elements make some truly moving scenes. This was a cream on a cake for a movie. The theme (or "point") of the movie is significant. Yes, it's a film about overpopulation, but on a more important note, there is a cautious story about what can go wrong with man's management of the Earth. In the subtext you found the real message of the movie. Pay attention to what Sol says about the "old days" of the past (which is our present moment), and remember that Thorn is incapable of understanding what Sol says. This film is one of my top sci-fi films of all time.
