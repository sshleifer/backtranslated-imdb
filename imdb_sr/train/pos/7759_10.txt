On the surface, "Vicious on the Vind" is a dark, splendid soap opera on the sexual dysfunction of the Texas oil family. But below it is a deep, social commentary on life from 1950. Director Douglas Sirk again achieved results with other universal fouls. Robert Stack fell in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's the best friend, Rock Hudson, loves her too. When Stack finds out that he is sterile and that Bacall ends in pregnancy, fireworks fly. And, too good Dorothy Malone won the Oscars for portraying Texas's greatest nymph, which Hudson dismissed. A good epic soap opera.
