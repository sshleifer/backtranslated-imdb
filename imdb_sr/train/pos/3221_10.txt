In the film, several references were made to the subtle Blade Runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact that Kain 607 and its unit are all genetic constructs that are grown as consumable warriors. But as my favorite quote from the film, "you should have made them smart and fast." Kurt Russell made an incredible job, his face expression or lack of movies gave him more about the story than the rest of the actors in the combination. Even when he falls in love with Sandra, but he does not know how to deal with those emotions, and with his tears after being thrown out of the group, or by his trembling when he hugs, and his attachment to a silent young man who in many cases makes the way Todd reminded himself of what he could be, if not for his choice to be a soldier.
