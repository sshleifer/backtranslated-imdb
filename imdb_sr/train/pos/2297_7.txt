There is something in every movie "Hammer" that I see that really leads me to a new world of imagination. In the world of "Hammer" films, everything can happen. The "Shore Guard" is one of those types of films. Experiencing deep into occult and hypnosis to bring about a different kind of horror fantasy. All in all, an unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
