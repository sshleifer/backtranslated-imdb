Paris, t'aime (2006) is a film composed of 18 segments. You can perform math - 18 segments in 120 minutes, which means that each director has seven minutes to tell her story. The film is based on the premise that you can really tell the story in that short time. Space works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete, and satisfactory. Each of them represents a different aspect of Parisian experience, and almost every director draws outstanding performances from the actors of large and almost large actors. There have been so many powerful views in this movie that it's hard to choose one or two favorites. Probably the most impressive for me were Juliette Binoche as a drowsy mother in the Place des Victoires segment, Gena Rovlands as aging in "Quartier Latin", Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in the "Loin du 16eme" segment and Margo Martindale as the carrier of postal services in Colorado who learned to speak French to be able to visit Paris ("14eme Arrondissement" segment). Particularly worth mentioning is Gulliver Heck, probably the strangest boy who has ever harassed an American tourist at the Paris Metro Station (segment "Tuileries"). This is an extraordinary movie. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months to catch some of the subtle points that we missed. However, Paris was so beautifully photographed to suggest that you try to see it on the big screen. In any case, do not miss it!
