I saw this film about a year ago and I found it funny. A true winner, in my mind. She had an accentuated stupid comedy, but she really had a real conspiracy. Like hit comedy, Elf, in fact. He had several serious moments, merged between joy. When Stiller shot at Black's horse, usually a sober moment, you found yourself laughing at his stupid nonsense. You can find a common language there, because I am sure that many people have done something that they would not want a friend to know about, that your friendship does not end. When I learned how many people did not like this movie, I was totally stunned. That absolutely terrible movies like Napoleon Dynamites had a rating higher than making me wonder about the common sense of people on the IMDb. Get my advice and rent it. If you do not laugh at least once, I will compensate you for the rent. = D
