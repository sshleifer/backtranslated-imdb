I thought this film was excellent, due to the fact that Corrine and Sean are newcomers in the business. She was full of action and a little romance, but there were some points when Corrine did not speak very clearly (when she pretended to Sean and she squeezed her teeth ... maybe she should have? I think that the roles of Joseph and Sonny were showing very well, and I'm sure that because I watched the next action star, I'm sure that Corrine and Sean did his own acrobatics, which were doing very well. I'm looking forward to another movie by the couple, because they make a great team, or maybe I'll continue to bet your life may have been called "a person." It's a great big apple '.', this time it might be about Carmen .. But your life is EXCELLENT!
