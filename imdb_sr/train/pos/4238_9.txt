On the surface, this is a supernatural post-war romantic comedy. Below the veneers, this is the MGM actor who plays the actor in the most amusing way. The guides are clear, but all the seconds are thrown a lot against the type. Margaret Hamilton (known as Vicked Vitch of West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive compulsive budget) and Sig Ruman (Brothers Mark Brothers) in _Night In Casablanca_ and always-lovely_Night At The Opera_, playing well-intentioned gangs trying to lead these two traces, instead of separating them as their "usual" characters would do. It also has fun on many romantic comedies, which is another indication that it could. Do not deal with such a "straight" romantic comedy, how wrong it is to send many post-war romantic comedies and their two-dimensional characters. I saw it only once, with interruptions, so I can not be positive, but this movie can be one of those who worked better in the context of the time it's made, but it's less successful now when viewers "see" these secondary characters through a completely different lens. I guess that's the case when I gave him 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.
