I'm totally dependent on this show. I can not wait for Sunday to see the next show. It's a great story and has the best actors and actors in the show. I'll set up every week to watch it even if I'm not home I always have my vcr set on the tape monarch bay. simon rider is the best actor in the show. She is tense and exciting. I think this show should remain in the air and I believe that everyone should be set to watch it. I saw the first episode and I did not actually go to watch it, but one day I watched my life and I decided to watch it because it was on and I absolutely love it and now it's my favorite show. I really mean that.
