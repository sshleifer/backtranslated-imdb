I'm pretty pedestrian with a little taste. However, from time to time I try to raise the limit of my cultural awareness. This film was one of my attempts. I was in awe during the whole movie. I liked it so much that I got my tape so I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie. I looked like a big question to the viewer: What is the depth of the victim for the duty he can accept, can be asked to accept, should he accept? As a military member, this is, of course, an important issue for me. This question is very difficult for the viewer of this film. Recommended.
