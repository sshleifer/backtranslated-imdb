It's hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. I do not think a beautiful cinema. This film was not too awesome, but it was not much better than the average. The main story dealing with very immoral teens was to focus more on the forbidden romance and why it ... should have been drawn into it instead of being groundbreaked basically "because mum says we can not." Some parts should be completely discharged or processed to have greater relevance in relation to the two main characters. On several occasions I wondered if the writer / director is a fan of classical American graphite George Lucas. It's not that it's wrong to be a fan of this movie, but to make your movie look like this sometimes, I mean it! The worst part of this was that Madchen Amick had such a small part, I mean the double! She was the only, in one or two lines, which she actually tried with the southern accent. (Take good listening, it was there even though her character was from California! DOH !!) Perhaps, if they were a star, the others could follow, and we would have a more authentic film. Well, what can you do when you have a director who is just a director and not an artist. A pity. All in all, I give this B- and it's a little generous, because I'm biased towards Mrs. Amick.
