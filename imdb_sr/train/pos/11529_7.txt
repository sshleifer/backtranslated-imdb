As a biographical film, "The Lady with Red Hair" (a story about how director Belasco transformed the notorious divorcee of Madame Leslie Carter into the international actor's star) is certainly not in league with those other Varner biographies similar to the vintage, "Iankee Doodle Dandi "(which is?), But" Ladi "is a pleasure in his movie - and he shares a lot of features with the Cagnei classic. As "Iankee Doodle Dandi", "Lady with red hair" overflows with old-fashioned shov-business taste. (Among other things, both films feature delicious theater sequences, as well as inevitable scenes set behind the scenes and theater managers. Also, in "Lada" as well as in Cohan's biography, auxiliary acting is made by well-known and beloved actors of character from that period, that's the ultimate job we remember. I should add that, again as "Iankee Doodle Dandi", "A lady with red hair" does not allow the truth to bother to tell a good story? But, like "Dandy", "Lada" thrives - magnificently! - to transfer the essence of the personality of the great hero of the show business. Everyone knows that Cagnei has shut down Cohan for all time in his brilliant and gentle portrayal of "Iankee Doodle Dandi" - but few viewers realize that Claude Rains did a similar service to David Belasco in "The Ladi Vith Red Hair" - and he did it Rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures the galvanic personality of the legendary shaman in all its magnificent glory. The rain gives a terribly pleasant, top-notch and incredibly true performance, as one at Broadway once called the "Wizard". Watching Claude Rains in action (looking at each frame as if he was having a good time!) In "The Ladi vith Red Hair" is to see David Belasco jumping into life on the movie as if he can not wait to shake things up again on the main tree. <br /> <br />
