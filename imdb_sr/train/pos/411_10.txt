This film is well made on so many levels that I'm awe-inspiring that the result is as low as this one (5.9 / 10 (576 votes)). This film has incredible special effects, a true epic story, a complex interaction of great character and an incredible battle - they must be seen to be believed! The only complaint I have is the subtitles on the HK DVD version I got (some lines have not been translated). I just do not understand when I read and hear from different sources: "it has a confusing action ....", "I could not follow the story ...." or "The characters came from nowhere ...". From the first time I watched this movie, I realized it, followed it, knew why there were characters, and I absolutely loved it! I've already seen him 8 times and every time it is a pure enjoyment. Oh, and this is not just my opinion, because I've shown this film to many Americans (people who have never seen HK movie before) who feel the same way. None of them managed to follow the story and each person expressed their love for this film. Oh, man, why can not we have this kind of stuff coming from Hollywood? At least Lord of the Rings had a beautiful marriage with special effects, character development and a story. This does not come from a novice from Asia. I have a large library of Asian films and I have to say that this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. When you watch it, you will be amazed by the incredible special effects and the epic impression of this film. You will enter this world of imagination and you will not want to leave! I also saw the 1983 and 2001 versions (both were done by Tsui Hark), and in 2001 it was much better compared to the IMO. Apart from the subtitles, I have another complaint to this film: I did not want to end .... I beg you, Mr. Hark - can we have a sequel?
