ONLY CAUSE is a wrong but decent movie that is held together with powerful performances and some creative (though extremely predictable) writing. Sean Conneri is a cruiser against the death penalty, brought to save apparently innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) from the final sentence. To make things right, Koneri goes to the crime scene, where he has to fight not only with time, but also with the sheriff who is mixing (Laurence Fishbourne). Reversals and reversals and reversals of roles are abundant - some surprising, and some do not - as the older cruiser is trying to discover the mystery. The climatic end is a bit ridiculous, but ONE CAUSE is worth a look at a slower night.
