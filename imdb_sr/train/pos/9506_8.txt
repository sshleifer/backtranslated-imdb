A sober, reflexive piece, a small miniature that flashes in a magnificent human picture sequence that surpasses a mere dramatization for the screen. This quiet little story will delight you - if you do not have too many problems with various Spanish accents, from Mexican to Peruvian, and more authentic use of the Iberian peninsula Marise Paredes! Garciadiego achieved a perfect adaptation from the novel: even the great maestro Garcia Markuez should be proud of his extraordinary work. And hats to Arthur Ripstein who so skillfully brought together all the effort into a gem, ruby ​​and so sophisticated, so elegant, so sensitive, so touching ... El Coronel - Fernando Lujan - waiting to get his retirement while he continues to live in his modest tree that is deep in the Colombian jungle (however, shot somewhere else, not in Colombia) with his fighting penis and his wife (in that order?). And that is all. But, oh, much more .... This movie is a rhapsody. I need to see this poetic piece again again. as soon as possible. It's a high side of 8 out of 10, which is very high at my level. This is not an easy commercial Hollywood thing.
