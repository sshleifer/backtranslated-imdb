This film was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I did not see any comedy in the film, but it's still pretty good. It's similar to Anchorman in the humor, but I think this is a better shot movie. It actually has a point. If you see the whole crowd of T & A, you will be disappointed. Just a well-made movie !!!! If you do not have anything to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will see that this is a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert's and Roeper's review of this film is correct. I mean, I do not like Ebert on most of the movies, but this is a movie I'll agree on. The film contains a good enough story that it's really convincing that these types of people are there. You can definitely say something about treating innocence in this movie. Yes, of course, you laugh when she finds out about it, but she still suggests that you are waiting. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person he worked with in this movie, yet it's still funny.
