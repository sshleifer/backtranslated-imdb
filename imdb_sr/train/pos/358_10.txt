The color Purple is about life's struggles and love that helps those who are strongly affected by life struggles. Each character had a violet color in it. The film touches on love, lost, hope, hatred and triumph. regardless of whether Celie had lived through hell and lost her sister, and Shug came to her life to show her love again, Albert was not the man who corrected his mistake against Celie, Shug was thrown out by her father and eventually confessed to him, Sofia and her stubbornness, good and bad, and even Nettie, had their emptiness and difficulties through the film, but ultimately dominated, and this was a sign of a good movie. Good job for all actors and team.
