Master of Film Cecil B. De Mille goes west. Using three legends of the old West as their protagonists (probably never met), Gary Cooper shows the Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill, and Jean Arthur makes a beautiful Kalamiti Jane. The story serves only for De Mille to hang some wonderful action sequences, such as the Great Indian attack. Such scenes are extremely well made. If you do not mind a bit over-performance of the actors, this is very fun with the west. Look at the very young Anthony Quinn who describes the role of a brave Indian who took part in the Big Big Horn fight. At least this part of him was noticed in Hollivood.
