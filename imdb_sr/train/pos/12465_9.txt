I certainly recommend reading a book before watching a movie. This book won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and is a very extensive reading (it is not intended to be used). It's not too hard to read for those who often do not read, so do not be scared! It seems that the book captures the passion of relationships more than film and the movie will make more sense after reading the book. I grew up in Melbourne and I could really treat this book and film. Very few Australian writers were around the 1970s, and very little was documented about the way women lived in a city in Australia during this era or class. It's a precious part of the history of Melbourne. It's a shame that it's documented as a kind of soft porn movie. It's far from that and as the other reviewer mentioned, please, do not read the DVD jacket, it does not represent what it is all about. Those who hire a movie based on this description will only be disappointed. Just remember that this film was made in 1982, so do not expect the Hollywood dramatization incorporated these days. That's what I like about it. It's also great to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she is fantastic as Nora and it's great to watch her play, because if you're close to my age, you'll remember her best because of her staying at Plaischool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew she hid that talent? This movie will give you a whole new impression of her. A classic Australian story!
