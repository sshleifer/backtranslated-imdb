I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (is this exactly written?) In Cibile. I did not see her for a while and forgot how much she was missing. I thought she did a great job in this. The support was also pretty good. In some angles, her daughter even looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The kidnapper was pretty dreadful and the story mostly had some good cues. The young boy was hottie. I thought that my husband definitely had something to do with it. I just got a Lifetime Movie Net for Christmas and I love these movies. I kept my interest and I will look at it again when it is restarted. Can anyone else recommend similar movies to this? You can post on the board or send me a private email if you want. Thanks in advance. Aboutagirli.
