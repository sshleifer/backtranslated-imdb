The presentation of Lily Mars is one of the genres of the film that unfortunately seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Okay now, when you know my bias, here are some reasons why this film stands out. 1. Although the main action - Lily Mars (Judi Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin) is a fairly Hollywood story about that period, the writers change her theme a little more than usual. Although Lily gets a big break when the star abandons, she is not successful and has to swallow her pride and return to playing a less important role in the show. 2. Jude Garland (enough to say!) 3. Supporting composition includes some really great performances. Spring of Biington as Lil's mother is really wonderful, as well as Fai Bainter (mother of the director - John Thornvai (Van Heflin)). Outstanding accompanying performance, however, goes to actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, an actress who once became an actress in the theater. It is surely worth the watch. One of those films designed to make you feel better in the world and dreams.
