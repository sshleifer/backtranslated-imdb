Barbara Stanvick gives this early Douglas Sirk a focused, Universal-made soap just the shot he needs. Not as easily memorable as Sirk's later melodramas, it is easy to see by looking at "All I Want" where Sirk would be artistic guitar in the next few years. Stanvick is a dancer who returns to her family in Smalltown, USA, after she left them a decade earlier. Her family and community have different emotions in solving her shocking return. Some of the cinemas are amazing, and Stanvick is tough and nail and really gives this movie a snapshot of energy. All in all, pretty good performance.
