This movie impressed me as a project that had lots of real ingredients, but somewhere along the way they did not quite get together. I do not know who did it, but there's a little Disney. While his parts are incredible (as when pre-teenagers are running for public office) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normality (whatever it may be) to keep things in balance and perspective. The acting is fine. Strange, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a little ... off. It's interesting to see how she must work hard to keep her balance between her best friend, her grandmother and her two passions: ballet and baseball. I was like a baseball player, it was pretty painful to watch Frankie trying to stick to the boy's team, but it works well to show the fighting she is facing. I read somewhere that she was not actually a ballerina, but the editing in this film did a very good job that her dance looks not only natural but also beautiful. All in all, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but his star Mischa Barton did not quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in "Lavn Dogs", "Lost and Delirious", and her small but shocking show Haley Joel Osment in "The 6th Sense."
