This is one of the better classic Edgar Vallace's films from the German series - contains all the basics for a very pleased Vallace's 60s crime: Although he misses the majesty, Mr. Kinski, you still have a young Joachim Blackie 'Fuchsberger, re-starring in the usual smart American' you have a young Eddie Arendt in his best (and also typical) role ever - a cool, sophisticated British butler - and you have (not so younger) Lovitz as melancholy but very "dry" ironic (and therefore: very funny ) a police investigator. In addition, you will be offered a weird and very camping "evil person" behind the frog mask (hence the title of the movie!), You will get a crazy soundtrack, the classic action scenes of b-movie, partially taken from the craziest perspective (rely on time her creation!), yelling to scream the queen, both on and on ... All these ingredients shook well in the sweet tasty cocktail of the pure German camp Edgar Vallace - very recommended !!
