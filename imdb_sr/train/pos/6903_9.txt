This movie is one of my favorites. I can watch it over and over again. Dreifus and Braga are masterful, but Raul Julia steals the show! Gomez Addams, with an abusive humorous tongue, with the right tone for this unscrupulous bite of this often-told story. Generally untidy and unrecognizable, Moon Over Parador allows you to check out the reality and join the party that happens on the screen. Two thumbs up!
