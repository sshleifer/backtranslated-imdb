Butch peacemaker? Obvious. After a violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry waver at each other, Butch interrupts and wants to know why. That's a good question. "Cats can agree with dogs, right?" asks Tom, who nods in a sign of agreement. "Mice agree with cats, right?" Jerry nodded "no" and then he sees that this is not the right answer. They enter in and Butch makes a "Peace Contract" (complete with professional artwork!). Most of the rest, and most cartoon films, are three that are extremely kind to each other. What a refreshing change in tempo. It was fun to watch. I can make a million of these cartoons in which each one flees from one another over the head. In any case, you knew that peace would not last. A large piece of steak marks the death of a "peace deal," but the journey was a good change and still had some of Tom & Jerry's common humor.
