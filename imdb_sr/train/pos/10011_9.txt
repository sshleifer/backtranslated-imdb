I really enjoyed the Night Listener. It's one of the better movies of the summer. Robin Villiams gives one of her best performances. In fact, the whole acting was very good. Everyone played the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is as good as a mom, and never crosses over the top. Everyone is very convincing. It's a short film, a little less than an hour and a half. I noticed that the general version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the disturbing images are cut out of the film. The director told the story and did it in a clear way, which is a refreshing change from the many directors of these days who seem to think the job is to impress the audience instead of telling the story and telling it well. Do not be naivani by review and ad. It's not a Hitchcock thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story. If you go to expect Hitchcock, you will be disappointed. The only objection to the film was the end. The director could have left a little more on the imagination of the audience, but this is a little bit.
