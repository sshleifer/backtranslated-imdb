Only when I saw Napoleon Dynamites, I remembered I saw Torba Cracker. Just a wonderful feeling, and yet it never bends to be full. There is some great cinema and the leading girl is pretty brilliant. She catches more than the nostalgia of that time. He has a real heart. Achilles' early childhood is remarkable and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendin Iin has a great future, and for me, I am looking for his next project. Tracking is always the hardest thing. It's like the second blues album for most people. I just hope his next film is not as crazy as a shark movie. Cheers to everyone. Enjoy the cinema.
