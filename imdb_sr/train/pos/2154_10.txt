I've seen this movie many times and I will never get tired of it. It's a classic in every sense of the word. The film is hysterically funny, but at the same time very touching. For those who are not fans of "subtitles" or a foreign movie in general, open your mind. This is a great movie for "beginners" because the story is so funny. Do not misunderstand me, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what makes it work), but everyone will get something from it (even if it's just a big laugh to one of the main characters called Aoki - one of the funniest characters that I've ever seen it!) I can not even imagine this film without a smile! I love it ... and I think most people will.
