Wow! I've seen so many bad budget films lately, but this one is great. A very realistic view of police life in the city on the eastern German coast is a strong contrast to other films or crime series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any cliche about the police. This film is realistic as documentation and at the same time fun as a drama. Perfect compromise!
