Watching David & Bathsheba is a much better way to get your Bible lesson going to a Sunday school. Despite the scenario that is sometimes inadvertently ridiculous, the film is very fun. The studio system had its own mistakes, but it did not save the cost when a lavish production was required. Peck depicts King David as a lustful but tortured poet who does what equals to Bathsheb's sexy bed in the bed, Susan Haivard. Raimond Massei as a prophet Nathan delivers his usual saturn and wild performance. Look for the silent movie star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Time for Old Testament and Hollywood.
