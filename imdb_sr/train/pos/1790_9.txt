I love this film and this is a wonderful example of family vulnerability, romantic love stories and very sad stories. Everything was so perfect and great in this movie. It was a great mix of actors and actors, and with some laughter and screaming, this movie deserves many awards. With the mention of a beautiful scenario, and although I would link this film with Notebook and Family Stone, it was much more cunning, sad and brilliant than those films. The evening speaks of a love story between an old woman who dreams about young years, and her two daughters stay with her until she is well. The story that dates back is so powerful and beautiful that I was sitting on the edge of my seat. You really meet all the characters, and I wanted to watch it again by the end. This is a stunningly sad and vivid movie that is truly unique and should be seen by everyone as it is truly wonderful. All the performances are amazing, and the movie attracts your attention from the very beginning and never let go. I loved it and I'm so glad I watched it really a stunning movie ...
