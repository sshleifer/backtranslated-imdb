Offside is a story about teenagers who tried to sneak into the stadium to watch the final match in the World Cup qualifiers in Tehran that could lead Iran to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Women are prohibited from going to the stadium by law in Iran, although many of them are dressed as boys and poured. Stadium guards search everyone at the entrance to make sure that no one is carrying fireworks and of course; No girl comes in. Like most Panahi's work, his acting performance was excellent. You actually think you're watching a documentary. The dialogue between girls and orders was made delicately and astoundingly. The film shows the interactions between prisoners and drawn guards who themselves serve mandartory away from their family and friends in a funny way. In the end, the audience realizes that there is no such difference between girls and guards who just followed the orders.
