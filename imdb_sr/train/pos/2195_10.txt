I liked it! Fred MacMurrai is as beautiful as Skid Johnson, a somewhat imaginary, proud but at the same time a very vulnerable saxophonist who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always there for him. They meet in Panama after Maggie leaves the ship and ends up at the bar with Anthony Quinn. Toni struck her nose after Maggie insulted her thinking she was a loose woman - all because she took her hat off the public. Big fights and Maggie ends in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are great together. Maggie is always there for him whenever she needs it. She calls him to go to New York where (watch the movie well and find out). They have these beautiful scenes together where she sings in his hands while playing the saxophone. I certainly recommend it.
