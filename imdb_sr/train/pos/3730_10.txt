If you want to watch a movie and feel good when you watch it, then the Tigerland movie is for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. Perfect scenes of this movie look so real; It's almost like a documentary about something that happened in real life, but with drama. Man, I tell you ... REAL drama they really "fought" in one of the scenes (take the DVD to listen to a comment that is not obvious). I see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape the evil fate, after seeing how to save soldiers Ryan I have an insight into what is "an unfortunate fate" and I know exactly how the men in the film feel. I see this film as a cross between "Stand Bi Me" and "Saving Private Rian". What do men do when they are in a situation that is "hard pressed" in real life? Some men are crazy, some people are crying, some men are fists, others are drugged, some sleep foolishly with whores recklessly trying to use the meaning of love from their lives, some try to drink, some jumps from buildings or bridges, some feel guilty, and others feel so much agony that it hurts so much that they collapse - physically. This film has all these desperate emotions in one ball. But do not misunderstand me in his awkward film, his realistic film, the very humorous film, the confident and entertaining Bozza (Collin's character) all that inflamed, and besides, there are about 5 female actors in the film. ; I'll let you understand what's inside them! With dialogue, war / action sequences, perfect pictures with appropriate music; this movie has everything, as I said: from top to bottom. I do not know why Tigerland is hardly underestimated. The best thing about owning a movie is to write on the cover page in capital letters "The Best Movie of the Year", and it absolutely does not fall any less than that. Keep the rare gems that come Hollivood, 10/10.
