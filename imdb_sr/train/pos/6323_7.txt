"Velcome to Collingwood" offers some of the happiest dialogs in recent memory. Watching this comedy directed by Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of perhaps another movie we saw in the past, but since we missed introductory credits, we had to wait until the end to discover that what we recall was 1958 Italian the film "Big Deal on Madonna Street", directed by Maria Monicelli. Russo's brothers made up a magnificent role to show all the characters in the film. Anything with Villiam H. Mathias, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, can not be bad in him. Since this is an ensemble, all the characters get the chance to shine. The film presents us with a group of meaningless, secure crackers from hell. No one could have thought that these people could carry a job like the one they took over. All that could go wrong, and much more, is what they did in that. George Cluni appears as the master of a safe cracker, also seen as a rabbi, but confused by priests from gang members coming out of Cosim's funeral. The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit and relax and let all those little thieves do their things. Let their funny lines smile, because everyone can see that this group is doomed to ruin from beginning to end!
