As an old rocker, this film mentions Heep and Kuo - my 2 favorite band ever - but with incredible acting (all) - and a fantastic story - I just love this piece of creative genius. I can not recommend it anymore - and Mick Jones has added so much (a stranger and main songwriter along with the biggest rock singer ever - Lou Gramm) - I've been watching this great work more than 10 times - Bill Nighi - what kind of voice - and Jimmi Nail - talent comes out of every pore - then Astrid .... and Karen ... what more can a rocker aging look like !! 10/10 - bloody brilliant.
