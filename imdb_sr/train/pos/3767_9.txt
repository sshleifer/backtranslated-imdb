Go back to the tenth page of this section, and make your way back. Come on; I'll wait. Done? Well, then you probably noticed the same trend as I did. You could read all day long about poor jokes, dated timing and apparently derived points points and sweets in "Bogus," but this movie seems to be one of those who now "hates me, they love me later." The biggest problem for Bill and Ted was that the original turned to the children of the 80s who followed the tendencies and they thought they were at the height of fashion. It worked well for the original, but apparently it was bombarded in 1991, when no complacent lenar would be caught dead by wearing anything but a flannel or admitting that he liked something in the 80's. Like Ted would say, "Man, this is a totally deep hole. Will you play 20 questions?" They say that nostalgia is going in twenty-year cycles, and that certainly seems to be here. Here in 2010, started are used by those who grew up with Cindy Lauper and Megadeth to look back and appreciate some of those key films that did or did not do what we are. If you are one of those who look at "Bogus" as if it were outdated ("Fa gs!") ripoff, then you missed the point and you probably spent six years in the growth of hair on your face, wearing flannel and getting out but as if you were just crawling out of bed. In his own comparison of his origins (the Star Trek episode) and a trip with a telephone booth, B & T is not trying to hide the love of his creators for honoring. Quentin Tarantino, anyone "I do not say" Bogus "is" Real Love ", but I think it should be appreciated because it is: fun recording of our society at a time before the psychology of children, Ritalin, anti-smoking advertisements, terrorist paranoia and the spread of media fear. So, for all of you who hated B & T ... turn off the CD "Screaming Trees", take that hair out of your face, go to the beach and light up. Narcissistic depression and intellectual horror are corporate.
