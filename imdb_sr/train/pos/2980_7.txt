This movie is funny. foolish, but funny. to fully enjoy this movie you can not have the perception of how the movie goes like this, and just enjoy all the jokes and games that are included in the movie. I still find that the bit is initially ridiculous when it says "I want a beer ........ penis". Funny things. but what makes the film a decent thing is that it does not make it hard to create a serious spin on the movie, too much comedy tries to have serious aspects that you simply do not trust. But this is different and only focuses on being ridiculous. I must say, however, that Iasmin bleeth is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the 3 main guy, the cage, the rhetoric and the scout are very funny for watching and shooting a movie great for watching
