I first entered this film almost five years ago. Then, the ideas presented in the film looked mostly fictitious, if they could even appear. Not anymore. Now, politics, society and the media in the running man seems to be really close to home. Take into account the following factors, which were largely absent in 1987 (when the Runner came out) who are present today: Concern, as Damon Killian says , the figure of Richard Davison, "traditional morality". CHECKTERS Fun in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort among competitors. CHECK Cams everywhere. Limited travel for citizens according to government's desire, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with bar-coded passports ("travel passes" in the film) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. CHECK UP Increased mixing, borders with incestuous, government, and media. CHECK ITS Computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real movie footage (such as the "digital maturing" of Ben Richards's image on a duel of a stuntman). CHECKING Closure of conscientious objectors or critics of the current administration. CHECKING The labeling of the economy further extends the gap between rich and not so rich; an increasing number of marginalized groups responding to the tightening of the loose big government; civil unrests that are drunk beneath or on the surface of almost every major public event, regardless of its origin or intent. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK Then again, maybe it's just a film based on Stephen King's novel. But just to be sure, I'm moving to Switzerland.
