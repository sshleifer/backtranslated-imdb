If it's the action and adventure you want in a movie, it's best to look around somewhere else. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie for that mood, look at "Straight Story". Richard Farnsvorth sets out outstanding performance as gentle and Mr. Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's trip to a lawnmower in three states to see his alienated brother who had a stroke. the wrong way, creating friends of strangers and discharging many tips on the family on the go. The story is moving as slowly as the lawnmower, but somehow it succeeds the viewer to watch, waiting for the next life lesson that Alvin will offer. This is the only way to watch this very good movie, which is rated 7/10 in my book.
