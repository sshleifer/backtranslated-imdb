Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and handsome wanderer who comes to the bar on the road. She met a young, beautiful and dissatisfied wife, Giovanna Bragano (Clara Calamai), and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragan (Juan de Landa), a bar owner. He performs his mechanical skills in food and lodging, and he has an affair with Giovanni. They both choose to kill Giuseppe, falsifying a car accident. Their relationship affects the sense of guilt and investigation of the police. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. Noir and the neo-realistic film Luchin Visconti is remarkable. This is the first time I watch this version 'The poster always rings twice'. I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner, and the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange had one of the hottest sex scenes in the history of the film, but this is definitely the best. My voice is ten.
