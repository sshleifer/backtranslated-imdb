The king of lions 1 1/2 is a very sweet story that goes with the King of the Lions. He basically follows the original story of the Lion King, but with a few turns. In the film, the openings are explained by the views of different characters. This story is still an original action. As for the sequels, Disney is not so good at making worthwhile things. This, as the third part for the King of the Lions (Simbina Ponos is the second.) Actually has an original idea for her while still involving the party of the first. Timon and Pumbaa travel together looking for an ideal place to live. After searching far and wide, they found the place "Hakuna Matata". Then they meet a little lion called Simba and go through many of the things that parents are passing through today. I think this is a very good movie and I'm glad to add it to my collection.
