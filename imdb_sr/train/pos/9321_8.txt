As a romantic comedy, this was sweet and victorious. I thought writing could have been stronger in order to build the final link somewhat better, but it's not a huge point of trigger. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Volf give good performances and are as charming as they always are. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was just glad to see them as romantic tracks. I hope to see them soon in several projects. All in all, this film will not change your life, but it's cute, warm and victorious. It's not a bad thing for everyone.
