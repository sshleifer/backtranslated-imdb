I'm a fan of kung fu, but not a Voo fan. I'm not interested in gangster movies filled with top-waves. Now, martial arts; *that's wonderful! And John Voo surprised me here, producing a very fun kung-fu movie, which is almost too much to fight if such a thing is possible! These are good things. Many fighting scenes are very good (some of them are less good), and the main characters are fun and cute. The bad guys are a bit incredibly evil, but still fun. You have to see the Sleeping Wizard !! It can only fight when it's asleep - hysterically! After repeated reviews, however, Last Hurrai For Chivalri may have a tendency to become a bit boring and time-consuming, especially since many combat scenes are actually not so good. So, I estimate that "only" 7 out of 10. But that's really almost "8". All in all, one of the better kung fu movies, is made in the heart of kung fu cinema. All really good kung fu films are from the middle to the late 70's, with some exceptional exceptions from the late 60's and early 70's (and early 80's, to be fair).
