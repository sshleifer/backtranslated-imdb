Philip is concerned (Leslie Howard), he is a serious but disadvantaged student of medicine. He falls deadly in a soulless, raunchy waitress named Mildred (Bette Davis). In the meantime, he co-operates with other co-workers (Kai Johnson, Frances Dee), but she returns to a mutual destructive affair. Bette Davis as a cocky and cruel waitress who has won another magnificent interpretation with tempting and dashing performances, is absolutely hypnotic in her slavery report that takes place from start to finish. The dominant woman will repeat several times in the acting posterior. Leslie Howard as an essentially good and decent student subtly ruined gives an excellent and melancholy performance. They will both play again in the fied Petrified Forest (1936). The Atmospheric Film has been thoroughly reconstructed in the RKO (Radio Picture Inc) studio. Remade was made in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; In 1964, Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvei. The movie will love classic movie lovers. Score: Very good or a little out of date.
