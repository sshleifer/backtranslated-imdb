In my opinion, this is one of the best films ever made in America and earned every award he won and a place on the AFI Top 100 list (although he is shamefully too low on the IMDB Top 250 list, in only 183 of this letter). If you enjoy the greatest caliber of the game (Voight and Hoffman are a wonderful match), well-drawn features and inventive guidelines, editing and cinema, you'll love the same as I do. Schlesinger paints a picturesque, always credible picture of the scene in New York in the late 1960s and many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive among amoralism, poverty, and hopelessness on the 42nd Street in New York. The techniques for filming the films we use here brilliantly depict the sense of the underground New York film movement (and city) and are nothing less than a glittering. I have seen many ideas (including quick fixing, handling recorded voices, drug / travel sequences and the character of cartoons that appeared during the murder scene to convey fear and terror) that were stolen by other filmmakers. The relationship between Joe and Ratso takes place in such a way that it can be seen as an unusual strong friendship or with their homosexual foundations. I think the director has done this in a subtle way not to withdraw for the censorship of time, but to concentrate his energy on the importance of a strong human relationship in life, whether it is sexual or not. MIDNIGHT COVBOI is a brave, moving film of size, influence and importance that has lost absolutely nothing of its influence over the years, so if you did not see it, there really is a true American classic. I recommend this film to everyone. Result: 10 of 10.
