I remember that in 1965 I tripped on this special channel. I've never heard of Barbara before. When the concert was over, I thought, "This is probably the best thing on a television I'll ever see in my life." 42 years later, that's true. There is still nothing so astounding, so sincerely astounding as the talent shown here. You can talk about all the super-stars you want, this is the brightest of all of them! Comedy, Pathos, Sparrow Seduction, Ballads, Barbra is really a story. Her ability to pull everything she's trying is legendary. But this special was made at the beginning, and he helped create the legend that she quickly became. Despite being so much raised in such a short time, she fulfilled the promise, revealing more of her talents as she went along. But they're all here from the very beginning. You will not be disappointed when you look at it.
