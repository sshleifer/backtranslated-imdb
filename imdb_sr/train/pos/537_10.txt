For me, the question of life and death is exactly that - simply the best film ever made. From the beginning to the end, the class comes out of it. It is stimulating, provoking thought, a mirror in the postwar world, and relations between nations. The characters and the development of the plot are near perfection, and attention paid to detail promotes a thoroughly convincing fantasy. me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it seems to me, I think I'm crying. Today it's fresh as it was in 1946. If I'm allowed to keep one movie and watch it again, the question of life and death would be that movie.
