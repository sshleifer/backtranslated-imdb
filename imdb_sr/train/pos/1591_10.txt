My mom and I have recently become addicted to this show, laughing at our asses! I've only seen 10 episodes and I'm disappointed that I did not pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled! The story is very funny, the characters really have great personalities (or not so big, but they're still funny!). I TiVO every episode of Vhat I Like About Iou. Amanda Bines and Jennie Garth, like all actors, never leave me bored as I watch! There is some inappropriate language for children and some sexual content, but with a parent guide close, you should not have too many problems. There is some sort of 'Friends' relationship that attracts me to this show. I really enjoy it.
