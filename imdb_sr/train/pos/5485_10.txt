One of the best and most interesting documentaries, you will ever watch. Although the story unfolds in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it provides an intimate look at the political dynamics that prevail in the western hemisphere. While essentially another chapter in the story of the "US coup, supported in the United States," this movie is a real-time chronicle, what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, political bravery and courage! The political insights offered by this film are invaluable. Clear examples of private media are being received, as a huge force for massive fraud and propaganda. We see the poor people of Caracas struggling with the brutal realities of "American politics". A man gets a clear sense of coming downfall if people fail to deal with the apparent tyranny, which is suddenly, and illegally, punched by the conspirator. We also see arrogance and fascism, the support of the CIA, private media, plutocrats and generals, who have come to terms with returning to Venezuela under the dominance of Washington. Although under the leadership of President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcefully kidnapped by the general of the exiles. Their answer is the peak of the film. If you are looking for an excellent portrait of what the US government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela are all about, this film is it!
