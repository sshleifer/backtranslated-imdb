Christmas gathering actually came before my time, but I grew up on John Denver, and songs from this specialty were always my family Christmas music. For years, we had a crackling tape made from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I finally managed to find a video on Ebaiu, so after listening to music for about 21 years, I saw John and Muppets in action for themselves. If you ever get a chance, it's fun - great music, heart and warmth. It's also interesting to see the 70th version of Muppet and compare them with their latest versions today. I believe that Denver really took a little bit of heat for a performance like this - the performers do not compromise their images by singing with the Muppet, but I'm glad he did it. Even if you can not track a video, a sound recording is worth it. There are some traditional favorites, but also some original Denver tunes.
