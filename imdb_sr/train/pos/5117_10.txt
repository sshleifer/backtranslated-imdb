Very few films had an impact on American culture the way Urban Covboi has. Thank God it was temporary. But UC is almost in-class as one of those moves that when you turn channels at 3:00 AM, you just can not take your eyes off ... my first three are Animal House and Valking Tall BTV, but it's beyond the essence. I recall that Urban Covboi hit theaters and that honkitonks were open at every corner, men were sporty cowboy hats with their pants, and if you did not know how to consider two steps as a social moire! Personally, I think it's a great movie. Travolta was really surprised at SatNiteFever's heels. Who would do that? And he's really convinced. Soundtrack is great. It's a pity that Charlene Tilton, from Dallas' fame on TV, destroyed Johnny Lee's career, this guy was great. The thief point here is Scott Glenn as a grease ek-con redneck cowboy. And I have nothing against the greeker ek-con cowboy I'm a half-being, but I always envy what I feel is the greatest power line of all time .... "Pack-at S * # t!" Something like Clint "makes my day". And seeing him as the sissi Sissi is the closest thing I'll take care of for my fantasy about Julia Roberts ... Like I said, beautiful. 9/10
