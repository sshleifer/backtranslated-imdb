Yes, Be My Love was an incredible Mario Lanza to fame and today is popular. His voice was strong and firm, so powerful that MGM decided to use it in the Great Carus. Sam Lanza thought this was the reincarnation of Carus. Reading Kostelanitza's book, written by the biography of Lanza, explains that regular practice and vocal lessons have become the visionary Caruso for Lanz. There is no doubt that Lanza did an excellent job in the story, but the story is not entirely accurate; blame Hollywood! I used to practice singing his songs, and I became pretty good until I lost my voice for emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Achieving High Note Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!
