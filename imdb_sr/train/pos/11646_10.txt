This film, although one of the most favorite topics of Mexican producers: extreme life in our cities, has a funny way to put it on the screen. Four of the most important Mexican directors, from the past, are approaching the history of our city framed in a variety of literary types such as Farce or Satire, which gives us a film with supervised in our country, but translated into a completely different a way that gives it a freshness. With actors who are little known, but this interprets the excellent way of their work, each director reflects in the stories of the capacity we have identified anywhere in the world, that the ability to laugh is painful and to celebrate sorrows. Perhaps many people in our country are not satisfied with the film, but I think people of other countries can find it attractive and share the Surrealism of the Mexican.
