We loved the movie. I'm the mother for two little men. I like to have a movie I can watch with them, where men have integrity and character. Move where money is not the most important thing. And the family is forever, and love means more than words. I wish we'd seen more of Davis's family. But because of everything I loved, she left me with the same feeling as the others "please do not be finished". We both want actors not to change. New actors were a good substitute. he asked me to buy them all. He is a film critic, so he says it tells me something. The family should see this move to buy for friends. Help restore time value. We'll read the books now when we're hooked. I really hope to see more. Be blessed with happy movements
