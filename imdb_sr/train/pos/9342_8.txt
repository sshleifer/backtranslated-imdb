Great movie. Hold on to the deadly capture when you let yourself get involved in the story. The successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), is torn apart in a life crisis of balancing his career with his family. He remembers his former columnist Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. He finds out that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the attack on America from 9-11, is no longer in contact with reality ... deciding to include his mind with his favorite music from the past and video games. Former roommates revive their friendship and strengthen their former ties. Johnson has his friend Angel Oakhurts, a psychiatrist, to try to bring Charlie out of his grief ... but Alan is the one who has gotten to get his friend out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's lawyer / guardian. Also in the acting team: Saffron Burrovs, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. An extraordinary music background featuring Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. NOTE: I've never been Sandler fan; but I found it remarkable in this role. In some scenes, I thought aloud ... why he was never called to play Bob Dylan's singer / songwriter in biography.
