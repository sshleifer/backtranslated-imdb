I loved that episode, but it seems to me that there should have been some quick reference to the fact that the secretary was punished because she was actually an accomplice after the fact. Although I like it when the Columba episode has an unpredictable craft like this one, its resolution should be part of the episode's conclusion, along with the discovery of the killer. The interaction of Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is invaluable. At one point, Gordon, playing the famous writer, gives some comments on how the famous Lieutenant Columbo lashed out, making allusion to language in the detective's real glory of life as a solution to the crime. This is one of the best many Columbo Wars.
