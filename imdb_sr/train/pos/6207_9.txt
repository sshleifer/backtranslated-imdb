I just watched this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley fans will not be disappointed !! And if you're not familiar with this director's opus ... it does not matter. This movie can definitely stand alone. I have to go to another projection ... it was incredible, I have to see her again - and quickly! This movie is very funny. His dialogue is very clever, and Parker Posey's performance is outstanding because he plays in the title role of Fai Grim. Fai Grim is the latest feature that returns to the world and characters featured in Henri Fool (2000). Visually, the most prominent stylistic feature uses the commonly used curved (or Dutch) angle, which can often be seen in Hartley's recent works that appear in various short films, available in Possible films: short works by the Hal Hartlei Collection 1994-2004. And in Girl from Monday (2005). I watched this movie most appropriate on September 11th. Textually, Fai Grim's adventure in this story turned against the changed world after September 11, 2001. Without entering into big spoilers, I see this business and the story-world as a brave political and original portrait of geopolitics that is rarely, if ever , in the foreground of the mainstream fictional cinema post-911 so far (cf. Sirianna: page notes - Mark Cuban Ekec. Prod in both these films ... the most interesting, at the very least). In the end, for those who are closely related to the characters of Henry Fool, Simon, Fai and Henry, this film is hilariously self-conscious and self-referential. In view of this, the character of Fai Grimm begins in the film, exactly where she was when Henri Fool finished, but until the end of the film ... Fai's knowledge and experience have completely changed and expanded during narration. What can be prepared for the future of Fai and Fool family ... ?? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
