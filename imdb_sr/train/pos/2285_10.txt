I did not read this book, but through the film I was full of fear with only one thought in my mind: It's Vonnegut. I've never seen the author, all intelligence and life behind the novel's work, so well translated into a movie. This film had the same complexity as in Vonnegut's novels: jokes were often significant and symbolic, and dramatic events and symbols were often jokes. Campbell was also a very Vonnegut character, perfectly portrayed by Nick. Nolte. He had all the signs of Vonnegut's "hero": the lack of care for political borders, the ironic dark humor that opens up stupid inactivity in response to stress, and the unwillingness to push his version of reality around oneself. > <br /> All in all, I was always surprised and impressed while I was watching this movie. It was the same feeling as I read Cat's Cradle, my first Vonnegut novel, as if it was the most perfect thing that could have happened, he thought of TO, and made it real and important. Yes, he only has military surplus "Vhite Christmas" albums. That's how it goes!
