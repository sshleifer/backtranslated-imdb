No garbage - there is no place near garbage. Is not the original? This is the last thing that can be said about "2.4 children." surely no! Although it was an unusual series for the BBC, it was funny, ridiculous and funny. I especially liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - which I believe have miraculously shaped. relatively young age. I wish they would make more of this kind of comedy, much more than them (and shown them here in Israel).
