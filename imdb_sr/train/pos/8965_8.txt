Made in the same year as Vertigo, this is an equally enchanting movie, though in a much easier way. It was set in a vicious New York city during the winter: Kim Novak is a witch who casts a spell on James Stewart, but is instead caught up in her. Interestingly, Novak's rival is Janice Rule, which was created as part of Madge in "Picnic" on Broadway (the part that Novak will celebrate on the movie).
