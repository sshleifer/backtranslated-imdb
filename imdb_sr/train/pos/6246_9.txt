It's not a brilliant idea to watch Hundstage if you're not 100% sure of your mental stability because it will be seriously tested with this movie no matter how healthy you are. I must say that Hundstage is an artistic film, not an entertaining film, so that most viewers would not have the level of "maturity" to reach its beautiful side. Something like Tarkov's films, but somehow different. Yes, yes, I can not say that I was having a great time watching him. But it is an extraordinary and very interesting experience for those who are just tormented by the cliche Hollivood offers. The Hundstage keeps your finger right in your brain and tears your mind more and more. You can not simply sit and watch it, but you'll use cries or watch across wide open eyes. A film that is similar to this style is Nachtgestalten, but it was much better and less violent. This, for example, is not for children or those who are mentally gentle or ill. Most viewers will most likely give either 10 or 1 to this movie. I'm giving him 9 because I saw the phenomenon of multiple stories in one movie in another movie and it was better. But this one is remarkable in itself. Worth to watch, but get ready to see something disturbing.
