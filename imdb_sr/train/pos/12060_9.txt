I really miss the production of good old fashioned Spooky movies. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory were assigned the task of producing such a film, perhaps this was, in addition to the lack of an internationally renowned, top actor. This is one of those movies you watch alone in a dark evening with pizza and some popcorn, and do not even cook dishes until morning, because you just want to hide under the covers. Bravo director Herbert Viseu, Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale writers, Jason Bunker's top production design, John Ralph and a great acting team that made me trembling and so isolated, although I live in one of the most populated cities in the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave her "9" from "10", because with the production and budget limitations of the television, they really got a great performance.
