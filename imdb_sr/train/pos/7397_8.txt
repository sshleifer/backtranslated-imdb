"Xizao" is a story about the conflict of modern life and ancient traditions and its impact on the family in China. Da Ming (Kuankiu Pu) is a businessman who returns home when a letter from his brother Er Ming (Vu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu) died. He reveals that his father is still alive, like his old neighborhood and old father, a public bath. The film revolves around the Da Ming family, and how he must learn the importance of his father's business, something he has always considered as an old tradition that soon had to die. Also, the film explores his relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally endangered, and the problems of the small community, and how the bath is a place that purifies not only their bodies, but also their souls. The two main themes of the film, the families and the problems of progress are incredibly well-processed, and the film never loses the point it is trying to make, both themes are very well developed and we gain insights into Chinese society and customs. The director, Iang Zhang, narrates his story in a simple way, allowing character figures to do their job. It's a very simple approach, but it fits perfectly into the movie, and I doubt that the other style would fit this movie. Jang has huge potential, as he can tell the story without the help of visual torches or tricks with the camera. The acting is remarkable in its naturalistic approach, everyone works in a very natural way and almost looks like they were filmed by real people. The three leading heroes give outstanding performance, and Vu Jiang, like Er Ming, surely steals the show. Even when the film could keep the patronage messages of "old days was much better", instead, a balance of mind is needed, such as saying that progress is good and that we have to move on, but we must not forget where we came from and maintain the balance between modern life and old traditions. Terrible, and touches the movie. 8/10
