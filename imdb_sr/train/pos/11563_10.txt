I've seen it many years after the television series and, at first, I did not care about it. Then, as my memory of the series receded over time, I watched again, and I found it absolutely ridiculous. Based on Neil Simone's play, it was not "open" to the big screen, which is one of its advantages. Valter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felic, and the auxiliary actors are lovely, especially John Fielder as 'Vinnie'. Even now, certain moments can lead me to the tears of laughter - Felic breaks Oscars in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request, Oscar shoots and fights Feliks around the apartment, giggling "Sisters of the Pigeons" brought by Felix's stories and of course the legendary scene of the cafeteria later stripped Nora Ephron, "When Harry met Salli"). And a sharp dialogue. When the guys think that Felic took overdoses, Oscar says: "They could be vitamins! He could be the healthiest in the room!" Fantastic!
