This film stands above and beyond most of the film's romantic comedies. It's virtually flawless! Writing, acting, production design, humor and patos are wonderful! Even music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is amazing and wonderful! Each character is distinctly beautiful and unforgettable, from guides played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to many supporting roles - - Olimpia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahonei, Danni Aiello - even a grandfather with her dog ! Each of these performers, plus Norman Jevison as the director, performs above his normal quality in this ensemble. For several actors, this was an early big exposure in the film, so casting is remarkable - and we have a lot of current actors who have changed their effectiveness in this film with their careers. I've seen this movie several times to the end - which sometimes can substantially fulfill the influence of the film. More precisely, a few years ago I realized that whenever I channeled my way into the scene from this movie - any scene - the scene was convincing and beautifully made. There are so many stunning and unforgettable scenes in the original encounter between the characters Cher and Nicolas Cage, where Cage tells his story of an accident; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his mistress in the opera, amidst the splendor created by his plumbing work at the gold mine; Olimpia Dukakis disgusted John Mahonei for his classmate in classical relationships with associates: "Do not eat where you eat!"; Danni Aiello in the bed of a dying mother; Nicolas Cage "takes" Cher as the thrill of the aria in the background! Of course, there are also many great romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both versions, but especially Audrey Hepburn / Humphrei Bogart / Villiam Holden original); When Harry met Salli; Apartment. No one is equal to Moonstruck!
