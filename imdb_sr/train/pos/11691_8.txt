A great movie when I saw him. I have to say one of my favorite films of all time. I saw him 8 times in the theater and got a DVD. As I grew up and saw again, I realized that the film was passable. Compared to movies that are famous for good comedies, this is nothing. I mean, Rock was hilarious in the film and the whole change with racial things breaks barriers that are great. Also, the idea of ​​how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking. It's like most thoughts about a movie, but also a little twist that is a very nice touch. I like the movie in general, so I give it ... Still good 7/10 for me.
