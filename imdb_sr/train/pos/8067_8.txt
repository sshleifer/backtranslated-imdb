Today, if someone means the name Victor McLaglen, the answer will most likely be "Who?" or maybe "Why?" Believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film, a poor, desperate man who is ready to sell his best friend for "carfare" in the United States. It's an interesting movie that shows how even the most frustrated snoops will be just a few dollars. The film takes place in Ireland, dominated by the British, and while all other characters directly or indirectly struggle for the political independence of Ireland, everything that Mr. McLaglen characterizes is worrying about getting money and eating. The film tells you to ask yourself if political activism is worth all the trouble, because while the activist is struggling to make a point, many others not only do not care, they do not even know what it is about. The moral of this film is: watch out for a friend, maybe you will be sold for ten cents.
