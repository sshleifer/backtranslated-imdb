Anyone who watched this movie and reviewed it badly, I would refer them to Roger Ebert's review of this film. He is one of the most distinguished critics in the industry and gave him 3 1/2 stars. This is an excellent movie. It may not be perfect or spectacular, but I enjoyed it. Chorus line is not so much a story, how much the group talks about the life of Broadway Hope. I read reviews where people said that too much time was spent on the romance between Zach and Cassie. That's the wrong view. This is another story along with all the other stories that have been told about every occasion from Broadway. What people do not realize is that those who are dancing for Broadway's shows go through the same things that an ordinary man passes through. And I think it's actually the meaning of the whole show. It is to show not only the talent of these special dancers, but to give us some sharp things to think about in general. This is a study of life as a star of Broadway. Anyone who dreamed of becoming a star of Broadway watches this film with a great sense of connection because they have gone through what the characters go through. This is a great musical. It has its own slow points, and sometimes it gets a little confused with the rhythm of certain stories, but in all, I have fully enjoyed it. Take a closer look and you may understand what I'm talking about.
