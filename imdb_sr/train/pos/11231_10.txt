I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier is a great series for fan fiction films and I can not wait to see more. I have already recommended it to other people to watch, because it is worth a look. I've already watched each episode several times and I'm waiting to see more episodes. I rated him ten, but I think he deserves 12 of my praise to Star Trek Hidden Frontiers staff on a great job. If you like Star Trek and I recommend that you look at this fictitious movie. Details related to this series of films are great, especially the ships and planets used in it
