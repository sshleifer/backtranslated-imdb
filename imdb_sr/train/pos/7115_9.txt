A wonderful and persistent war film that focuses on the inner sufferings of the blind sailor Al-Shmid. Although it is difficult and unpleasant, in the end, the heroic-Schmid triumph over disability and depression. The battle was great. But one bone to pick up. No matter how many 50 bullets have fired, I've never seen water or dirt hit! He hurt realism, but I can live with it. Nice performance by Eleanor Parker, again, as his friend.
