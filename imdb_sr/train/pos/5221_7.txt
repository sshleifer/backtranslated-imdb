I was not too interested in watching Flock. Andrew Lau directed the trilogy of the Infernal Affairs masterpiece, but he was fired from Flock and replaced by the emergency director, nicknamed Niels Mueller. he made a good movie, but he did not satisfy the studio, so they were fired and hired by another director. This usually does not work well (remember the Invasions). But Flock was better than what I expected. great movie, but it's an interesting and fun thriller. Character development was very well made and I could very well know the characters. Also, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible. Richard Gere and Claire today bring competent performance. , we go to negative points. One element that really disturbed me (it was the moment in which I was irritated) was the excess of the tricks of the edition that give the film more "stance" and style. d their presence is arbitrarily. Plus, I think the film should have been more ambitious. In spite of that, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. It's not unforgettable, but it's fun.
