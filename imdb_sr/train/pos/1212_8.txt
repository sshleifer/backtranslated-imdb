Care Bears Movie 2: A new generation is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I really like it. Yes, I admit that the dialogue is wiped out and that the story is a little bad. But Darkheart, although very dark, is a convincing changeable criminal, and Hadlei Kai has done a great job. When we were already in the voice, it was great, nothing bad about it. The animation was colorful, and some of the visual effects, especially at the beginning, were astounding. The songs and scores are wonderful, especially Groving Up and Forever Ioung, this one has always been my personal favorite. Bears of care, which I love, are wonderful, and human children are well done. And the ending is a real tracker. All in all, a harmless fun for children. 8/10 Bethani Cok
