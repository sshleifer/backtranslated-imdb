I love cartoons. I can show things that can not do with the 'real' actors and landscapes - although computer effects are changing more and more. They can push the boundaries of the satire ('Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), spectacle ('Aladin'), or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in the "Ice Age," as when we see the colorful herd of the now extinct mammals who migrate across the village, talking as old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch, because at the same time we get familiar and weird, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While the Ice Age is not as good as a top-quality animated film of all time, it's a really fun movie. Sit down, enjoy intense anachronism, beautiful backgrounds and laughs of your belly. the human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, of course, they have a lot of problems. Likewise, during the trip, Scratus appears, the most miserable rodent of history, who desperately tries to bury the winter for the winter: in glaciers, on the top of dead trees, in ice caves. His introductory scene is a classic. It is a simple story with an extremely predictable end and the middle that is just a series of funny incidents with a few moments to build characters, but some scenes like nappies or appendages are hilarious, the animals are cute and look good. There is also one very touching moment, when the cave images of mammoth live before the eyes of Manfred. It does not have to look, but it's good for a fun hour. 7/10
