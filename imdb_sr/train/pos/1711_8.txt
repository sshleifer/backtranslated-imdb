The second film by Abhai Deola, written by Imtiaz Ali, Shivam Nair's first film. Soha probably has her first (?) Mesnat role of Meghe, a girl who has fled from her home and is waiting in the Delhi office secretary for marriage that Shaian Munshi is meeting her. She waits and waits and is finally spotted as a girl in trouble by Ankhisha (Abhai Deol). They spend many days together because they pull out of one difficult situation for another and finally fall in love with her. Then the guy's back! Aage pardei par dekhiie! Sounds familiar? This is another adaptation of the White Dostoevsky Night with a small number of loans from Le Notti Bianchi (although very small - Ankush separates lovers by telling the boy to be dead!). But this is a geographical and more realistic (spiritual) adjustment than much overwhelming and overwhelming Saavariia. I wonder why nobody brought this little gem while we all talked about Saavarii as crazy a couple of months ago. Delhi Delhi are wonderful - there is a mandatory ride through Old Delhi, snapshots of Masked Jam from the roof, Connaught Circus, streets with rickshaws (What? How?). The colorful luminaries in the hotel are enough to tell you this is a tiring connection to the rooms for rent per hour! The more I see Abhaia, the more I like this young man. In this second film he is quite good as a witness for hiring, to whom a beautiful woman gave a purpose in life. Soha looks gorgeous, and when she smiles, she suits the role, but at serious moments I find it unconvincing. I'm not quite sure that she has a great actress in her, or she may flourish like a brother. The music of Himesh Reshammi is not so great and the film is actually casting songs, somehow breaking the story and not sitting well with the characters who sing them. The support is great, and this adaptation of the Vhite Nights gives me a thumbs up. BTV - the fact that I love sweet holes Abhai Deola has nothing to do with my rating.
