This film was not so promoted here in Greece, although it got good actors, a great script and a pretty good photo was not the so-called "blockbuster" movie in my country. The film itself is very powerful, it has been difficult for the newcomer to pass when he returned to his native village after being released from jail (drug). The end is quite sad ... Mourikis is trying to keep up with his role and well-behaved ... Lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas is one more time near excellence ... 7 out of 10 because very few Greek films can make such an impression!
