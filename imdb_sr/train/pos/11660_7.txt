A beautiful piece of a children's movie theater buried in the world of archaic celticism. Setting up a story about the famous book Kels, believed to have been made up of a monk from the small island of Iona, on the west coast of Scotland. The story of the story of a young student abbot going to the woods in search of Crom-Cruic, a fierce, headless horseman of pagan mythology. Hoping to recover the lost artifact. The films of true beauty lie in his animation. The cell is shaded by a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity, resulting in the appearance of less simplicity. Performing much from the artistic style of the brilliant series Cartoon Netvork 'Samurai Jack' for its ingenious use of marker making and depth of background, Secret Kela creates a consistent affective Celtic world that lives in the shadow of the Viking Invasion. History can be very inaccurate and a way of life depicted without realism, but these facts are utterly irrelevant because the film is placed in the fantasy world and Celtic-revivalist mysticism. A girl from the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion she pictures what she is, sliding from branch to branch. Appears and disappears as a mysterious nymph with the qualities that resemble the legendary Cheshire Cat from Alice and Wonderland. Secret Kelsa is an absolute delicacy. For all sexes, all ages, it's a wonderful piece of family film. Do not expect to be thrilled but you will be pleasantly impressed!
