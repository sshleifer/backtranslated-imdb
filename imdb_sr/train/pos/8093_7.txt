My friend had the idea to watch an animated LOTR after seeing Peter Jackson's Return of the King. So I finally bought it from e-baia, thinking that it would suck right from the start. In fact, it was really not as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good for their time, they used a unique method of mixing live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who made the voice for Frodo sounded a bit like Elijah Vood. the greatest adaptation of the book, but believe me, I saw much worse. It's a lot of things to do, because both Fellovship and The Tvo Tovers are compressed into one hour of two movies. Definatlei is worth the clock, the children might like it, but the absentee does not compare with Peter Jackson's trilogy.
