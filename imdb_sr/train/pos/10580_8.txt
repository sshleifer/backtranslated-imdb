This phenomenal film should be watched, knowing that millions gathered 10 cents to see it and forget the gloomy daily economic opportunities of the 30s. Remember, 10 cents then bought a loaf of bread, so it was a small luxury for many people. It is a testimony to how Hollywood has done everything in his power to make the United States feel a little better about itself. You will notice that with the studio system in Hollywood at that time, many actors and actresses were shaped into similar films, for example, James Cagnei, Villiam Povell, Rubi Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondell and Gui Kibbee. At that time, the US Army was always respected by enthusiasm and patriotism, as it ultimately used military precision marching from the great choreographer, Busby Berkeley.
