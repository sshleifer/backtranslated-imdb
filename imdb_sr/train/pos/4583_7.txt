I saw it in Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the sub-characters were overly active. This took away the film, as well as a rather lame piece of music, which really disturbed me all the time. If the music score has been improved, I could overlook a few exaggerated scenes. Then the film would be much, much better.
