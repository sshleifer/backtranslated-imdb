This is no doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. The first time I saw it, I was 9 or 10 years old. I started looking somewhere before the rape scene. And when I saw it, I was really shocked thinking, "What kind of a sick movie?" Today I saw it from the beginning and I really realized that this film is really great. It's exciting, terrifying, shocking and, in its unique way, disturbing. But the best thing about it is the ending in which the audience showed that this experience will haunt characters for the rest of their lives. This will torment their conscience and they will take care of the corpses in that river for the rest of their lives. And I can not do anything about it, it's something they have to live with. This region is one of the happiest finishes in the history of the film and is very clever, brilliant and terrifying. The magnificent acting in this movie. All in all, John Boorman has created one of the best films through the history of the film based on the novel by Dick Chayney. Must be seen for all film lovers
