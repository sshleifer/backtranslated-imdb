I absolutely loved this movie! I do not look at all the other comments that I read about it at all. I was completely fascinated every second! I found stories story, acting intensity, and direction on the spot. I would literally jump every time the phone rang near the end of the movie. Although there was nothing "scary" in the story itself, I was firmly on the edge of the whole film - and for the rest of my evenings. I discovered that so many perfect choices were made ... casting, script, small pieces of humor in it. There were so many points where the film could go on cheap excitement, but it never did, and it put this film behind me for so many of the main thrillers that came out lately ... and the last number of years.
