and this is a very disturbing movie. Perhaps I'm wrong, but this is the last movie I thought Burt Reinolds was the real actor, who transformed the role, and delivered the message. They are modest and unconscious; businessmen who want to enjoy the country. They knew little about what would happen next. Photographs and sets are realistic and natural. That was before the time of Vos Craven. The most worrying thing about this movie is the fact that such sites still exist. In America, rural people continue to despise city people; It's almost a century since the civil war. You will enjoy this film. It was filmed in rural parts of South Georgia, which still exist. Just do not go past it in Mobile, Alabama; This area has not yet been repaired by Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
