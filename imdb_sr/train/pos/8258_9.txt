At the risk of sounding a little bit of sacrilege, at first glance, I'm inclined to put this together with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given Saimon Pego as an indisputable genius of comedy, I realize that this is a big claim. And to what extent do you agree with this last claim can be a good preliminary indicator of whether Fido will like you. In a way, the comedy accepts where 'Shaun' has stopped, except that we've been back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereo-typed Central American small town. Zombie Wars are over and zombies are becoming better-suited, helpful members of the community. This, so that we are initially informed, mainly thanks to the scientific achievements made by good people in Zomcom - perhaps a nice idea of ​​romantic comedy? The beauty of the film lies in its morgue of a prominent neighborhood that maintains its core values, creating a place for zombies and the particular dangers they pose. The charm and balance with which it is done is close enough. The themes you can expect from the more mainstream comedy comedies come through - the facet of a good clean life, the performance of appearances, suppressed emotions, confused parental values, social responsibility and the suffering of an alienated individual. The story is told with a happy heart and a wide appeal that is vividly revived by a powerful movie. It is one of those works that really shows that everyone involved was given a blow from participation. It's also fun to imagine what Billy Connelli learns that his script was like ... So, the conclusion is that you'll probably appreciate the humor of this movie if your father did not try to eat.
