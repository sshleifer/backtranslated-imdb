when all aspects of the film are gathered --- dance, singing, acting --- the only one that stands out as the best in the acting team is Vanessa Villiams ... her dedication, energy and timeless beauty make Rosie a perfect role for her. I've never seen Rose show such a lifetime! Vanessa's singing talent is beautifully depicted with all the songs she performs like Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! Her dance is so incredible, even when some people say that choreography was bad - her dance skills were shown better than ever before! I would recommend this version by '63 just because I discovered that the long acting Vanesse is excellent ----- not to mention the fact that both Jason Alekander and the other actors are very impressive (with the exception of Chinas Philips ... what the hell , thought when they threw it?) All in all, I would say that this version is wonderful and I recommend that everyone see this version!
