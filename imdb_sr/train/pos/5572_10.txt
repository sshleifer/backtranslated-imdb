This film was hysterical. I did not laugh like this for so long. I mean, it's not "Good Vill Hunting," but was that supposed to be? In fact I went to the advanced screening expecting much less and I was pleasantly surprised. The comedy is strong and fairly constant. Amanda Peet is hot and awesome. The whole audience I shared with her enjoyed the movie as much as I did.
