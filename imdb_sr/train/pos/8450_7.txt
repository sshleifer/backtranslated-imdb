It was not bad for the first PPV of Rav 006. But the end was really shocking for all those present and those who watched at home. EDGE V / LITA FOR EVERY INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONS Not a bad opener, these two can seriously put a big sword if they have more time to embark on wrestling. Flair defeated DK after Edge beat him with a MITB briefcase. 3/10 OTHER STRATUS STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF EVERY WOMAN It is not bad to notice the fact that this is the first time that these Diva faced the ring. Mickie goes for a modified Chick Kick, but Trish hits and nails his Chick Kick to win the title. 3/10 THIRD MATERIAL - TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOV This really was a really good match, indeed. The whole HHH match focuses on the Big Shov's injured arm, but Big Shov is still struggling. Later, HHH is able to demolish the Big Shov & Nails by a pedigree for victory. 5/10 FOURTH MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN V / MAMA VS. VISCERA {This was a bonus game} Not so bad, it was okay. After Viscera fell, behind the judge, Benjamin's mother took a bag that had bricks and hit Viscer on the head three times. Viscera got up just to catch Benjamin's shot in the heel to win the big man. 4/10 FIRST MATCH-JERRY 'KING' LAVLER VS. GREGORI HELMS Bored, slow and messy. Both men did not invest very well. Jerry Lavler defeated Fist Drop to win. 2/10 SIX MATCH-TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEI VS. MARIA VS. CANDY MICHELLE IN THE FIRST EVERY WOMEN MATERIAL FOR WOMEN That was pretty fun for me. Ashley (I think) eliminates Candice's last win at the first women's competition. 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN PRICE VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAVN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE V / DAIVARI IN THE ELIMINATION CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONSHIP It was a cool game of the elimination chamber. But nothing will be at the top of last year's elimination chamber that was the best. The last three are Masters, Price & Carlito. Carlito turns his back on Masters and gets him on it to eliminate him. Seconds later Price gets a roll-up on Carlit for three numbers to win the elimination chamber and keep its VVE title. But his night was not over yet. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon goes out and congratulates Price for his victory. Vince McMahon says his night is not over yet, and says Edge earns on his Monei In The Bank an opportunity to challenge the price for the title. Edge comes out with Lit, gives briefcase to Vince and heads in the ring because Price has another game to come here tonight. OSAM MATCH-JOHN PRICE VS. EDGE V / LITA FOR VVE CHAMPIONSHIP {The price that is open during the match chamber} is immediately hit by Edge, Edge then the nail of the spear on the Price, goes to the cover and its shock The price comes out. Edge nails another Spear & covers for shocking three counts as he defeated Price & won the VVE championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So, last year's New Year of the Revolution was better than this year, but it was still fine. The EC match was also good and shocking Edge in his MITB capability is definitely the most shocking on PPV shovu. All in all: I will give him 7/10 and C
