In Holland, the lecture is held by gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe). He stays overnight with the beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (imagining he is a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but looks at the image of Kristina's boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay tested. Then things get strange. Large art house with the name of KS in the USA in 1983. Why is KS ranked? Let's see ... there is choking, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in the crypt ... and everything is comedy !!! !! Paul Verhoeven did it after Spetters. "Spetters" attacked critics for extreme sexual sequences and were declared for rubbish. So Verhoeven fulfilled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking that critics would think it was an art and that it was praiseworthy. He was right! Critics loved the film without realizing that Verhoeven was playing with them. Still, it's a great movie. It's beautifully filmed by Jan de Bont (now the director) and there are so many symbols and obvious "hidden" layers in dialogue that you are never bored. All the acting is great - Krabbe plays an extremely overwhelming character, but (somehow) he has you for him; Soutendijk is just amazing to watch and play his part to perfection - the little smile he gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is cold; Hofman is extremely handsome with a large body - deserves merit for the order of the churches and a departure with Krabbe in the crypt. you love extreme films that are challenging you (like me) this is for you! 10 to the end.
