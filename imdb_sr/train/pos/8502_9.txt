Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is in charge of complying with the Japanese automobile company that comes to his city and thus opens jobs for Hadleville residents. What happens after that is a hurry moment after another. Two cultures are clashing and Kyoton is holding things together. Look for great performances from Keaton, Gedda Vatanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturra, Soh Iamamure and Sab Shimomo. Everyone is perfectly thrown. Do not be fooled by a low estimate of the number. This is 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the name of the city of Hadleville was used at noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleville but in Oregon.
