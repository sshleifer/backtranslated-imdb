What I loved on the screen adaptation of a stone angel is that it has remained so true a novel! Great movie! As a passionate reader, I think the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book is somehow lost in translation. You can say that the Stone Angel team watched this not happen with this movie. Ellen Burstin was an excellent choice for the role of the Hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar. However, I think the Canadian actress (Christine Horne) has been chosen to play Hagar in her younger years and has done an incredible job that guarantees great praise. I have not seen any of Horne's previous works, but I will definitely look after seeing her performance of Stone Angel. 2008. I can not wait to see him again on the big screen!
