This famous story of an older man / younger woman is surprisingly stubborn. Bikers, hippies, free love and captive bait surprisingly mix well in this forgotten black and white indie effort. The main actress Patricia Vimmer, as the title "Candi", gives the best performance of her career (encompasses all three epic episodes). Vimmer was premature and attractive in IOUNG GRADUATES (1971), but gives a more serious appearance to THE BABYSTITER. Occasionally violence and occasional nudity are somewhat surprising, but are regularly led by the director. Leading Weimmer and George E. Keri sold loyalty from May to December. There is enough resemblance between BABISITTER and YOUNG DIPLOMAT to ask if the same director was leading this other film. Patricia Vimer, where are you? Hello from Seattle, VA, Miss Vimer appeared as a dancer on TV rock and roll shovu MALIBU U before she covered the cover (as well as the appearance in the eight last year's edition of the magazine "Best For Men" from August 1968. It also appeared as a squirrel in a popular cult drive-in shocker from 1969. THE VITCHMAKER. BABISITTER has finally made its debut for home video as part of an eight-film BCI set DRIVE- IN CULT CLASSICS vol 3, available at Amazon.com and some retail stores such as Best Bui.
