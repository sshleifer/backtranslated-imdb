I simply can not agree with the above commentary - there are many interesting and truly amazing film images in this, it has an unusual structure and is moving well with a terrifying climatic sequence that is significant for the efficient use of silence. Moreover, he explores the weird suicide moment in a very sincere way, not pulling any blows on what he shows but not dwelling and excessively sensationalizing. has hints of documentary film about it as well as horror and art-house cinema, and deserves a place among the canons of 'various' horror films such as The Blair Vitch Project and the original Ring (both of which preceded and could have been unacknowledged). Definitely worth seeing if you are interested in the edges of horror cinema.
