Bugs Bunny's excellent cartoon from previous years is Bugs as a contractor in the windows window at a local department store. After finishing for the day the manager came to tell him he was about to cross soon. Bugs is happy to commit that he realized that the new job is in a taker ... and that takidermi has to do with stuffing animals. Animals as they say, a certain rabbit. This provokes a battle between a witty rabbit and his former employer. I discovered this short one to be wonderful and definitely one of the best early 1940s. It still remains ridiculous almost 60 years later. This short animated film can be viewed on disk 1 Loonei Tunes Gold Collection Volume 2. My Rating: A-
