I just finished watching this movie, which made me very upset. They were also twice in South Africa at the time this film was set. It's definitely difficult, and opening scenes tend to "set the scene". A slow but steady increase in speed barely allows a pause, and of course there are some light moments. It will never again be able to see Nigel Havthorne the same. He came across as a very weird individual, and I tortured him more and more every time he appeared. I totally agree with Steve-Tom's articulated and well-thought-out comments.
