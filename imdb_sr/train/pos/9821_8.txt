I saw this movie about real films (which automatically made me skeptical), but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the incredible turn of the story or the breath-taking dialogue (which there are few) but because, despite the fact that people say that I thought the film was correct in the view of teenagers who are pregnant. N / A Davson's Creek, they are not graceful, cool spirited characters who run through sexuality effortlessly. They are children and they behave like children. They are blunt, unkempt and disturbingly confused about everything. Yes, it could be coincidental and could only be bad actors, but I do not think so. Dermot Mulronei gives (when he does not try to be cool) very convincing performance and I loved him for that. Patricia Arquette is tough and boring, but she was pregnant and a teenager? The combination of these two is not exactly the lavender on your pillow. The plot is VERY predictable, but then what? I believed them, his stress, and his inability to deal with her - her brave, but somewhat erroneous attempts to bring them closer. I think the characters, which anyone else did, were really boring and incredible, but they were not. This reflects the superiority of the situation in which they are sitting, sitting in class, and walking in the campus with the baby. I felt angry at her for that, I felt angry at him because he was such a child and I blamed her. I felt everything. In the end, I loved it and I would recommend it. Take care of the scene in which Dermot Mulronei starts from a catastrophic counseling session - career performance.
