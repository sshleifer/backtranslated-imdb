I saw a movie for the first time on the BBC on July 27, 2005. It was a good interpretation for me by Conan Doile, and I'm really wondering what sherlock fans think about it. I also think it's a movie for these fans, regardless of whether they agree or not what is mentioned. You may wonder if A.C. Doile was a strong person or questioned. However, he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much was it a sort of semi-biography? No less strongly putting this adaptation forward, it's a movie that you must see - even if you are not interested in Sherlock Holmes movies or books - look at it, enjoy and have your own opinion on it.
