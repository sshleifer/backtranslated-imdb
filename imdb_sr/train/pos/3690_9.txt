Rudiard Kipling once wrote that God gave all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that the human heart is very small, every human being has this particular place that he loves more than anyone else. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most prominent presenters of the day when they wanted to confess eternal love for this particular place and present the situations in the lives of its inhabitants and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris is a t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coiket, Cuaron, Paine and others lead a stunning walk through Paris arrondissements, human feelings, longing and expectations. /> Always in another neighborhood, always a moving story about ordinary people looking for love, whether it's at a parking lot, an art studio, an underground station. And Paris is about the great series of love - love for a partner, a child, a parent, for those who have meant to us the world but are no longer around, the love that needs to be revived, the happy love for that stranger how your eyes meet or love which just does not have to be ... today, but tomorrow - who knows? Still, this film is not only about love, but about life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, daily rises and falls. And the most important quality to him is that he is not at all relaxed, but warm and full of hope. This film I give to the nine, because the final part talks about how some of the stories can develop further, but not all of them and that's what I miss, and I do not mean "further development" some specific reference to the future of characters. As for everything else, I can only say - amazing. He wants to leave everything behind, escape to Paris and live those little romances.
