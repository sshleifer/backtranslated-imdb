In fact, one particular person / character is not "right there", but my summary refers to the power of the film. And all this is achieved without any fictitious movements and / or large production sets, but with a great story and very convincing and good actors who transmit the story. companion of a great Japanese movie / cinema (such as Tokyo Story, etc.), not so much story about the story, of course, but more mood! Excellent acting, shades in gigs that are really jewels. If you are eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie that touches you emotionally, then that's what you're going to do. As you have noticed (like many of my reviews), I'm not going into the story. There are places on IMDb where you can look at them, I'm not one of those who tell the story!
