This was an absolutely spellbinding series and I was sorry that I managed to catch only a few shows back when it was broadcast late at night in the UK. The style was so different from the others of this kind, all of which had an unpleasant style of horror. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (and not one negative one I can see) to understand what a truly innovative series is and how it captured the imagination. Now I understand that I have read the comments CANCELED, it's so incredible. What a bunch of "headless overpriced custom parties" has to (or maybe it is still) run around to do it.
