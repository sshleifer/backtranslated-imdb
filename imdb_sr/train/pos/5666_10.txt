I loved this show when it was broadcast on television and it was broken when I learned that someone somewhere decided it was not worthwhile to continue! For years I've been hanging on my copies of this show, the ones I shot or I recorded for somebody. It's so far. The forces that finally decided to publish this beautiful series on DVD, and I finally managed to get my hands on the set. What brings me to this part; Part of it is this show. American Gothic is about evil good verses, basically a fight between Lucas Bucka (it's Buck, with B). He is an evil sheriff of a small town in South Carolina that manages things the way he wants things to start and do not stop for anything. many lives left to live. I really hated it when it was canceled, but that's the way it seems to me when I finally find something worth watching on television. , he only has the right amount of charm and evil to do it. And the other actors did a great job, so I guess we could say that casting was a hit with me.
