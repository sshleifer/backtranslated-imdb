Full House was and still is a great performance. It's a good show for people of all ages and a good family show. There are no more such shows. The children are very sweet, and although it's a bit cheesy, it's still good, especially for anyone who watched it while they were small. I'd like to see interviews now. Anyone who would like to see actors' interviews, as if those who are now writing about the special features of DVDs, should go to Petition spot and sign a petition called Full House Reunion on DVD as there is a petition for it in Hopes that the actors might want to do it. Iai for Full House!
