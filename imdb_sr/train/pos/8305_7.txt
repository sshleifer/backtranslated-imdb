I really enjoyed the movie, however, I did not realize that so much was happening in his life Little Richard. I did not know Lucille first. There is very little (it can hardly be said) that women are closely associated with Little Richard. There is no mention of women's participation in the romantic way in their lives. I wonder why this part of his life is not mentioned. All in all, the film was great. I also did not like Leon playing the role of Little Richard, he is a good actor, but I feel that the part should go to another actor. He did not visually remind me of Little Richard. I was also totally unconscious of the promiscuity in which Little Richard was involved. From the film is shown as a sexual addict. Nowadays he would be consulted for his sexual addiction. He was a voyeur. I do not want to ruin a movie for someone who has not seen a movie, but there have been several things about a movie that I think should not be part of the final clip.
