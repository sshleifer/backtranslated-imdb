This was one of my favorite series when I was a kid. Swedish Radio Television decided to broadcast it several years earlier when I just finished my first semester of a medical school. I was surprised when I saw the depth in which the organs were explained. Of course, some things were simplified, but most were correct (although it was made 22 years ago!) And quite understandable. I suggest that all students who are soon to be medical doctors should look at him. This is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words for example. Now I'm in the seventh semester and I think I'll watch the series again as soon as I buy a DVD box :-)
