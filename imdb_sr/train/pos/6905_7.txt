I thought Mr Dreifuss was perfect for the role of actor and dictator. His actress, Mr. Julia, played her role equally perfect. It was interesting to see how Richard Dreifuss hesitated to replace the dictator against his will. But he became safer and more satisfied with the role that time passed. Since everything happens with a cause in life, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was supposed to stay there for over a year. I suppose he stayed because he needed to see how much his life was comparable to the poverty he saw in the Paradise. I think he had taken too many things in life in his life and had to get a serious check of reality by staying in that country for as long as he worked. .. anyway ........... so I gave this film 7 out of 10.
