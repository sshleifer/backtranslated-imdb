Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a documentary about globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This movie has a zero narrative and combines faithful shots with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in China living in the factory. They play with toys, jumping and dancing. However, most of their days and nights consist of work, work and work - but the images of their work are bright and enchanting to watch. The owner of the factory in China is astoundingly open, so that it dominates the effects of globalization as he "punishes" workers. According to Mardi Gras balls from China to Carnival, the film reveals that it is locally linked to global through humor and interesting, convincing footage from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts in this film is the intercultural introduction of factory workers and Mardi Gras, who are interacting with each other through pictures. Here the film comes in a full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film never prophesized, it is not guilty, and allows everyone to be present. In the end, we - the viewers - make our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and globalization.
