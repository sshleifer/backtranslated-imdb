Different film directors from different countries have contributed much to the film medium with their thoughts. As a result, we have experienced different genres when it comes to media. Jafar Panahi, unlike J.L. Godarda or F. Truffault, believes in a simple story; Schematic narratives are one of the main features of his directing work. He has confidence in the automatic and critical intelligence of the observers; he does not feel any need to go to Alienation or such things to reach the viewer. It is equally efficient despite conventionality. Offside (2006) is another schematic creation of it, in which gender subordination Middle Eastern Asia is gradually becoming clear to everyone as a simple but appealing story of the film. Today, when we all Wickham on women's rights, this movie is very quiet draws in our mind and in the end becomes a coat of arms for our critical intelligence conveying the message that Egalite of Human Rights is nothing but illusive good utopia. Paternity will never allow women to be empowered. An important football match in which participating nations, a teenager who knows the game, loves his nation has no right to enter the stadium to delight your country. She is only allowed to listen to the comment live. Her pseudonym could not work for her. As a result, she had to go through several humiliating situations. From the very beginning, her worried father was there and ran for her daughter there. At the end of the day, the celebration came when the nation won the match that the girl could not see because it was reserved on the outside of the stadium during the game. But the celebration can not suppress the issue of the rights of women who remain in every corner of the world in a different format. Jafar Panahi has most successfully pointed to this issue of gender abuse within conventional film and patriarchy. The global tragedy was resolved with ease, and sometimes with humor, which, in turn, constantly teases our beings.
