The Best of Times is one of the best sleepers of all time. Setting up does not burden your patience, the development is stable, many interlaced relationships are lovingly established, gags and bits work and everyone is fun. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell plays Reno Hightover in one of his best performances, and Robin Villiams playing Jack Dundee is as safe as ever. Many of the big fans are also included in the cast. Jack's wife plays the daughter of Jack Palance, who is beautiful, as well as Reno's wife, who is a great comedian. I can not tell you how many times I've watched this movie, how many times I enjoyed it and how often I want to see more people.
