Halloween is one of those movies that give you deep skin! In my opinion, the most terrible film of all time. Michael Mayers is the best pianist ever! He was so scary! What makes Halloween so special is that there were no special effects where you can say that it was computer animated, it was on a low budget and had only one note, but it managed to scare the hell out of people. 25 years and this film still has the same effect as '78. It's about the boy Michael Miers, he kills his sister at age 6, and so many years later he escapes from a mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis searches for him and will do everything to bring him back, as he describes Michael as "... pure evil. Blessed eyes, the devil's eyes." Michael is on a mission to kill his other sister, Laurie, played by the new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to keep the kids on Halloween, while her friends are at a party and, of course, we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie will have a chance because she is a virgin. The night of the witch brings a lot of respect to the Psychas, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, daughter Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolutely brilliant film that breaks the boundaries and makes you lock the doors, hook up the windows and turn off the lights! "They will arrange you! They will arrange you!" Night of witches, the ultimate horror movie! 10/10
