This is one of the best conversations, Joan Cravford. It was the first Gable-Cravford pairing, and it was obvious to the MGM and the public that the squad was a team that led the studio to make seven more films with them as a co-star. convincingly shows the slide of a brother and sister who, after their father loses everything in the stock market, must take care of themselves and work for life. Life is in depression difficult, and soon even their attempts to find a legitimate job prove to be futile, and resort to underground activities. Joan Crawford is great as a social person. It's smart, complex and convincing. It even endangers the theatrical stiffness of the early acting of other actors. Clark Gable is a diamond rough, masculine and rude as a gangster with no stupidity that intertwines in Cravford's character. That same year, he would play a similar and even more successful role than Norma Shearer in A Free Soul, securing his position as the best male sex symbol on MGM. If you like Cravford in this role, do not miss the "Paid", which she did a year earlier, which is also among her best early Talkie performances. <br /> <br />
