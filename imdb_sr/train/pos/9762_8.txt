This is a very strange film directed by Richard Williams. Everyone who knows about Villiam's work knows that it's a little worse (if not genius), but this one takes a cake. There are two unfortunate ragdolls who have to save their new French doll of their owner from lusty Pirate Toys and are at the mercy of a few bizarre characters along the way. The power of this film lies primarily in aesthetic quality; his strange character design, his powerful animation, and the strong contrast of the sweet and intimidating. Villiams' brilliant animation featured Raggedi Ann and Andi as real puppets, floppy disks and damned rather than just cartoon versions of puppets, making them more convincing (at least in a visual sense). The animation shines on the knees brought with Camel-vith-the-Vrinkled, whose body is walking with two different characters controlling each end, capturing a silent film with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, Greedy. Greedy animation, by itself, is perhaps the most perfect psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There is something in this animation that only makes your jaw fall - and each one is something new. Living in what was considered "Taffy Pit", Greedy is a massive man who lives in and ruthlessly eats sweets. He sings a song that I can not feel like I have some sexual subtops, and then I try to kill Raggedi Ann for her heart with sweets. The only complaint I have about this movie is that they have too many songs. Continuously restricts the pace of the film, because there are sixteen. There are about six good songs (which should be the only ones), including "I Look, and Vhat I See?", "No Girl's Toi", "Blue" (although they did not need singing twice) "I'm never enough," "Because I love you" and maybe "I'm home." Others look unnecessary and sincere, they are not too unbelievable to listen. This is a strange movie with strange tones, but if that's what you're looking for, you will not find it better.
