The first part of this notorious series of horrors is a woman who was kidnapped by a band of black-clad men who tortured her for a few days before they were finally killed. the animal's bowels are thrown on it, hot boiling water is poured into it, and finally the eyeball is punctured with a needle (a really sick and unpleasant scene). One is the closest snuff film you can get without a murder on a tape. Of course, some of the special effects are pretty poor, but the idea to make a burmut is pretty horrible. which is more bloody and sadistic, but less disturbing. In any case, this is unavoidable for fans of horror!
