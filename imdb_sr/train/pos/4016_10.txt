This beautiful little film has all the elements that made Spaghetti Western also more exciting: GREAT music (one of the few if not the only one .. .. female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi) EKSCITING action sequences (and very corrupt for that day!), and beautiful scenery and sets (of course in Almeria, Spain). It also has a very good story with a pretty tragic romance. Actors do wonderful work - the true performances of Lawrence Dobkin and Rozalbe Neri (the most important role of women in Western Spaghetti outside Cardinal in Leoneovom "Once the West"). Without placing any spoilers, let me say that this film contains one of the best endings of any movie I've ever seen!
