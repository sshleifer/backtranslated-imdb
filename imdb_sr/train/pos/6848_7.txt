A very stupid movie, which begins with soft pornography, enters a distant comedy in the art gallery, adds shock to the discovery in the hotel room, and then introduces a random kill without obvious reason. What follows is bizarre and surreal (especially the stopwatch is extremely unnecessary), culminating in the "discovery" of the ending that is obvious as being unfair to the viewer (see section on triviality, which is deliberately dishonest). The film comes out of its way to offend as many groups as possible - transsexuals, crazy, and beautiful "Huggie Bear" -style racial stereotypes in the subway - and patronizing treats the viewer as an idiot in the final stages, while characters endlessly explain each other in detail, and again and again what just happened in the film. Although female characters in the background of the restaurant are finally happy to watch. In fact, the whole movie is a joy to watch: Despite its many, many drawbacks, the whole package only, well, works.
