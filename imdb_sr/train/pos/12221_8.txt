This is a nice job. A very sexy and attractive plot to keep my interest. Its main disadvantage is that it looks like it was made for TV: The whole screen, and although there were several scenes of sex, there was absolutely no nudity (but the boy came close!). Strangely, also, since Netflik shows that it was rated R. Still, very beautiful and I want Alicia Silverstone to make more of these films. One Netflik reviewer stated that he was part of the series, but I could not find out what that series was. I would like to find out, because this film is SO GOOD. Valt D in LV. 8/23/2005
