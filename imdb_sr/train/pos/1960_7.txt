This takes about a year after the "Basic Instinct" event. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. As you interact with soccer players as you drive a car that drives 110 km / h (do not ask), she leaves the road and ends up in the Thames. She survives - she does not know. Police hired psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if he is mentally fit to be tried. Naturally, instead, he begins to play with his mind and follows many murders and sex. This film was condemned to ruin before it opened. It should have always been the role of actor and director, script problems were constant and the actors were not satisfied (Morrissey often complained about the film). It's not bad, though. It's a lot like the first - there's lush music, beautiful locations, lots of sex and nudity (it had to be edited for R), a pretty tricky plot and good acting - but it does not have any impact. It looks like a restoration of the first one. People are killed here with a crypt (I believe) ... just like people were killed in the ice. In a sweet moment, Stone picked up the lid and looked at him passionately. She played and played games with a man and maybe involved in the killings. Similarities are too obvious. This is also VRLO R rated - there is much explicit sex talk, male nudity (Morrissey looks much better than naked Michael Douglas), a naked woman (Stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. The acting is good. The rock is fantastic here; Morrissey looks poor, but it's okay; Charlotte Rampling and David Thevlis are good in supporting roles. So - it's not at all bad, but it feels like a remake of the first one. I still recommend it. People just attacked it because Stone did not like it and they thought it was stupid to make the "Basic ..." extension 14 years after it was made.
