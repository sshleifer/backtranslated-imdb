Shintaro Katsu, who played blindfold "Zatoichi" in a total of 27 films, ends with Hanzo trilogy with this great film in which love is made with the spirit, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br> The big stick, which is often used in the search for justice, has always been withdrawn. Katsu was his usual daring while he was persecuting those who would steal from the treasury in order to lend on the lucrative amounts of those who I can not afford to pay. Common incredible fencing and the great guy's skills were present, along with blood. I will miss it.
