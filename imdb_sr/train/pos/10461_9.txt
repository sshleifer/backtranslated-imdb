The Divine Covenant is a wonderful movie. It is based on a novel of the same title, which was equally good, although different from the film. It really made you think about how to answer that you were in the role of characters. It is recommended to anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, EVERYONE! values ​​and ideals are shown more than compensated. And the actors did a wonderful job to capture the emotional ties between family members and the destruction that happens when one of them gets sick.
