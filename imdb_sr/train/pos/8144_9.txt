Seeing "Fear of the Black Hat" and "This Is Spinal Tap", I can honestly say that while they are similar, both films must really see. Many times it will be in the "Fear" that will have you in hysteria. No wonder that both films have such a big cult. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Hire it if you have to, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
