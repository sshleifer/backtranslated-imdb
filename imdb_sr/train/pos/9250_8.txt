Clark Gable plays a rogue who enters the life of hard cooked wife Jean Harlow. She tries to suck it until she combs it with her stubborn attitude. Despite their cynicism and opposition, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man during a stab, he runs out leaving loyal Harlow in a female prison where she finds her pregnant. Anita Loos 'and Howard Emmett Rogers' writing is great, with many well-drawn and surprising characters (including a Jewish socialist and a blacksmith, and her preacher father played with the trail of stereotypes). Gable and Harlow show that the actors added shades and tones to their characters who send them out of typical Gable and Harle's roles. And the direction is much better than you would expect from Sam Wood. One nice shot brought Harlow to prison, and then he was taken to a surprising snowy yard while the camera followed her. This is one of the best genres and "criminals in love" and "women's jails" and has some of the best hard-core dialogues ever written.
