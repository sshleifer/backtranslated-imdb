A great movie that deals with the life of an old man who looks back over the years. Beginning around about 1910, he recalls his young man and youth; His family, friends, romance, etc. Very nostalgic work with a bitter finale finale ... "all things in life come together as one, and through it flows a river. And that river is haunting me." Worth watching.
