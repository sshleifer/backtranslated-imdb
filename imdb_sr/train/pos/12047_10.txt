The first and only time I saw a woman in black, I think the only way to my knowledge was that she appeared on TV in 1989. It was Easter, and my father and I watched him in the living room a little before we all went. Midnight service in the village church. I was quite young at the time, but I'm not sure who was more terrified by walking through the courtyard of the church to the entrance to the church that night or I or my father! There are many factors in the film about this that make it so dreadful, but I think one of them is the fact that there is not much in the way of the soundtrack that plays in the background of almost every Hollywood movie, so every single Creeping, kicking, and cracking are more intense in your head, as there is no disturbance. Another factor that distinguishes it from other ghost stories does not have a jump factor involved, such as things that jumped out of the closet, so this does not necessarily mean what you see, what you hear, and what you think is happening. This is a smart medium because nothing scares you more than your own mind that leads the mess thinking of what is behind the corner or behind the door! Great story about ghosts, I never saw anything that could fit in with this and with all the freaks that repeated over and over again on TV I can not believe that the BBC erased it after (how much I know) only one display!
