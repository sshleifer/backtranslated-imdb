All right, the musical pieces are poorly written and generally poorly sung (although Valken and Marner, especially Valken, sounded pretty good). And so they finally broke the fourth wall by killing the King and his nobles about "fighting" with the giant and praising Cat's efforts in boots when they were not supposed to know about it rightly. /> Who cares? It's Christopher Freakin 'Valken, who makes a film based on fairy tales, and sings and dances. His style of acting very well matches the role of a crafty, naughty cat that seems to bring his master into deeper and deeper troubles, but in fact has a plan that he thought about seven or eight moves in advance. And if you've ever seen Walken in any of his evil roles, you * know ... Ogre bit the dust to the end when Woken pulled him into the trap. Funny movie, and must-see for anyone who enjoys the unique style of Christopher Valken.
