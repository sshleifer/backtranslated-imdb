This performance will succeed because it calls on all adults regardless of where they are in their relationship. As a man who is married for 26 years, I sympathize with Patrick Varburton: he loves his wife, but he presumes he knows it. I also enjoy monotonous delivery; is never too excited or too low. Nice ensemble of characters. This will be a good addition to the line on Monday night. I do not know how David Spade will be in his role. It is best consumed in small doses. It seems a little old to still love women. I enjoyed the pilot and I look forward to how the series is developing.
