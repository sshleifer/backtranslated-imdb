Simply one of the best ever! The adaptation of Truman's novel Capote Richard Brooks is truly an artistic achievement. The stunning black and white cinema (which was supposed to win the Oscars), the funny Kuinci Jones score and the huge performances of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as strange killers. This film was 0 for 4 on the Oscar and was not even nominated for the best picture while Dr Dulitl was. Imagine! Although you can not get acquainted with a Clutter family like you do in a book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and to the painful process of tracking these guys. dovn. John Forsithe is also impressive as Alvin Devei. There are simply no shortcomings in this. 10 out of 10. Best Performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake. Recommended!
