This strangeness from the novel Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations were at the time when he did it. Polanski himself plays a shy man who rents a Paris apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with discovering what led to it, to the extent that he is dressed in retreat and re-creation of events in the way they could develop. The film is disturbing to some point, and has that atmosphere of the horrible horror that Polanski exposes, but it is too much separated as a repetition of "Rosemary Baby" and "Repulsion", two more Pole's films dealing with horrible events But in terms of preoccupation. ... unless I read too much in the film, I must believe that it was Polanke's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt on the labeled Sexual Perversion and expelled from America. Not condemning it in one way or another, but it's hard to deny evidence about it in the film itself. Rating: B +
