I heard about this film for the first time 20 years ago when I was a child in elementary school (!), I only once happened that I was once browsing the encyclopedias in the classroom, and under the film (or film, I do not remember), it was several photos for different films from mainstream to experimental, and one of them displayed on the page was still for OffOn. It really intrigued me because it was the most important on the page (it was a photo of an eye film with other elements above it). About 18 years later, the public library, where I live, was available for the collection of the entire 4-DVD set "Treasures of American Film Archives", which was issued by the National Foundation for the Preservation of Film. When I read notes on DVD boxes for a set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the disks. After all these years, I finally saw a video! After I looked at it, it was a little because I expected it to be (usually it was the organic appearance of the film, not that it was a bad thing, but I expected it to have more electronic aesthetics), but it was still impressive film, IMHO, taking into account the techniques Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including manual tinting of the film itself and the use of video equipment for some of the movie scenes (taken from video monitors), giving it a more disturbed, lo-res look. Do not misunderstand me, the techniques used in this movie were pretty revolutionary for 1972. That's why it is still one of my favorite short / experimental films, and creative inspiration for me ...
