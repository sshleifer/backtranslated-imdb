I have not yet read Kurt Vonnegut's book from which this is customized, but I am familiar with some other of his work and I was interested to see how this would translate into the screen. All in all, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. It relates to the story of an American living in Germany and recruited as a spy for the United States. His job is to interact with the highly ranked Nazi and send secret messages to Americans through his weekly radio show. But when the war is over, he is convicted as a war criminal, but flees to New York, where various unusual complications await. times. But for most of the film, schmaltz is kept to a minimum and a very strange action is transmitted by skill and self-confidence. And there are some great moments of black comedy in which there are three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and very high ranked Nazis in the prison cell. Very recommended.
