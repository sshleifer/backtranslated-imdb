For persons of a certain age, V.V. I was definitely the time of their lives, and what followed was never comparable. As the movie opens, a recent widow, but still a lively woman (Judi Dench), sees a street musician trying to play the classic song "Stardust". This reminds her of her memories when she played almost all the girls who were having fun during the bombing during the war. Drummer, Patrick (Ian Holm), happily avoided the sketch and enjoyed the women. Patrick and Dench character meet and decide to reunite the band, which leads them to a series of mini-adventures. Despite rising and falling, the band reunites and reappears successfully. The film is superbly written and understated, with the top performances of all involved. The characters are well developed and all people who have not stopped living, despite years. And there's this magnificent old rock music! This is not Stevie Spielberg's pontificate, but still a serious film. The war has affected everything and this lesson is not forgotten in a movie that is not afraid to entertain while learning.
