First I read the book, when I was a young teenager, and then I saw it late one night. About a year ago, I checked it on IMDb and found no copies available. Then I found myself on the web and found a site offered by Var Films, so glad that I did it, I ordered a copy and leaned in and was able to confirm why I want to see it again. To truly enjoy the movie, I suggest you read to get a copy of the book and watch a movie. The book is no longer in print, but I was following a copy via E-baia, author Alan Wite was a commander / parachute during World War II who participated in various secret operations, and that was his first book. It was written by someone who knows and I believe that this fact gives the book and the authenticity of the film. I did not give a movie to the film simply because of the nature of the film's end, not as good as a book. There are also several tricky lines that differ from the book, which is strange because the book does not speak about the great nature of war, but about the individual in the war. The film is very well illustrated. I have a copy of the book that allowed my son to read, and then the movie to let him watch, in that order. If you can find it in a book and movie then it's definitely worth it and I just want it to be more readily available for reading and watching, one of my best war films, ever!
