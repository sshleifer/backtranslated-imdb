This is something new. There is a coup, and a couple of Irish documentaries are right in it. Democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read The Constitution is slandered by private media openly as a dictator, mentally unstable, a new Hitler, etc. ). Oh, and still claim to be suppressed, of course. See how the media are scared of their role in the coup on television after they have crushed the government with the help of generals' roses (how much stupid can you get?). You see the people of Venezuela marching in the palace, holding the constitution in their hands, and reinstalling their elected government. This sounds like a Hollywood fairy tale, but it happened in reality, in contrast to the explicit wishes of the United States. The documentary is a historical masterpiece shot from the center of action, acutely and completely embarrassing for the main hitters. ). Also very fun and exciting. 10 points.
