My daughter, her friends and I watched this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice, and some little girls escaped. After that, I rented it so many times. Simply never grow old! Blockbuster is no longer in his ads and I tried to buy, find, rent for more than 5 years. No doubt, this was and is my favorite film from my daughter's childhood ... it has everything! We laughed, we cried, we talked about real life and how hard it is to have some children in the world. Nothing turned into this movie. We have connected to each other and every line of Bill! Thanks a million for the restoration of our faith in human nature. Frankly, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermei. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! August '07 update: <br /> <br /> <br /> Who we judge whether a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a man who has love chooses to raise a child who is not his. Maybe it's not mine or your life. This is not only convincing, it happens every day. Thank God! Keeps my faith in human nature !!! celebrate !!!!
