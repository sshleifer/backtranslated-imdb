The end of an era was released here in America in the spring of 2002 with "The Rookie", a Disnei Live action movie that looked "best for the last !!!!!" It happened right here in Texas! In fact, the story began in West Texas, which is also indicated by the area code on that sign. This is a high school coach whose high-level baseball team was so convinced that he decided to get acquainted with it professionally. !! It was a very good sports movie, ala "Mighty Ducks" trilogy. He also made films all over Texas, somewhere between Panhandle and El Paso all the way to Metropole (where I live). I can say because I recognize that the ball ("Ballpark in Arlington" is now "Amerikuest Field")! It was nice to see the ending of Disney's "Golden Age" here in my area. RIP Golden Age Disease 1920s -Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "Everything started with mouse ... and ended up with baseball. " 10/10
