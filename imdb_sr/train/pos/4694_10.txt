If he is your fan of Flight type, this must be seen! Set in the twenties and thirties, Johnny Dangerousli has not only great actors but also excellent lines. "crash the wall, crash the wall, and crash the given # @ $% # @ $ vall." "You should not hang me on Johnny's hip" or "Sounds like Johnny is lying." It's definitely a hoax of the old James Cagnei Movies and mentions a lot of them. There is a great scene when Jhonnis is walking with the death penalty and has a priest who is ready to flee. Listen carefully to reading false priests, it's pretty fun. Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays Papa. Watch his reaction to Johnny after advising the Pope, he said a lot without sound. I recommend this film to anyone who likes to laugh or are old movie lovers.
