Those in the era of horror films "Instant Gratification" will no doubt complain about the pace of the film and the lack of free effects and body number. The fact is that "The Empti Acre" is a good example of how independent horror films should be made. If you are avoiding indie racks because you are tired of unpleasant teenagers or twenty few who have been killed by some baddie whose story could be taken off the back of the Count "Chocula", "The Empti Acre" is a movie for you . Settle In The Decaying Remnants of a Village American Dream, Empti Acre "is a story of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby. As a bad relationship breaks apart, a bigger story appears in the background. In the night, a formidable dark mass sculptures from the sun-baked sunshine on their property and apparently devour all that is on its way, leaving no sign that it was ever there. The film is filled with mysterious characters and visual traces of what is happening, and ends with a well-executed ending that responds with enough questions left to confirm the writer / director's faith in an intellectual audience. It seems that there is a subtext referring to the death of the American dream, but I would hardly call it an allegory. Riveting, acting well, and technically discerning, "The Empti Acre" is a fantastic little indie who loves lovers of love.
