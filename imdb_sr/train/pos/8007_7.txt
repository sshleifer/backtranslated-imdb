This game is very addictive, I continued to play it for hours to late in the night, but also the fact that you can not save the game when you're in the universe, contributed to it, sometimes I just had to play that you did not lose any game info. So, "Freelancer" is infectious but also quite wrong. Also, for example, something that was really disturbing me was that you could not skip any scene with the scene, which resulted in you sometimes had to watch the same scene of a few minutes. It's a great opportunity for me to do more tasks to check my email or chat with friends and more, while I had to wait for the scene to be interrupted. The story starts promising, but what's more, you get more and more ridiculous. And the game also ends pretty fast, at least it did for me. It is quite obvious that they are indicating the upcoming sequel. I do not know whether the moment is below, but I'm sure that I will probably pick him up when it's published. The game is very simple! Even for those who are not familiar with the flight games. To be brave, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are quite heavy and require a lot of effort. It took me about a week to finish this game, which may be a bit too short. But thank God for the option of more players! This allows you to continue to play short missions, just like playing one player when you're done on the run. Although many missions are the same, it simply stays cool to be in the middle of time sometimes is a massive fight. The graphics are good, but simply nothing revolutionary or anything. An interesting game, but beware of its flaws. /> 7/10
