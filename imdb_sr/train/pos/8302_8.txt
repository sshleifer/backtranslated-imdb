Rifles fall, buildings explode, cars collapse, and these are only the first ten minutes. This film with the action of a packed former CIA mercenary who can not die no matter how many times he shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. Garry Busei, who is usually cast as a criminal in these flicks, has his own usual crazy charm, but he is a bit more muffled: after all, he carries the whole show. Which does not mean that there are not many great auxiliary roles, including Villiam Smith, Luke Askev, Mills Vatson, R.G. Armstrong, Henri Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulal and several other "forgotten" actors. It has enough smaller action sequences to keep the whole story: The Busei must release the group of "kidnapped" US military elites and return the high-tech "supertank" (a normal crude additive tank) -It is glued to the top back in the United States. But does America deserve this machine to kill more than the bad guys? This question, of course, is posed as in any film that focuses on the CIA ... but without getting caution.
