How this film is incredible! I've been watching him over and over again over the years and I'm always concerned about it. The reason why the movie is so easy to watch is, of course, the arrest of the young Bette Davis. She not only steals every scene she's in, she is actually much more beautiful and better photographed here (not to mention sexy) than she was in any movie she had filmed in her home studio Varner Brothers (this film RKO Radio Pictures). She wears a very flattering makeup and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, and lovely big eyes (especially in restaurant scenes that take place in London Soho). Her body was so curvy when she was young. Take it in a cheap negligee who wears his big explosive confrontational scene with Leslie Howard. Oh, boy, she's the absolute power in that scene. Howard is a little nervous, but he cares for the sensitivity of the hero. Frances Dee is a sweet, pretty young Salli who really loves him. Max Steiner is both charming and sharp. The extraordinary performances and flavors of the thirties make this version of the classic novel.
