This film is great at so many levels ... and none of them is the level at which it should have been great. Just remember this: When you watch Shauna from dead and other recent zombie movies ... whether they are good or bad ... OVO is the formula they use. This is what zombie movies make so great. And what makes it BETTER than the big story behind the movie. A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know. All in all, it does not hold back. There is never a point in which you think of yourself: "Come on, continue with it" ... ... she moves quickly and angles nicely. This is a sporty, small Italian number of zombie shifts. Such a terrible thing, it's wonderful! If your language consumes enough time on your face ... rent it, buy it, you love it. As a great trivial note: If you watch it on DVD, notice that there are sound effects through the menu screen, below the music score ... Well ... this is because the music is raised directly from the trailer ... which is probably the only working impression of that music that still exists, long enough to stop.
