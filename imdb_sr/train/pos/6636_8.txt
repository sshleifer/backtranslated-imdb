It's completely absurd to rate this film. It's like condemning (or boasting) the newborn for his future life. Instead, look at it as a powerful meditation on what could have been and what was in the past 100+ years. About eight years of cinema: what has become of the baby? I like to think about what would (creatively) happen to be that Europe was not broken (devastated) twice from the great wars of the KSKS centuries. A fake neon mansion of a non-creative and reactionary circus named Hollivood was erected on the ruins. Before 1914, French, Italian and Scandinavian cinemas were leading and financially and, of course, creative. In particular, the French film has already been fanning some very original and creative ways that could (if not interrupt) possibly change the middle history in some unthinkable way. You wonder how the film history would look today if it was not suppressed and suppressed by the commercial and cheap political program of the Hollywood 80+ years, which Chekhov could define as a stench of greed and blas ... maybe, at least be aware of La Sortie as the key ( or at least one of them) for the "Kingdom". So the birthplace of the cinema: The Lumiere Brothers Factory, Lyon, France Date: March 19, 1895 (there is a replica of the image in the summer of 1895, so if you notice the light and light working clothes: this was the FIRST FIRST PEOPLE They are EVERY CHICKEN MOVING PICTURES * Louis Lumiere: creative ideas, cinematography, the direction was all in the Louisian domain, because Auguste took care of the rest (the money), the camera (= cinematograph only) and the cameramen (only cinematographer) who had only fifty seconds for things to happen, crossing the globe. So, all the stars in the star n bu and minutes of silence for perhaps the most wonderful invention in human history (until now).
