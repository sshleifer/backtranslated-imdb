From the torrent of Austen's films from the 1990s, this is my favorite, even more than the "Conviction," which turned me into Austenian. Before I saw this "Emu," I saw two previous versions, but in one Emma it seemed wrong, more like Lada Teazle, and in the other she looked half as a possible cheat, while she looked good, young and stupid here. and stubborn. In general, I thought that the attitude and atmosphere of production had a very good transfer of the charm of the novel; Indeed, it is one of the sweetest, happiest things I've ever seen, preferring in the nature of Christmas delicacy. The scenario is unusually well-formed, and the adapter accessories, such as the light shaft that reveals Harriet Emmi in the church, are in line. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would expect, but I enjoyed him very much: he put out the usual, practical side of the character, unlike Emma's feelings, and his hollerish outbursts against Frank Churchill are pretty funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Voodhouse character of almost Carrollian Absurd; Samantha Morton as Emma's ward is exactly as soft and accurate as it should be. And as in the same producers "Pride and Prejudice", it is taken into consideration that eventual linking of a character can be believed - in some cases unique. For me, this production was still a delight.
