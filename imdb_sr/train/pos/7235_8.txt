"A Girl's Follies" is a kind of semi-comedy, half-mock-looking look at the film business in the mid-1910s. We got an insight into life in the early film studio, where we are experiencing the installation of sets, running through the scene, handling fans of film fanatics, and even lunch in a commissar. We are also familiar with little-known movie facts - for example, did you know that "Frequently" actors of the film "do not know the plot of the picture in which they work"? The action of this movie is essentially the discovery and romance of the Kenneth Driscoll movie star of a young starlet whom he discovers while recording at a location in the country. I believe that the 30-minute version that I watched was shortened, included on the same tape with Cecil B. De Mille's "The Cheat". It's a very authentic movie - easy to watch with a great addition. As a bonus includes some of the best illustrated titles I've ever seen following a silent movie.
