This movie is not good, but it's good and pleasant. It looks like an indie movie made of scenarios. Morgan Freeman basically plays alone, although the director is kunning that the script is not written for him. And there is a small irony of an actor who goes to the supermarket to explore a film that has not yet been dedicated. I mean, he finally made a movie in the end and we watch it :) Dialogue I considered too positive for my taste, but nevertheless refreshing. This is a movie that inspires the viewer to look at his own lives and choose the direction to go. A bit too much emphasis on the look, if you ask me. Conclusion: a nice little movie, made in two weeks, with two actors and several statists, leading the dialogue, makes you look at Morgan Freeman Good :)
