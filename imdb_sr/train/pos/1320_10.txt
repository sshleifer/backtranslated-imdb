Early in the mid-1970s, Clifford Irving proposed to write the final biography of Howard Hughes, claiming that he spent several months preparing for the book, engaging in interviews with the withdrawn millionaire. When all of this turned out to be false, Irving was charged with guilt and spent several years behind bars (although he always admitted that his findings were correct). Switch to 20001, a few months before September 11, a book titled 'Forbidden Love' (published in the United States as 'The Lost Honor: Love and Death in the Modern Day of Jordan') from a formerly unknown author named Norma Khouri, a woman from Jordan, reporting death on her best friend Daliya, due to the fact that Dali, from a dedicated Muslim background, met with a Christian. This, like Irving's biography about Hughes, was discovered as a potential fraud. Australian filmmaker, Ana Broinsky, is trying to embark on a wetland that Khouri tried to clear off from the lies. During a 104-minute period, the film is trying to find out if Norma Khouri was telling the truth, or is she just a compulsive liar, with her agenda / vengeance? Interviews with those who knew her (including her ex-husband, her publisher, and others) told her story. This is a good, well-produced documentary that manages to hit many fingers in the same number of potential culprits. It is not rated, but it contains an ubiquitous bad language and a repetition of a horrific scene of murder, played several times (but nothing like graphic and disturbing as it might be seen in the latest tormented porn epic, such as Sav: Part 84). It's not a good choice for small ones.
