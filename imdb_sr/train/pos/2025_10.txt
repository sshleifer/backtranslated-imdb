The An Anthology novel An Brontes TENANT VILDFELL HALL should be studied and read in schools, libraries and the living rooms of the people. It's a fantastic story and talks about the "true" truth about alcoholism and ruined marriage, and mothers struggle to keep their son away from her brutal husband. Its so similar today's stories that we see and hear and I believe that people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on the possible true experiences the author had in the 1840s. Watch this movie, its great version of the book and really very touching. I'm sure Anne would be pleased with the way she was made. Excellent acting and excellent location.
