I just watched this movie on TV .. I lost my dad when I was young and this movie touched me safely. I can feel the lost girl Desi senses .. Feeling that I want to see my father again. I would like to talk to him .. or at least get the chance to say hello. . So I am touched by the letter she was written ... By saying that her father read the letter, and sent her back to someone to answer her and buy a gift because there is no store in the sky .. Just gives me the feeling of miracles exist .
