They had me from the first performance. Welcome to Trinity County. A sleepy little place like Maiberri with a small difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There is a spoiler. I would not understand it in 10 minutes anyway. Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep it good, but it's a difficult battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb loves to spend time with him and teaches him the paths of darkness. Subtle. Damn, cunning. He does not always go as evil. Most of the time is a hero. Everyone owes him a great favor because he often creates an accident and saves them from it. Every time you think someone is finally going to knock him down, one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage him. In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in the woods in the cockpit, and some of the guys with guns decided to rob them. Lucas used this as an excuse to teach Caleb an evil lesson. The robber (Ted) hesitated to kill them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half a conscience. If he had no conscience, he would kill them so far. Had he had real conscience, he would never become a criminal. He started to call it Half-Ted. It was pretty fun. He called criminals. And of course, he stayed 10 steps in front of Half-Ted at any time. And, of course, he was in complete control at all times. In fact, they had an advantage over Satan. Very excellent performance. It was one of my favorite horor shows of all time. Tvilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of fear American Gothic Supernatural It's a good company.
