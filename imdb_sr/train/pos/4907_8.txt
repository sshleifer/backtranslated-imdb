Well-designed and imaginative production, refreshingly free from clich√©s, this little picnic affair tells the story of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less ideal conditions: a man who escaped a prisoner who kidnapped his youth as hostages. Expert in Alan Gibson's direction with a fine feeling for a balanced narrative movement, the film gives freshness in almost every scene, such as the criminal Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his refusal to parole was specially unexpected, invented intricate, but ultimately successful plan for escape. , after which his spontaneous nature comes to fruition while fleeing to a residence on the lake of his childhood. Often shouting in the song or dancing a few steps, hiding Steckert gradually attains the trust and affection of his prisoners and, as the police approach the unavoidable bargain, tied pairs largely coincide in responses to forms of refusal, as observed by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Vagner) assigned to help the lazy lieutenant of the police (James Coburn) who is in charge of the search for Steckert and his "prisoner". This is an amazing story, valuable exhibitions, a quick and new adventure that benefits from Harris's capital performance, a fine turn of Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black, and Justin Henry as a freaked boy, with Vilfred Josephs contributed with a suitable horoscope, and Frank's top cinema Watts, with all the recordings shot in the beautiful autumn province of Ontario.
