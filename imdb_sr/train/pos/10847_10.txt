I'm 60 years old, guitarist (guitar / rhythm), and during the last forty years I've been in four bands, there's everything, fights, disturbances, rotten food, poorer accommodation, always traveling, little or no money, and each was drunk or tall. But clubs, fans and music have made everything worth it! Just like Strange Fruit! Now I am too damn old, and arthritis in my hands and my hips does not mean more swinging, but due to the length of that video, everything came back and everything was there! Birds, quarrels and drinks! And I was young again! It's like Billy Connolly's voice, God loves those things in the '70s! Rock On Forever!
