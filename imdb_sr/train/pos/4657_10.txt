Hot Millions is a great movie in every way. A fun, unconventional story with beautiful performances by four best professionals ever in business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant, as usual, and Maggie Smith - definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time - is a complete enthusiasm. Karl Malden and Bob Nevhart complete the acting and are also perfect. If you want a movie that has a perfect casting, that's it. What is so impressive is the way these people work in such a natural and effortless way, creating a lot of laughter and fun moments. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a great sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. Mode, photography and editing are also top-notch, and this is a great time capsule of London in the sixties. It's definitely on my favorite list.
