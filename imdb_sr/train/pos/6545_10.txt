I really enjoyed this movie. Most reviews are bad, but most critics think the film should be like a drama. This movie has little drama, but the rest is just pure entertainment and very fun. Forget that Julia Roberts is a beautiful woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young lady and she is more than just that. Emma was so amusing to look at Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. I believe they will go far. Nancy Drev may not be based on books, but the story is still good. There is also a good mix of other actors and auxiliary actors such as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostvick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan. I'm surprised that Disney did not publish this movie. Some people may not like this movie because they do not contain sex, violence and cursing. This is a good family movie that is rarity nowadays. So take your family, watch this movie and estimate how good it is. I can not wait for the sequel.
