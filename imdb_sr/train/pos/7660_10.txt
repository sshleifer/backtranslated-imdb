This film is nothing but a dark, dense masterpiece. Maybe I'm biased because the era of apartheid is an area I've always felt. But I would say that this is fine with Cri Freedom and Cri the Beloved Countri. Unfortunately, I have never heard of this film until a few days ago. Inside is one of the most disadvantaged films of all time, probably because it was a small film company, which I have never heard of before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors, is already persuasive and dramatic, Nigel Havthorne is playing his insidious role. Do not look for humor in this movie, you do not have it. It's real, wild and persistent to the last one, and for a sensitive one I'd say to bring a box of tissue. But movies that are so big to ask, why is this for the biggest movies often not heard?
