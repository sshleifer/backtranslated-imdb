Sunshine Bois is one of my favorite movies. I first saw him when she was a Christmas attraction at Radio Citi Music Hall when she first came out and loved her since then. In the end, I saw him 6 times in the movies, and if I play today, I would go out to see him again. Now many comments here mention wonderful performances. Matthau was brilliant, but he was unhappy that he was nominated against Oscar, Jackall Nicholson, who defeated Randall P. MacMurphy's "One Fli Over the Cuckoo's nest" roles have been played to perfection, such as Fritz Feld at the audition for chips advertising. What brings me to the reason for considering this film, directed by a lot of underrated Herbert Rossa, who had previously made two Man playing "Owl and Pussy" on the screen and made her entire film out of it, doing it again, opens up shows without looking like a photo shoot. in the movie before we get to the scene that opens the show, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about a special Comedy, playing in the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is brand new. A few years ago, I saw on the Broadway revival of the performance with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was wonderful, but I think Ross and the screenwriter, Simon, improved the game. just a wonderful movie.
