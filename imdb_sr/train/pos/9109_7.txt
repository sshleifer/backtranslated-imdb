It is mostly a story of two men who were part of the Portuguese Revolution. It was easy to understand the competition, but usually the leaders begin from the historical fact that they are talking about something else, or they show a period before or after this fact, everything is happening here for several days when the revolution works. It can also be considered a kind of documentary film. The film focuses on these two people, showing it as normal that they are, and not as ordinary heroes, because the revolution comes from people. Although it is from a military army title, you realized that these were just "chiefs" as the main characters. Beautiful colors and lights throughout the movie, an excellent job for directors as the first movie, it does not fall in a banal way. Well-shown emotions and passion for people and the audience. The character Maia (the main) is well made and there is a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi, who is able to show the Maia borders, this non-hero.
