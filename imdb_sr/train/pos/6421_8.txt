"Honorable Men" - a true story of a proud and persistent Black Navy (phenomenal Cuba Gooding Jr.) Is definitely a great movie that touches and entertains and is part of the absolute cream of the new millennium film. Wonderful acting is the main reason that this movie is something really special and quite pleasant, great experience. Charismatic Robert De Niro is wondrous as a rude, fierce and ruthless boss Billi Sundai - the role is practically written for him. This film, along with the fantastic 15 Minutes (2001), are two of the latest evidence that he is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, "People of Honor" include a fine performance by Cube Gooding Jr. who was one of the most promising young black actors from "Boiz n the hood". "People of Honor" goes straight to Jerri Maguire, "Good as it gets" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. is a skillful and fantastic actor and I am ready to get a lot of great movies from him. "Men of Honor" also has a great story and probably the most exciting diving sequences in the history of the film. This is a great, fascinating movie and I can only recommend it.
