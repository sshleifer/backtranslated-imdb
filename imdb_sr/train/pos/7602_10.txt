The first season was an incredible, whole idea to adapt to the island, while the mysteries explored (and seen) were phenomenal; filled with uncertainty, tons of cliffs, and an incredible plot. I mean, I like the whole idea to see them get used to the island. And then the first sight of a smoky monster in the first episode really attracted my attention. Since then I've been hooked. The second season was fine with the first season, just a little better. I absolutely loved the idea of ​​the covers and the initiative of DHARMA. The entire action and sequences of the second season were mysterious, creepy and exciting. I loved all the uncertainty that surrounds others on the island, but the story of DHARMA really made Season 2 incredible. Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but nevertheless, great. I loved to see the stories of others, to see their camp and to see the mysteries that are being researched. ("Tricia Tanak is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, though not so good, was still amazing and fun, but above all exciting! Now, the 4th season. I had hopes for this season, and the first couple of episodes are good, but then POČELO has become boring and monotonous. I mean, I really despise new "savages" like Miles and Daniel. The action remained old after the first few episodes ... and THE HIGHEST EVERYTHING ... Season 4 was taken off from something that made LOST the perfect series: Mystery, uncertainty, comedy intrigued (Charlie went) and general excitement. Also, some of my favorite characters have left.
