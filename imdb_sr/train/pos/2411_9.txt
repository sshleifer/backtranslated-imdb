This film seems to me as one of the most successful attempts ever to arrive at acceptable answers to some of the controversial questions that have emerged in the recent science of the "Suffering" (suffering and death of Christ) in the New Testament. (What made Judah motivate money was not a problem? What could lead Sanhedrin to meet on a high world day? Why is Pilate waffle?) It's a movie for a serious, contemplative Christian: the fans of "Christ's torment" will undoubtedly be disappointed with the lack bloody spectacle and port characterization. As far as I'm concerned, here is a portrait painted - the willingness of ordinary people to sacrifice their commonly shared power in such a way as far as their own interest is concerned - far more realistic and deeper disturbing. (Not interested, "just doing my job" look at the face of a man who drives the first nail in Christ's wrist is as cold as any other movie in the movie.) The film does not claim "authenticity", but the settings and costumes are constantly feeling "more correct" of much more praised efforts. It is a slow film, but if you accept its self-imposed boundaries (that is, after all, "Death" - not Life - "Christ", is ultimately very useful.
