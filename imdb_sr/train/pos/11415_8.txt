This is a great movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I both love dancing and we come across this movie in the video. We had to take it. Without violence and such stories of warming, a great movie for relaxing and enjoying the night. I would recommend this film to every family or just a group of girls looking for a sweet film.
