Poor Basil Rathbone, an egoistic composer who lost his muse. He has been playing for some time, buying verses and music from various sources. The problem is that two sources (Bing Crosby music) and (Mari Martin vords) accidentally meet and fall in love. And then they discover what they were doing. Complications appear, but in the end, everything is corrected. Crosby and Martin are singing great. Mary signed a contract with Paramount and at the same time doubled as a regular radio show Crosbi's Kraft Music Hall. For reasons I do not understand, the film audience did not contact her, so she returned to Broadway and made One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. Basil Rathbone in one of several times played the comedy very well. His ego is constantly deflated by assistant Oscar Levant and again I am surprised that they did not record more films together. the previous reviewer on the title melody performed as an improvised jam session in the pawnshop. Good job for everyone. Amazing original shop and great fun.
