It worked from 1959-1973. It's more than its longevity that talks a lot about this series. He also survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50s, the psychedelic 60s, and the other popular 70s. It was a successful combination of all of its elements from stories, actors and productions that made it remarkable. Lorne Green had his own definitive character from this series. His appeal was a generation. All family members could enjoy this. It balances morality with violence, humor with seriousness. A series of cartoons was made as a spin off of it as a result of its influence. It's a shame that this series is no longer repeating and many will not know its significance.
