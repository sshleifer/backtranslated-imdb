Back to roots with "as in heaven" - what are the real values ​​of life? These Swedes sing out a message that appeals to every heart. We saw him twice in a cinema filled with the last place: pure love and joy in choir music that is simple, but full of power when everyone finds their inner tone. From the glory of glory to the school of your youth, now empty and ready to adapt as a new home after falling on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and enters the lives of simple, warm and rough people in the north. He wins hearts with music and gets the ability to love and be loved unconditionally. You're standardized at Hollivood. This thing does not contain any additions, just your laughter, your compassion, your tears!
