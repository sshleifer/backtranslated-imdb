I think this film was one of the good films of Kurt Russell. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor and I think he is a good actor in any role he plays. But this film had lots of action in it and I know it should have more than 5.6 out of 10 per meter, but many people did not like this movie. Oh well I thought it was good, so I think everyone should see this movie. If you look at this movie and love it, I think you should see Back Draft and Kurt Russell. I give a soldier *** 1/2 from *****
