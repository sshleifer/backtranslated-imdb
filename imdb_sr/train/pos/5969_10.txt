This movie, as Carrie met Heavi Metal. This is a high school student who has been selected to a great extent and is completely revengeful with the help of Heavi Metal Spirit. It's such a classic. Soundtrack is A ++++. You have live legends about Metal in it. And Marc Price was great in this movie. This is a must for metal lovers.
