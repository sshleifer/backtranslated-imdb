The Three Stooges have always been one of the many actors I loved. I love almost every of the short trousers they made. I love all six Stooges (Curli, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curli Joe)! All short films are hilarious and also featured many other great actors and actresses that many of them have been in many short films! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors ever and the funniest comic team! One of my favorite Stooges short films with Shemp is none other than Husbands Bevara! All that appear in this short text are beautiful Kristin McKintay, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alin Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Makine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntire provide great performances here! There are so many funny things here. This is very hilarious. There is another similar Three Stooges short like this called Brideless Groom and I recommend both!
