You do not become darker or more tragic than "Othella," and this film follows the show, with the exceptional performances of Lavrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne expressed Otto's plight as he fell convincingly to Iago's lies, even gave a real epileptic episode. Jacob is a beloved and loyal woman who becomes either an instrument of Iago's revenge against Otto, or the object of his anger (it is not clear which of the reasons why the motive for Iago's behavior is not clear). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, he's a little marginalized. The characters of Kasio and Emily are also wandering and coming out of the scene, although they, like Iago, seem more decisive for the plot. I did not watch a movie against the show to see how many lines were cut out, but I know that Shakespeare is very well developing his characters, even seemingly unimportant. If I had a Criticism of a movie, it would have been that the story proceeded too fast and that the relationships between some characters would no longer expose. The director played a great role, and nobody offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassia and Othello and the one between Emilia and Desdemona should be further developed earlier in the film. I have the feeling that they were closer to each other than the film suggests, even though you got a feeling for it very late in the movie. Also, Otelo and Desdemona need more time together. Although their suffering is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other seems to seem to have just met. On the other hand, he may have just met - like Romeo and Juliet. In short: good performance, too short. <br /> <br />
