. . . he was on the UHF channel, and the reception was very vague. I really would like to own a movie, because I first watched it because I was a bus driver and when I saw this movie, I drove that bus model. Only (during his murder trial, some 15 years later) I only remember that OJ was one of the stars in it. I only remember that he was a driver and that the bus was shot and wildly guided. I've been looking for this film everywhere without success, since I watched it in the mid-'80s. I liked the film, I do not usually watch the thriller, but after I read the summary in the TV guide and looked at its beginning (though vague), I remained for the whole thing.
