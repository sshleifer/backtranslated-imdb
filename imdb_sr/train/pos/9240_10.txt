I found this movie in the video, it cost $ 2 for shopping. The whole movie smells very bad! The so-called colonel, who would be a hero here if he could be trusted, must have been in the eighties and can barely walk. He still manages to kill some of the dumbest ninjas in the world. Then the story leaves the colonel, which makes sense, given that the old man's inability to do something worth mentioning, now two terrible guys from the eighties, who take up the role in some kind of story. I lost a hundred times, but I did not mind, because the film is so bad, it's fun to watch. Trash without budget with actors who do not deserve this name. Go look!
