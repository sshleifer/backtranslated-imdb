It is a recommended masterpiece, not just for the main theme of the story, but for the incredibly brilliant and ingenious work of Angelopoulos, not to mention the acting of the giant, Mastroianni and Moreau, as well as the extraordinary visual representation of Ilias Logothe. Performance Gregory Karra may look shadowy to his "solid" partners at first glance, but in fact he perfectly plays his character, revealed in his last scene with a girl (Khrisikou) and a man (Mastroianni), although he foresaw in advance. (From here and spoiler.) Accept your expectations! It is an "artistic film" in any sense that the phrase has to offer and requires attention. Not for spending free time, but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as when reading a book or attending a concert. Due to the overall photo style, it is recommended to watch on the big screen. Dialogues are used by the savvy. However, the film includes - in addition to standard Greek and English-speaking - fragments that are spoken in Albanian, Kurdish and Turkish, which will be attractive to those who are fascinated by the beauty in listening to different languages.
