Peter Falk is a versatile actor. The film is well written and the acting seems like a real life. For all lovers of Columba, this is a great job. Because it shows what kind of talent Peter Falk is. He does not play the detective who plays a retired carpet dealer. By the time the credits start to play a role, you want to watch it again. An interesting part of the film is that the message will refer to every person who is watching; the depth of its perceivedness will be the only thing that will vary. It's a shame that Liberals in Hollywood only promote smack and skin because it's the kind of film that people in business need to be proud of. This would be a great movie that would turn into a live theater show.
