Super, unusual movie from Audiard, Read Mi Lips is a pulp, a lone thriller. Perfect for the charming charisma of Vincent Cassel and contains remarkably performed Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a repetitive characteristic of Audiard in the same way that KArin Viard appears for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (all referred to as unattractive in this movie), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile. This is almost the definition of her role as Carla, the dog at the office, upset by colleagues who use her deafness. However, she finds ami d'ekploitation, if you like in Cassel's ex-prisoner Paul. Each of them uses the unconventional talents of others (stealing and reading lips) in order to fight in their situations and form an unconventional romantic approach. Devos / Audiard manages Carlin's deafness and her companion, distorted by the inner world with discreet, modern charm. with a truly visceral experience that will become a great hit - the Prophet - nine years later. 7/10
