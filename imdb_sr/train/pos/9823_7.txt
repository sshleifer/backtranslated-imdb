I really thought this was not so bad. It's not a great artwork, but Dermot M is a far stronger performer. Patricia Arquette overcame most of her time. He actually played a cello that was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. Besides, he's an incredibly beautiful man. Really sexy. Add that talent, and most of what he was was much more tolerant. He always gives everything, even if some of the projects in which he was involved did not hit the highest score. Unfortunately, he was in some weird films that just did not sound at the box office. Always with A-list, but not always "hit". But he "is worth every penny" of any DVD that is leased or purchased. See the wedding date with Debra Messing - one of his best overall films. EVERYBODY EVERYBODY! ; ) (if you have not seen it yet, do it, then you will understand that quotation!)
