Another of those brilliant young men who came out and dared to make a teenage romantic movie (can I actually call it - it would cause the devil from their fans) to a micro budget, but full of such a taste, sensitivity maturity. Peter Sollett - You deserve more admiration and respect. Thank you once again for demonstrating the forces that are in the "industry" that stereotypes can be emptied into the toilet. One location, a lot of rich characters, low budget, good acting (and those are amateurs), decent lighting - true Indian cinema fans should watch this and watch STOP ... so ... you know what.
