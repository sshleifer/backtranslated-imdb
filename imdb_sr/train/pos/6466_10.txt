I really liked this movie and the audience I saw in Los Angeles. After the film, many cried and talked about how much film influenced them. I see why it was such a big hit in his homeland, Sweden. The film is masterfully directed and every character is brilliantly drawn so that in the end you really know these people and take care of them. Music is very natural and the main song in the movie is quite cordial, but inspiring. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone to see - even those who do not usually watch movie titles. He definitely deserves an Oscar nomination due to the deep topics of the film that are exaggerated in the community of small towns with everyday people. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. A MUST SEE!
