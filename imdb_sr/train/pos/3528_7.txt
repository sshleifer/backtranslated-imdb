I rated this film 7/10, which is an average of 8/10 for screenplay, direction and 1944 production values ​​and 6/10 for acting. heroine Ella Raines as Carol Richman who was excellent at 8. 10. I also praise Thomas Gomez as an inspector of Burgess whose character assures that he personally does not think that the guilt of Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is just because of his naive alibi. These two then form alliance to prove Scottish alibi. I have this movie on the DVD "Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro" in Spanish as "La Dama Desconocida" with the original soundtrack "Ingles" as an alternative language, since despite searches I could not find in complete English version. Still, I wanted to see another show by Elle Raines after I was impressed by her performance as a heroine in the "Impact" playing of a female garage owner. the other beliefs of a heroic role in the innocence of their chief engineer, and rejects a few suggestions that she should return to her house in Kansas (her name chief) for her to resolve the missing alibi. The fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a bit difficult I believe because she formally looked like she had a formal business relationship with her. However, he designed the children's homes and playgrounds, so I guess the "family man" was lit in Carol's brain. In the 1940's "movie code" in the work, producers could only show sex through metaphors and it's here in the form of an angry drumming played by Elisha Cooke jnr. Carol is a doll as a girl's lighter virtue in an attempt to swing the drummer in giving her information on the alibi "The Phantom Ladi". Another major character, Jack Marlow (associate Scott Henderson), plays Franchot Tone whose performance was too theatrical and wondered why Carol did not notice him permanently and strangely, for example, while theater movements telegrated the action too soon for the audience is to improve the scenario.
