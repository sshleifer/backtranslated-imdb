Something too long and in the end, this comedy is an extremely beautiful, never humble or funny look at the problems of a "powerful man" who likes to wear women's clothing in the newspaper. Julie Valters is as beautiful as ever, but Adrian Pasdar is totally authentic and steals a movie. He is absolutely gorgeous in high heels and silk stockings.
