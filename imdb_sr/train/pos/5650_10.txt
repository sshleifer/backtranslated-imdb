"Someone in the door". OHHH, How do I miss this show so badly ... but we're lucky to have an "Invasion" now. Thank you, Shavn Cassidy. American Gothic, it was all. If I had to choose the one thing I liked most in the show, it must be her "unpredictable line". Favorite actor was Lucas Black .. I love this southern accent. I bought a DVD as soon as possible, and my kids are fans too. There are some hot nations. Some devil. So, if kiddos will watch, you might want to edit (fastforward / skip). It has humor, at the level of Joss Vheedon, which is so lacking. An adult and a situation with adults, who are handled fine. The DVD has some accessories, but I want to have more. If you want to be thrilled and enjoy a great performance, come to watch "American Gothic"!
