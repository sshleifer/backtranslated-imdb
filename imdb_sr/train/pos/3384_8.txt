My Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Compared to today's brainless film (just action and special effect and nothing new about ideas), Soilent Green is looking for something that does not exist today: Think. Surprised one day to eat human "cookies" that are created with the body of man. With all that is happening on this planet, and to see how people are so indifferent to everyone, this kind of future is possible. Rich in paradise, the other in hell. Fortunately today, TV and idiom as "Realy Shov". TV is a good brain to wash. It's a shame to see that people's intelligence has not advanced as technology. From the moment of writing everything stops. If you love to realize shov, this movie is not for you. If you believe all the politicians. If you do not like to ask yourself a question about the present and the future, never watch this movie.
