Like Amelie, recent French films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship, centered on a woman who finds her true love. In this case, despair leads to convicts, which leads to its evolution into the prototype of the mafia. A smart and surprising story in many ways, except that the female is there to support a man. For those of us who do not speak French, the subtitles are a bit quick, but not unreasonable. Soundtrack, as it seems to be more and more the case with European films, is excellent in perfect synchronization with movie variations. Nothing is forced. Visually reminds me of various urban horror films. There's Ves Craven from Chicago.
