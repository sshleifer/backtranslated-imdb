This may not be one of the best films ever made, but it's actually very pleasant, the light heart of the foam in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time. It is recommended only for a good feeling. OK, so the "acting" of Frank Sinatra leaves much to wish, but his singing is a great redeem and songs perfectly fit into the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra continued to make many more films in which his undoubted ability of acting glinted, but in this, his first venture into Hollivood, his voice, and not his acting, his main contribution to this film. I just watched it again on TV and still raises my mood as much as the first time I saw it many years ago.
