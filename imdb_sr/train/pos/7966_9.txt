As a kid, I thought this film was excellent. She had animals, she had great music and she had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fok. Now, I still love this film, for various reasons. There are well-trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look great on the camera. He has a beautiful, well-written musical that perfectly adheres to scenes, with exciting tunes and the main theme that troubles the heart, which still cry me. Even when people do it. And that's my favorite actor, Michael J. Fok. Based on the book, this is a story about three pet, an intelligent, overly confident and considerably fatherly lab called Shad, a witty and futile - but still smart - cat with a fear of water called Sassi and street smart ridiculously curious and a little neurotic bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to the farm of friends when their family leaves. Worried and worried, pets break out and plan a journey through the Sierra Mountains to travel their lives. A truly incredible journey. So what, maybe it's home just over this mountain. But what if it is not? I propose Homevard Bound for people who love three wonderful actors who give voices to the main characters of animals, and for anyone else ... yes, everyone is going to watch.
