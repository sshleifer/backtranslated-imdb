If you have not seen this obscure little charmer, you should look for it. This is the story of a messy, Sad Mac (Fred MacMurrai) who is on the list 4-F each time he tries to join any branch of the army. He finds a magic lamp that, of course, contains a gene (Gene Sheldon), but the spirit is even more uncomfortable than MacMurray, sending it over time to serve in all the wrong times and places from the one he wants. She's cute, cheerful and clean, and you can not like her. Stories are much like Disney's film, especially since the two stars (MacMurrai and Sheldon) made numerous Disney movies in the 50s and 60s, although not together. Needless to say, everything ends up well for everyone, and the viewer goes to feel pretty good.
