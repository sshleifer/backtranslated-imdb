This film surprised me. I watched him 2 or 3 times. I really liked this movie. There was a lot of the truth that this film made. I love all the characters in this movie. This movie makes a lot of sense, because society "becomes more advanced" What culture loses? It does not sound big. I can really get in touch with this movie from the baby's hood and lose my life that will never come back or ever be the same. This film is on my top 5 films I've ever watched. There is only such a crude truth that I feel when I watch a movie, and this is not the truth that you have to dig for your real face. The creators of this film did a great job and I enjoyed this film very much. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you will like it.
