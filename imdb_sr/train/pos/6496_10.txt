An example of how to make a World War II documentary, using first reports on actual troops and civilians involved in this terrible conflict, and archived footage collected from that time. a year and a half ago, without any knowledge of the Second World War at that time, but it was overwhelming, and now I consider myself the World War I, I watch and read everything and everything I can find about it, but nothing is approaching this significant documentary film, definitely worth buying packs in a box ............. This is a simple documentary making of the highest standard.
