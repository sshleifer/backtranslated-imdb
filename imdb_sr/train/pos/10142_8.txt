Maybe it's just because I have a fear of hospitals and medical things, but this is under my skin (forgive my dear). This piece is brave, not afraid to go over the top and be pleasing as it comes in terms of revenge movies. Not only did I feel a lot of hatred towards the screver and a lot of sympathy for "screw", but I felt like I was bothering and feeling biting disgust at certain moments, which is really rare and wonderful thing for a bit exhausting horror viewers like me. Some parts are very reminiscent of "Hellraiser," but they are subtracted as tribute, not as imitation. It's a difficult piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider, but I enjoy the attack of the movie once and for a while. This piece brings it and does not apologize. I liked this very much. DO NOT watch while you eat pudding.
