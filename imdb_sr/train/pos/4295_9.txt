Alain Chabat claims that this film is his original idea, but the theme of the unwilling fans who finally merged him is old, if not older than Shakespeare. Chabat is a "vieuk garcon", happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to upset his life. He has a problem, 5 nurses and a matriarchal mother - G7 - who decides to marry. Come in to the beautiful, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what a simple plan should be. Charlotte must be presented as Chabat's girlfriend and then simply does not appear on the wedding day. There's no more talk about G7 marriage. Of course, the best-placed plans have the habit of getting out of control. Lafont has a very strong supporting role as mother and Osterman as Brother Gainsbourg. There are some fantastic scenes like Charlotte first needs to charm, and then revolt the family. French Farce with English.
