"Stories of the Century" was a half-hour series and appeared in the first series of unions during the '54 -'55 television season. It was also the first Western TV series that won the Emma Award. In the role of veteran Western actor Jim Davis, Detective Matt Clark, the series was set by Clark and his colleagues on the railroad detective (Mari Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristina Miller as "Jonesi" in the second half) against the historical relegate of various periods from the middle 1860s to the early 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to watch and fairly realistic, mainly due to Jim Davis's casual charm in the main role. He looked like a real Western character. Another note. If Matt Clark arrived in the city after a long ride, he looked like he was on a long horse ride because he would be covered with dust. Very Good Adult Westerner.
