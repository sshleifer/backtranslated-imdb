Finally, a film in which the audience fully determines what will happen. Well, we all know that the life of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Havks), will spirally lower to destruction, because where else is there to go, but we do not know how or when to the end of the film. Hoffman is excellent, as usual, and even Houk was decent as a younger brother who basically does what he was told, because he really can not think of himself. Havke may have been a bit out of his element, but he played well enough. Add this mixture to Andy's wife, perfectly played by Marisa Tomei, cheating with Hank; Andy's misappropriation of the company's drug addiction and sex addiction; and the father who finally reveals exactly what happened on the day of the robbery. This movie will make you think.
