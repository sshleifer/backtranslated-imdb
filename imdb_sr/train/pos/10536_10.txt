Yes ... I'm going with 1-0 to this and here's why. In the last few years, I watched a lot of comedies and left only a few mild laughs and a couple of fees for leasing video cards, because the films were so easy to forget. Then I stumble upon "Nothing." It looked interesting, although it did not expect much. I was wrong. This is probably one of the most entertaining films I've ever had to watch. Dave and Andrew made an excellent comic couple, and humor was attractive enough to remember, but not too complicated to the point of missing a joke. I do not want to comment on any real scene, because I feel this is a movie worth watching once. With more and more meaningless concepts coming into the movies (you know, like military jet planes and "fresh" remakes that destroy old classics), this movie will make you happy when you say that it's ok to laugh "Nothing."
