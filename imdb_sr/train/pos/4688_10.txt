I showed it to my school in grade 6 about 17 years ago, and the students admired her. I was glad too. The story of Termitas and their interaction with the environment is incredible. The head of the being is deep and everyone plays their parts well. The battle between two cold-blooded titans is a really classic shot. Alan Root made incredible work on the camera and it should have been Oscar for the best documentary film. The copy I have does not have Orson Velles's narrative (Derek Jacobi) and it's not called "Mysterious castle castles", only "Clay castles". This makes me think that this was done with Velles, who added star power and the Oscars. I was lucky enough to find this VHS just recently and it's now my child's favorite movie. They brought him to the last family gathering instead of the Disney movie. If you can find this movie, you're really lucky.
