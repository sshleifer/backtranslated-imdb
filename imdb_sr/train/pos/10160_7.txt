I entered this film thinking that it would be a shitty movie. I came out surprised and very funny. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had an incredible comic timing. Jokes in this movie were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two straight jokes between. The action was sufficient to tie it all together, the woman (Eva) dies on the wedding day and returns to persecute a woman who comes out with her future husband, sounds incredible, but in fact works well. 7/10 - Generally watching movies, if not on DVD when it comes out.
