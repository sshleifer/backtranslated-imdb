The second topic concerns a young woman in London who desperately seeks a job, happy to accept the secret position with the older woman and her son. Trilaters about people who are kept in the house against their will always disturb me a bit - in the end I feel like an inmate - but this rather elegant B-movie is neither crazy nor claustrophobic. It is strained and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is fast on her feet. It has not been shown that this transmission in 1986 (as "Dead Winter") is wise, because the action-elements are not modern times. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short in 65 minutes!), But it stays on a nice course up to the overclocked climax, which feels a bit messy. *** from the ****
