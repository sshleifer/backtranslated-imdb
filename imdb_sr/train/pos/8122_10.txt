I've never seen this movie until I bought a tape last year. I was delighted and fun. It has all the elements of what I like to see in the Sci-Fi story, in a book or on the screen. There is social commentary, speculation and good story. There is something funny and fun, looking at the distant future from the 60's and 70's from 1936. I think that must be seen, not just for scientists.
