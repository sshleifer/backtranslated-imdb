The usual work in the film consists of the main characters who leave the city crowd behind and are in the peace of nature. In the Power of the Province of Kangwon, we are shown two stories about individuals doing just that, trying to get through the road to popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province. However, rather than epifanal moments, we have two characters whose journey to nature is just another form of escape. The pace of this film is slow, contemplative. In the end, we found out what everyone really did bring to Kangwon Province and learn how they are connected. For those who want a Hollywood glamor and a movie that will give them the ultimate answer, this film will not satisfy. But for those who want a film that leaves them thinking, they wonder, influencing them a few years later, this movie will more than satiate that longing.
