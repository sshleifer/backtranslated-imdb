I enjoy Ralph Bakshi films ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the underrated animated "Lord of the Rings"), and I am a collector and fan of Frank Frazette. I am also a fan of the sword and wizard who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Barrow and Robert E. Howard. I missed the "Fire and Ice" theatrical performance in 1983 and I was looking forward to seeing it or somehow reviving it since then. That's why the release from 2005 became a dream for me. However, I bought it with a bit of anxiety, because I was hoping it would not be worth a look at once, then put it on the shelf as a "collecting" dust until the day I died. Luckily, my fears were unfounded and I was pleasantly impressed with this film. As with Frazetta art, this is a persistent film that has physicality and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy / sword and magic films. without being cheesy or dirty. Art is good and you see the best of Frazette. Even my young men liked to watch him with me and asked to watch him again and again. However, my wife has some remarks about the scarcely dressed princess (very Frazet-eskuire). I do not mind it because it is convincing and there is no sex scene. Used roto-scoping, but I personally enjoy roto-scoping. It gives more fluid and realistic motion to characters that are hard to find in animation. Despite some problems with continuity, I recommend this film to all Bakshi, Frazetti, Conan, and fans of sword and magic. Enjoy!
