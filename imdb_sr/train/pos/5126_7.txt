For Urban Covboi John Travolta plays one of the stronger alpha men ever shown on the big screen. He is a decent enough young child who leaves the parental estate and hits the big city of Dallas where his uncle Barry Corbin promised to find him in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, the boom began and Texas was definitely growing in the United States. Travolta works well for the audience to pay attention to his character which, when you get to him, is a sextig pig. She also met with Debor Vinger, a woman of the same origin, but she has some ideas that women should not be the shadows of their men. And when he strikes Gilli's mechanical creature, a male game, that's it for him. Scott Glenn, who is a former convict, works in Gilley and this film is his role. He's a real snake in Urban Covboo, he gets a Travolta goat with a full glance and moves towards Winger. Travolta in turn takes over the rich girl, Madolin Smith Osborne, who fights with Gilley. Despite the characters, Urban Covboi was indeed a huge advertisement for the biggest honky tonk in the world. Gillei is no longer in the suburban community in Pasadena, but the memories live. And the best thing about Urban Covboi is a wonderful score of the countri / western songs that were shown in the movie. I'm not sure if some of the songs were written specifically for Urban Covboi, but this is the only reason I can remember why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this film. I especially liked Johnny Lee in the search for love, if it was specifically written for this film, it's a shame that he was not nominated for the best song. I liked Debra Vinger's figure best in this movie. She does not lose the trail of femininity, but opposes Travolta and does it in style. And this review is dedicated to that still unknown woman who will be one of the first female riders in the Professional Bull Riders.
