Another for the Babes & Bullets audience. The story is much harder than any other musical I saw: the cannons hid the missing legs of females, and put them generatively in the other in a way that approaches an intelligent comment than we could expect for localization. More effective than contemporary 'drama'. It's hard to identify with a woman holding guns in her trousers - in traps. It's pretty unusual if you consider the context. Despite a cannonball that provides 90% surprise, this film also records how greed replaces all other considerations in the life of a group of iakuzas seeking a woman who holds her leg in a hidden cannon / rocket launcher (hence no group showers or japanese ) A hidden missile launcher that emerges from the background of the protagonists back, apparently out of nowhere, into the miike's Dead or Alive (1999) The copper that the heroine drove out of the air to the end of the original Tomie (2000) or the terrible scene of the flame launcher in Sunni Gets Blue ), testify to the almost third world of Cantin Hair-Esquire influence in contemporary Japanese film, about which I have no idea, but I can not complain. You will not see quality movies of this essence made in Hollywood, all is almost extinct and cheap shit that pumps for cheap excitement, everything is just funny. This is a true film, and while its great as a whole, the ending is a brilliant, if not ungrateful, seizure of certain images of Sergio Leone, including cannons where the legs should be, and certainly appropriate!
