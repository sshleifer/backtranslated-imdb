"Panic in the streets" was a decent thriller, but I felt a bit disappointed with it. The central theme of the city of attacked pestilence in modern times is fascinating, but the film never explores or develops. Well done and fun, but not as interesting as it should be. The scenario for this film is really weak and brings the whole movie to the end. None of the central characters is really convincing or convincing. Fortunately, the film is very well made to compensate for weak scripts. The director of Elijah Kazan keeps the film uncertain and is moving at a fast pace. There are some standout sequences, especially an unforgettable climax. When his direction was combined with better scenarios a few years later, man could generally not do it badly. The acting is also very good. Richard Vidmark has always been the leading man who can be watched and does what he can with a signed character. Paul Douglas spends his time by screaming too much, but also a decent job. Extraordinary places in the actors are two villains. Zero Mostel, famous primarily for comedic roles, is effectively a joke as one of the top characters in the film. Jack Palance is, not surprisingly, an angry criminal. "Panic in the streets" is disappointing, but worth watching. (7/10)
