When I took the place in the cinema I was in a cold mood and I did not plan to change it. But this film is a dramatic force. I was in a sweat and I needed a shower. So what are we? Theoretical story about the age of a teenager living in Copenhagen, Denmark. It soon occurred to me that the plot seemed almost completely borrowed from "Bend it like Beckham", where we had an Indian girl who played football and broke the marriage of her sister. Here we transferred him to a Turkish girl who destroyed her brother's marriage by working Kung Fu. And of course we have a love story and a competition. After accepting this, this really proved to be an exciting, emotional drama and showing some beautiful Kung Fu (although I'm not an expert). The main actress Semra Turan is not only a champion of Denmark, but also a great performance, so it seems safe to assume that there are plenty of autobiographical impressions here, bearing in mind that this is her first film and no education as an actress. The rest of the support is fine, the camera is good, Kung Fu is intense. Sidenotes: - The male Turkish audience showed respect, so they had to do something right. - The crowd roared when our heroine finally kicked off and attacked the guys who severely beat her brother in retaliation. - Xian Gao, Chinese filmmaker Kung Fu instructor / actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon), played the main role of the master. good and intense experience and I do not know if it works on a small screen
