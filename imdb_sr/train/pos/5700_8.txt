I read many negative reviews of this film and finally I got the opportunity to see it on DVD. To be honest, I really do not know what the problem is. It is a decent thriller, shown from different points of view, from the eccentric act of often drugged potential killers / suspects, including the late King of Pornography, John Holmes. Please read the synopsis of the plot for the exact details of the action of the film - I want to contribute more to the review than the synopsis. Many reviewers have gone so far as to give this film the lowest rating due to violence, but I really do not see it. Many modern films were burning - Saving Private Rian was ultimately more violent than this film, which often relies on implicated bloody stains of real brutal murders (the killings shown in this film were made with lead pipes, after that). I was delighted with both halves of the film - the first showed John Holmes as a hopeless hungry drug addict, and the other half showed his side as a little conspirator in a meaningless bloodshed. The film has a great acting, although Dilan McDemorant looks more than a little in his biker-eskue person and crazy boyfriend. Soundtrack was also great - a fantastic blend of 70-year-old B-rock rock and pop-up pop, spanning a few hours in all the right places like Boogie Nights.
