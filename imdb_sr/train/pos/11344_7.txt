Pufnstuf is what it is. I've seen it at the cinema since 4 years and I'm very pleased, and alive, remembering it. Watching this as an adult allows you to capture references that are over the head of the target audience - as part of Jimmy's gray wig, and Vitch Hazel (Cass) mocks: "KNOW she had brown roots!". Of course, it is under the strong influence of the culture of the floral power of that time, and in some ways very advanced. The Different song, for example, sends a clear message to young viewers that you are alone, not to run with a pack, and the nurturing of what is in question is different. It could be an anthem to a gay community, it should be, a great track. Martha Raie, Cass Elliot and Billie Haies are brilliant as witches, and living islands are doing their best. restrictions on their character suits (include Billi Barti, Felik Silla and other famous names). There's a lot in this movie - there's nothing subtle, and when Little Jack Vild has to show his concern for the abducted inhabitants of Living Island, it's really a bit more than shouting. This is a drama and comedy that spreads with a spatula. Though I think about it - I could never stand a flute. I like the sound surface, especially the above mentioned different but also the Zap world, Pufnstuf, and even the touch of Jack Vild. Moreover, it is now on a CD of delicious people at El Records in London. See here for more: vvv.cherrired.co.uk / el / artists / pufnstuf.htm
