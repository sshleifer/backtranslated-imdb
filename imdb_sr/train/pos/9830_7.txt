Nobody really understands the logic of numbering Italian zombi-shifts, but ?? honestli ?? Why should we be tortured? Each movie in the Zombie Series brings a lot of fun, unpleasant ups and free shocks, and "Zombie 3" is no exception to it, despite all the production difficulties that happened during the shoot. This film began as an interesting Lucio Fulci project, which had to elaborate its success in Zombie 2, but ended up as a typical Bruno Mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films. The scenario is hopelessly incompetent and ignores all forms of continuity, every genial idea of ​​George Romer's "Night of the Living Dead" and "Crazies" is shamelessly repeating and the acting performances are really poor and painful to watch. Nevertheless, this did not disturb me for a moment, for the sublime upper crowd made up for everything! On a secret military base in the Philippines, scientists have completed the virus of bacterial warfare "Death One" and prepared it for transport. After an unsuccessful attempt to steal the virus, the infected body of a terrorist is cremated and zombie ash contaminates the entire population of a nearby tourist village. The last group of survivors has to fight against hyperactive and inhuman strong zombies, as well as soldiers in a white overalls who have been instructed to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area. This film is comparable to Umberto Lensi's "Nightmare Citi". It's really bad ... but incredibly fun with quick action and a few very creative zombie-mad situations. The dead birds were genuine, for example, and the entire sequence of zombies in an abandoned hospital was also cool. The notorious flying scene of the head is not nearly as terrible as it was designed to be and perfectly belongs to this cheesy and totally cozy Italian zombie. Recommended for fans; do not bother negative reviews.
