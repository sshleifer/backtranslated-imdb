This is a cute little horor hoax / comedy with Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most horrible horror hostess of all time. This was supposed to be a pilot vehicle of Elvira and it was so successful that it was picked up by the NBC network. They shot a television series pilot to show the baby's bust in black, but unfortunately sit-com never passed the pilot phase because of sexual references. This film is, however, very fun. Elvira is a modern Chesti Morgan and a queen of a one-liner. A few years later, this film was followed by the sinless "Elvira's Haunted Hills", which was supposed to be taking off the old films of Roger Corman, but fell on his face. Watch this movie instead of a much more entertaining experience!
