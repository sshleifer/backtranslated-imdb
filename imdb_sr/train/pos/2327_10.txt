A 14-year-old girl is developing her first serious fall in love with a 17-year-old boy who lives nearby while at the same time trying to overcome her inadequate feelings compared to her older sister. It is a simple premise of this beautiful, poetic film about the birth of director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is known for directing Year 42 in 1971, and in 1962, "Kill the Bird Mistake", two giants of the older genre. Here she directs newcomers in the lead roles: Reese Vitherspoon, in her film debut, as a 14-year-old girl; Emili Varfield, as an older sister; Jason London, a court, a 17-year-old boy. Reese Vitherspoon is astoundingly good in her film debut, showing every emotion the 14-year-old girl feels when she experiences young love and injury, never hitting a fake note. Both Varfield and London are equally good. The film accurately describes the thoughts and feelings of each adolescent in terms of love with sincere sensitivity, never exceeding the maudlin's exit even once. Honor for the autobiographical scenario by Jenni Vingfield; This is one of the few films about young love that is honest and consistent in the tone without an emotionally dishonest or sensationalistic one. Music is beautifully simple, emphasizing the tone and mood of the scene to the scene, but it never becomes intrusive. Beautiful cinema is the famous director of horror Freddie Francis, who was recorded in his 70s. Tess Harper and Sam Vaterston play girls of the girl with the precision of the dead target for 1957, caring, strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is good as a boy's mother. There are feelings to be solved, lessons to be learned, and truths that you can confront in this sweet-natural movie that contains an emotional blow. To date, this is the latest film by Robert Mulligan. This is one of the best movies from 1991. **** of 4 stars.
