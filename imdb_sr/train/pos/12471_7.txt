I did not know the real events when I sat down to watch this, just the fact that it was based on a true story. After the death of the child's father, Rhonda is trying to help her daughter Desiree (... I did not know that someone actually called their offspring) to deal with loss. This is really made for children, as is often the case with "family" shifts (in other words, go and gather everything for watching, even though I would keep teens out of it, unless you are sure they are buying the concept), but that does not diminish the sting that is the death of the parents, and this does not actually tell anyone. The action is interesting enough and it's moving enough. The acting varies, and excellent Burstin surpasses most of his colleagues, Mathis is following him fairly well, and Ferland and her peers (with few exceptions) are least convincing in the group (and frankly speaking, irritate; I'm really not in this audience. Installation and cinema are standard and certainly not less than that.While humor is limited to a handful of fun lines, the tone is not unpleasant.In this there is an intense scene.I recommend this to fans of these types of films.
