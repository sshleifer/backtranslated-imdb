I personally saw many Disney movies in my life, although absolutely none of them matched in any way with Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I would not personally go through a live action with animation, it was a step forward in an attempt to dress as animation characters. The film contains three evacuees from World War II sent to stay with a quiet and socially awkward woman in the country. I should say that the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsburi made the perfect Miss Price, while David Tomilson caused great interest of the entertainer. The ending always surprised me and it was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, although I do not know if it was deliberate. The dialogue was not great, but since it was designed to be a children's movie, that's fine. All in all, I would give the show nine out of ten, a dialogue of six out of ten, casting nine out of ten, and a costume of eight out of ten.
