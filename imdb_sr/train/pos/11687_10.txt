My affection for Chris Rock varies with his films, I hated him after Lethal Veaphone 4, but after that I hated everything in that movie. Well, this is still best for him, he did not expect it to be so good. Chris Rock brings a sweet, wonderful story, accompanied by some of the funniest comedies I've seen for a while. Loved it.
