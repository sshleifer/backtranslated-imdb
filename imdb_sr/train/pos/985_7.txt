This film is in many respects like the "enemy of the state" with Villain Smith and Gene Hackman, because we have an innocent (black) man whom the "government" is pursuing with all modern technology a famous man. Usually when this story is copied like this, the result is a disaster. It does not apply here. Of course I like everything that David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were other good things about that movie then. The main baddy, played by Doug Hutchison, was brilliant, and the story touched with great accessories such as David Paimer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Fokk), still irritated most of the work. He is so insane, he breaks bad jokes, does not cause audience sympathy. Or not for the beginning, the strange thing is that it somehow grows on you (and its followers!). I did not expect much when I rented it, but I was surprised by a good solid action movie with comedies. 7/10
