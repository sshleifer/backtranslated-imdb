The master blackmailer, based on the short story of Sir Arthur Conan Doille, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus of Milton", is the first feature-length story about Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett I saw. The story is interesting and dark. The film has a somewhat gloomy, sad feeling, but it's pretty fun (with some particularly funny scenes). Spelers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Vatson are trying to discover the identity of the illusionary. a blackmailer who destroys some of the most prominent families in England by publishing private letters that will, in one way or another, destroy their lives. In the end, they find out that it is Charles Augustus Milverton, an art dealer, after several tragic consequences for victims who could not afford to pay. Our heroes should help the next Mrs. Eva Blackwell, who has to pay a sum that is beyond her character, otherwise her upcoming marriage will definitely be revoked. The scene in which Holmes and Watson imitated Milverton's house are intense. Although the film is essentially a happy ending, the tone is sad and sad. Outstanding performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwick (as usual) and Robert Hardy as the infamous villain (most of the audience probably recognize him today) as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter, Serena Gordon as Lada Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson like Agatha (the scenes that included her and Holmes are messy). I give her 1/2 1/2 *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough Inspector Lestrade. (I would like to add them to the scene at the end of a short story in which he gives a description of two burglars, one of which matches Vatson.)
