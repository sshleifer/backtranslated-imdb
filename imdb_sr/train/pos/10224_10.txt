... and I really mean it. If not literally (after all, I did not see every movie that has ever been created!), At least, obviously, among many, I know. 5.3 ??? The IMDb thumb is this: sometimes movies are highly rated (for example, a piece of Kannes-Kompetition-Krovned-Korean-Kraap called "Oldboi") can be really bad. However, rarely when a movie worth watching is actually rated below 6. This movie, worth watching, is. Shame. True, I give him 10 in protest. The film is not perfect. The right rating should be 8 or 9. There are some actor's failures (especially Belafonte), the scenario wanders around, sometimes. However, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all time, the Czech Jan Kadar, the director of the two greatest actors of all time, the beloved, the greater life Zero Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska in the acting / poetic / moral tour. Couple made in heaven! It's true that this film, in addition to minor shortcomings, does not resemble the average audience, but those who are interested in watching excellent (although, again, do not overlap) the film of the incomparable director who gave us the "Store on the main street". (the best ever Holocaust film) should not miss this just because some stupid IMDb system decides that "American beauty" is better than "Angel Levine". No.
