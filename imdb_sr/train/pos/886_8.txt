This was one of the DVDs I recently bought in a set of six called "Frenchfilm" to clean our French pre-planned holiday in the beautiful Provence this year. To date, as well as improving our French language, we have significantly improved our recognition of French cinema. What a breath of fresh air in a stagnant, predictable, unimaginable, broken blow from Hollywood. A good example for screenwriters, actors, directors and cameramen. It was so stimulating to see two distinguished characters in the main roles, without having to be great figures on the cover of the magazine. The other thing that I liked about this movie was a slow temper and a complication that made you guess how it would all end. Is there really good in this selfish bandit who constantly treats a seemingly naive benefactor with such disrespect that would be shown by a former prisoner? Will our sexually frustrated poor half-deaf heroine show her answer to her dreams and the situation her fate gave her? The spectator is intrigued by these issues and the actors discover the answers slowly and convincingly as they face the events that challenge and shape their feelings towards each other. When you look at this movie, you love me to see it again. I still have to elaborate the psychological motive of the sub-plot director as a conditional release officer, and some of the subtle shades of camera work are worthy of another look. The action requires little imagination when our hero has the chance to help our abused and overburdened heroin in the office. You also need to be broad-minded to believe in her brilliant reading of the lips and how some of the actions fall into place. But if you go on an exciting ride with this example of French film at best, you will go out more than happy. Four stars out of five for me.
