The plot in the pen and the suspicious features have no difference when the movie is fun to watch like this movie. Lively action and spectacular acrobatics - for their day - give this movie a real zip. And there is a real comedy from Ripe Chemistry between the two tracks. Kuinn is also a good criminal, although his role is completely overshadowed. But do not be fooled by Maureen O'Hara in his wide role. You may be able to forgive this because of the time it was made, but it is still difficult to pass. For all heroes and disgusting adult situations outside the screen, this is still a bit more than adolescent time.
