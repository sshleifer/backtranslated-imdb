This film was created in 1948, but it is still true today. Very, very funny. It starts with a family that wants to buy a little place in the country and then "builds" it. Anyone who has ever built a house will find this film very expensive. Great cast. Cari Grant and Mirna Lloyd are wonderful in this movie. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the great style of the 40's .... clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are related to the price of things, and these comparisons with today's costs are quite astounding. I can not imagine that no one enjoys this film completely. I am surprised by the number of middle-aged people who never heard of him. A real classic.
