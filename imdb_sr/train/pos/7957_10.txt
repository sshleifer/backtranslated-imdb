Hey, guys, I was looking for where to find these two films and I can not find them anywhere in my local area. (I am an Australian). Can you please help me and tell me where I can buy it. In General Home Vard Bound 1 and 2 are the best films I've ever seen and are good for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie Venus I was 5 and it's still even now when I'm a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie except my younger sister, because I've been watching so many times that she is enough. I love this movie and I can not wait to buy it again on DVD. Salli
