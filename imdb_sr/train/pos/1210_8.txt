And my kids love him now! I agree, now I can watch it and realize that the animation was not so big, and that the plot was loose. Hey, if every villian introduced himself by saying "I ammmmm DAAAARRKK HEEEEAAARRT", I think they could laugh, but for young children it's a moral story with attractive music. , that I still had words memorized after I did not see this film for twenty years. I would definitely suggest this for younger children.
