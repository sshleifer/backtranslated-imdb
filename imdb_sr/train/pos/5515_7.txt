I read a bit about Che before watching this movie, and you want to know something, he was a real hero for people because he just wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces are doing to his people like everyone other Latino Americans in general! Now, I do not know about others, but for me he did the right thing by wanting socialism that everyone should pay their share. However, the powerful elite apparently did not want to go to it. So, instead of figuring out what Guerever wanted, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to suppress the revolution. It did not work because there were too many of his other followers who just picked up where he stopped. A good example was when Castro continued with his leadership in Cuba. As far as I'm concerned, and as Che said, before he died: "If you kill me, that's fine. But you kill only a man, you will NEVER kill the cause!" I could not say that better. But ... EVERYONE ... so I gave this film 7 out of 10.
