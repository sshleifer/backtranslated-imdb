The Matador milestone lasts roughly half the film when Danny, an incompetent man from Denver, sits on the balcony of his hotel in Mecico Citi, enjoying a quiet moment. Someone knocks on his door, and knowing that Julian, a paid killer, refuses to respond. But is he real? Richard Shephard, the director of "The Matador", is a character, Julian Noble, who does not show any redeemable quality. In fact, we've already seen it in action, doing what works best. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real Bar in Mecca Citi, he spins a bean and tells the new acquaintance what he really is doing for life. Danny, who came to sell his program, is a Mexican company, but seems to compete with local equipment that seems to be at the forefront of getting a deal. Danni is a naive person who is a prey of charisma and charm that he received from a smarter Julian. Only after a while, on a cold winter night, the killer appeared at Danny's door asking his friend to pay him a favor and went with him on his way to Tucson. At this point, the secret that connects them is revealed in an unexpected way. Pierce Brosnan, acting against the guy, makes a major contribution to his disrespect for Julian Noble. Just to watch him walk through the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boots gives a real impression of his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the right part of this odd pair. Hope Davis appears in only a few scenes, leaving us to regret why she did not stay longer. Philip Baker Hall appears as a connection between Julian and his tasks. Richard Shepherd manages style by working with his material. The music is Rolfe Kent and the sharp cinema of David Tattersall improves everything.
