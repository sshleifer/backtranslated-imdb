All right, I admit that casting in the movie is really strange - part of it is due to complication, but I still had problems with the belief that Pierce Brosnan played this advantage (although he really did a good job). It is based on a true story about an Englishman who went to live with Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He claimed the Indian was mixed blood. He was, in fact, so successful and well-conceived that people came from all over the country to hear his lectures and be taken to his desert trails - although he was not a blend of blood Indian and all his knowledge was from books or fake! The film focuses on this and what happened when fraud was discovered. The performance and the settings were great and I really liked the movie (once I stopped the disbelief about Brosnan). She did not get a widespread distribution - probably because she was pretty cerebral - not Bond's movie or romance - just a really strange movie about an extraordinary man.
