If you love movies with animals, this movie will appeal to you. My wife loves animals and animal movies, especially loves parrots in this movie. She was directed towards children, but I was the most laughing-out of humor. The French fashion figure smiled at me and added a balance of scripts. It's a Disney movie, with its sarcasm, a happy, family appeal, but I like to leave the theater with a positive temptation.
