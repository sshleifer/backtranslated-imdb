I found it to be such a romantic / drama that has a nice ending and a generally good feeling. It's not the Hallmark Hall Of Fame type of family-run sleeping before a marriage that is considered "normal" behavior, but given that she plays Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would expect a much rougher film, albeit a language. The most impressive part of the film is the display of how difficult it is to learn to read and write when you are already grown up. It's a great theme of the movie and includes some moving scenes, but, to be honest, the film is not so unforgettable. It's still pretty mild, a nice story I would recommend. .
