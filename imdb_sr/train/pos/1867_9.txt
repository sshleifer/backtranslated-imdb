This is a film about life, a triumph over the troubles and wonders of the human spirit. I'm not letting anyone get rid of it until the end of the movie. This is more than just a tear, its interesting drama that provokes thoughts with the great performances of all actors, but especially Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. Seven years later, I'm amazed that Luke is still unknown, and that Washington is just another movie. However, in addition to slow construction, a story about the temptations and troubles of this foster child and how it still affects him in adulthood is the kind of film that stays with you long after you've seen it. Like many fox fiction images, this was more hit and did not get the massive critique it deserves. The scene in which Antwone finally met with his mother summarized the film for me, there were many ways this could have been done and it could have been all that or could have been unrealistic, but Washington was hit by the exact tone, his mother she never said a word, and she could only shed tears, while the antwerp simply asked why. Her prevailing guilt prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend her? One of the most discerning movie scenes I've seen.
