As a Pokemon fan, I enjoyed this movie. It presents new legendary pokemons (like any movie) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. However, I do not expect those who are not pokemon fans to enjoy it (this includes MOST adults). Some of the lines were truncated, but this may be a bit unavoidable when the film is switched to English. The animation was beautiful, although there were a few pieces that did not look good. And although the villain is somehow torn off, I think the movies have done bicycling through different types of criminals, and I assure you that not everyone is like this. To those who do not like it, I tell each one, but Pokemon fans will worship it.
