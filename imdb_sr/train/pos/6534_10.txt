I heard this film is good from many of my friends who saw it, and everyone said it was incredible, so I had great expectations - and Nancy Drew surpassed those high expectations! She had funny parts, entertained me with action and all the guys who tried to kill her, and Emma Roberts was amazing as Nancy Drew. The rest of the actors were also very good. I would definitely recommend this movie !! Nancy: "I wonder why these guys were trying to kill us!" Corki: "Yes, I was wondering about that, in fact, it's somehow I'm looking for!" Nancy: "I hate when people are trying to kill me. It's so rude!" ~ Nancy Drev
