This is the picture that John Laser made today, that there was no progress in the CGI. And that's just to say that he would have been forgotten if technology did not make things sexy and kevl since 1983. in Picard Flick, it is executed only under media restrictions c. 1983. Innovative animation techniques combine with a brilliant screenplay and great pronunciation to create a film that appeals to many levels. It should be talked about the same breath from Spirita Avai and _Toi Stori_.
