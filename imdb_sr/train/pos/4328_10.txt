I bought a DVD of this version to compare it with the current version of BBC 2005 (which is great). In 1985 he adapted Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spies to TV and who died this year (2005). I remember great acting, especially from Riggs and Eliot, and moving music. (Music in 2005 version is much more subdued but very pronounced.) Just to pick up other commentators on several points: Richard Carstone is Ade Claire's boyfriend, not Esther. Esther did not have an uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook in any version, nor played Tobi Esterhase in TTSS! Krook plays the comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby was playing Bernard Hepton. Both versions are an honorable and wonderful adaptation of Dickens' great novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and sentimentality can make you sometimes joke, but I'm defying you not to cry - and you're laughing!
