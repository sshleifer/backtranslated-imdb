Kazan's early film noir won Oscars. Some of the reviews given here in incredible details and the length of the film and its symbolism, and highly estimate. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer to focus on a long forgotten movie that seems to have been shot virtually without a budget and in a quasi-documentary manner. A pelvic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and a military doctor (Vidmark) and a city detective (Douglas) is to capture the main bearer (Palance). The film is crazy, shot in black and white and is very well used by locations. Vidmark is as good as usual. Forget the symbolism (crime is equal to disease, and illness is equal to crime) and just enjoy the search. It's not always easy to watch a movie like this now when we're in good shape in this new century, because it's a very special style that was very short-lived (after World War II to the early 1950s) and it's unlikely to be interesting for a random movie watcher. For those who are watching this for the first time, sit firmly for a great pursuit at the end. That's something else, and honestly, I do not know how they filmed something of it. I can say that it took a lot of time to shoot a finale, as was the first 90% of the movie.
