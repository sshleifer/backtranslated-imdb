When this first came out, my dad brought it home - we were amazed by it - it was so different from everything we've seen before. Last night I was looking for a certain movie and I found Mind's Eye again. The box is falling apart, and I'm surprised the tape still works! Although it's not a quality 'Finding Nemo' graphics, it's still very good. They should resell this - it's a landmark for computer animation. It is recommended! It is what is: Mind's Eie is a spectacular odyssey over time. Your journey begins at the dawn of creation and moves through the ascent of man and technology. Travel to the world of abstraction and into the future with breathless images. Mind's Eie joins the imagination of over 300 most talented computer animators worldwide with powerful, original soundtrack music. This unique collaboration leads you to an incredible journey to "Mind's Eye."
