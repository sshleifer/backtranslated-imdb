The movie can be great. I watched him last night, but I feel incapable of expressing it honestly because I first read the book. The book is much better than the movie I disappointed with in film. If you plan to watch "Of Human Bondage", do not read the book before. On the other hand, the book is so good and contains much more than the love affair that Phillip has with Mildred, you can still enjoy the movie. I'm not saying it's easy. I regularly read a book every 4 days and I read such different authors as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" gets my voice as one of the top ten novels ever written.
