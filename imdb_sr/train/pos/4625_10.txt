Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most incredible and most beautiful film I've been watching all year. It's a prison program, somewhere in California, if I remember well where prisoners practiced and performed various Shakespeare performances every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production "Storm" from casting through the performance, and in this process we learn some pretty amazing things about these people, who are all in the heaviest crimes. The truth is really more weird than fiction - if one tried to adapt this story to a fiction film, the audience would never have bought it, but knowing it was real, it took away breath while watching - literally; I sigh loudly when I found out about a particular gifted crime. It's like some funny episode from Oz, and more fun because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.
