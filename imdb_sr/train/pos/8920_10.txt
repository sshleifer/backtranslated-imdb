I did not know about Steve McKueen in 1958. I just knew that I was very scared to watch this movie. (I was devastated by the movie "Trantula" with seven years ... but now I was ten years old). The first scene in which Blob crawled with the help of a peasant rod and took his hand was enough to make me leave the theater. But I stayed and suffered every attack by our monster. I felt such a horror when Steve and his girlfriend could hardly get out of the office (poor doc), and even more when Blob went into the cinema and ate a large audience. . . So much is the fact that he is oooooozzzzzed from the front door, too huge now to fit through only one. It seemed indestructible and unlimited in the potential of growth, and when he captured poor Steve in a restaurant like a sieve, he looked like a safe dinner. Say that Blob was cold, it would be a modern description, but in the end, better ice than scare and mental rupture of young children. I remember how I walked home in the evening with my Uncle Nick, trying to act bravely. He knew that I was in trouble, and when I got into bed that night, I could not just feel Blob in the room, but when I got the courage to look down into the floor, there was a red pulsing, heart hungry type sitting, waiting for me to I try to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. Now I'm 57 years old. . . I made it. Of course, Blob is not destroyed.
