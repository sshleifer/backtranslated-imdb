Hello: I heard about a lost friend who had obvious differences in opinion about the party, he liked it. Well, I watched an episode or two in the early seasons and I was bored, so I exhausted it. After a few years I came across a lost one; boring with the current sci-fi tariff. I was surprised. Can you say that gravity is good, I'm damned in. Speed ​​and scripting are very good, some of the flashlights back / back are so with lamer characters, but above all good ones. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Saiid Jarrah, Savier, Hurley, Daniel Faradai, Jin & Vife, Valt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's Dad. Jack and Michael are definitely immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. Kate 1 step above them, Juliet was much more glamorous than Kate. Mr. Eco is underestimated at the level of Charlie, if not more, the damage they both died. A guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (back) is a real curiosity. As a whole, a great, very layered series: we are looking for more. Sincerely
