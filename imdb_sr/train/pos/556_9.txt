Cowboys James Stevart and Walter Brennan take their herds from Seattle to Alaska and then to Canada to apply. Once there, they have to fight with the seductive, shifted business woman Ruth Roman and the icy cold, happy criminal James McIntire. John Vaine can talk about even more, but his good friend Stevart has made some great, hardcore, some with great director Anthony Mann. Frankly, I would take this, with solid action sequences and fine melodrama, across North Alaska every day! Also, there is also the strong support of the ever-reliable Brennan, Rome (which is great), incredibly sweet Corrine Calvet and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types of bad guys, that kind of Do not take it too seriously . This would represent an excellent dual account with another highly recommended Mann / Stevart north west-west, Bend Of The River.
