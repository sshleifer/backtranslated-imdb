Having read many other critics about this IMDb film, there is obviously a consensus among purists that this film is nothing like the books on which it is based. At this point, I can not comment because I have never read any of the protagonists before. However, what I can safely say is that it seems to me that many of the above reviewers have certainly gone through the sense of humor bipass; Let's be honest - this movie is fun! Okay? .. so I have to admit that the film is obviously not representative of the character, but let's put this in a clear perspective ... are the same individuals involved in this film also complaining about the fact that the classic Batman series from the 1960s remains faithful to the original character of the comic DC? Or maybe there is the same unrest in the same people that the 1980 Flash Gordon movie was too far away from the original series? The point is, that this movie is an incredible camp, but it's just his Ex-Tarzan, Ron Eli, plays the eponymous hero in this (and he's carrying more than a passing similarity with Gary Boussayem for lifting!) And is supported by a great team that supports all have the ball with their roles. Also watch out for a very short but very welcome performance of Michael Berryman's favorite horror film. Best scene? Too many can be chosen, but look at the funny expressions of the face accepted by the waiter, when Savage and his men committed the ultimate faucet of the order of cocaine, lemonade and milk on a formal occasion! Also often seen is the scene at the end of the movie where Savage deals with her hostile captain's seas using various martial arts disciplines that are marked on the screen! ?? Inexcusable! Simply put, the movie is not taken seriously at all and it's more fun for him. Great fun from start to finish! (and you're singing John Phillip Sousa's customized theme song for days after it's guaranteed!)
