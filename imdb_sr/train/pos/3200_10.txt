This is a great Canadian comedy. The film talks about how the stars Jean Paul Tremblai- (Julian) and the lead writer of the show and his friends Rickie and Bubbles play across the top of what is a real-life satirical view of the parks behind the trailer and residents of the garbage. . The film will tell you why Ricky and Julian begin to make their more advanced attacks on the world of crime. WHY and the reasons behind everything would be a spoiler, so I will not give the right reasons for their brilliant escapades. Their friend and often partner (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The entire show is brilliant and the missing movie will not affect the way you see sit-com. It is a comedy with the capital C and a brilliant satire in a vibrant park trailer and a small rogue with little time ideas, but great weather dreams. If ever you have the opportunity to watch - buy - steal this program, grab it. You'll be glad you did it. And to my American friends - and that will break you. 10 out of 9. Brilliant. TV should be TV.
