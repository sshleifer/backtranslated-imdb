I was lucky enough to see it on the last night's recording (October 20th) and I was incredibly surprised by the wonderful complication and the true feeling of the heart. While the plot is not particularly complicated or extremely new, the story takes place in a way that feels fresh, unique and distinctly "indi" in style. This is not something that can be easily compared to movies from the past, it is a unique phenomenon in the classic depressive love story of middle age. Especially I was delighted to deal with the movie. Until the last addition to the family, it was wonderful and talented. The three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly distributed between them, and neither of them "shook" the other two. It was truly a wonderful film, suitable for all ages and laughs loudly funny, and at the same time truly touching and warming hearts. It was a wonderful break from the sexual jokes and the nudity of recent movies.
