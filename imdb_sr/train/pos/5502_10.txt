Whether this movie is propaganda or not (I firmly believe it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how good Chavez is. It's really to show how the Bolivians saw how it happened, Chavez's way to see it. Although it may seem wrong and biased to support the film, I think the viewpoint shown in the movie is extremely legitimate. The Venezuelan people through a private media corporation in Venezuela saw only one side of the prospect of a coup, a neo-liberal side. This film shows us how the Bolivars saw it. Call this propaganda, I say it's your court summons.
