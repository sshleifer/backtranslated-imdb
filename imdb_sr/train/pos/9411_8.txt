Sidney Straton has problems maintaining job positions in various textile factories, mainly due to experimentation in textile laboratories. Stratton is experimenting with a formula for a new fabric that will create an ultimate fabric, which never fails, never folds or breaks out. When Stratton finally creates a fabric, he creates enemies in all textile workers (who will lose his job) and owners (who will lose money because one mill has exclusive rights), so that Stratton becomes the most compassionate man in England in his white suit. The film is ideal and only Ealing could do it. Guiness's performance (and great support such as Greenvood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the film a delightful, but true hero is the story itself, a beautiful satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance, and uncertainty. Rating, 8.
