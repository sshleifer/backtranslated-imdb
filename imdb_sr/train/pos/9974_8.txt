It must have been a remake of the 70s movie, but he had the uncertainty and action of the current film, say Breakdown. He runs, desperately wants to be with his hospitalized wife, the police are least worried. The potholes were very good, and the part with him was turned off at the stop for a vacation was well done, the end of the movie was a big clipper. This is better than bullit, boring movie with what, hunting muscle cars that is badly shot? Vigo's character knew what to do to avoid Johnny Lava, several films had night vision, CB radio. The ending is excellent, you can not tell if he's lying his suicide or not, very good done-to-or-no.
