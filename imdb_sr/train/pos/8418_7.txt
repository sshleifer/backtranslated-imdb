The Russian 1969 emigrant director in Hollywood, Villiam Povell, deals with his epoch about the Russian Revolution and hires an old former emigrant emir (Emil Jannings) to play the genre of the film, and the two of them re-live the drama and memory of the woman they shared ( Evelin Brent), 11 years ago. Try as best as possible, I feel it's hard to warm up to the "Last Command" for all its virtues. 'The Docks of New York' was an undoubtedly great movie, and 'Undervorld' is a movie I always wanted to see, but 'The Last Command' is quite difficult. The premise is fascinating, but the treatment really makes the script come to life, except in the sequences set in Hollivood, featuring a wide range of applicable add-ons and a great deal of film production with cutting-edge technology. Emil Jannings is, predictably, a marvelous Russian general, who is distinctly distinguished between the traumatized and worn-out old ex-general, transformed into his misery, and a strong, hearty officer from the past. The ending is excellent and worth the wait, but in order to arrive there you have to prepare to be a little annoying at times.
