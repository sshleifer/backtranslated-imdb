Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love, and mom and dad can also have fun watching. Growing up in the 80s I enjoyed this film, its action and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD so that when I have my children, they will be able to have fun watching this movie as I do. The action is fun, a group of children, moving on a journey they never expected when they threw themselves into space thanks to a robot that overcame it. They were first in the arena, but when they realized they did not have enough oxygen to go back to panic. When they extracted enough oxygen from the space station, they returned to the country as even better friends and newly found respect for life.
