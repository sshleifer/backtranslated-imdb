Hello Plaimates. I've never seen this movie for the first time ever and it's also my first experience of Arthur Askeia, I must admit that I was very impressed with this film. As an admirer of black and white films in general, the passport for pimples, the mafia of lavender and Tommy Trindher (who is obviously a distant cousin), this film complained of providing good old British humor. I noticed that there are some here who have criticized Askey's performance, but in my opinion this is a test of time as a fine example of forty comedic actors and if something adds a picture to creating characters that are more than ordinary stereotypes you can now dominate movies. If you can reach this film, I would recommend that you capture it, the shame that these films are mostly not shown on Sunday afternoon. I am also glad that I had the opportunity to look at another part of Arnold Ridley's work (Private Godfrey in Daddy's Army). thank you
