This film is a perfect example of a movie that divides people into two groups. Those who get a joke and those who do not. People usually attack what they do not understand. This film has a chic style and charm that has not been unique since. It's EXCELLENT comedy .. and GREAT romance. It's a perfect movie. Perfect film for someone who wants a good laugh. If your perspective is too tense, maybe this movie is not for you and you may need counseling. It's a mistake that Paramount kept that film on the shelf since the early 80's, because he never saw the light of the day on a DVD. However, they believe that Urban version of "Honeymoon" is a good idea. It's strange that my two most romantic comedies have never been released on DVD. The other is Gene Wilder, the "greatest lover of the world," in which Fox had been sitting since the early 1980s. However, "From Justin To Kelli" is in almost every video shop in the country. There is no justice in the world. Perhaps those who have taken the time to bash enjoy "From Justin To Kelli", I'm sure he's sufficiently poured to "get". Sometimes, for years, people lose sense of humor ... Or sometimes they simply go and find comical pleasure in the repairs of "Full House".
