I'm a big fan of Jet Li! He's the best HK movie star alive ... and consequently - this movie has shaken! I saw it in the video store and, as was the case in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store, I did not register its presence for the first time and I had to look twice. I immediately knew what I was going to rent. My only suspicious (I guess I expected) is that it's synchronized (AAARGh) and it's not titlovan. Otherwise, the original / strange / cool plot of the movie and full action made it one of Jet Li's best movies ... although they all fall into this category.
