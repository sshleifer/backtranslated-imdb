This film has scenes that are coming back to me at the strangest times - this intense scene with Mr. Muckerie, who spoke to Mrs. Melandez that someone with witnesses pushed a girl out of the window by a woman who corresponds to her description --- that turns - in the way she calls it by name --- in the Greek accent "Mr. Muckerji" - and when Boier discovered that she had just taken a poison and gave her another last head she was dying - pleasure! "Fools - fools - my whole life" ... etc. etc. - you get a point .. I have to buy this one. I love acting by Dana Seimoura - he usually plays some fat-faced sultan or chief of police and appeared in Casablanca and a lot of great pictures.
