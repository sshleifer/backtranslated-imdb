Ride Vith The Devil, directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger), is another gem in this fine direction. For those who are not familiar with the history of the Kansas-Missouri border wars during the American Civil War. Watch this movie and visit the sad piece of America. In addition to some wonderful action scenes (fairly bloody times). This is a story of love and loyalty between men and a lady in particular. She plays Tobi Maguire, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Vright and as a young lady Jevel, whom I have never heard or seen before, I want to see her more). novel) This is a long film of 128 minutes, but it's worth a look at it. My rating is **** <br /> <br /> or delivered <br. /> Jai Harris <br />
