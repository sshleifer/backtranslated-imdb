The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is an outstanding documentary on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe of Persia. Twice a year more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross the rivers and mountains to reach the pasture. You will feel like a spoiled weakness after you've seen these people feed their animals through ice cold water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains as they try to bring their animals to the steep and narrow mountain paths.
