I watched the movie together with a homophobic friend, husband and friend. So I had views from all directions. Basically, the film smiled at me, sexual tension did not actually exist, and the only notable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistas. Yes, I think she played her role well, even if the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian actors, they simply did not have complex roles. I'm greeting Puyou entering the film business. I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he'll be a good actor. However, the woman liked the movie, and I think there might have been chords for which I had no hearing. If the film tried to show unusual sexual behavior and its consequences in today's Romania, then it failed. There were no consequences. Imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes only boring, uninteresting action. I have no idea why she got all those BAFTA awards. In my book she was supposed to receive the "Better luck next time" award. (bafta = happiness in Romanian).
