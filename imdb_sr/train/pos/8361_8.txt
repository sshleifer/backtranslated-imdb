I had mixed feelings towards "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started to watch, but I ended up. I would not call it vulgar ("stupid and stupid" is vulgar, "the sweetest thing" is vulgar and inexplicably stupid); I would call it shocking and insulting. I can understand why many viewers, especially females, would not like or even hated. This is the content of the misogyny (or at least it looks), and the way in which the two anticheroes treat each woman they meet seems to be inexpressible. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it somehow seems like a lovely little gem. I'm fascinated by how Blier managed to get out. The film is very fun and very fun: it's written well, the acting of all is first class, and music is sweet and melancholy. In fact, when I think about it, two friends did something good to the women they came across: they prepared a woman in the train (beautiful, obedient blonde Brigitte Fossei who began her film career with one of the most impressive debut in Rene Clement's "Forbidden Game" ( 1952) at the age of 6) for a meeting with a husband whom she had not seen for two months; they found a man who finally managed to get the frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) who came out and was happy; They enlightened and educated a young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her early appearances on the screen). Their encounter with Jeanne Moreau raises this comedy to a tragic level. In short, I'm not sure I'd like to meet Gerard Depardieu's Jean-Claude and Patrick Devaire Pierrot in real life and invite them to dinner, but I was having a good time watching the movie and almost flown for almost two hours - it was never boring.
