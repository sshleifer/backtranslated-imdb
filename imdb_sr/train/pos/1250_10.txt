This may contain a spoiler, so be careful. If there were 200,000 thousand or two million people, does that make a difference? Sometimes I get so angry about the apparent apathy of a small number of Americans, but I have to remember that many people in the United States were not raised or raised to take care of anything beyond the comfort zone. God help us for what we did. After the relative ease of what we did to the Americans of the natives, and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving the race, you would think that we would grow up hearts and souls in the late 60s and early 70s. But now I see that it's OK as long as our goals are justified to us only. How can we then look at another dictator and a terrible government and think that somehow we do well to impose our will? We are contradictory and hypocritical, and I'm ashamed of it. I feel sadness for the affected people. They deserve justice and their homes back. If this is done in my name as an American for my supreme security, I do not want it. I condemn these actions and I hope that our global community will realize that many Americans believe the US government has escaped fraud. No one is above the law. I want my country to come back, like the shabby Chagos. Regardless of the fact that people are setting out the anonymity of their computers, no one can deny in their hearts that they will not be willing to give up their place of birth for some bombs and heliports. We can not stand to be stuck in traffic, let alone violently and unjustly removed from our homes. None of us, Brit and the Americans do not forget what's happening. Do not embarrass yourself in the misconception that a simpler, more natural civilization is in some ways less valuable to see their rights observed and preserved - when we turn our back on basic human rights and dignity from 2000, we turn from the fundamental human rights and dignity of all people.
