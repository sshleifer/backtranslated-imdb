Pineapple is a truly good movie, with great acting, good narration, good presentation, touching emotions, etc. It seems to me that the quality of movies that Bollivood produces has been greatly improved these days, and this film is one of the proofs. No Bollywood film I remember had such an influence on me - literally I thought about the movie for hours - admiring the various emotional situations that a man's test in One Man. The film rests on the great actress Urmille Matondkar, as well as on Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in North India in the backdrop of the division, and all the troubles look sweet if they compare with the problems she faces. Film that must be seen. Technically superior Bollivood product, which I think can be compared with the best films coming from other countries of the world.
