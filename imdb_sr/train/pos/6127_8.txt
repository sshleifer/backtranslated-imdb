Jack Frost is about a serial killer who was sentenced to death. On his way to his death, a prison truck crashes in a collision with chemical tankers filled with a chemical that his molecules turn to snow on the ground and turns it into a snowman. I'm a killer who will turn him into a snowman's killer. Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him. Jack is now starting to fight again, killing people in a small town. I do not think Jack Frost has the chance to become a classic horror, but it's a fun movie. Just put your brain on hold and have fun with it, but do not take it too seriously.
