I saw this film for the first time when I was about 6 or 7 years old and I did not really think it was anything special. As time passed, I watched him several more times and began to grow on me as I began to understand the moral of the film, to which I will come later. For some time I left this film myself and did not watch it for some time. When I searched for an old classic movie watch a few weeks ago (now 15), I dug VHS related to the house. After watching this, I remained at a natural height that I could not explain. The movie gives you a huge sense of joy that you never expect. The film nature of three completely different animals working together to find their way home, really sends a message to the house that no matter how different you are, you can always find a common language, something that you need. The way people are being selected is truly fantastic. In this you have an old wise golden retriever, who takes care of the 'chance' and amusement of love, a little clumsy young American bulldog, with a wise and smart, vulnerable but sure cat. The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistic that it is impossible to create magic in starting to believe that this journey can happen. I do not want to sound like a soft tissue catcher when it comes to the movie, I assure you that I am quite the opposite, but most of this film is undoubtedly returned to the shadows, when the shadow desperately tries to escape, chance and daring , he was painfully told to leave. When both animals return to their loved ones, a silence arises, until the shadow interrupts the horizon to awe. There is a fine line between warm and wet garbage, but this film is pure magic even at 15 years old. This film may not be the Lord of the Rings, but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and to raise the way it does, even in this age deserves 10/10.
