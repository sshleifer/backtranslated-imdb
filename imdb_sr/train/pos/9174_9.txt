There were many film and television productions of Jane Eire, each with the aspects that I would recommend, but I suppose that's what people will continue to discover and fall in love with for decades. It's just a classic (and it offers a lot more than a story than the other). Timothy Dalton is completely in his element as Rochester, who rarely misses the label; Its performance is astoundingly swivel and colorful, and never goes far too far from the dark complexity of the character. Jake Zelah Clark is more cerebral than the one from the other world, but she makes the perfect film for Dalton (which, as appropriate, overwhelms over her!) The nuances of her performance are getting better on the second look (after absorbing the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical errors and a few moments when production values ​​could have been better; although this was pretty much a top-of-the-line production according to BBC standards of that time. But performances are a real pleasure. Do not miss this!
