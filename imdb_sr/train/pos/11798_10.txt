I've seen this movie literally over 100 times ... absolutely full of fun !!! Powers give great performance. As a fan of actors such as Villiam Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academi, 1981), I never thought the actor could catch "intensity" like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As far as I'm concerned, Povers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... this movie captures his best performance !!!
