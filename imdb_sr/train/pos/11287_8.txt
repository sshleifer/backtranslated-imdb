As other reviewers have noticed, this is one of the best Tarzan films. However, unlike others, I like the beginning of the movie because it seems like a fairly accurate description of what a trading station had to be. Plus the show is needed to know why Harry wants to return to the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most interesting and scariest sequences in the search ever made. The pre-censorship production values ​​add a lot of realism, truly showing the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans entering the jungle. The film also offers, although perhaps before that, an accurate picture of how terribly treated domestic Africans are by their white employers. In addition, sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, a couple of great sets and two cheats! Do not miss the classic adventure.
