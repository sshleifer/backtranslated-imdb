While captured at the Florida National Guard, "Tigerland" completely reminded me of Fort Polk, LA, shooting, maneuvering areas, water to the waist and all that. The film was quite authentic and characters similar to those of my AIT in 1974. The difference between Tigerland, 1971 and my 1974 is that all the princes and instructors knew they were not returning to Vietnam. it was almost everywhere, so the training was very relaxed - it was not a challenge at all. It was a precursor to all our troubles in the '70s and' 80s, for which I know that I remained until 2004. I never heard anyone say "Tigerland," but the army had realistic training villages in Vietnam in various bases throughout the United States. Vietnam veterans tell me that until 1972, Basic & AIT could have been pretty rough and rude because coaches were there and had the mandate to train men in Vietnam and the skills to do it, although this was not always the case. And the military sergeant in Polke and later one of my Vietnamese NCOs, when we became instructors at the Fort Bliss Primary Brigade, told me that they can not do anything to make anyone ready and people simply have to find out and understand for themselves. This film is tall.
