This last Dutch film about Verhooven smiled me well. As a film admirer in search of all the fine details and cross references, etc. In any movie, I can convince anyone interested in film art that this work entertains all senses. I did not read the book of Gerard Reese on which the film is based, but I still believe that we have received a sincere image of a little self-confident poet / writer who gets his own (in a way, there is no deterioration here). An anti-hero surrounded by characters who have their ambiguous intentions, like him. All this in top-packed cinema, Paul Verhopven manages to reverse the otherwise pretty "gesellich (?)" Dutch locations into an unstoppable film-noir ambiance, an impressive work!
