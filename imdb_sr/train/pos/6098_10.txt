This is a TV show based on a horror movie that corrects it. On Friday, the 13th series had nothing to do with the films. Poltergeist Legacy: I'm not quite sure. It may have been poorly linked to movies. They seem to just cast a famous title to the show, so fans can watch. It shows that Freddy burned down Elm Street's parents (in the first episode I believe) and that the number of parents is disappointing. With your kids in the first 3 movies, you expect to be more parents. But well. Freddy is basically a narrator for the show. He sees how people in the real world sometimes get involved somehow. Like other anthologies that are portrayed as Cryptic Tales, there is a supernatural or sudden ending of seduction. Act does not exist, but believe it or not: violence sometimes transcends film movie. This show lasted several seasons and was created at the time of the 4th film. I heard that he was canceled because of the parents' protest. I watched a lot of things that they rated as a child, so his shame parents had to ruin him for everything. Another 4 films came after the series, so it was not a complete loss.
