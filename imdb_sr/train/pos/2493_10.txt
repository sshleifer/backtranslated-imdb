A typical comedy from the 90s, a situational comedy similar to our modern "My Family". Thatcher is the culmination of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for everything he can. "Bloody Thatcher" may be divided by most of us. David, a typical teenager who cut his brains with bread knives, Jenni, a strange elderly teenager who was only interested in boys and boys. Bill and Ben work as much as they can to maintain their family on the surface, struggling in the economic climate of the early 90's. The first two series were not successful as the last series, however, the series 3 is still where everything starts with more laughter that I care to count. All in all, this show did not get the best viewing time and it took a little longer. apparently could not continue to work after Gary Olsen died, but I think we should get rid of "Catherine Tate" "offices" "Little Britain" and return the classics!
