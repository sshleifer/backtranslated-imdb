All the talent shown by Mr. Sooraj Barjati in his first films, I thought that all of them were unhappy because his fourth Major Shots Divine Hoon was so bad. But I must say that it was not an accident. This guy is talented and the way he did Vivah is just brilliant. It's affecting you from the first scene. The sequences between shahid and amrit are great. Chemistry between these two actors gives insight into this between heart and nail. As usual Alok Nath as good and loving father is fantastic, so is Anupam Kher. But her movie Shahid-Amrita.Amrita looks good in most scenes, although Shahid looks a little young to get married, but works shyly, but still morally strong groom. this film will especially love those who have gone through such beautiful moments in their lives. All in all, a great movie. Sojaer Barjatia ...
