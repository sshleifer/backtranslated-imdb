Wow! The movie you could watch ten times and still enjoy its shades. Absolutely incredible! If this was Visconti's debut film, I'll scare myself to think what would happen if I got a better film from film to film. The only other person I saw (at the time of writing) was Death in Venice - which was absolutely incredible: visually more than Ossession (Obsession). One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, but his story was not like Ossession. If you click on "Miscellaneous" on the links on this page, there are photos from the movie on these websites. They really do not justify the experience of the film: such graceful camera movements, such a beautiful composition, such beautiful faces, so great characters, such a great story of development, the first film adapted by James M Cain "The Postman Alvais Rings" Twice. "I can not believe that it was done 43, eight years before Brando was supposed to present a realistic action to the world with Streetcar Named Desire (1951). Actors in this may not have used the technique of the method, that is, Maybe they did not truly feel all by themselves (I do not know anything about it) - but they are some of the best, true and most realistic performances by this date and cinema. Also, eight years before the tram called a new sensuality on the screen, Ossession was Sensational! The most sensible thing since the beginning of the movie! Yes, j I was a superlative, but Ossession was so great. The reason why Ossession did not provoke the influence of the tram is that it was made in Fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini and again in America. she did not see her full glory until 59, eight years after the street vehicle. I will not say anything more about it - just to tell you that she is one of the best, the most beautiful and exciting films I've ever seen, and I tell you to go out and see! As the second reviewer, I'll buy it as soon as I can!
