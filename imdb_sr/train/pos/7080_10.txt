Terri Gilliam gives a stunning movie, which I fully enjoyed. Bruce Villis, Madeline Stove, Brad Pitt, and even the small appearance of Christover Plummer make the movie absolutely brilliant! This is the only Terri Gilliam movie I've seen, and twelve monkeys are definitely in my top 10, and Brad Pitt is the best. Brad Pitt delivers perfect performance. Perhaps one of the top ten actors I've ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Villis and Brad Pitt worked very well. With a brilliant story to support great performances; And to support this, Terry Gilliam is a super director.
