After I only had a "welcome" to my 23-year-old daughter in the year of the IAC, the medical support unit at Anaconda camp, I felt needed for this DVD. I wanted to hear the other feelings of the returnees in order to try to better understand her mentality upon arrival and I do not wait until something bad happens. Regardless of your fight against war and peace, this film serves as a great start for all Americans to begin healing our returning veterinarians with emotional gaps. The most important statement of the whole film is "Take Action" on the problem. Incredibly emotional movie. I would highly recommend this film to a veterinarian for the whole mature family and ask him to follow him with a plan to listen to comfort and help returnees in the Gulf War. My daughter saw this DVD. She took into account her emotions and actually committed to working again for another 6 years. Her time in the sand was that she did something good. Local children Balada received the first medical treatment for various common diseases that they usually can not afford free of charge with escort and interpreter. Her gaze over the shoulder in a tour in Iraq was. "We have changed hearts and minds there" Great DVD must have an open mind and see all sides
