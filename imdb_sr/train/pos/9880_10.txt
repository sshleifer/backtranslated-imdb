This film was shot in 1943 when I think that Judy was at its peak (looks wise). In their previous film For Me and Mi Gal, people often say that it looks skinny. In this movie it looks perfect. She's pretty and shows her sense of comedy. I think this film is hilarious, especially at the beginning when trying to organize an audition with John Thornvai. One of the funniest scenes is, in my opinion, Judah's interpretation of Ladi Macbeth and when John is looking at a party to give her a shower (Lol). a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean, one minute is despised, and the next goes to the meeting, and the next time they meet after that date, they are in love. . If I were Lili, I would be angry with John, but she is not ... it just makes no sense. But all in all, I would have to give this movie 10 because it's just wonderful and almost perfect.
