First I accidentally one night while I watched the television: since then I've never missed an episode. It's humor very humorous, like the cross between the social commentary Brass Eie, the excellent Fast Shov. one-liners, and an incredible plot that seems to be developing every week without ever going anywhere. The best example for this was the special thing of Hillary Briss - what is this about? Humor will not attract everyone. Some will say it's too sick and it's easy to see where they come from. Still, try it. If you do not like it, do not look at it, but if you like it, you will be very glad that you took my advice.
