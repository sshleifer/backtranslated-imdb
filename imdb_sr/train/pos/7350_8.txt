I was a good teenager when I saw a movie .. the songs were a big hit, but the elite class skipped the govinda movies back then seeing guitar and karishma (aka charisma) the movies were not at stake for that 'class', but many people already I liked it because a series of these films shook the 90s, and most of them were successful. Today I watched it again after a long time and I remembered that there was a long person and that there were riots when the song came to the screen and I heard about ... the dresses of govinde and karishme were complementing each other (the worst duo of that time ) and karis was transformed at the end of the 1990s, but the govinda was still very loyal to his designer that his sense of dress remained the same ... but then everything was fine ... everything worked and slowly the elite class realized what he missed and then ... there was no reference to this iodine as he went on finding these Indian to wear on the series ..hated a few, but beloved by the masses. If you are looking for a good time and do not have anything to rent or watch on TV, I do not think you will regret it ... but remember it's the worst in its best edition. <br /> <br /> I'm still watching these movies when I get time because I can not stop laughing ... so I say go ahead and have a good time as there are times when we all love nonsense and especially when done by the kings of their time it's certainly vatchable ... I recommend it to all film lovers ...
