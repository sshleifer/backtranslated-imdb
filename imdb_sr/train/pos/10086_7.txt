It's a lot of nonsense about a London woman who marries a tea plantation from Ceylon that she hardly knows. It's full of cliches, and Liz Taylor's character is not convinced. It has a wonderful set, some exotic snapshots of the location. She shows Tailor at the height of her beauty. It looks amazing.
