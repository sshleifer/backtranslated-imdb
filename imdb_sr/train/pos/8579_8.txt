The plot: The crime master unites 3 different mafias in the company to buy an island, which would then serve as a money laundering tool for organized crime. To prevent this, the FBI is trying to catch one of the mafia masters. The thing is wrong, and due to some incredible complications and reversals, other "cops who do not like" movie are presented to us ... is an FBI agent, and another male DEA agent So far, so stupid. But the power of this film does not lie in his story - a bad joke, at best. That's funny. (The least synchronized version in German). And the action is good, with an unforgettable scene involving a pistol and a rocket launcher. But the focus is entirely on humor. Not intelligent satire, not very humorous, but somewhere between, you get a lot of funny jokes. However, this film is contrary to political correctness. The misuse of legal drugs is highlighted, without criticism, and even portrayed as cool. It's part of a movie that has seriously upset me and makes it unsuitable for children, in my opinion. All in all, for a nice evening viewing comes an acceptable action with some funny jokes, this film is perfect. Just remember: In this genre, it's normal to leave your brain on the door when you enter the cinema / TV room. Then you'll have a good time. 8/10
