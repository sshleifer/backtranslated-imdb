I love this film and I've seen it several times over the years. It's better with every look. I agree with all the positive comments. Yes, it's grossly and brutally real, because life in prairie was in those days. I found a comment on how I watched it. Someone here said that Rip Torn was wrong. I could not get along anymore. He is brilliant as a scoundrel, scandalous Clide Stevart who speaks a bit and works as a slave / worker. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as Elinor's widow, whom Clyde hired as a housewife / chef (along with her old daughter 7). Lilia Skala is great as a remote neighbor by the name of Grandma. And the star is stark Montana prairie. It is also a wonderful and brutal country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are repulsive and necessary. There are no special effects here, what you see is really! It even has great music and excellent scenario. When you see Heartland, you will never forget it. He deserves all the dozens he gets here.
