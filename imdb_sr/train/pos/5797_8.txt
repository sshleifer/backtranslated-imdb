And I'm not saying it in a bad way. I watched this movie in the cinema when I was 6 or 7 years old. For me and my relatives it was magical, beautiful and at the same time terrifying. . When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about it. Over the years, I've seen this film broadcast several times, but I've always changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds would bring that sense of magic and warm my heart. And I liked it that way. So that I saw this film only once and I believe it was a good decision not to look at it again. If I saw him today, I know that I could not but criticize MJ's action, plot (if it existed) and this and that. For me, this is a childhood memory, so my feelings for a child from a child are 20 years ago. I see that my adult face intervenes in my rating and gives him 8 for memories and wonderful music. For that little kid who looked at him in awe 20 years ago, this is definitely worthy of a dozen.
