Flock is unfairly defective as a smaller "Se7en" ripoff. There is really no reason to compare these two, except perhaps a similar landscape in the final calculation. Now that this is out of the way, I will come into question why Flock is very interesting in some aspects. It is mostly a drama, and not a full thriller about a very awake social worker who tracks sexual offenders. At the very beginning you can clearly see that his work got better than him. Obviously in two scenes, where the perpetrator first interviews and strikes him around for a second when a woman tries to pick it up, and everything that can be remembered is his standard questions from his questionnaire. like Errol Babbage, the mentioned social worker. His way of doing a job is not like a cop, he wears a gun and constantly checks the newspapers and supplies legal officials with information if one of his "herders" can be responsible for a sexual offense. He is also a person who has lost all the happiness of life and it seems that his only relief came from seeking his own true justice in his flock. You see him twice as he laughs, once he apologizes for treating his partner roughly, and the other after he beat up a member of his flock. A little confusing with some irritating holes for the works, but there are many striking pieces. so that he would not swallow a sore that surrounded himself. The world we live in is a very sick place and can still distance itself from the worst happiest man. Flock gets this point nice.
