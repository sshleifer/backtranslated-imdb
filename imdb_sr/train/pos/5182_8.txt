A quiet, sweet and nice nostalgic movie about how to deal with old friends and the environment of your youth with all those memories and problems and sadness of the present with you. A movie that makes you good. Here are all the ingredients: old jealousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Disadvantages, night fridges and all the other fun things that we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters get a chance in a week to come back to it because the old camp leader is now retiring and wants to meet the children from the golden years of the camp. Everyone is now in the thirties and in the middle of a career.
