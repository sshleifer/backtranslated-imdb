Before the Devil knows that you are dead, he begins promising, by placing a simple plunder that goes wrong, told from different perspectives (in RASHOMON style). For an hour, Sydney Lumet transforms this film into something much more than a collection of its parts; finally turns into a multiple family drama, exploring the full range of human emotions / relationships, while the story comes to its daunting climax. As with Lumet, he manages to extraordinary results. performances from his actor with stars, without any idea of ​​excessive acting or hyperbolics. Philip Seimour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often dwarves Ethan Havke, who plays his brother, Hank. That does not mean that Havke is not bad; in fact, he's pretty much above the adequate, in a problematic role that suits his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she throws her meat contributes to it). The character of Alberto Finney (Andi and Hankin's father) is the most intriguing, and in my opinion, he earned a little more time for the screen. Amy Ryan is also doing his job in an adequate way. BEFORE I KNOW you are dead is not an extraordinary movie, but it proves that Lumet is still at the top of his game on (obviously) twilight. a glorious career. Many of its features and trademarks appear here, and the smallest of them involves the use of his characters. Sprinkled with a killer script (without the intention of playing), intelligent dialogue and pacing, and a decent result, BEFORE YOUR DEBATE KNOW you are dead, you must see. A truly underestimated jewel. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). I just need to get into Top 250 at 248. Very recommended.
