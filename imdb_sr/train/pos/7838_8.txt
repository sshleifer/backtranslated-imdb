If you are a T-Rek / Marc Bolan fan, I recommend that you look at this. He shows the capricious side of Mark Bolan, as well as Ring Starr, apparently having a good time recording some of the scenes that are not part of the concert, but entertaining to watch, leaving you with the feeling that you are introduced to them just as people, and when a talented musician shows up and plays and a professional, who wallows and seems to impress screaming girls. Watching him at the concert, you would never know it was a rock star job but rather great fun with some great songs with some good friends, such as Elton John and Ringo Starr that appear on some live performances. True, few songs are missing I'd like to see there, but like any other album, I can not have it all. I just bought this in 2006, but if I knew it was out in 1972, I would definitely buy it a few years ago. It's sad and weird that a man with so many songs about his love of cars would never learn to drive and die in a car accident!
