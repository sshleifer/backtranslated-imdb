This series was like what you'd expect from Mr.Spielberg. It's really one of those scary, fun, childish shows that you will not forget. Just like the External Borders (another great performance), this little series does not do much. She was great and deserved her to work longer. It was a great performance, even the children could watch, although some of the shows were a bit scary when they wanted to be, but they all eventually had morale at the end (like the twilight zone) that made you realize what you are not You want to finish, or those you did. I remember that I watched some of these movies on Sci-Fi when I was 10 years old, and even now, I still enjoy seeing them when I can. A really fun, imaginative performance. I loved it and I'm still working.
