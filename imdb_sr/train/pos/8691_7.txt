Master Cineast Alain Resnais likes to work with actors who are part of his family. In this film we also see members of the Resnais family like Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, Andre Dussolier and Fanny Ardant who deal with serious issues such as death, religion, suicide, love and their overall implications for our everyday lives. The formal nature of the relationship these people share is obvious even as friends, they turn to each other using the formal one. In 1984, while L'Amour was mortal, Resnais dealt with time, memory and space to discover the mysteries of the fundamental question of human existence: Is love stronger than death? It was 16 years old in 1968 when Resnais made a similar film Je t'aime Je t'aime which was also about love and memories. The message of this film is loud and clear: true and deep love can even embarrass the science of dead lovers returning lost lives leaving the doctors to care for their reputation. L'amour and mort is like a game that is not at all a didactic. It's a movie in which the music party is in perfect tandem with its pictures. The reason why this movie can be easily understood.
