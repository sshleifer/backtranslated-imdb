First of all, I remember seeing him in the 70's when he was shown on television late at night. He scared me. But then, I was a teenager in those days, not as I am now exhausted about movies. BLOOD BLOOD (aka DANSE MACABRE) is a good example of the Italian horror genre of the 60s, along with BLACK SUNDAI (1960), Maria Bava, CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD (called KILL BABI KILL) (1966) and Mario Caiano NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965). If you want a fascinating atmosphere together with brilliant writing, check these. I also evaluate them together with the early Poe films Roger Corman worked in the same period. I saw a new Sinapse DVD that was taken from the French press and that's a big improvement over the old pan - and scanned the press that has been doing rounds on television over the years. Adds a few minutes of dialogue (in French) that do not add much to the film as a whole, but it's nice to see it completely, without cuts. Unfortunately, DVD really does not offer any add-ons behind movie pictures. One flub that I noticed was in the starting scene, watching a smoke effect man next to a camera that is reflected on a glass of the inn door entrance. I suppose the editors did not catch it at that time, or maybe they did not care, but that's something I did not notice for the first time. These are the wonders of the DVD. You can see all the flutes, mistakes and details that were not visible for the first time. But no matter what. But no matter what, he still gets 7 on imdb gauge. <br /> <br />
