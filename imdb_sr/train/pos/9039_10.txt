I grew up in South West Virginia; I'm about the same year (or maybe a year older than) Homer Hickam, author of The Rocket Bois, a book that makes the real story of this heart-warming film. So I closely associated with the coal theme in West Virginia, and the stunning effect that Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on all of us. Rocket Bois continued to make great lives for themselves. I continued with a degree in physics and computing. All because Sputnik woke many young people in the "Science Gap" that the US had in the United States during the Cold War ... This is a wonderful movie for everyone, all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it would touch the core of your being. Each: take it; Watch; recommend it to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
