When you see the cover of a DVD, you are convinced that this is a cheap cheap class B, a movie made for $ 1,000 in someone's yard. Wrong! This is a good quality material and really good. It's a comedy and smart. It is also very touching in places, with a nice point of kindness. Production values ​​are very good (this looks great), the actors are famous, the direction of the film and sets are great. That's incredible. Who would have thought? Carrie-Ann Moss, who plays against the type, is brilliant, like "Helen Robinson," a wife from June Cleaver; Billi Connolly is a great whistle of zombie "Fido;" Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is with the sexy zombie girl Tammi, and Henry Czerni and Dilan Baker as dads (check) are great, too K'Sun Rai as young "Timmy Robinson," It should not be ignored . In fact, there are probably more lines in the movie than anyone. If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that it will look a little over you. Only you will have to accept the word of the people who liked them and found it a very, very pleasant surprise. You need a dark sense of humor; respecting the absurd.
