If you have seen Dogton and Z-Bois or are you interested in seeing a real, non-caricature, the "real American" side of America, then riders will hit deeper than anything you've seen before. This film is "unreal", a light expression if it has ever existed, but it is extremely convenient if you get any form of literary meaning from it - it's a 100% factual documentary, but with all the drama of the wash, and completely the obvious feeling of love, expertise and knowledge in the direction and narration of Stacy Peralta, this film takes you professionally from a great wave to a great wave, whilst you are completely amazed at everything you are privileged to see. This film is a symphony, made up of Beethoven's 9th, which started beautifully with its introduction to Hawaii, deeply pulling human emotions in Santa Cruz and ending with an excitement, triumph and crest of Laird Hamilton's exploits, again in Hawaii. br /> As a classical music; like Beethoven's Ninth, Ride of the Valkiries or Barber Adagio for Strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Trust me.
