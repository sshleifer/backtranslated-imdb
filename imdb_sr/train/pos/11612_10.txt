Picture Bride painting is a realistic and portable portrait of what must have been like Japanese men brought to Hawaii at the turn of the 19th century to work in the fields of sugar cane. Most were planning to return to their homeland, but few have succeeded. The fate of Japanese women, some of them fifteen or sixteen, is equally movable, which they sent as promised brides to men they knew only through photos that were often 10 or 15 years old, or were some other younger men. They also worked in the fields for a long time, fighting against nostalgia and preserving their dignity. coercion is, ultimately, inspiring and stimulating - a story of moral and cultural survival. There is a magnificence and magnificence of the swing of characters and landscapes in the image of the Bride that captivates the seductive beauty as well as the violent roughness of the colonial Hawaiian. This is a film that is emotionally, intellectually and artistically rewarded.
