This is as good as the original 101, if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with its unhealthy behavior and equipment, and the movie is probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We see a lot more at this moment. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, a rather messy man. To use Paris as the highlight of the film was a smart idea. The movie is worth watching regardless of your age, provided you love animals.
