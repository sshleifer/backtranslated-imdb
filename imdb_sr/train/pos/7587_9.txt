I have to say that I was impressed by incredible cinematography, that the frames are close to perfection and the way in which he built a tension around the theme that sounds more like terrible boredom. two narrators, one seen, one invisible. Both are trying to explain the importance of a series of images that have caused a scandal for a long time. The film is all about theories and explanations, but the conclusion is quite shocking. Definitely a movie that deserves more than 171 votes. With only 66 minutes to play his action movie still feels like a complete work. Fantastic direction! I must say far better than Blood of the Poet, which for some strange reason reminds me a little. I assume you can call it slang words "artsi". There is quite a lot of professional talk about various theories and stunning visual effects, but the team and Ruiz did it. At least for me. Incredible movie.
