"Moonstruck" is the movie I liked the first time I watched it. I really liked the second time. I loved him the third time. Now this is one of my favorite moments. Humor is subtle, but really good. The film offers a lot of warmth humor. the story takes place in the old school district of New York. Cher's quest for love is pleasing to watch. This film is by far the best work Nicholas Cage did on the movie. The old man's image is fantastic. It illuminates the screen without saying a word. The scene with the dogs turns on the Moon was fantastic. But perhaps it's the best person to play Olimpija Dukakis. The peak of the film is a scene in which the main heroes have at breakfast from oatmeal in the family kitchen. Exceptional direction and completion.
