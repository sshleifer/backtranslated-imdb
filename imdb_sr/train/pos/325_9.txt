This is a great movie - esp when compared to the sometimes exhausting seriousness of today's political actors. A film that can easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art these days is rare. Although the optimism of the 1960s can not be reversed, I think we can at least learn a lesson from the hot energy and charm of the film. I do not know what those who label the film "boring" look - so much is packed that the same movie never stays for more than 15 minutes.
