They do not know that another couple of thieves (Luci and Tommy, a couple of birds in love), who had previously refused Mandi and Martin to join the job, also plan to steal a diamond. As every couple of thieves planning a robbery is exciting to watch. Things go wrong, as Martin and Mandi unconsciously find a step behind Port and Tommy.

Action fans will not be disappointed because there is a healthy dose of fighting with pistols, martial arts and fighting in hands.
