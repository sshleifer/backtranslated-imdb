Some genre films have to be dressed. This was an exception. Taken by its own merits, it is a trained version of the genre genre film. With minimal special effects, it manages to be a psychological study, with a simple but existential subject - who is hit by a bus and why is she? It's not a great movie, but because it's a little fictitious about it, the story works. Subtly, and all about the interactions of the characters. In fact, in the introductory scenes, there is one device, but it may have been set up there simply to set the tone for what's coming. I appreciate the balance of male and female energy and I would not recommend this story to anyone who is interested in more than people who respond to the physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the movie if you have empathy, appreciate the need for a little adventure in your life, and you are wondering, "What would I do in this situation?"
