I discovered that this film is uncertain almost from the very beginning. When Miss Stanley begins her story, it's only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming. The abandoned area, the lock on the abandoned door of the gas station, keeps you waiting ... here it comes. First you think it will be about a little boy, but prematurely you start to hold your breath watching the tide comes. I think this film is really stressful, although I already watched it and was ready for a breakup. Now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you've seen it before deserves some special grade, maybe a reward for white wrists?
