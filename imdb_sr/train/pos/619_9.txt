I expected this film to be decent and maybe clickable, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cock (for which I have not heard of him) has played an incredibly good leader; he was so sincere and romantic, that I and my friend who watched the movie with me completely fell in love with him. I still enjoy her more. Her acting was fantastic, I could not even say she was an American. Chemistry between her and Charlie Cock was extremely good, casting was perfectly perfect. Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well-thrown; De Niro as gai pirate ... priceless, invaluable. So I laughed at the scene where Septimus appeared on the boat ... oh my God, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked it as a skinny mother in Hairspray. But she had the right amount of melodrama and made comments during the film. All in all, it was funny (but not at all!), Romantically, special effects were not frequent, but when they were, they were great; The rings of Ricki Gervais and Peter O'Toole are also well placed. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who loves fantasy movies like Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings. She kept my interest all the time and I'll buy a DVD when it comes out!
