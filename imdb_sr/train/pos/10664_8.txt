Does anyone else cry tears of joy when watching this movie? Like it! One of the top 10 films of all time. It only makes me good. I am looking at the final product number with all the members over and over again and again !!! Babe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is a baby movie, IMHO! I never watched the show, but I got angry when I read reviews that say the performance was better than the movie. They are two like apples and oranges. The process of making the film will rarely bring a finished product that is authentic to the original work. I believe that this is only because of the fear of public alienation that many famous works adapted to the screen do not change more than they are. This is a very good movie, it's very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
