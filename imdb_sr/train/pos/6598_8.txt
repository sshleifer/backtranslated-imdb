I saw this film when I traveled to Brazil. It was hard for me to really understand Brazilian culture and society, because there are so many regional and class differences. To see this movie in Sao Paulo itself, there was a discovery. This shows something of the everyday lives of many Brazilians. On the other hand, sometimes it is a little over dramatized. And this is the only negative comment I have on this movie. Sometimes it's too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for a movie. The director could make some things a bit more subtle, making the film more effective. In spite of this, I loved the film and the way the story is revealed. The characters are complex and very similar to real people. Not the pretty American actors and actresses with many cosmetics, but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time. It makes the movie real, even when the story is not so convincing.
