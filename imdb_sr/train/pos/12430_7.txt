Normally, I do not watch action movies due to the fact that they are usually all similar. This film had many stereo-action action movie scenes, but the characters and originality of the premise of the movie made it easier to watch. David Duchovny withdrew his normal acting approach, which was great to see. Angelina Jolie, of course, was beautiful and great acting. Large thrown together. It must look for people boring with the same old action movie.
