Emilio Miraglio "The Red Queen kills seven times" (1972) is just the most perfect example of gialla I've ever seen, mixing all the necessary elements into one malicious pepper. First and foremost, for me, it has a complex, twisted plot that ultimately has the perfect meaning, and the killer here does not come fully from the left field at the end. The story of a series of terrible murders (you already know how much it is from the title of the movie, right?) What happens in the seemingly fulfillment of the ancient prophecy of two sisters, involves one, and a murderer, a reddish figure with a crazy laughing craze, and scary and unforgettable. Every great giallo requires some wonderful actresses, and here we have a lot of assortments, led by funnyly beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of two sisters, and in one of his earlier roles, Sibil Danning, as a lusty robin in Barbara's fashion house. Another necessary ingredient of the top gialla is an appealing, humble result, and Bruno Nicolai offers one for this film that should stay with you for days. Gorgeous sceneries? Check it again. Recorded mainly in Wurzburg, Germany, the picture is a real treat for the eye. OK, OK, but what about these murders? After all, is not that what Gialli is? I'm glad to say that most viewers should be pleased with the various knives, shootings, shelling and other massacres that this movie tastes tasty ... not to mention the crypt, the sequence of strange dreams, rats and a stick (and many of them too! ), Drug Recommendations, Rape Scenes, Compulsory Red Herring and, in Uga Paglia's personality, the leader who led the female spectators. As I said, the perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD is from fine people to No Shame, and you know what it means: a beautiful print and a lot of accessories, for lifting! Thanks guys!
