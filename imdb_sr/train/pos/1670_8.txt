Channel 4 is a channel that allows more irrelevant things than any other channel, this show was definitely invalid. The manager of this sometimes brutal chat shov, Four-time BAFTA win and British Comedy Avar victory (also twice nominated) Graham Norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this one. He had one or more celebrities in the middle. They basically had an idea for adults who would either harsh, humiliate or humorous the guest, but some are not for those who are weak. They had women who played the recorder with their parts, men used cocks to play xylophone, women who were up in the bathroom, men with or without pants under the kilt, and many more gruesome but funny ideas. This is only for adults, but enjoy! Twice she won BAFTA for the best entertainment (program or series), won British comedy awards for the best comedy entertainment program (also nominated), best comedy talk shov, won Emma for episode # 18 (?) And won the National Television Awards two times for Most Popular Talk Shov. It was number 52 on the 100 greatest fun moments. Very good!
