Do not bother with the soundtrack, which has been played so far. Still, Debra Vinger is always interesting and while she was an earlier role for her, she is pretty good as Cissi, a girl from the wrong one. trail, he lived in a trailer with Buddha (Travolta), for a time to replace City Slicker Madolin Smith as a rival. I agree with the earlier review regarding Scott Glenn, it is used only for the action, thrown into the mixture to create uncertainty; the story is predictable and fictitious. Also, although I am from the East, many of us did not like the "fever of Saturday Night" while she had her moments, permanent stereotypes are beyond criticism at this time. It's Worth To See For Deborah Vinger; she was still so cute and she never had that Hollywood person who we are exposed today by too many actresses. 7/10
