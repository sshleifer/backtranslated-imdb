Trailers of this movie can show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are only rare fragments chosen to attract audiences. They, of course, display the main message of the film: People who are constantly on their feet in their jobs and lives, using the power they may have elsewhere to infamously inflame others. And at the bottom end of the oppression chain, mostly women. The film that shows it so brutal as the Hundstage is certainly difficult to face, but must bear such a lifetime is even more difficult. Technically, the film is similar to short cuts, but it consists of episodes of documentary style, with people like your neighbor, who play just as they are. Without any shine, and most troubling, without any hope. His documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing, because you realize that such people are there, and there are many, even though our society focuses on a fine outward appearance. Somewhere pornography must do its job, somewhere there must be undeclared domestic violence, some hope must be broken. I certainly know such people. If you want to watch a movie without any funny scenes (some might think that a disabled woman who repeats the top ten supermarkets is ridiculous, but this happens really) and without any melodramatic, watch this movie. However, it will be lost when you focus on the subtitles I'm afraid of, because subtitles can not transport accents.
