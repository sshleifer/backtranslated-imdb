Ravhide was a wonderful TV western series. Focusing on the band trail of the drovers led by the head of Gil Favor. Most of the episodes - especially from the first three seasons - were really typical studies of Favor and his people. Visiting stars came and went, but unlike Vagon Train, they rarely dominated episodes in which they appeared. Thanks to the performance of Eric Fleming, the show has become a big hit. Of course, it was supported by a wonderful actor of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Voolei, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocki Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors have left a trace in television history. Ravhide captured the taste of that time in the West that no other series has failed for me. Later seasons had a tendency to separate traces and give them individual lines of story. It did not work for me for some time - cattle and regular people gave the best stories. Still, there were some more classic stories, and Ravhide remained a top-notch affair. The black and white photo added a gloomy, realistic feeling that other Western series rarely managed to capture. Rustlers, Indians, Comancers, beautiful girls in trouble, serial killers, all of them appeared to give problems to our heroes. The end came for the series quietly when the final season was less than half way. Reason - Eric Fleming went and Ravhide was now a headless body - persistent realism disappeared, Gil Favor commanded respect and gave authority - he was never unmistakable and made him even more interesting. We will not see his resemblance again. Watch the episode whenever you can, rarely disappoint.
