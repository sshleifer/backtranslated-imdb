I read Kerching reviews on IMDb, and honestly, I have not seen any positive reviews so far. I really like Kerching. Kerching is about a teenager named Taj Levis, to earn 1,000,000 pounds for his mother, sets up a website called rudeboi. The site offers many interesting things, if only Taj, and his two friends - Danny and Seimour can prevent him from revealing. I think this show is pretty fun and I enjoy watching her. The acting is OK, but definitely it can be better, the characters are fun, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his stupidity is what makes him funny. and Taj's second friend Seimour. Also, Carlton, the owner of a cafe called "Chill". We never see him, we just hear him. The younger brother Omar and his older sister, Missy, are also ridiculous. And Missina's best friend Kareesha. So many times he's nearly exposed. Like comedy, drama in Kerching, such as the love and loss of loved ones make this program great.
