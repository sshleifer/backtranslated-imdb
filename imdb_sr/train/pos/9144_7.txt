Okay, maybe it's not an award-winning movie of the year (except for a great soundtrack that I think has won several awards), but it's a really great movie about Kid (Prince / O (choose) and events around him living in Minneapolis music, music is absolutely wonderful, in my opinion you have to have this soundtrack, it's really a classic and it collects the sounds of the eighties and feels that the movie itself plays a good story, it's worth a look again, especially if you love Prince / O (what I do ) of course.
