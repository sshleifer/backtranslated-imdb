The first time I watched this movie when it was transmitted to the BBC in 1988 when I worked in the UK in 2000. My friend Steve Parkhouse took it to VHS and sent it to me. Until this moment, I really saw only Shong Bros movies with kong fu, with their sharp lighting (so the audience could clearly see the moves), so I was discovered to see something that looked like it was lit up Ridley Scott he leaves Hong Kong. This was also my first exposure to Tsui Harka's films (spoken, apparently, by "Choi Huk"). Still, for all the smoky, illuminated exteriors and ambitious special effects (Stop-motion?) In a Hong Kong movie?) In the heart of Chinese GHOST STORY lies a simple and moving love story, which is even more real than the great acting talent of Leslie Cheung (which is a tragic, tragic ruin of life!) and the beauty and elegance of Joey Vong. Allowed Joey is gorgeous, but these are her ballet gestures that give her a character that is unattainable erotic that is difficult to analyze. Although Joei is now almost 20 years older (which is not of us), it will always be a permanent image of this actress. Some reviewers have said that the film is simplified and there are no surprises, but miss the fact that this film is based on the famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! It's as if you complain that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable end and just copy the VEST SIDE STORY. (I just wanted to take it off my chest!) For me, Chinese GHOST STORY is the essence of a romantic story. It has a great tragedy, because we know that Chio Sin and Son Seen can never be together. It's about becoming mature, because none of us can mature until we experience a great loss. It's about sacrifice, because the victim is an essential component of True Love. And the comedy with the style of Vu Ma does not hurt a little. Enjoy the Chinese GHOST STORY by trying to not look through the western culture filter and you'll be well cared for. .
