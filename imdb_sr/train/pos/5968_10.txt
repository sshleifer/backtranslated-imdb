When you come across a jewel of a movie like this, you understand why the 80s were the greatest decade of life. Rock music reigned, as well as movies ... especially horror films. Film makers knew how to entertain us, and "Trick or Treat" is obvious for this. Vene rocker Sammi Curr, most likely written after V.A.S.P. singer Blackie Lavless, dies in a hotel fire, his first fan, Eddie, is upset. He goes to friends and local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of the last shot Sammi made; This is the only available copy. It was given radio station to play live at Halloween Night. When Eddie plays it, it's kinda coming back Sammy. He helps Eddie with schoolmates at school, but then he goes beyond control. It's definitely an excellent movie. The bad thing is that this film is out of circulation. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get it off eBaia. You should ... $$ well spent!
