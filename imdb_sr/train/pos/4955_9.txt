I do not know why people always want a deeper meaning in movies or find them useless. What about the fun only? Something that Morgan Freeman stands out for. He gets a chance to show up a bit. Paz Vega, his actor, gets a career in career, and Brad Silberling gets a name that will attract people to watch his film. I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some pathos, some bitter sweetness, but nothing above the top. I had a special blow from Jim Parsons as a receptionist at a construction company. When he looked at Freeman and adored him, he said, "You make me want to be a woman." He's just funny. The scene of a fight between her ex-wife and his girlfriend is wonderful. In short, it's a cute, charming movie that will make you laugh. He could do a lot, much worse.
