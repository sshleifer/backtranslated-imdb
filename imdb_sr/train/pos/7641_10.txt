Everyone is playing their role pretty well in this "little fine movie". Belushi gets the chance to live differently, but ends up realizing that what he's got is just as good or maybe even better. The film shows us that we should use the opportunities we have, and not those that we do not have or can not have. If you can get this movie on a video for about $ 10, it would be an investment!
