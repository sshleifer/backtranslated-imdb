If there was even a more wise adaptation than this, one should not ask for it; you will find all this in this almost perfect presentation of the masterpiece of Charlotte Bronte. I rarely saw a movie that would urge me to read the novel on which it was based, but I admit it here. Although I did not read Jane Eira, I am convinced that I missed a lot of dialogue and complication, intensity and emotions very little. I just want to explore the novel because of the enormous curiosity and emotions that this masterpiece produced in me. I do not have to reveal anything on the path of complication. Let me just say this: if you may be unsure whether you need to watch or read the beautiful story that Jane Eire, please do not suspect anymore! Every power and magic power that raised Jane Eire as a popular classical English literary artist has been trapped in this film. What the Bronze did not bring, Clarke and Dalton managed to translate into the center of attention with enormous intensity. The success of the film, no doubt, is due to their acting power. Love is Jane Eire or hates her, but appreciate the wealth, vitality, truth of the story; love the characters; you love actors; all just like you would love what's great at the cinema.
