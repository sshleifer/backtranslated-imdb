This is a powerful Italian adaptation of the novel by James M. Caina The Postman Alvais Rings Twice in the direction of the great Luchin Visconti. What is so interesting in the film is that it overcomes its original material to become more brave and original (interestingly Camus also recognizes Kajin's novel as a key inspiration for his significant novel Stranger). The film has more strength and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create a film equivalent of Cain's narrative structure, but offers a more complex research of the genus. Cain's American novel is also uncritically fascinated by the construction of whiteness (the main character of Cora is obsessively afraid to be identified as a Mexican and embarrassed by marrying a Greek immigrant), which is not relevant to the Italian rural context that Visconti allows for class antagonisms to occupy a central position and play among the beasts of the passionate, condemned love affair of the two main characters. This film is a complex, tense, rewarded experience.
