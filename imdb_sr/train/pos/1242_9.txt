I love this movie. She is well written and acting and has a good cinema. The story combines action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with great sets and beautiful locations. See it, buy it, show it to your friends. The acting is good and Murphi especially does a good job portraying an unwilling hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found them interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions. a stunningly attractive girl and a holy child are saving their lives - who can not see it? - He continued to make me happy when everything was finally accomplished. Thank God, the dignity of this film has never been destroyed with a shitty continuation. Take popcorn, lick on the couch and watch this fun, happy and funny movie.
