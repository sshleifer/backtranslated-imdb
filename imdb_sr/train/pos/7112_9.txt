A very good war movie that shows the effects of war on a boy from a hometown that loses sight on Guadalcanal and has to come home and adjust again with the help of family and friends. A great acting actor helps make this movie fun. The role of Eleanor Parker as a girl was worth the Oscar nomination. She's so innocent of her in this movie. The role of Ann Doran was as satisfactory as all her little supporting roles. Especially I love the gender aura of pre-war Phildelphia. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the war scene in Guadalcanal really showed the horror that our soldiers faced during this epic battle. A well-deserved film and one that should not be forgotten
