This is not the best movie of White Lagos, but it has good access to the old style for the terrible entertainment of the '40s. Brides fall dead on the altar like a fly. I think I would postpone the wedding until they catch the villain, but it's a horror movie, so I guess people ignore the danger for some reason. In any case, Lagos is a crazy doctor, who needs a young woman's blood to keep her old, sick woman healthy and happy. He always avoids Keystone's policemen hiding bodies in a dead car (who would think they were looking for a corpse in a dead car?), And the brides just keep on singing. No film like this would be complete without Lois Lane, a female reporter who wants to catch the criminal himself. Good in dealing with crime, poorly keeping your mouth shut at the wrong time, guess who Lagosi chose his next victim. I love the "house with the haunted" in which Lois Lane roared like a storm as a guest in Lagosian villa. Hidden passages, women like vampires, evil dwarf Igor assistant, and so on. Good things. Pretty well-paced pacing keeps the movie motion, and the story is resolved in a typical, but satisfactory way. If you like old horror movies, this is worth watching.
