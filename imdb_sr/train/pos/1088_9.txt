Cari Grant and Mirna Loi are perfectly thrown as a middle class couple who want to build a house of their dreams. Everything starts with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are flooded with innumerable complications and an explosion of the original budget. There are lots of great laughs (even if the story is a little thin) will surely entertain the lovers of the star or the Hollywood comedic style of the late 1940s. It definitely stands out when the artist goes through all the expenses, which sounded rather exaggerated for the audience in 1948. As it arrives, the client assures (Granta) that he might be able to achieve a $ 100 reduction from the total ... or at least 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00. Hilarious!
