I was surprised that "Secret Rage" was a nice good movie ... Probably because I did not have any expectations for this movie ..... Although the movie has its holes ..... I would say that you can not guess who is behind the whole scheme, to the very end of the film ... In the beginning, I thought, it was Robert Rian, using the same method as "Gaslight," where the husband is trying to get rid of his wife, but I made a mistake ...... The main problem, with the film, is to drive in the other direction, which at the beginning did not give any clues. ..... I thought Robert Ryan & Claudette Colbert were well wearing their parts ...... Plus, Vivian Vance, a fine art actress, who steals the scene in this ... Those who love movies, which and keeps speculating, will you like this ......
