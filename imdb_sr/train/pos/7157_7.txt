The movie is a fun, fun and quality movie. The film follows the guidelines of the book very cleverly and strives to keep accurate lines. Actors are all suitable, and you would expect them to be part. They use some famous actors who give a big effect to the film. The graphics are a little suspicious in some parts, and there are many mistakes during the movie. For example, there is no such thing as a yellow lizard seen. The camp is not as horrible as it is explained in the book, and does not seek to show what is happening in the camp as a book. All his group is mentioned a lot in the book, but they are not in the movie. All in all, a great movie for the rainy afternoon
