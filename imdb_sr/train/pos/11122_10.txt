When we started watching this series on the cable, I had no idea how dependent it would be. Even when you hate the character, you hold on because they are so nicely developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed, or temptation in the way they do it. It's almost like the viewer experiences one of Christopher's learning curves. I can not understand why Adriana would suffer Christopher's abuse, verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read to see how many women can tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream house, an endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she would give up her beloved and faithful husband - or maybe not. That's why I'm watching. It does not matter how many times you watch an episode, you can find something that you missed the first five times. We even watch episodes in sequence (watch Season 1 on late night with commercials, but the whole language, A & E with censored language, repetition on the movie network) - whenever they are, we are here. Now we are completely spoiled. I love and Malapropove. "Albacore around my door" is my favorite Johnny Boi. When these jewels entered our family vocabulary, it is a sign that I should get a life. I want the series to finish, and I've collected all the DVDs and put the collection in my will.
