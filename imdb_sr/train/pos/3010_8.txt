The final reconnaissance of Villyama Povella, such as Philo Vance, occurs in the case of a murder in a cynological institution, where the murder of a dog in the championship leads to two more murders and one attempt of a human kind. It's all about discovering how it leads to who and why. Philo Vance's murder by SS Van Dine was at that time the most popular, and clever Mr. Van Dine discovered a way to sell his books to one of the largest bidders. That's why you see so much Philo Vance and so many studies that expose them. If Bill Povell did not become famous with MGM as Nick Charles from the Thin Man series, he would be known as the biggest Philo Vance. It turns out that Povell entered his small Terrier Captain in the same competition where the killed dog was killed, and then another rival owner became the first victim of the murder. As usual, Pauel appears Eugene Palette as sergeant Heath whose greatest contribution in the proceedings was to use his mass to bring down the lock from the inner door where the first victim of the murder was found. I said that it was locked from the inside and was the upper story, so it was to determine how. Pauel has a wonderful group of suspects, as extreme as it is otherwise in a thin man's mystery. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, Mari Astor, are well-fulfilling their roles. Varner Brothers loved this version so much that in the thirties they made it again with James Stephenson in his one and only trip as Philo Vance. Do not keep a candle for this. Since this is the only Povell Philo Vance that is on VHS or DVD, in any case, you can see this or can get it.
