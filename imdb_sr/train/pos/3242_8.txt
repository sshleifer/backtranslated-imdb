I saw this movie with my father. I must have been pretty young, around 15. It was in Star Movies movies one afternoon. He really took a step after the first half an hour. All actors are brilliant, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I assume it's an ensemble, they just play so well together. I can watch this movie at any time. I think it's the relative stupidity of complications and characters who are trying to cope with a very strange result. Jokes are not torn, but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious. Perfect comedy for lazy afternoon.
