With few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's dramas have virtually disappeared from the theater these days. Too cunning, too much is heard to be a general judgment. This BBC version of one of Shavin's funniest games does not deny that judgment. It's definitely a bow and a conversation, but it's also wonderful. And because of the quality of the British theater, it perfectly acted with actors for whom - with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - most of us probably never heard. Carter is wonderful as a Bulgarian girl who hides a professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later falls in love with him. One could argue with a particularly hilarious interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Riecart), a Bulgarian horsemen who led the accusations into the enemy lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his machine guns. However, the role of the call for excessive action and Riecart was obviously said to be excessively acting. Other players are perfect. Carter as a self-trampling Bulgarian aristocrat and Torrens as a wealthy Swiss soldier are, of course, at the center of the game, and they are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" appears as a recorded play. But, you will hardly ever see a movie from Shaw that does not reveal its origin. Plots are mostly smart. However, Shaw is all about dialogue. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the sets are intangible. Enjoy what it is.
