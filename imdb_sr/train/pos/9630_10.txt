I saw Dirty Vork several times and probably my favorite Stan and Ollie are short. In this, Stan and Ollie are cleaning chimneys and get a job to clean the chimney at home by Professor Noodle (Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle makes crazy experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie are causing a big chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess in the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into the special formula reservoir that Noodle uses for his experiments and turns it into a chimpanzee! It is best that Ollie drops down the chimney and drops a bunch of bricks on his head, but there seems to be no pain in it. Dirty job is Stan and Ollie in their funniest. Great fun. 5 stars from 5.
