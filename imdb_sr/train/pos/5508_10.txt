The year was 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who was a Cuban citizen for the last five years, disappears from the face of the Earth, leaving the dark Fidel Castro to announce that he is probably dead when, in fact, Cuba went to move to Bolivia to survived the assumed identity. Living in La Paz, Guevara assumes the idea to overthrow the corrupt, bourgeois government there. Once again, Steven Soderberg takes the place where 'Che: Part One' goes (only better this time). Pacing is more targeted, the job of the act is always so fine (including the turning of the ill-mannered Benecio Del Toro, as Che Guevara). Suffice it to say that it is best to see both films, to get a true story about Guevara and how he was a man (I had a rare opportunity to see both films on a projection ---- talk about a long way!). As with Che-Part 1: The Argentine, this film does not have a MPAA rating, but contains enough salt language and violence to easily catch it as "R".
