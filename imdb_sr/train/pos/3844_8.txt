When you read the summary of this film, you may think it's something weird and in some ways it's, for the primary character of this film, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbe) haunts vision and hallucination. The visions that Gerard sees are all (more or less) subtle indications of what will happen to him while the story continues, and it is a great time for spectators to try to understand the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and a few indication of the end of the film, the film retains a very high level of excitement and does not become dull even minutes. This is mainly due to the great performances of Jeron Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk (Christine) and the great direction of the entire film by Paul Verhoeven. His directorial style is clearly visible and can be said, looking at him from different angles, that 'De Vierde Man' is a typical Verhoeven film. Not only will it look typical for people who are familiar with his American movies due to nudity and graphic violent scenes, but will also seem typical for people familiar with his Dutch films, for the same things and his talent to tell a great story. When people watch American Verhoeven films, short-sighted people can say, he has no talent to tell a good story and focus only on blood and sex. That's what some people think, while I think that he is a very talented director who is trying to convey a deeper message to every single film. Although not a good movie, Hollywood Man (his latest American film) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than a science fiction movie and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more different films. He needs it. Just watch his Dutch movies. Not only do they show that he needs certain freedom, but also shows a remarkable talent. 'De Vierde Man' brought him a step closer to Hollivood and certainly is one of his best. 8 of 10
