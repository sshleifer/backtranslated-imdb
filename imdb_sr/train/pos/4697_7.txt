Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerousli" in this release on gangster films made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sick mother, Griffin Dunne is his brother YES, Peter Boile is his boss, and Marilyn Henner is his girlfriend. The other stars are Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays the owner of the pets' store in the 1930s, who catches a child who steals a puppy, and then tells him how he comes back, how he came to own a pet store. In his youth, he turned to the thieves to help his mother pancreas ($ 49.95, especially this week) and began working for the mafia boss (Boile). Johnny uses the surname "Dangerous" in the world of mobsters. In this film there are some hilarious scenes, and Stapleton is a mess as replaced Johnny's sore mother who needs an organ in her body. Peter Boile as Johnny's boss gives a very funny performance, as well as Griffin Dunne, a shotgun DA that will not play the ball with a distorted Burre (Danni De Vito). Like Johnny's enemy, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri stands out as Moronie, who is bothered by English - but you must hear him do it, not read about it. What makes it funny is that it all works with an angry face. The film gets a little tired to the end, but it's worth a look at it, and Keaton is brilliant as a good guy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this movie was underestimated when it was released, and like Keaton's second gem, "Night Shift," you do not hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real jewels, you will find "Johnny Dangerousli" immensely pleasing.
