I watched this movie somehow accidentally, buying it as a B side on the Omega Man DVD. Omega Man was a bit disappointing - except for the beginning, which was obviously the inspiration for Daisy Later, the rest is just a matter of TV films. But Soilent Green is in the second league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in a movie that I have never seen before. Heston casually entered the bed with "furniture" while he was discussing something else, completely unrelated! A whole bunch of people picked up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest who confesses and confesses. Maybe it's been done since then - but there are not many movies that are so consistently original. And what happens between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Fortunately, I saw this film not knowing the end - which is obviously rare. Then I looked at him again, and I enjoyed all the little traces that make long early scenes worth the effort. Very nice script - and some great sets. Just when you thought you saw everything. . .
