(spoilers) I was not sure what to think about the movie. Not too much for a children's movie. It's definitely worth seeing with a parent because it involves death and dying. But I was surprised that I had a little fun. I was a bit disappointed 81 minutes of the time we had. (even less without a loan) And the trailer will tell you to think that the rodent is the main creature. But, you're torturing him. To the end of the movie. These two horns were anchored by the movie 2 stars. But I recommend a movie. Even for continuing. 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replaiable: 7/10
