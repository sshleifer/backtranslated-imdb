I was very surprised by this film. I was touched by the lives Paulie touched on her way to find her "Marie" little girl from whom she was separated. Humor was also very good and did not hurt the story as I thought it would probably do. In fact, I expected that "paulie want to crack the jokes" to hurt this movie, but even that was done in a very witty scene that is very touching when Pauli is at a news conference at a research lab. So if you want to see a good movie about the talking animal, check this, much better than Doctor DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprise turn in the end, which works well.
