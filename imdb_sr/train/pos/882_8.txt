I picked up this from the library library and I was very pleasantly surprised. Many of the narrow, Expressionist cameras, the equally solid script and two top actors join together to create a very fine movie. Not for the reptilian multiplek brains, but for the real movie lover. If Hollivood ever gets its dirty hands, I'm sure it will ruin it. The choice is treated everywhere around. The other posters here are more than enough to sing his praise, so I should not try to duplicate their boots; just take their advice, and mine, and do not miss this gem. Call it how you like it; I call it two hours of well-spent fun. Read my lips: do not miss it.
