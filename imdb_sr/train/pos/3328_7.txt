Today, it's seldom to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly repulsive in short terms throughout the film (eg Big Fat Greek Wedding; I, Sebe & Irene). There were only a few senseless jokes in the film, nothing embarrassing. Everywhere around, it was a sweet movie with nice characters. I thought the end was a little bit sharper. It looks like it was supposed to end it on the world series for a real kick. The operation was a bit more desirable, but it was compensated for by the pace of the story. If I knew it was Brother Farrell's film, I guess it was an impairment in the stomach and that I did not watch it, but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making a good movie. Good for them, I hope that he will pull his head out of the rest of the road and begin to consistently make good films.
