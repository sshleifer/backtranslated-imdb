I do not think I'll ever understand the hatred of Rennie Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool and gave it to the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most exciting action movies ever. That's right, you little bastards, the rules of "Cliffhanger," and we all know it. Same game Gabe Valker, a former alpinist who only visits his old city when asked for help from his former friend, Hal Tucker, helps to save on the mountain peak. Walker obviously returned at a good time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves headed by Eric Kowloon (John Lithgov). Kualen & Co. they lost a lot of money that they stole from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and would really like it ... In fact, "Cliffhanger" is another "Die Hard" clone. Just exchange the boundaries of Nakatomi Beach to the open mountain ranges of Rocka Mountains, along with the scenes that are created to indicate the weakness of our hero and keep him dead. Naturally, this setting is soon totally ruined, because Stallone's character avoids a fairly large number of bullets and easily faces several faces, with no visible side effects. After all, is not that what is being done in action movies? Cliffhanger is one of the most exciting action films in the area. Exhibition of big scenes and acrobats. One of the early tricks is one of the best stops I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie is not better than at the beginning, it keeps its action incredible. Leading criminal John Lawgov is funny and one bad guy. Very likely one of the best villains ever. 'Cliffhanger' is simply one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely the best effort of Rennie Harlin, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
