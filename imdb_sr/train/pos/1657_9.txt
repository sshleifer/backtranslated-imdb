And this is especially true for lawyer and police. Puerto Rico, which boasts a small, but powerful film production company, brings this multilayered story of corruption, due to a growing cartel that begins in South America, stops on the island, and then in the North America. Steven Bauer, the most recognizable face on the screen, leads the actors of top actors, in the story of "Can you spot the only reputable face in the crowd?" Ricardo Mendez Matta is out of action-based adventure for American television, in a script written by Matta, along with Poli Marichal. The rest of the actors (Elpidia Carrillo, Magda Rivera, Jose Herredia, Luz Maria Randon, to mention a few) turn in such fine roles, in a film that will ask you "do you have prominent characters here?" I spoke in Spanish with English subtitles. Estimated 'R' by MPAA, this film contains vulgar language outputs, short flicker nudes, adult content and violence, some of which are pretty bad.
