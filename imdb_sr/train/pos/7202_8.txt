Long before Brokeback Mountain (about 23 years ago), "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two people who were passionately kissing on the screen, and honestly, I was shocked. I understood it in terms of action, and that did not really upset my sensibilities (not much), but it was the first time I've ever seen it, at least, in the "mainstream" movie. I thought it was a brave move for my time, and he was terrified to try, especially Christopher Reeve, in the midst of his time as Superman. Male bisexuality on the screen may have hit its "Brokeback", but it is interesting to note this much earlier incarnation.
