What can be said about a movie that has one of the darkest, the most fanatic, and sometimes the strangest - I will not say 'compassionate'. Flinn and Fairbanks were at their peak? This is the epic about stubborn, sometimes crazy, incredibly brave and honest man who fights for his honor and freedom from tyranny. I liked it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very moving, gentle and sensual.
