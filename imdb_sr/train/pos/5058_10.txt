There should be more movies about our Indians. I especially think that the use of real American Indians would be the right thing. I know that Archie Belanei, played by Pierce Brosnan, has done a great job of being an Englishman. But my suggestion to Hollivood is to put more American Indians in the roles, and we never use anyone else. Siouk Nation is too long on the back burner. Their poverty is a disgrace to our country. I am firmly convinced that our country should return the black hills to the Sijuks. We ask Israel to return their land to the Arabs, but we do not try to do the same, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!
