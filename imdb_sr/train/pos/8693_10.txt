I was pretty young when this came out in the US, but I recorded it from TV and I watched it again and again until I remembered it all. To this day, I still catch myself quoting him. The show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra, Silvester Stallone to Mr. T. The voices were brilliant and they sounded like the characters they were displaying. The dolls were also well made, though somewhat creepy. I'm surprised that I recently discovered that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Nailor from Red Dwarf, which shows that I'm enjoying it. As another person wrote a comment earlier, I was also robbed of this great show by a "friend" who lent him and never returned it. I certainly want there is enough request for this show to release a DVD release, but I do not think that people have heard enough about it. Oh well, maybe I'll try e-bai ...
