This is filming the film in the simplest way and it's best. I had doubts, because although Freeman is a great actor, sometimes he gets involved in bad projects; This is not one of those moments. It's a small story that lasts just over an hour and fifteen, at a time when we get used to the fact that movies become longer and longer, and not necessarily better, the director uses a short time to his advantage, because the characters are so well defined from the very beginning (great portraits of Freeman and Vega), that little information about them seems real, Morgan himself, although he himself does not mention himself, he has not been in the movie for several years because he was saturated with work, and developed a fear to devote the script, and doing research for the character in the indie movie where the store manager / manager is permarketa. The story starts with the fact that it is in capsules in an inaccessible place where lucky cashier 10 or fewer things (Vega) and has to travel with it because the "production" has forgotten to pick it up. In many ways, it's a road movie, Morgan delivers a laugh, and strangely agrees with his invincible smile and a positive perspective on everything, showing himself to a successful actor who has trained his mind to be able to define all that see the character he could play, and Paz (by the way, what a wonderful beautiful woman, even more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings vulnerability to a 25-year-old separated woman who works harder than all others without getting the credit to finish the job in a shitty supermarket. It's speech, it has a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and fun, serious and sad is well maintained, the characters become so cute immediately that you spend the last 20 minutes praying for more screen times Strange couple, but shortness is in the nature of the story, so it was a good call from the director to not surrender.
