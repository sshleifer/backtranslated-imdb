Jet Li brings his charismatic presence back to the screen in the Black Mask movie. In this film, Li plays Tsui, a fugitive from a super-soldiers program trying to regain the mankind he took away from his program. To do this, Tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life, but destiny requires that he purify the problems of his past before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the super-soldiers program fled at the same time as Tsui, but they want to equalize themselves with the world, not to find inner peace. Thus Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former teammates from publishing information that could cost many lives of innocent people. This film screams across the screen at a low tempo and never leaves its audience. Martial arts are incredible, but because they use wires, they can not be appreciated as much as the American audience deserves. If you love action movies that have an interesting story and look for good acting as they deal with psychological and physical conflicts, then Black Mask is for you. I'm glad to see that some of Jet Li's films are finally getting a major show in the United States and I'm looking forward to seeing the changes that this release will require (such as dubbing and soundtrack) affecting the movie. This is one of the best Li movies, comes out and sees it on May 14 when it's released in America.
