This film is apparently low-budget and recorded in British Columbia, Canada. The barriers that needed to be overcome in order to make this film persuasive (set up in California and the late '60s' 80s) was well conceived. I believe this is the best and most accurate version of the zodiac killings that hit the city of Vallejo & Bai Area from 1968-19? Edward James Olmos (Det. Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac - believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen, after being cleaned by DNA and fingerprints) play the game of a cat and a mouse that visits the crime scene together, each attempting to launch another in an emotional discovery. Olmos is dying of a kind of terminal illness and knows that Dzundza did it, still completely obsessed to the extent that she lost her family and became a full alcoholic on the road. completely unconscious and complacent (like all serial killers) into the bloodshed that remained in his watch. The only disappointment was "over the top" that was otherwise quite precise. ,Take a look at.
