This is another great movie that I was fortunate to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker et al). In the late 80's I was a relative novelist in the genre and just really new about the big three JC, SH & IB. I was not sure what to expect when I paid my hard-earned money to see it in the Triple Classic Account in old Scala. I do not have to worry, I stayed out of breath from this movie. If you are a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and have not seen this movie, do it NOW!
