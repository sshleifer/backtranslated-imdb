That's how I felt when I was watching this movie. I liked it. It was hilarious. But I felt as if I got a secret look at someone's psyche, and then laughed as she turned to create an interesting point. A friend says it like this: "I feel like we broke into someone's house and now without their knowledge we watch their terrible home videos." Another of these facts is strange than fictitious films. "Groovin 'Gary, the original Beaver Kid, is a guy from a small town who appears in a nearby TV station in the hope of being on the movie - and certainly it does, although not perhaps, as he expected at the beginning. With great hopes of fame and the importance of calling Harris to come and make a really terrible search for the talents he organized in his hometown - which he initiated by his own act, "Olivia Nevton-Don". Director, Trent Harris, is doing a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story. Some clips of an accidental kid who wants to be some morphs, through two subsequent reinterpretations, in a story about the freedom from suppressed sexual identity in a small city of America. At the same time Harris criticizes the views of the small city of America, the cult of celebrities and exploitation practices of the film and television industry. And Sean Penn and Grispin Glover pull out performer performances. young Sean Penn is most memorable - he closely monitors the actual 'Garry footage', but with strong nuances that give way to the meaning of interaction as Harris wants to go. The end of the wide eye of naivety The original Gary is what triggered me - when he opposes these possible interpretations of his situation. Film that should not be missed. I did not see anything like that. Jacob.
