The Dirty Harry series started with a very brave police action, and was almost immediately illuminated by "Magnum Force". By the time the "The Enforcer" turned, Dirty Harry was just a little more than a television police show (saved by Tine Dali only). After a seven-year break, Dirty Harry finally returned to his roots. Perhaps this time was absent too long. Clint Eastwood makes the first well-rehearsed Harry movie since Don Siegel made the first, which significantly helps. Harry is again a darker figure, not a handsome policeman he has become. He can once again say things like "Go, make me a day," and that's what you really mean. "Sudden Impact" is a real Dirty Harry sequel. "The Enforcer" should never have been made. 7.2 from 10
