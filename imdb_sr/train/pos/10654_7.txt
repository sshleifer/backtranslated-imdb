The Haunting is a movie that boasts a very creepy house, good effects and good work. There are scenes that make you jump, and the evil aspects of what happened at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are genuinely terrible moments in the film, and I liked how the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. The result of Jerry Goldsmith gave him the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices that popped up around you. What I want to happen is that it's a little bit more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to fight and I think he got a little too much. Poltergeist scared me when I saw him many years ago, and he's still holding on. Haunting could have used several more scenes of pure terror. The end was for me, a little anti-climatic. All in all, I enjoyed it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just want to be more scared of me.
