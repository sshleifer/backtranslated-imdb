I watch most of Nick Mancuso's films, because, frankly, I love this guy, although he's like a baddie, he's usually baddie (long-time fans should note that for some reason they are blondes). It's a pretty famous movie in terms of complication (but most of the movies are not really original these days), but Rick Roberts is as attractive as an imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac is just as attractive as her daughter, and Mitzi Kapture works well, if that was its goal, Be angry and sometimes quite tough. Nick still has it in the sense of demonstrating both charm and psychosis. However, too much complication takes place outside of the screen - such as motivation, previous behavior, good times and bad weather - and things that seem obvious to characters are never reaching the audience (ie Me). The final scene leaves everything to get in the category "but what is ...", and all in all, I can not say that I care about any character. That being said, it was - a reasonably fun way to spend the afternoon - and I still like Nick.
