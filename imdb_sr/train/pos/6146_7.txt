Perhaps Disney hoped for another Mari Poppins, but this is quite another story, and while Angela is wonderful, she was a very different performer for the great Julie Andrevs. Saying Lansburi is perfectly thrown and brings a magic show. Something is tasteful about her character and gives her the wonderful support of David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can carry a melody, but he certainly is not much cut off as a singer. It does not matter that he was such a talented actor you barely notice. There are some great cameos from many beloved stars of some other time like Roddy McDowell who gives a winning performance and a much loved Tessie OShea who does very little but it's nice to see the old girl again. It is also great to see Sam Jaffe and King Bruce Forsithe of the English television in small roles. The result is a few nice songs, especially The Brini Sea and Age of Not Believe. A large number of Portabello Road extends to the limit, but it has a lot of theatricality. The effects seem a bit clich√© today, but the scene with the German attackers attacking the craziest army in the film is quite impressive. Children are not as boring as other movies, but they struggle to understand what the youngest boy says. I loved the song of the local army. The home guard was very important for Britain and this is a warm acknowledgment. The animation is wonderful, much better than Picard I found grotesque. A warm, happy movie and his miracle is not on the scene.
