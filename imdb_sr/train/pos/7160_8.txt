A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be rewarded for effort. The "holes" do not make the same mistake as you would expect from Disney's movie about troubled teenagers in the camp. For the first time, the events have not been explained in detail. Flashback scenes really serve the purpose and represent several mature topics that can surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a bit overwhelmed by the seriousness of the film. But soon I realized that we must endure these moments to see the beauty of the story. In addition to the story, this film also explores well some methods used in penitentiary institutions. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to learn Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build a character, such as reading the reading will not contribute). "Holes" is a film that is clever and beautiful. Must watch!
