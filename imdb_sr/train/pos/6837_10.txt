A typical De Palma film is made with lots of styles and some scenes that will bring you to the edge of your seat. Surely what makes this movie better than the average thriller is style. There are some brilliantly arranged scenes and some scenes that are really nervous, which will lead you to the edge of your seat. The best scene from the movie; Museum scene and murder of elevators. There are some mild erotic scenes and the movie rhythm may not be fast enough for a random viewer to fully appreciate this movie. So this movie may not be suitable for everyone. The story itself is also pretty good, but it's really the style that makes the film work! It can only be for fans, but also occasional viewers should appreciate the well-built tension in the movie. There are some nice characters that portray a good actor. Michael Caine is an interesting choice and Angie Dickinson behaves as well as it looks good (not bad for the 49-year-old!). Like his movie for the other De Palma film "Be Double". brilliant nerve thriller. I love De Palma! 10/10
