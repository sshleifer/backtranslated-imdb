This exciting story of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable for watching DVD years after PBS broadcasting, with sharper images and clearer sound. My only reservation is that the plot has several incredible moments and that some of the stronger masters accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, even missing words here and will not ruin the party: the primary actors are ideally thrown. Robson Green brings a puzzling smile, good temperament and sportiness in the capacity of a young surgeon who hopelessly falls for his superiors in a hospital where he has just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking of 50 women imaginable; her acting rivals are her beauty. (Love scenes between these two show better than the words how little difference in age for them!) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and perfectly depicted. The combination of sophisticated dialogue and passionate surplus makes this beautiful miniseries. As Russell Baker noted in his introduction, you may not be morally improving by looking at "Reckless" - but you'll have lots of fun. (Continued, the part of the DVD box set, provides a wild but satisfactory two-hour unfolding. You will not want to miss it if you enjoyed what was before.)
