I've seen it 25 years ago at PBS. It was very difficult to watch. So real. Watching this little family battle in winter was the heart. There is no time for courtesy: fate has cast us down and we put our shoulders on the stone and made it work. It was based on the real diary of a woman, which I read many years later. In her diary she said that her parents died when she was small and that all their disorders and sisters had to work on the farm to feed. She learned to mow, which was not like the ladies. She was afraid that no charming prince would have wanted a woman with a brown sun, his stinging hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife was able to mow, and she was happy to do so. Both were widows and worked together to build a new home. It was so, so sad when the baby died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would be good. It just makes the tragedy extremely sad. I was crying so much. But then they came out and successfully pulled out new calfs. Spring is on its way, and life continues. She had two more boys in her diary and they lived.
