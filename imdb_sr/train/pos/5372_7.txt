From the first five episodes of Hammer's short series "Hammer House of Horror", this fifth episode with the beautiful title "The House That Bled to Death" is probably the hottest. As a big fan of Gothic Horror films for many years, I wonder what has been waiting for me so long to finally start watching the series recently. So far, I have only seen the first five episodes, and I have a strong feeling that it's best yet, but even if the series is as fun as the first five episodes, I will be satisfied. While the second and third episodes are great for watching their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor, this fifth entry is definitely one of the first five that brings the most original Horror. This episode starts when an older man kills his wife from unknown motivations. Years later, Nicholas Ball and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) moved into the house with their little daughter Sophie (Emma Ridlei). Soon after moving, the family has to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house, which is apparently persecuted ... The second episode directed by Francis Megahi is much better than his average previous entry, "(Episode 4), and quite unknown actors give The film is also well-made in terms of effects, cinema and scorecards. "The Fading House" is a solid episode that brings elements that my fellow Hammer fans would like to see in a short story movie. The movie brings a furious atmosphere, real moments zas demanding and intelligent turns, and is tense and very fun from start to finish. All in all, this is highly recommended for Hammer fans.
