I was a fan of Jodie Foster since we were both kids from her Disney Years. In movies such as Candleshoe I loved her masculine fool. "Foxes" were such a big departure from all of this. Where were the other young female actresses of that time turned into a sexual childhood disguised as a comedy ("Little Darlings", anybody?), Jodie went on a depressing and tragic story about the teenagers who led to their death by the powerful attraction of temptation and addiction. This was not Porki. This was not Hallowed. This was a dark and powerful story of the destruction of young lives. Unfortunately, this is a story that is still broadcast every day throughout the country, this movie can be reproduced (with the current soundtrack) and still be fully relevant. It's not the best movie ever made, it's tiring in some parts, not all performances are particularly prominent. But Jodie Foster continued to show her heads as a real adult actor (the trend began when she was very young in Taki Driver). 7 of 10 Barki
