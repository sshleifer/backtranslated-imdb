First I saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on television. In fact, I was expecting watching the movie when it was advertised and it was more than fulfilling my expectations. Now I bought a DVD and I plan to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's A Wonderful Life", I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" one of the best Christmas films ever made. George C. Scott is an excellent and top-notch actor who leads Roger Rees around him! Scott proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself. How can one be remembered as Patton and Scrooge? Scott works so easily. The direction is marvelous with fine sets, costumes and music that give the film a special feeling of time, place and era. You will simply love this movie and put it among your favorites to watch during the holidays.
