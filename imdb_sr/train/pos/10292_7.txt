Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of Carrei. Although I will admit that I have not seen all his films * cough * magic * cough *. Bruce Almighty was pleased. None of the other reviews really did get into how it would wrap up in the end, I do not know what the writers thought. Somehow I could not help but feel that this film was a bad attempt to re-create a liar. . You see Bruce Almighty if you are a big fan of Jim Carrei, or just want to see the unusual (kue soft piano music) a funny comedy.
