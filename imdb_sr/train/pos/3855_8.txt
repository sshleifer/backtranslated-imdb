Morbid Catholic writer Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbe), a homosexual, alcoholic and frequent vision of death, is invited to hold a lecture at the Literary Club Vlissingen. While at a railway station in Amsterdam, he feels rude attraction to a handsome man who moves in another train. Gerard meets with the treasurer of the club and beautician Christine Halsslag (Renee Soutendijk), who is a wealthy widow who owns a beauty salon Sphink, and has one night. The next morning, Gerard sees the image of Kristina's boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and recognizes him as the man he saw at the train station. She suggests to bring Herman to her house to spend several days together, but with the secret intent to seduce a man. Christine travels to Cologne to bring her boyfriend, and Gerard stays alone in his house. He drinks whiskey and snuff box, finding three movie drums with men's names; decides to watch footage and finds that Kristina has married for three and everyone has been killed in tragic accidents. Later Gerard believes that Kristina is a witch and whether Herman or he will be her convicted fourth husband. The ambiguous "Vierde Man" is another magnificent character of Paul Verhoeven at his Dutch stage. The story is supported by a great script that uses Catholic symbols to build tensions associated with smart dialogues; the magnificent performance of Jeroen Krabbe in the role of a disturbed alcohol writer; and stunning cinema. The unsolvable resolution is open to interpretation as in many European films that explore common sense and intelligence of viewers. There are central directors who use nakedness in front of men to promote their films; however, Paul Verhoeven uses the nakedness of Gerard Reve as part of the plot and is never aggressive or seeking sensationalism. Last but not least; androgena beauty sexy Renee Soutendijk perfectly fits into her role as a woman who attracts gai writer. My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): "About 4o Homem" ("The Fourth Man")
