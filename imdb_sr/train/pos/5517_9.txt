Che: The first part was a fascinating experiment, which did not just tell a very interesting story, but tried to do something different with the "biographical" genre. The second part is a great culmination of this experiment. This film offers all the same attributes from the first, from extraordinary performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) to the brilliant regime of Steven Soderbergh, not forgetting his intention to break with the conventional rules in biography. What I admire from Soderbergh's experiments ... always try to do something different and unusual, and they manage most of the time. The final message from this film is perfect and includes everything that we have It's been said about the life of Che Guervare. The only failure I found in Cheu: The second part is that a few parts feel somewhat irrelevant. In short, I give che: The second part of the very enthusiastic recommendation, as the first, it's a brave and fascinating expert who challenges the viewer and leaves us thinking.
