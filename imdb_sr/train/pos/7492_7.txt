Although it's not a horror movie in the traditional sense, this creepy little movie brings goods. It seems that a vampire is free in a small German city that exhausts the victims of their blood. Police Inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvin Douglas in one of his early roles, is skeptical because he believes the crazy killer is not a vampire. The only one who trusts her is Ruth Bertin (Faie Vrai), a girl inspector and assistant in the laboratory of dr. The locals suspect the strange Herman Gleib, who played with his usual madness of the Dvette Frie, which seems to be very entertaining with his role. The film contains a lot of humor to help relieve the intensity of all murders. One funny part is Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Aunt Ruth Bertin, thinking that the strange Herman has not turned into a bat, but in a dog. Maude Eburne and Dvight Frie make a good comedy comedy. This budget film brings items from Dr. Caligari's Cabinet with dr. orders, from "Frankenstein" using human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and "Dracula" from murder, it is believed from all but the inspector and his girlfriend that it was a bloodsucker. These elements are well mixed by director Frank R. Straiera with a small comedy that got a good measure. The fabrication works. The revamped version I was looking at used tinting in order to increase the creepy atmosphere. Try to view this version if possible.
