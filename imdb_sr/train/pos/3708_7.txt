The lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cats and mice when joining femme fatale in this adaptation of the Grisham novel. Altman creates an uncertain, gothic atmosphere, but the scenario is weak. Sporting on the south side, Branagh is convincing as a lawyer, and Davidtz is tempting as an object of his own desire. Dovei is as nice as a private detective. Duval has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his strange character. Hannah and Berenger round off impressive actors. After an interesting setup, the film stops and does not fulfill its initial promise, but Altman is always worth a look.
