Although the story is essentially routine, and the ending of "surprises" is nothing but a bad joke for the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - offering them roles in which good actors can shine and shine. The film is flawlessly made - for its time. It was redesigned in 2000 as "Under Suspicion" and if you just want to see one version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), I recommend this one, with Hopkins up-to-date and more explicit. references to the drawing points that the original could only hint. The end, however, continues to blow. (** 1/2)
