This is a very unusual movie in which the star with the top of the charge does not appear literally up to halfway. Nevertheless, I was engaged by the hook Phantom Lada. Curtis, although competent as a fictitious Accused Scott Henderson, seems a little hard to be cute (perhaps he should have had to shave his shouldache), and his behavior when he first came home was to convince cops at least some degree of innocence. While the other commentator had problems with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlow, his portrait of the character was impressively complex. He's not a villain. Superior actor Elisha Cook Jr. is again in a top form as a 'little man with great ambitions'. His drumming in musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism. This film, however, is carried by very capable and handsome Ella Raines, as a dedicated lover Henderson, Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent and her presence on the screen is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first part of her work I've seen and I'm definitely inclined to see her other roles. The rest of the support head is also more than competent. All in all, a very satisfying film memoir of the mystery that, when viewed today, is completely transmitted by the dark and complex urban world for which it is intended. Recommended, 8/10.
