Pushing Daisies is just a wonderful fairy tale, with the nuances of "Amelie" aesthetics and romance. It has a beautiful palette, well-designed and detailed, with names and dialogue, subtle and sophisticated to be real, imagination great, and the depth of romance. on you, because blue can not be found in other sets or recordings (with few exceptions). Take a strange natural and completely satisfying song that comes out of the scene. His result is beautiful, his acting is top quality, there is great music, and the two leading romantic stars can not touch each other or die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (Actually, I wanted to find the way around this, but c'est la vie). It's easy to show that it is a pleasure to spend a watch with, and I recommend it high. There was no other television like this, and I'd love to see more. It has gone through one flu for a week, which is good for society. Return it back!
