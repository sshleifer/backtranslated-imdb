I saw this show 3-4 years ago. That was funny! When I first saw that he played on ETV (Estonian Television) I started to love him. It's a shame that this show is bad for me. Hide as a cool guy who loves to sing Frank Sinatra! And it comes to a stupid idea. He got those glasses that are brown. I love it . And there is FeZ. Group Pervert. We all know what he does when he is alone ... ... he wants to be bad. He even had him with his boss in one episode. His is from India. And there's Michael, the dumbest guy on the whole group, probably the stupidest in town and his cop! He's so stupid that I remember to follow: Hide says: Did you call the cops? - Michael does not come and say. Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? He's a city playboy. Then comes Jackie, who is formerly Michael's girlfriend and then Hide's girlfriend. Then Eric Vho is the son of a war veteran and his son, Kitty, a housewife. His big cunt. But he likes Donna, his girlfriend with whom they plan to get married. Donna is one pretty girl. What have I forgotten? Ahid lives in the basement.
