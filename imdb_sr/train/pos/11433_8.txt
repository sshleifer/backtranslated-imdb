Despite the patronage of George Lucas, this amazing and completely original fantasy in "Lumage" (a combination of animation through live action clips) is so far away from the usual child's tariff as everything Ralph Bakshi made at its peak. Brilliantly imagined characters such as Ralph (one of the two bumbling, discarded heroes), Sinonamess Botch (a hilarious evil villain) and Rod Rescueman (a pompous superhero beginner) breathed life into a uniquely clever concept: Frivoli vs. Murkwood or, eternal battle between dreams and nightmares. In this context, sound recordings caused by the ILO should not work, but somehow. The real damage is, therefore, that I had to watch this through really scrupulous boots (extracted from the TV screen) of the uncensored version ?? there is also a milder variant that tinted the tongue for VHS release ?? because the movie is otherwise unavailable on DVD. Interestingly, both Henri Selick and David Fincher worked on this image in subordinate capacities.
