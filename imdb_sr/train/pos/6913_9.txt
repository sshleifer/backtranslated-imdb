As an actor in a theater society trying to do it, but not taking it too seriously, I am always entertained by those who treat him as Great Art. This film relentlessly evades "acting craft," while smiling a lot smiling. The actor at the location for the film has similarities with the dictator. When a dictator dies from a heart attack of too many drinks and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play "part of life" by a neo-Nazi chief of secret service. He is a game on the handle, brings the dictator's girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa, and beautifully turns tables for his captors. Many good things on the heads, lots of good work by some unknown supporters, especially housekeeping staff and two members of the guard palace, and fun little Comeos. Sammi Davis Jr. Illuminates herself, Jonathan Vinters plays a half-retired American businessman with something that happens, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, and above all Richard Dreifuss are outstanding. This is a stupid movie, but it has many beautiful locations (in Brazil), a witty scenario, and good actors who do their thing and look like they are actually having fun and do not go through the usual existential pain of what It's just an act!
