If "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" is the father of all horror films (and the German expressionist film), this film before the Second World War is grandfather. A titular student, starving in an empty mansard, makes an agreement with the Devil-- The devil gives him a dull gold bag, in exchange for "anything in this room". The devil chooses the reflection of the disciples in the mirror. He went with the student's duplicate, who makes the crimes for which the student is a culprit. The film is violated by some restrictions arising from the technically primitive state of the film 1913; the shop shouts for chiaroschuro effects, but the movie is, as needed, almost all recorded in daylight without shadows. But the scene in which the reflection is coming out of the mirror continues to travel. More interesting for trends that are more important than for themselves, Student Prag is still worth the effort.
