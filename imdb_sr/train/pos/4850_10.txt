So, your babies are on holiday? Woman comes to visit mother-in-law? You're still at home. It's a dark and stormy night and there is no football on TV, and the dishwasher needs to be stacked? So, what are you going to do now? I will tell you! Go make old-fashioned cocoa (Fris is the best!) Take a little ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now go and choose and play Arthur Askeis two world thrillers / horror The Ghost Train, return to a comfortable couch and enjoy your nights! Ghost Train is a true British War Classics! Arthur Askei with his bang aside, Stinker Murdoch, entertains you and I doubt that actors, high octane, excitement and spill, are a spy thriller. It is around a colorful group of people who needs to stay overnight, over circumstances beyond any control, in an old railway waiting room discovered by an old train. The plot is neatly unfolding and it is true that the whole actor's merit is humorous in parts and sometimes frankly awesome! (The story was written by that old guy Godfrei from the glory of Dads Armi and it's smart) Arthur Askei is fun and very at home and runs his routines for you and starring, it also shows that it can work a little! Actors are never set, even the railroad parrot and parrots help the movie to get the necessary gravity. Oh, and when it's over, remember to set up a dishwasher!
