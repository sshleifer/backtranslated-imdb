Let me first say that, although I have watched every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider Trekker or Trekki. These are people who live in the basement of their parents and attend conventions in costumes with pointed rubber ears. I gave this film seven, rejecting fictional historical mistakes. The acting was better than the average, but the plot did not have any surprises. They tried very hard to reverse the engineering of technology, but the special effects, however, were only a great temptation. As for historical errors, if you call them so, the first captain who piloted the Enterprise was the commander in April, then Captain Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. educated them and gave them technology (that is why the main directive was created), but as I said, this is not a reason to discredit these fine series. I hope that the plots will become deeper, and then special effects can take the back seat.
