I loved Sabrina Teenage Vitch and I saw every episode. I remember sitting each evening at 6 pm and waiting for him to come to Nickelodeon, but when Sabrina left high school, the show began to go downhill. The best series must be when she was a friend with Valerie (I'm not sure who it is). So the next series (friends with Dream) was still really good, but when she left high school, it just did not work properly. It seemed that all of the main characters had gone, which meant she did not have as much old spark, but the first series where Sabrina is still in college is still relatively good and visible, however, when her aunt leaves Sabrina and leaves, in their The house is simply not right. She's no longer a teenager, so the name of the show is not right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh show it just does not look good, especially when Sabrina is almost married to someone other than Harvey. Thank God for passing the last five minutes of the last episode to take it. All in all, I still love to watch the old episodes of Sabrina Teenage Vitch, but I think the writers took him too far and they should have left Sabrina to leave high school. Because after that, the show definitely lost some of its magic
