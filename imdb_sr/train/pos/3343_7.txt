My daughter puzzles me when I mention Drew Barrimore as if she seems to be hit in the face with a tug, not to mention her Dudley Dooright beard for which Jai Leno would die. How wonderful then, when I discovered in "Fever Pitch" that I really like Mrs. Barrimore; and Jimmy Fallon; and Red Sok; and Boston! This film is probably best described as a sweet, easy comedy. To be absolutely stereotypical, girls will love the movie because of Jimmy Fallon's romantic charm and vulnerability, and boys will love all men's ties and sports mania. my wife, my teenage daughter, and I found something in the movie that she likes. It says something in itself. It's a nice way to spend an hour and a half, and it's probably a good flick.
