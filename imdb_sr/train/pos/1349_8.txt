RKO had a reputation for making American pieces of America. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Dai) was in movies since she was young. Until 1933 she was in limbo - played by Ann Dvorak as a child in the film "Three in a Game" (1932) and "Flower Girl" in both The Side of Heaven and The Kei in 1934. She remembered Anne's work from the previous film and she got this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her theatrical name. Unforgettable stories are here - Lady of Shalot in a boating boat, a "stolen" brooch, a "red hair" incident. Anne was right for the role of a cheeky, cordial orphan. She was heartbreaking in her intensity, the desire to satisfy her fiery temperament. WHOP. Heggie was wonderful because the understanding of Matthews Cuthbert and Helene Vestlee was as good as Marilla. Tom Brovn was great Gilbert Blithe. Gertrude Messinger, who was also in the movie as a little child, was as good as Diana Barry. Sara Haden has proven she can play someone other than Aunt Millie in Andy Hardy's series, she was Ms. Barry.
