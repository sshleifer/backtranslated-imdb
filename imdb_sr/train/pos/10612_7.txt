It's cheesy, it's creepy, it's rough, but that's what makes it so entertaining. There are too many top melodrama moments that are simply funny. This movie is great for ridiculing. Rent it for a good laugh. The film is about three women running news, over time before mobile phones. They go to a small town to cover the festival, but they can not get a room to spend the night. And then they meet Ernest Keller. Disgusting is in a psychic way. And they offer them to stay with him. But he does not tell them the truth about who lives there. Most of the movies are somehow boring, although finding out the truth about Ernest's family is interesting. Just watching this spot in these scenes, it's worth a look at it. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make candy. I consider film an old gem, it's hard to find it and it's worth a look.
