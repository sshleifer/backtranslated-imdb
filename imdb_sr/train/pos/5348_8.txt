Another great Arnold movie. This futuristic movie has a big action in it and is one of the best Arnie's films. Arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays the game of death. This film is an excellent and excellent Sci-Fi / action movie. I've always loved this movie and must be one of the greatest adventurous films of all time. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
