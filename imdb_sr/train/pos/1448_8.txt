Throughout the country, especially in the political environment, people with any political ambition should spend time watching this film. The film is called "City Hall" and with a little imagination, its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. He accidentally opens in New York. Here we have a story about a popular politician called Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough knowledge to lead a big city of a metropolis with very little effort. His right hand is none other than deputy mayor Kevin Kalun (John Cusack), an equally bright individual who is ambitious in relation to his mentor and both looked as if they were intended for higher offices. Everything points in that direction, as long as the police shootout does not start the investigation led by Maribeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) who finds guilt pointing to the city hall and the mayor. The six-year-old boy and the death of a policeman blamed a career criminal, whose questionable freedom leads to the apparent retrenchment of political payouts and corruption in the city, including union leaders such as Danny Aiello, starring Frank Anselmo, corrupt lawmakers like Judge Valter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia chiefs such as Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also implicated are party officials such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) who works at the New York City probation office. But this is a link between the mayor and his deputy, who is in charge of the incidental shooting. An excellent Cusack vehicle and a safe betting candidate to become a classic. ****
