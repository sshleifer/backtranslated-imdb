New York drama writer Michael Caine (like Sidney Bruhl) is 46 years old and quickly fading; While the movie opens, the latest game of the g. Caine on Broadway. TV reviewers are having fun at Caine, and he gets drunk. Transfer to Long Island Railroad land Caine in Montauk, instead of his residency in East Hampton. Finally reaching home, Caine is comforted by the tightly dressed wife Dian Cannon (like Mira), sadly with a patient heart patient. There, Caine and Mrs. Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap" written by young Christopher Reeve (Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believes that Mr. Riv "Deathtrap" is a hit that is needed to revive Caine's career. The trap is set for the wicked ridiculous who will do-it. " In the direction of Sidney Lumet, Broadway's Long Broadway hit Longevity is not far from its origin. Actors are pleasing and knitting stories are still amazing. One thing that did not work (for me) was to finish the curtain call; she must have played better on the stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again; the performances are dead - but, looking back, the greetings Reeve gives Caine at the East Hampton railway station should be simplified to smile "Hello". The location is not exactly East Hampton, but windmill and pond look alike. And, a very desperate love scene is shockingly lukewarm. But the performance was so good, "even the gifted director could not destroy it." And, Mr. Lumet did not disappoint.
