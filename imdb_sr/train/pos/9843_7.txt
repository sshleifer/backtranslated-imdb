* Can contain spoilers * * Can contain spoilers * In the age of Shrek (film) and Picard (studio), this is a much more traditional animation film. He composed some characters that are usually not seen together (we do not mention, we are trying to save a human child and bring it back to your father). They start as enemies and end up as the best friend. If this sounds like a Disney movie, then it's (just through the 20th Century Fox). The movie trailer was one of the best I've seen for years, but the film does not live up to the expectations set by the trailer. The problem lies in the fact that filmmakers have not decided who the target audience of the film is. Yes, there are some jokes in a movie that adults only understand, but the film is mainly directed at children. Parents will enjoy the fact that in 90 minutes. Their children's attention is focused on something else. The background is great and the voice is good, but it is nothing but a good movie. Children will love this movie, adults will just like it.
