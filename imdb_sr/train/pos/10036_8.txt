The Titanic is a long, but well-made, tragic adventure love story that takes place during an unhurried journey on an intolerable boat. Screenwriter / director James Cameron did a great job of filming this film about a fictional love story between two very different nations and combined with the actual Titanic event that sank after he hit the iceberg on April 15, 1912, who died in thousands of lives in an icy the waters of the North Atlantic. The two leading roles in the film are great in their roles, including Leonard DiCapria and Kate Winslet. They make a good pair on the screen. DiCpario and Winslet also had a true chemistry that created a romance that could ultimately pass between them, which is much more convincing. They both showed a real talent when it came out and both of them continued to show exactly this in their latest films. The rest of the support, including Billi Zanea, Kathi Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hide and Bill Pakton in a minor role, are as impressive as their characters who help them to come to life in this movie. A lovely story, action, uncertainty and special effects are magnificent, especially during this time. The horror of the situation in which the characters felt so real, because it really happened, it seemed that you want most of them to survive this life and mortal situation. The pacing was sometimes a bit slow and it was a long time, but the rest of the movie was compensated for several drawbacks. Titanic is a great movie that will surely make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely adds to the film making you regrettable for all the lost lives when Titanic entered the Atlantic after hitting the iceberg. All in all, Titanic is a tragic story about two people who fall in love with an unfortunate ship that has revived the exceptional performances of actors, especially DiCaprio and Winslet who certainly make this movie worth watching time.
