It's a cooking competition, American-made. There will be no Japanese version. The fair is excellent. I was a little worried about cooking, but this show is just fun to watch ... From the intensity of the cookware made by the chef to the stupid president. A really good way to spend some time watching TV. You could criticize the show because they are guests like Marc Ecko as a judge ... But ... Meh. It's just fun to watch, and in general the winner deserves a prize. Oh i'mah and I'm outraged John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... Ala kiln!
