TRENING MAN, together with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite Schwarzenegger movie. No, this is not 2001, but it was not intended to be. Both the acting and the script are not even at the level of other Arnie's films such as PREDATOR or TERMINATOR. But I claim that the IDEA behind this movie is one of the best ever for the big screen. The sponsorship show of a state where criminals have been convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (racers have nothing to do) to meet lust for sports and blood. Final Award for the Winner Runner: Freedom. Or, as the rules claim. For a film with such super-fatal fatalities and bulky liners, there's really a lot to say. Someone else pointed out all the comments about the culture / government presented in this film, so I will not go into it here. Just say that if you can look beyond the apparently stupid feeling of the movie, you will enjoy it (especially if you are a great fan of SF with a lot of imagination). As I said, this is not an attempt to be a serious artistic film, but it is surprisingly accentuated for filming the 80s film. The premise is borrowed from Richard Bachman's short novel (aka Stephen King), but is quite different from the original material, especially to the end. (The book ends quite nihilistic, it's not necessary to say that this film is not.) I enjoyed both of them, but I like the film more. My favorite line: "I suppose it is caused by steroids."
