This is such a great movie called "Call Me Anna" because it shows how a person suffered so long without knowing what she was. In order for Patti Duke to go into the public eye and tell her story, she is inspired by those who suffer from this illness. I have a lot of respect for her as a person. The only thing I do not like is that I can not record it on a tape, I tried to look it up, but without success. Anyone know how to get it?
