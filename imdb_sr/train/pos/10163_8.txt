This was a good story ... it had a nice pace and all the characters developed cool. I watched the entire bunch of films in the last two weeks and this had to be the best. I've seen it in two weeks. The character of Jason Bigga was still the best. Although small, he was smartly made from the very beginning. /> This is perhaps a romantic comedy and I do not like the majority, but writing, directing, performance, sound, design in the overall capacity was really pretty cool. This film has achieved a high level of all the movies I've seen lately - the rest was a big budget or better posted. Good writing job.
