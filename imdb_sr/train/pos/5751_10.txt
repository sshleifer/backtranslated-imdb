What can I say about this movie? I've seen him many times since the first time I was around 6. I've seen the English version and it's done very well. It's a great movie for all ages, but it's more focused on children. I love childish humor and I appreciate it. If you have not seen him, try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
