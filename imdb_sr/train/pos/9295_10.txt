It was hard for me to believe in all the negative comments about this film. I laughed through the whole picture, as did my entire family. The movie was clearly defined as an old gangster comedy - the players were hysterical - I bet they had a good old time when they made it. Of course, Goldblum and Dreifuss were great - and how about these sisters Everley, each of the two Falco, and the divine music. Rob Reiner made a great limousine driver and Gabriel Birne was a funny neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reinolds, the character of Sleepy Joe and the whole references to the morgues and the grave. Paul Anka was his usual party, with the added attraction of a frightful run after Birne decided to make a duo of his "Mi Vai" welcome home for Vick performance. was a comical honor to Frank Sinatra and his friends; Dreifuss imitated him well. I also think that no one, at any age, would even think of mimicking the actions that took place in this movie - it's a joke - not a frightening gangsta movie. Cars and clothes were impressive, as well as decorative, "Vic's Place." and voice broadcasts. I would recommend a video for evening entertainment.
