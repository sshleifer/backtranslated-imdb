Yesterday I was my Spanish-Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is again heading towards political confrontation. That's why this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish high schools. It's a huge lesson in the hidden crime of fascism. An American pilot who joined the Spanish Civil War is voting for a democratically elected republican government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well displayed in one of the most intriguing scenes Uribe has ever made. The colors are magnificent. The cruelty of the war (would anyone be able to tell me the difference between any war and civil war?) It is used as a scenario of hope when two little ones express their feelings and protect each other. Cowards who begin abuse the power even of innocent children are again active. A film like 'El viaje de Carol' / 'Carol's Trip' is about one of so many sad stories from the 20th century. It's a better lesson in the history than any book. Again a big deal from the peninsula Iberica!
