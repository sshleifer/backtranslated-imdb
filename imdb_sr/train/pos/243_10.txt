Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is excellent, all technical (especially cinema) are sharp, and the script is smart. He is brave as a legendary forger and is well supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All action sequences are at a point. The movie is all the way. One of my favorite films of the late Legend of Heath Ledger, which was the culmination of every film in which he acted. And he makes no mistake.
