By the end of the first hour, my jaw was comfortably placed between my legs. The film never, and I never think, give up on the action. It can be a mild action, but it's an action. Once again, every member of the actor fits perfectly. Explosions were realistic, hunting scenes were feasible, and the battles were incredible. Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne. All I have to say is that every Bourne's movie gets better and it's no exception. Action, bet, plot. I will never know how to do it. I welcome the man who wrote the screen for each of these movies. Because if he did not do such a good job with the first movie, we would not have anyone to talk about. if it's still where you live, but if not December 11, Bourne is back home!
