As a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, and therefore a large number of these films, I rarely seem to be completely unique. As far as that is concerned, it is rare that I have breathed a breath through laughter in several scenes. The love story is a bit thin on the field, but I would say that this is probably the best, because this romantic comedy firmly puts emphasis on "comedy", and in any case it is just a little more than the limits of credibility I like the majority of the romes. Four scientists have provided some of the funniest moments not only in this movie, but in any movie I've watched for a long time. I hesitated for the shortest moments before I finally selected "10" above "9" as a rating, because I believe that too many people use it without difference, and therefore the maximum rating loses part of its influence. I'm also a great fan of Meg Rian, who is helping, but this is one of the few films I've seen in which I would say it is totally overshadowed. She and Tim Robbins are acting as leaders, but for me they play another violin in the antiquities of disorderly intellectuals. A real movie that laughs.
