This will get reviews all over the map because it does not fit into any mold. It's a horror, but not a splatterfest. It's equally part of Suspense, as well as Horror - but without the usual Hollywood scream and the edge of the camera. Feeling the film is free and lean, without any special effects, because I think you should listen and watch face faces. He graduated from the Buffy universe. It's red herring. He's performing here. 'Camp' is a misinterpretation of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau gives solid performance - so she must believe that the script has something to say. We all know which are the speeches in which actors obviously no longer worry and wait for the director to shoot "Cut" and get his wages. This is not the case here. Forgive that the bodies begin to fall off with almost mondo-ridiculous regularity. I think that the intention was not witty, but I keep you out of balance. Think about it less about the movie about horror and about the movie about horror on the stage - about this white-headed house. Then you can see that this is actually paranoia, fear, and spiral madness in the middle of an isolated place, the United States. And it's weird. Time Travel, Mind Control, secret experiments and Nazis who may not be dead. . .iet. I say to rent it and try if you're in a mood for something a little cerebral. This would be a good choice for Saturday night.
