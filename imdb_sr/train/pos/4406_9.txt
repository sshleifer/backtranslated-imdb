It's strange that this movie never came on the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video. My expectations were high, but they were not disappointed. As always with Ang Lee, there's a fantastic acting, an intelligent and exciting plot that hits you to the finish and top-of-the-line shooting. With Unforgiven, this is easily one of the two best western 90s. disappointed, everyone else who appreciates the above features will have a fantastic time to watch it. 9 of 10
