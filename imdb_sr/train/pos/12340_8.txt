Many can complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical performances - Farrell looks good in his title role, but his reading lines, honestly, stink. This also suffers from the fact that this is attributed to the first film using the background screening. The sets look counterfeit. However, there are two great advantages in this show: although the reading of the dialogue is shaking, visual performance is perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, is a little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell overturned the programmer EAST OF BORNEO on his recordings: he recognized Melford's stylistic visual direction of the original. Her great beauty and simple (though stagnant) performances help to repair some damage to the earth's parts of this film. However, one of the Borzaga's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the celestial parts that make this great, from the arrival of the heavenly train to traveling to the 'hot spot'. H.B. Varner's performance is, as always, perfect. So we have here the wrong but very interesting version here. I think the 1934 version of Langu is better, as well as the heavenly scenes in the version of Henri King CAROUSEL, a glued music remake. But I still enjoyed this version and I think it should give her a chance.
