Henry Fonda brilliantly grasped what we thought for a long time that Abraham Lincoln was. It's crazy. Through Fond's performance, we stated that (on the surface) we believe that Abraham Lincoln was a farmer. But, through confrontation with the lynching mafia and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that under the external poses, a brilliant man knows very well what is happening around him and how to influence people around him. In this film Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good understanding of how to present humor. This is his aspect that has been lost over the years. When he talks stories and jokes, he has a perfect moment. There is a sequence in the trial that made me very laughable. He shows this present again in Lady Eve 1940. The end of John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fond which goes up the hills and in the distance is a huge storm of symbolism of civil war. He goes into history. The film is a fiction, but the insight into Lincoln is huge. It's definitely worth seeing again.
