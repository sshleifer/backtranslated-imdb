Before movies such as the 'Texas Motorcycle Massacre', 'Suspiria' and 'Halloween' have forever changed their horror horizons, the genre had more gothic and less violent era. Films such as the Hammer Horror series and 'Rosemari's Babys' were what frightened and thrilled audiences during the 1960s and early 70s. I can not tell you how many times I rented this movie in my childhood, but I did it because there was something about it. I did not want to limit myself to slasher and zombies movies of the 70's and 80's and movies like this production from the famous, but unfortunately the long-past Amicus movie company, were a good start. Great, dreadful music. Powerful performances from the stars. Brilliant cinema. A lot of good old excitations and winters, especially in the first and last vignettes. Some moments and pictures. It starts slowly, but instead of tempo. The house is an awesome, oppressive apartment. Great production design and decoration, which gives the film a real old Gothic sense of horror. It is more dependent on mood and without blood, and not from above and from nudity due to excitement. Cons: Some problems in pacing in the first half. In addition to the "Plaque", the rest of the story is felt to have been done earlier. Cliches galore. The second story, "Wakworks", has fine acting and moments, but is the weakest of four in terms of fear and uncertainty. Low budget is sometimes displayed. Final Thoughts: After I first saw this movie after many years, I see why I rent it so often. It's not a masterpiece in any way, but it's a good example of when horror films are made with style and class. Beware of this with the lights off. My Rating: 3.5 / 5
