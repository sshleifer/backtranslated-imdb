As the story in my family goes, my father, Milton Raskin, played the piano for the Dorsei band. After Sinatra joined the band, my dad trained with him for hours. Then, at a certain point, my dad told Sinatra that he was actually good to be tied to such a small band (band), and that he should be alone. Until that time, Sinatra had enough points "under the belt" to do just that! Dorsey never forgave my dad, and the rest is, as they say, history. I have some images and records in this regard, and also Berkeley Universites in California. I've seen almost every Sinatra movie more than I would like to say, and his films are never old. . . Thank you, Frank
