Since he was just a kid when this show was originally broadcast, I recently picked up a DVD set and want to record more episodes. This show was the 70th version of the popular 90s television series "Ks-Files" - but with a slightly more comical approach. But do not misunderstand me, some of these episodes have full topics about horrors, many of which have some pretty big mistakes (the imagination left - of course, it was a television in the early seventies). Some plots are a bit silly and acting, but this is the charm and appeal of this series. Whether you love mysterious drama of crime, comedy or sci-fi / horror themes, this series has all merged. Each episode lasted about 50 minutes (1 hour with advertisements) and the 50 minutes quickly passes by always leaving me more. A great classic show that's underestimated in my book!
