Obviously, there were not many people who watched this movie, as nobody posted comments anymore. This is not a movie to be missed. After all, he won the George Peabody Award and the Humanitas Award. Paul Vinfield should have won the prize for his excellent performance in this film. Eugene Logan, co-writer of this film, made for a TV film, was also part of another film about humanity, or loss, as a technical adviser to the movie Truman Capote, Glass House. This film is now available on DVD. If someone is interested, I will post another letter in which he writes that Eugene Logan came to be a technical advisor to the film of such an incredible person as Truman Kapote. Thank you for reading this and I hope you find a way to look at these two films.
