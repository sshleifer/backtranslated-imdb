Here is the evidence why Mary Pickford was the "American Soul". In this very complex drama, Mary plays a young daughter of a squatter who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the "hill solos". Scenes that steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply beautiful. She is even ready to bathe. The fact that Mari could withdraw this role at the age of 30 is simply incredible and partly due to her small growth (5 '). She does it with courage that has not been seen in many heroines of that time. Tess visits and is not ashamed to fight anyone. Why she agrees to help her daughter-in-law is outside of me, but she sacrifices her happiness to keep her deep secret. Picford's big plans are wonderful. Danish born Jean Hersholt is simply wonderful as a villain. The scene in which he handles a small baby is enough to throw vegetables (or anything else) onto the film screen. If Forrest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) wore a beard, he would fit the model used in those first world wars that recruited Uncle Sam's posters? He wants you! Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow at first, it's worth investing in your time to see a piece or a pure 'American'. The film highlights the choices that are available to us, and all this makes somebody else happy and how to be a true Christian. Recommended.
