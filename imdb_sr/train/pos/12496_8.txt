For years we have watched every horror film that comes out of boring Hollywood updates like Saw 2, to horrible indie editions that are totally incomparable ... suffer from all the bad films in the hope of finding little gems like "Dark" Remains. < br /> We succeeded in capturing the screening of this film at Shriekfest 2005. The audience admired him and I believe he eventually won the Best Film Award. <BR> <BR> Although they may not have a budget or a star in studio films, she has a serious blow to the furious atmosphere and the category of fear. The acting and cinema The films are top-notch, but this is the direction that makes this movie worthwhile. The story and characters are developing in the right rhythm to provide some fantastic fears. The editing and visual fk are also top-notch and while many horror movies do not manage to use music to their advantage, the result for "Dark Remains" only contributes to his horror. I know that the film was shown at the crowd of the festival, but nobody was close to me, so I can hardly wait I hear it will finally come out on DVD. Believe me, even if you are tormented by the current state of the horror films, try this ... you will not regret it!
