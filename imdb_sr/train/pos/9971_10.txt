This film was great, I thought the original was quiet central. This one got all the ingredients, the 1970's, the 4-speed Hemi Challenger, which really shows that Mother Mopar knew how to make the best muscle cars! I was in a rajslarov paradise every time Kovalsky planted that big Hemi block, and he certainly did it a lot :)
