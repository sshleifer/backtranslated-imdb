UC 0079, One-year war is nearing its end. Neutral colony Side 6 was the target of Ciclopa, a Zeon workgroup. Their goal is a new Gundam built exclusively for Nevtipes (supposedly built for Amuro Rai from the original Gundam Saga) inside. When the little boy Al Izuruha, who is a fan of Zeon MS, came to Zakua after the outbreak of the battle in the colony, he is acquainted with MS pilot Benard "Bernie" Viseman. The two become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie acts as the father of Al (whose real father always works) and seems to be taken with the pilot of the Federation Christine McKenzie, but in the end they have to meet ... in the battle. Al soon learns that war is not a children's game, and Bernie must decide to make the final sacrifice to complete his mission. For just 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a well-performed show. Mobile suits are extremely well-designed, and animation may look obsolete, but it really shows emotions in characters. If you like 0083, then check this, or if you are new to Gundam, this is a good start to start. If you look at the play for the development of drama and character, this is it for you, it focuses more on this battle of the mobile suit. I would rate him more like a drama than an action. Mobile Clothing Gundam 0080, War in the pocket. Sometimes you have to lose to win.
