There are always people in the Old West who live with breath of violence and breath-holding women. The Mayors hired a famous city guard named Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) to free the deserts (Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, among others), Baronland's hooligans. There he met the smith (Emile Meier), his daughter (Karen Sharpe), her boyfriend (John Lupton), marshal (Henri Hull) and the owner of the salon (Ted De Corsia). Clint as a legal representative was appointed a deputy who brings peace and puts some cartels in the statement of the following: Warning, carrying weapons or other weapons in the city is forbidden. Check all hardware in the Marshal office. Clint finds her ex girlfriend, local lady (Jan Sterling) in charge of the girls in the salon (among them Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lavrence). But the city council was afraid of the crude methods that Clint did. In the end, a royal landowner appeared and tried to kill Tollinger with his own hands. This is a terrific exciting story about a sheriff for a hiremaker who only had one more murder. It begins as a slowed western, but it keeps us coming to surprise us with dark characters and a tough plot. The story is almost gloomy, and the Pacifier comes to the city just in time to take care of its population, but later events get worse. The most interesting are burning in the Saloon and climatic calculation at the end. The phenomenal and great role of Robert Mitchum as an avenger of angel and bitter revolver, he is a whole performance. Vivid and live music score Alek North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), Atmospheric cinema in black and white technique by Lee Garmesa. The film was astoundingly accomplished by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, Three in Attic), which turned out to be a good western as "a call to the gunman and" Zane Grey "episodes. Visible results for this unusual western.
