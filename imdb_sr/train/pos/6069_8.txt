....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. The man was quite a wide range and scream. I like to watch how he interacts with Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or anyone - he obviously had a ball and I think he made it easy for his guests - as long as they know before they were not disciplined, 19 some kind of production. Relax and be relaxed, clearly the name of the game. Reminds me of guys like Milton Berle, Benni Hill, maybe Jerry Levis. Excellent timing, ancient gadgets that keep the audience in the seams for decades, enjoying what it does. His sad little clown who played was also good - but in touch. Personally I think it's great, since he just bought two DVD sets of his shows from '61. for me it is in a kind way. I remember seeing him on TV at the end of the run when the series ended in 1971 or so. Check this out if you are fan or curious. It was a mess.
