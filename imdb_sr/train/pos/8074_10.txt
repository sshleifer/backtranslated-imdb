Gipo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as everyone else on Earth. Living in the 1920s, Ireland, Gipo and his fellow Irishmen are part of an underground rebellion against oppressed Britons. A certain rebel, whom the English have sought for murder, is secretly returning to the city. He thinks he can trust his friend Gipo, but the Â£ 20 prize turns out to be too tempting. Gippo killed his friend and sank into a hole of despair and drunkenness. In the meantime, other Irish rebels are seeking information. Immediately, Gipo, with money that picks up a hole in his pocket, is their main suspect, but they, who are his friends, do not want to believe. Informer's story is simple in its complication, but complex in its moral and emotional issues. It's just one of John Ford's emotional films. What Gippo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand his sad character, and there are many sympathies for him. The scenario is also very tense. This is a kind of uncertainty in which we are pretty sure we know how it will end, so we have to squeeze our teeth and deal with it. The acting is extraordinary. Victor McLaglen, who played in many of Ford's films, probably gave his best performance here (and won Oscars for him). Every other artist in the film deserves his honor. In addition to the incredible scenario and acting, Informer is one of John Ford's most challenging films. I love the darker side of Ford. In my mood, as in my subjects, Informer reminds me of two of my other Ford's favorite films, The Long Voiage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); is also somewhat similar to the grape clout (1940) in these aspects. 10/10.
