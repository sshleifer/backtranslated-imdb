This is a great movie for all generations of X'sers. What a different world America compared to 1972 with our psychotic 21st century. You can see how America went from 1972 watching this movie. I discovered that clothes and car styles give me good memories of a much better country than now. Just think ... then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations. There were no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, avian flu, highway sniper, etc. Etc. The Vietnam War was over. It will still be 7 years before Star Wars arrives. The personal computer and the Internet will continue to be 29 years old. When this movie first came out, the producers had to make the film themselves, because no other film company wanted it. This was the start of a tour of smaller Protestant churches across the country displayed on film projectors (These were given before the VCRS). A pastor of a church who would be interested in showing the thief in the village to his congregation, would get a copy of the film. Then I would set the evening to show him in the church meeting room or in the lunch room. Members of the community would invite "unprepared" friends and family members and this would be a social event in the week. If you can go through the limited production value of the movie and just watch it for the nostalgic value, I think you will enjoy the movie more. Of course I speak as a gene. If I had a weather machine, I would return to 1972 and I'm sorry for the septic tank of the 21st century we now have.
