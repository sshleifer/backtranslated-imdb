This is probably Karisma at its best, except Zubeida. Nana Patekar is also doing her best, even without attempts. The story is sometimes very good, but it eventually seems to retreat, especially when Shahrukh appears in the picture. What really led me to this was the performances, the dialogue, and the story, for what it was. It could be better focused and edited. The support case was even great, including Karim's mother-in-law, although she had only one great moment, it was great to look at her. I did not really like their view of the Canadian family, but once they arrive in India, he is as real as he gets.
