"Lady of Shanghai" is known as one of the most problematic Hollywood productions. Manufacturers took away the original Vellesa cut and cut it into strips. This made it even more difficult to follow the already blurred story of a mystery. They set up a good number of his dialogue due to the density of Irish accent, and dubbing is too obvious and bad. Worst of all, Velles and his leading lady Rita Haivorth on the screen and their real life are decaying in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry comes to the screen. the fantastic direction of Orson Welles. It makes the movie incredibly modern and atmospheric - every scene looks like it breathes its back on the screen. Also, characters and scenes are so bizarre that it borders with dreams and surreal. This feeling of strangeness raises the scenes that are often found in these films, such as court sequences in the middle. I usually think courtroom courtrooms are bored, but Velles's direction and unusual touch make them as fascinating as anything else. The ending of the carnival almost reminds of David Linch. The acting here is also very good. Despite their unsuccessful relationship, Velles and Haivorth give decent performance - but their interactions are just a bit lacking. All the rest are wonderful and wonderful to watch, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. The "Lady of Shanghai" obviously has its problems, but it's worth watching just to see one of the film's masters at its best. (8/10)
