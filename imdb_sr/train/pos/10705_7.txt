The trailer for this movie is not a movie rule. And while the film did not know what it really wanted to get, the first half of the film was a bright, romantic comedy, and another more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought it was. This film was more a film about the date, but the trailer turned into a thriller that never turned out. Kidman, as one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this film proved to be a light, sensitive, though somewhat strange movie that deserves better. Three of four stars. 9/5/02.
