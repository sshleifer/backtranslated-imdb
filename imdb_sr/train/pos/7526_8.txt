Canadian director Mari Harron is a cultural father whose previous films uncovered an artistic surplus of the sixties and hollow eight years. With "The Notorious Bettie Page" she shows her steadfast eye on America in the fifties, an age concealed by the moral justice of Joe McCarthy, while experiencing the beginnings of sexual awakening that will result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner are obviously not interested in the standard biography of sex symbols. This is a film about the underground icon of a era and how her pure unharmed sexuality has revealed both grave instincts and impure thoughts about the culture untouched by the beauty of the naked body. If the details of Beth's life were only about what the film was concerned about, why then it ended before its most tragic period. Clearly, Harron is more interested in American attitudes towards sex images then and now. Together with the fearless performance of Gretchen Mol and the stunning atmospheric cinematography of V.Motta Hupfel III, she attains this goal beautifully, holding the mirror in the past, making the audience by studying her own "enlightened" paragraphs 21, called pornography. As America is struggling under new conservatism, this film is needed more than ever.
