I have not seen a movie yet, but I can not wait to see it! It looks very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I've ever seen: the questions she asked me really stopped me and made me think, the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for "fighting inside" ... thank god that somebody hitting another angle in boxing . This movie looks so fresh and smart. And the actor is really handsome. I especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the Rocka movies, really smart. I thought that the topic chosen - overcoming anxiety and childhood trauma - timeless, and God knows that many people need it. Bring.
