*** Spoilers * My dad shot this movie for me when I was 3. For 5 years I watched him over 400 times. I just looked at him and watched him. And I'm still working today! He has a cruel story, a mother of lamb kills a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf, like him. After years of training, the lamb turns into a really real evil. He and the wolf travel to his old stable, but he can not kill the lambs, no matter how much he wants. In the end he kills the wolf, but his former friends no longer see themselves as lambs, but can not return to their previous lifestyle. The art is beautiful, the songs are .. Well, well, and acting is better than some things today. All in all, you just have * to see this movie, it's a great masterpiece. Although it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
