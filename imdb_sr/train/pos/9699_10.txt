Something about "Paulie" touched my heart while few movies. It's a funny, fun, but emotional movie. I'm late and I'm becoming a fan of this movie. I did not see "Paulie" until May 2004, and since then I ordered Videscreen DVD from the seller on the eBai. My son asked me how the bird knows so many phrases. It's probably my favorite part of the movie when Paulie is at Gena Rovlands (Ivi), then Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Toni Shalhoub (Misha) plays a great role as a good hearted man. Use it until the end of the movie. You can not make a mistake if you rent or buy this movie !!
