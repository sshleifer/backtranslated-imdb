A unique film about a confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who intertwines with sharp men. Joe Mantegna gives Oscar-caliber performance as the most exciting in the group. Absolutely enchanting for the first hour, because Mantegna shows Crouse's "ropes" of her congratulations. The line of the story is a little later revealed, but it still represents a unique display of the innocent in the dark world. It's definitely worth a try.
