Karen goes to a Japanese house as a replacement for sister Emma, ​​a foreign woman who sleeps and wakes up at night. Karen goes up after hearing a noise when she finds a scary spirit. She will learn the secrets of the house. It's very terrible! Scenes are shocking and scary! The characters are good. The settings are creepy. I love the whole plot! The end was shocking! I paused in the place where the boy so loudly muttered the man who found the sister on the floor, and I was shocked. This is the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend this to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
