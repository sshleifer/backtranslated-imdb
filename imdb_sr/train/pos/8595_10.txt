I can admit that the script is not very good, and that there are some slow parts, but all the critics of this film should learn how to have fun. First, the performances are great (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria.) Michael Douglas proves that he still has it, and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as a cheater, his wife. incredible talent in the path, and secondly, this film is the most wonderful thing I've had in Theodore for years, its simple and simple, if you want to go to the movies, and you have a lot of fun seeing, Sentinel.
