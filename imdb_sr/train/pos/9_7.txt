The romantic drama of the working class of director Martin Ritta is incredible as they arrive, but there are moments of enjoyment mainly due to charisma stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both great). She is a widow who can not move on, he is illiterate, and the inventor of the closet - you can probably guess the rest. The adaptation of Pat Barker's "Union Street" novel (better title!) Is so relaxed that it borders with mild, and editing the movie is messy, but it's still pleasant; pink fantasy blue collar. There are no serious problems (even the illiteracy angle is just a tool for the love story that follows) and there is no real fireworks, although the characters are intentionally slightly colorless, and the traces are recorded to an interesting degree. The final is a clean cereal - and the cunts will find it hard to swallow - although these two characters deserve a happy ending and the image would not be satisfactory in any other way. *** from the ****
