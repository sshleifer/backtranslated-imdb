This is one of the funniest series ever! I laughed as my sides split and turned to the floor. If only someone would let in America. Region 0 or 1 - Ne-PAL, please. I know it's published in the UK, but it's also Region 2 and PAL! Let's make this series fair. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved Tracie Bennett's stupid role in this. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was treasure! Free this show in America! or Show again at PBS stations. I must laugh again and laugh! Please, give it up! Please! Thanks for reading.
