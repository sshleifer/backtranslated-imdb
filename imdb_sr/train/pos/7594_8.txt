I do not know the stars, or modern Chinese teenage music - but I know a completely fun movie when I see it. Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values ​​- it plays for laughter, for love, and it's a great mix of Kung Fu and basketball. Everyone looks as if they were very entertained by doing so - the production values ​​are great - and modern China looks brighter than Los Angeles here. The plot of an abandoned orphan who grows up in kung fu school just to be thrown out and then reveals the superstar as a basketball game (and love and more etc.) is super - this is fresh, fun and immensely fun. With great action and good dialogue this is easy to enjoy - for all ages - and for our money was one of the best family movies we've seen for a long time. Please to ignore negative reviews and give Dunk a chance - we were really pleased that we did it - DOBAR sports film.
