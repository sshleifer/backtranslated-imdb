Andi Goldsvorthi is a Taoist master of the first order, expressing the Way through her exalted effeminate art. Indeed, time and changes are what his work is basically about. I bought his first book a few years ago and my family has admired many times. So it was a pleasure to personally meet an artist through this film; he is as patient and gentle as you would expect, and he has some wonderful things to say about the natural world, of which he is most profoundly expressed in his occasional impossibility. to say words in general. He is like most children playing in the open air alone (if they do more), creating things from sticks and sand, mud and snow before they grow out. Mr. Goldsworthy was given the gift and mission to expand such a game to create deeper visions of nature and opened us often tired eyes in brilliant new ways. And always with the utmost respect, gratitude and humor of the wandering and strange monk.
