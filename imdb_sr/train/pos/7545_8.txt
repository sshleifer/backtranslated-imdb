I really liked it, even though I read the reviews it was quite disturbing to me. But as a fan of anime art, I can fully understand this perfect artistic work, although some of it was against my cultures and I believe it. But hey, it's the world of art. . !! the beginning of the film is very strong, weird and confused. It's hard to understand the content that makes me respectful of the one who did it. Only someone who is extremely open can do such a bold movie .. it's absolutely not for kids .. although the characters are sweet and beautiful, but they go through some disturbing adventures that can not be deleted (sorry if the spelling is wrong) than those you remember ..
