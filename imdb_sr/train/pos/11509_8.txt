It's a pity that this spin-off series inspired by the top-of-the-line images "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler" lasted only one season and twenty episodes, because at best this program often offered a winning and very entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor (lively verbal sparring matches Karl Kolchak with a permanent boring and longtime editor, Tony Vincenz, were always a treat for watching and listening), wise writing, wonderful supernatural threats (I have to love the unusual and original creatures) in "The Spanish Moss Murders "," The Sentry "and" Horror in the Heights ", plus you can not make a mistake with such attempts as" don'true fright favorites like zombies, vampires, insects and witches), colorful characters, lively acting with a host of cool guest stars (legendary biker The flick icon Villiam Smith got a rare chance to catch up with a heroic trail in The Energi Eater, while other episodes featured great actors like Keenan Vinn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden and Villiam Daniels in juicy roles ), effective moments of true uncertainty (especially in the sewer and the best of all, one and only Darren McGavin is in top form as a brave, aggressive and exciting but essentially decent, brave and honest journalist from Chicago, Illinois, Carl Kolchak. Kolchak was the main hero of the 70s of the last century. tricky and smart guy with a strong nose for a delicious spoon and an unhappy sense of entering all kinds of troubles. Moreover, occasionally unconcerned Kolchak was nothing but a superman; he usually stumbled or stumbled as he escaped from a deadly threat, but he had some inner strength and courage that enabled him to save human life again and again from all kinds of deadly enemies. The colch was surrounded by a handful of fun secondary characters: Simon Oakland was as perfect as Carlov's chronic boss, Toni Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage, as sprayed by Ron Updike made an ideal comic strip, Ruth McDevitt was as beautiful as cute Miss Emili Covles and Carol Ann Susi It was also fun as the eager beaver rookie Monikue Marmelstein (who, unfortunately, disappeared after appearing in only three episodes). However, the show has suffered from vague make-up and special effects (the "Verevolf titular lyantrop" unfortunately reminds you of Yorkshire Terrier!), And these other episodes boasted a few funny nonsense (the headless motorcyclist in "Chopper", Cathy Lee Crosby like Helen of Troy in The Killer of the Young), but even second-hand shows were bought out by the trademark of a program that is maliciously cunningly sardonic and McGavin's limitless vitality and an attractively bumping presence.
