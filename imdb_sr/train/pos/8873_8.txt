This film came and went to the theater. Because of the nature of this, you can see why it is not well received. It was unjustly declared because the subject is more than a movie itself. More learning was not spectacular, but it was a good movie that tried to talk about the fear of a subject in America: racism. Plot / story: More learning is mainly focused on Malik (played by Omar Epps), a naive star that has to deal with not being fast enough, and a rigorous professor (played by Laurence Fishburne). He is getting acquainted with Fudge (Ice Cube), as well as with a beautiful lady named Deja (Tira Banks). In the end, they eventually had to deal with some skinheads in the campus. Remi (a play by Michael Rapaport) is a confused kid who eventually fuses with some local skinheads in the campus. Once they impose their views on him, he becomes as racist as they are. Opinion: More learning is not without disadvantage: character development is scarce, fine performances by Omar Epps, Tira Banks and a skinhead leader (whose name I have forgotten), Busta Rhimes does not fit into this film at all. Plus, women who became homosexuals after maltreating them were clich√©s "before this film, so you know that this part of the movie did not like me with Kristi Swanson. In addition, this film was not bad. Laurence Fishburne was as good as Phipps professor (although I could without accent), Fudge was the best performance of Ice Cube and Michael Rapaport was as good as confused Remy. All in all, it was one of John Singleton's best films and one of the reasons I frown on the garbage he now puts out. Cinema needs more movies such as Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American Histories X and less movies like Babi Boi, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very meaningless remake of Shaft.
