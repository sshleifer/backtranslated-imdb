I saw a movie in Vienna a few years ago, where the audience loved it. I liked it too, the performance of Summer Phoenix is ​​still haunting me, so I decided to write a comment. The story takes place in London around 1900, where the Jewish girl decides to become an actress. She desperately tries to do it, but this is not before a person is treated badly to understand the scene, has talent, and connects with the audience and appears as a stronger human being. There were certain criticisms that her performance was broken, she was accused of being annoying, unable to bring life to her character. I think that's her strong point, that's exactly what Esther Kah should be, and Phoenix makes a bold decision to make Esther a pretty boring girlfriend. So, its transformation is ultimately more powerful than it would otherwise be. Cinema is great, London's paintings at the end of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how it was an unpleasant life then. The only mistake in my opinion is the length of the film, you lose touch with the characters, after all, just about finding an actor in yourself, so there are no dramatic action in the movie. It's Phoenix's credit not to lose interest in the movie after the first hour.
