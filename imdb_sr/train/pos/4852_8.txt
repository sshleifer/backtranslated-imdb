Now this is one of the biggest awards, one of the role of Jack Hulbert in 1931, divided into two parts for the radio band Band Vaggon Askei & Murdoch. He can boast a great acting team, who plays the game for everything that's worth, especially Askei. The histrionics was provided by Linden Travers, melodramatic Herbert Lomass and pragmatist Richard Murdoch. spectral carriers, hairy sausages and Arthur try to entertain them all. His conversation with everyone falls between the lateral separation and the terrible dull. When the formula works, it is very good, but sometimes it becomes very fictitious and forcibly make the film more obsolete than it is. But those damn bastards of the fifth columnist - thank you to every God that the British today have nothing! In the end, a nice harmless movie, welcome back to the TV screen as an old friend, but if you were expecting to be trembling from your trees, you'll probably be very disappointed!
