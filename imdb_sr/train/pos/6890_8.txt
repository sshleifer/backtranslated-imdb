This was one of the highlights of the semi-oblivion of the second season of the ST: LPG, before they 'grown up' or turned into their third season and beyond. This was not just a showcase for those returning, such as Bill Campbell and Terry Hatcher, but was a continuation of Data's quest for his "humanity", this time through the concept of comedy. Still, one of my favorite episodes. Aside from this, I am still disappointed that there is no merit for an actress whose character the Okon was supposed to break through (after Charlie Hatcher's character) before he severely interrupted Lt Vorf. I remember watching this episode for the first time in my comic book friends in the day and we all thought she would be the perfect Jean Grey / Marvel girlfriend. It would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is ...
