I saw this film for the first time in the 1980s and now in 2006 this film is still one of the best movies I've ever seen! I would recommend anyone to watch this movie. You will not be sorry. She's acting well, so real and never boring. The acting is great and the location makes the movie look like you're there. From the very beginning to the end, this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention. The actress works perfectly with a girl who survived this terrible plane crash in Amazon and shows how she managed to survive in Amazon. It's amazing that anyone could survive in such conditions. That's why this film is so appealing. The fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and the thought that a young girl could survive this temptation is enormous. I think that this movie that I can watch over and over again and which I never dying. This is really a compliment because I have hundreds of movies! I'd say this is my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
