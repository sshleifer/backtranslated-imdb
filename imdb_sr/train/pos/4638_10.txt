I saw this movie when I was in Israel during the summer. my Hebrew is not fluent, so the subtitles are very useful, I did not feel lost at any time in the movie. You're used to getting used to the subtitles after 5 minutes. This film took me away !!!!!! It shows two of the most prominent taboos in the Middle East today: the homosexual relationship between the Israeli and the Palestinian. Allows a person to enter both conflict areas at the same time. Dilema, emotions. The film comes in a tragedy when anger and rage provokes one of the lovers to one extremist side! absolutely must see !!
