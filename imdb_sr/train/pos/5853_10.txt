I really liked this Summerslam because of the look of the arena, the curtain and the look that was for some reason interesting to me. Anyway, this could be one of the best Summerslams ever if the VVF did not have Lek Luger in the main event against Iokosuna, now it's time it's okay to have a huge fat man against a strong man, but I'm glad the times have changed. It was a terrific major event, just like every match in which Luger is terrible. Other matches on the card included Razor Ramon and Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Heavenly Bodies, Shavn Michaels vs Curt Hening, this was an event in which Shavn named his big monster bodyguard Diesel, IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart first takes over the Doink, then takes over Jerry Lavler and things with Harts and Lavler was always very interesting, then Ludwig Borga destroyed Marta Jannetti, Undertaker took over Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka were taken over by Bam Bam Bigelow and Headshrinkers, and Iocosun defended the title against the world drug Luger, this game was boring and has an awesome place. However, it deserves 8/10
