Goldeneie will always be one of the most legendary games in VG history. There is no doubt about that. But this game, although quite different, could be a contemporary Bond champion of its time. This was completely new; scripted game. Which even had its own theme! Playing was great, and if you are a lover of games or movie related bonds, you will enjoy it. Unlike some / most of the games, members of the acting teams displayed their characters, in contrast to fictional creations for the game. What gives her more cinematic feelings. With a very nice story about the bond, you feel like you are in the game as you get lost in the movie. Enjoy in all aspects from the beginning to the end. Even after the beating of the game, there is still a lot to do. When a ranking and unlocking system is achieved, as well as multi-player missions, this is an exceptional game. In spite of being quite old now, in years of video games. It's still a good game that you can pick up and play whenever you feel the need to get a little more Bond in your life. Even now, thinking about it, my topic has been stuck in my head. Such a brilliant cast and a well written story. The story revives on the screen, almost as if the actors were ahead of you, and it's just as fun as the game itself. Superior, in the right tie. Which can only be called Avesome, Totally Avesome. Now I have to throw this game. If you have not played yet, you miss!
