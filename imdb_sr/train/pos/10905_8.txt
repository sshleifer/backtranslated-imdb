In September 2003, 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died. He had a terrible genetic condition called Distrophic Epidermolisis Bullosa (EB) - which meant that his skin literally fell to the smallest touch, leaving his body covered with painful wounds and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. In the last months, Johnny decided to work with director Patrick Collerton to document his life and death, and the result was the first film broadcast in March, which was an exciting, confusing and provocatively humorous story of a unique man. Not fleeing from the dark reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of life that lived to the end. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004, The Boi Vhose Skin Fell Off became the most responsible documentary film that year. She attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening, the audience donated more than half a million pounds to Jonny's charity organization DEBRA. The Memorial Fund, Johnny Kennedy, was set up to raise another half million euros to ensure that Johnny Kennedy left millions of pounds.
