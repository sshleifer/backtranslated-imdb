Some people say this is the best film ever released by the PRC, but I'm not sure about it because I have a precious spot in my heart for some of their mysteries. I'll say that this is probably one of the most memorable single films that they, or any other studio, big or small, ever released. The action is simple. The spirit of the wrongly executed ferry returned to the swamp to kill all those who licked it, as did all their spring. In this mixture comes a grandson of victims of one spirit, the current ferry. She takes over the ferry job while the ghost stops at the man she loves. Wrapped in thick fog and placed primarily on a single wet set, this is a more musical song than a regular feature film. The rhythms of dialogue, especially in the early stages, are their poetic rhythm towards them. Similarly, there is a similar rhythm of the camera's work when it travels forward and back across the swamp as if it passes through the door through the path between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or a musical lesson than a mere horror movie. It's an incredible movie film that's probably unique in the history of the movie. This is not for Guild Lilly. This is a low-budget horror / mystery that tells you a nice little story that will entertain you. His story of love and revenge is what is important here, not poetic film work, and he attracts you the most (technical aspects are just dressing up the window). If there is some real drawback, the cheapness of production. The fog creates an atmosphere, but it also hides the fact that this wetland is completely dry. The constant moves back and forth, but after some 58 minutes it is desirable to see something else. Do not misunderstand me. It's a good little movie that has shown me somewhat that desire is a little less affected by poverty. It's definitely worth a look if you come across it.
