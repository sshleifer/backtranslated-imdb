This film is an excellent example of fine storytelling. The acting is wonderful. The story is inspirational without being too manipulative or fake. There were a few points where people probably made people a bit better or worse than they really were, but given that it was a Hollywood movie, they showed incredible restraint. No explosions were shown in the movie, although they had one chance. The film, though it had uncertain parts, was not turned into an action movie. The story is so designed to focus on an exceptional man, unfortunately ordinary times. Good work!
