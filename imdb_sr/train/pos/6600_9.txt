I'll keep this review short and sweet .... I saw a trailer for this and thought I'd give it a spin for 5 minutes and my initial thoughts were "what the hell is this?" But after 10 minutes I knelt and after 20 years I pulled out the fork from the floor. This film is an excellent example of how the film can be distinguished, and it is also French. This film is a superb art candy wrapped in a neat futuristic movie noir package, motion capture is a very smart and black-and-white animation style that does not have a gray color, although at first it did not do for me and me. the end of the film, and I found myself wanting every movie to be like this. I think that my thoughts helped greatly dubbing it would be very easy to destroy that they did not send so many prominent actors as many actors give a sense of character (just watch any movie from Hong Kong in English to see the perfect example) I gave it 9 even though I gave an extra 2 because of the fresh and new whole thing.
