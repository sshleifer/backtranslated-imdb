I happily acknowledge that I am a spice for a wonderful movie, and enough inventive movements of the camera and angles may be enough to keep interest in a rather long film. No length Goyoe, although she had one of the most important cinemas I've seen from the Korean part of MUSA. However, Goyoe provides much more than beautiful pictures (like MUSA ... does not mean that contrast) - this is the second biggest strength is a wonderful acting, and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophies. I must admit that I'm quite sure what the point was in the end, but it certainly causes some thoughts on the road. Unclear, but definitely thinks: p </ i> <p> One department in which a movie might be better is action. The film has a huge amount of bloodshed, but action is taken with hyperkinetic close-ups, and often sheltered by objects in the foreground. It creates some very intense and impressive images, but it would be nice to see some more real moves, something that would make it more convincing that the villains could only trample through the entire army and scatter everything. > Still, the film is definitely one of the most interesting and beautiful films I've seen for some time. Recommended!
