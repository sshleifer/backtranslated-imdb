The Rookie kept me from the beginning to the end. Dennis Kuaid played this role to perfection. The little boy playing the son was fantastic. He made this film a father-son for memory. Messages are good. Follows your dreams. Failure to search is ok as long as you try. Excitement is tangible. I believe this movie will be a classic.
