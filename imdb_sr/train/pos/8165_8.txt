A dentist was made at a time when almost every profession had a psycho. We had crazy policemen, emergency ambulance, secretaries, and it was just for the beginning. The dentist came to surprise late because going to the dentist is usually a nightmare for every human being. The plot is weird. Super clean dentist Dr. Feinstone lives the perfect life in his big "white house", has a beautiful blue woman and a great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds come to his horizon in the form of a nasty IRS (Terminator's Earl Boen), a dirty pool cleaner, "cleansing" his wife and suddenly all the teeth seem to have passed through the dark filter. He speaks and begins to take care of people with teeth in a nasty way. And you do not want to come in his way. The team was professional. Producer / Director Brian Iuzna has produced stylish horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beiond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator and his first film The Society was a good spinoff by John Carpenter's Thei Live. Producer of the film Pierre David is known from films such as Scanners. Cast was excellent. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from LA Lava and Major League, but I could dream of him as a psychotherapist. He was actually great in his role and was kind of a sad person. Linda Hoffman was beautiful and stupid like Feinstone's wife. Micahel Stadtec did not have many rows, but after seeing him with neighborhood women, I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, From Beiond) was a nice scene as a policeman on the case. Virginia Keehne was an innocent teenager who would be the next client for Feinstone. Finally Warning: If you are like me and have problems with dentists, you may need to skip this one. But if you want to try, then you have to prepare yourself with dark humor and lots of nasty drilling.
