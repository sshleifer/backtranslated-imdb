I saw True Crime when it was first published in the mid-nineties and since then I've watched it many times. She is a great mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school student in a California city who tortured and killed an unknown killer by the younger sister of a schoolmate. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees how great she is and decides to work together to find the killer. Many suspects in this. The real crime seems to me to be very "true" or real. I read a review of newspaper groups where someone wrote that there is a complete suspicion of unbelief here and that it is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, like other actors. The locations are correct, and the writer / director, Pat Verducci, really records some of the reality of teenage life and Mary's loneliness (see the scene where Mary wakes from the dream sequence after looking at the photos she captured for Tony). I wish Verducci made more movies. I did not see any other movie like True Crime. 10/10
