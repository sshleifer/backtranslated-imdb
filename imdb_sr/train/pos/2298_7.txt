I love the occult horror, a great British Hammer Studios, which is one of his major films released the "Devil Rides Out" (1968), proved to be more than capable in this field Horror. This occult tenth episode of Hammer's brief TV series, "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guardian of the Abiss" really creepy entry in the series. Directed by Don Sharp, who had previously enriched Hammerov opus with "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966) and further directed two "Fu Machu" film starring Christopher Lee, undoubtedly one of the famous names among HHH directors, and he also brings here. Michael Antique (Rai Lonnen) encounters a mysterious old glass for watching. A watch glass is the object of the craving for a devil cult who wants to use it for his Satanic rituals. Once prone to a beautiful young girl named Allison (Rosalin Landor), which should be sacrificed by the cult, Michael becomes a deeper problem with the cult and its sinister leader (Johnny Carson) ... While this is not one of my favorite episodes of absolute grounds "Hammer House of Horror" (the best is a brilliant seventh episode, "The Silent Scream"), is very dreadful and atmospheric. The action has several interesting plants, and remains uncertain and unusual throughout the entire film. Rai Lonnen runs well, young Rosalien Landor is convincing as innocent beauty, and John Carson is truly terrible as Satanist leader. All in all, "Guardian of the Abiss" is another interesting and creepy HHH story and my fans Hammer's should not miss.
