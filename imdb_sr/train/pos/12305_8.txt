I was not quite sure what to expect from this, beyond the uniform positive reviews I read. It turned out that I could never imagine this movie, because it is very close to the "Brides with white hair" in operation and fantasy. This is a fine line between farce, comedy and a good old fashion story about ghosts. There is nothing terrifying; it's not a theme, it's mostly a love story dealing with an unpleasant guy who meets a wonderful spirit, which is in great distress with other spirits. So, the main topic is the type that tries to save the beautiful spirit. This also happens in ancient China, with wild unusual Kung Fu exhibitions and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the halted ghost actions are pretty cool, and visual effects are at the highest level. I could watch this genre of Chinese movies all day, because they are very fun, great visuals and quite a lot of languages. I'm looking forward to watching the first sequel to this film. Recommended.
