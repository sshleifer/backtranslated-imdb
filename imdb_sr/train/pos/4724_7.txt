Caught: Buried alive leads us to a resort that's just opened, and will soon close. We start with the type in the gears to avoid the possibility of avalanches. somehow, that makes no sense. in any case, he is ready to blow up one particularly great when he sees that the resort is open. despite his greatest efforts, senior authority tells him that his day is over. Soon, as everyone expects, struck avalanches. Look, I will not discover more anymore. , all I can say is that this was a B-movie designed for the family channel (which I just saw, and the fact that there are no commercials proving it to be B-movie) is a pretty decent movie anyway, but it's partly unrealistic. First hand, when people are buried with ice and snow, they are buried. not accompanied by dust. Or, what about a screwdriver CD? it is not possible. and finally, what can not be emphasized enough is that the explosion can not stop the avalanche, guaranteed. Moreover, it is worth renting or watching TV, but not owning it. 7/10. The film was rated by PG, but maybe it should get something stronger. the boy almost lost his foot in the elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, the guy is healed with electricity and diesel, and in the exercise room lie dead people. Enjoy.
