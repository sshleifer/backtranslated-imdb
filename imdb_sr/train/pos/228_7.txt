"Convicts" are largely the third film. All dialogue and interaction of the character that takes place inside it comes from the long wind in the late southern day. And, therefore, the life of his protagonist, Solla (Robert Duvall). This is the first collaboration between Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years earlier, they worked together on the film "The Trip to Bountiful", a movie that looks almost overwhelming with this action. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he is barely this side of an adequate one. The slow tempo leaves a lot of space for the Toiomichi Curit, a film that brings the film into real feelings of brittle light and heat. Because it's basically a movie game, with little editing or directing heroism, everything comes to acting. As far as I'm concerned, there are no mistakes here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are completely real, uninterested in anything but life. Lukas Haas, a young actor with whom I was introduced to "Testament" and "Witness", is very similar to his early roles. He is quiet, withdrawn, somewhat frightened and sad, somehow. These are qualities that look natural from him. Perhaps the title as "prisoners" is a bad service to this movie. This title, along with the starting scene, seems to create an image of far more raised Western image. If you are not interested in slow production of scenic productions, you will also want to forward this. Otherwise, it could be exactly the one you want to do more often. Enjoy.
