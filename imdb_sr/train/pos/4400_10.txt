The star of this film is the script. Attention to details in the period of dress, language, social customs (we do not hurt women) and policies are extraordinary. It is a reminder for Kosovo today. Subtle pieces in action scenes are there for a careful observer, and the choreography of these action sequences is wonderful. Perhaps this film is near reality in order to earn the support it was supposed to get. It is like a staircase of increasing violence, with breaks of peace and tranquility between each step. Big movie ....
