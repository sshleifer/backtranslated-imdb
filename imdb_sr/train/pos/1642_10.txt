I did not see the movie since the first edition, but it was unforgettable. The performance of Ripa Torna and Conchate Farrell were great, the photo was excellent, a moving story, and everything else about it was the highest standard. Still, it seems to be pretty forgotten. Maybe it's because the UK is a strange market, but I did not watch a movie on TV or video, which is sad. Has he had more success in the US where he can rightly be considered a fairly accurate historical drama? Always count 50% of good movie music and although I'm not sure that I think the title of the title was a simple but mobile solo clarinet "What a friend we have in Jesus". The film then disproved it! Am I right or not?
