The multilayered novel Rohinton Mistria seemed impossible to adapt to the screen, but the film that emerged was filled with passion, emotion, humor and pathos. The story is a bit slow, but there is always something on the screen that would attract audiences. The film perfectly captures a certain time and place with precise precision. All actors are Indian - there are few who are known to the "Western" audience - but they are glad to watch, especially a girl who works very convincingly. Do not postpone the title and summary of the action - this is a movie that can be seen on the big screen. We have a lot to learn from it.
