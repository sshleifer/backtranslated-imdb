Hidden Frontiers - is more than a fan-fiction - a well-designed and organized series that keeps the Star Trek world alive and growing. From a fun project for fans to date known networks; Hidden Frontiers has something for every fan star trek in it. Set in the late Star Trek: Nekt Generation / DS9 and Voiager timeline The Hidden Border takes over the themes and questions that are posed in other Star Trek-staged series stories using well-developed characters, complications and stories. Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken on social context stories that Gene Roddenberri failed to show on the screen and showed character development in long-term spatial tasks - real things that are happening in the near end, as well as thrilling spatial wars and conflicts - Fi addicts know and love . Almost in the "Green Screen" studio; Hidden borders lead to the screen and your heart an incredible number of rows. A large ensemble of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. Inventive use of green screen technology, props, makeup and costumes work to entertain and trust the hidden world of Star Trek. The Hidden Frontier went where little people went into the world of science fiction and advanced when they arrived there. Hidden Frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well-designed website, with interesting forums for discussion, access to creative, production and acting staff, and fun week-long conversation. I recommend that you take the time to load and watch.
