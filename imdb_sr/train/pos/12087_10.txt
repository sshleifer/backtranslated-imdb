I took the chance for "Hardcastle and McCormick" by purchasing the value of the first season (Canadian edition) from Amazon. When I got it, I started with the pilot, and I was hooked right after that. I rated it with the 5 stars on Amazon, and I'm rating it here with the 10 stars. That's very good. What I liked were the themes of opening and closing, and of course the Stephen Cannella logo at the end of each episode, but above all, the relationship between Judge and Mark while they worked together to break each case. I was so drawn that I purchased the second season as a traveler, and I enjoyed it equally. If you do not have this great series on the disc, I believe you need to buy it and put it in your collection.
