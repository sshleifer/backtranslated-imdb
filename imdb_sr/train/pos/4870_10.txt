The film celebrates life. The world is set for innocent and pure souls and it all has "Happi End", just like on the final scene of the movie. The film has a wonderful soundtrack, a mixture of Serbian Neofolk, Gypsy music and jazz. This film is a very refreshing visual poetics. The viewing experience is like you. I sat in another vivid, romantic, and sometimes rude world. As if the film Kusturica should have been.
