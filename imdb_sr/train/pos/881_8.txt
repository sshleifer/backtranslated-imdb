"Reading My Lips" speaks of the strange symbiosis that develops between the ordinary, socially bad female office worker (Devos) and her trainee at the workplace, rude exon (Casel). While the film enriches this incredible duo to their identification numbers, they intertwine in the cold merging of the mind, each of which is used by others for its own selfish reasons with exceptional outcome. Good things for everyone in films with characteristic movements with strong psychodrama currents. In French with easy-to-read subtitles and good translation. (B +)
