What sound of the 80's. I guess John Travolta sang some of the songs, but if he watched the movie, he seemed to personify everything that was a cheese from the 80's. It is clear that films relying on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were in style. The best was his bad Tekas accent. Compare it with Fridai Night Lights. I suggest you watch Cocktail and Stir Crazi to start getting into the movie. Also, as a note Made in America with Ted Danson and Vhoopie Goldberg is a terribly bad movie. I was so shocked that I realized that I had never seen him. Another strange film of this genre would have to include Man-Made Man with Robin Villiams. Just remember that all these great stars have played great roles in these films ... Tom Cruise, Richard Prior, Robin Villiams and John Travolta
