Story and characters were some of the best I've ever seen. the graphics were good for PS and cutting scenes, and the voices were incredible. I won the game at least 3 times and I loved every second. I felt that the problems faced by the protagonists were credible and real and I believe that it deserves a continuation. or at least a remake. If it was processed for PS3, I would buy the system for this game only, and perhaps mgs4 its incredible and the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to guarantee the lease and beyond that adventive though sometimes cheating (stupid buster) stick) the system of combat additions and plots makes this game a definite purchase.
