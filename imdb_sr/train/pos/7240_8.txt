When I found this film in my local video, I expected it to be another American movie about vampires in the same spirit "The Lost Bois" (1987). Sometimes it's a bit tricky, but it still has enough stylish sets and surprises to satisfy the vampire enthusiasts. This is the perfect combination of romance and horror, and this is surprising from time to time.
