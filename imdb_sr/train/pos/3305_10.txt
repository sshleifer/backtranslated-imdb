Without a doubt, this film must be one of the greatest in cinema history. I've watched him too many times to remember, and every time it's like watching a movie for the first time. Where is it starting? Meena Kumari performance is undoubtedly one of the best in his career, and soon follows Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar. Every movement and nuance of her performance makes any other Bollywood heroine pale. Her masterly interpretation of Kathak in combination with her grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic expression of Urdhua, is as if nothing was seen on the Bollywood screen. Pakeezah is perhaps the most picturesque interpretation of the human condition; photography, lavish cinema and table one scene, are so burdened by symbolism and meaning that the viewer has remained breathless. Naushad's music, is unmatched, his knowledge of the music of the garage garage is incredible, and the way in which he narrates the dark atmospheric motifs and superior romantic melodies is truly remarkable. My only advice to anyone who is seriously enjoying the spectacle of total cinema, should watch this epic mediation on life and art.
