Better than the typical made for a TV movie, the CALL FOR PEL is blessed with excellent casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidi, McCarthy, pre-Murphy Brovn Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frie) and a highly updated concept of the famous Faustian shop. Urich is as sweet as ever, and Lucci is particularly attractive and devious to the mother of all femme fatale roles. The type of hybrid version STEPFORD VIVES and THEI LIVE, the film binds itself early on its apocalyptic Miltoneskue vision, and fans of horror are unlikely to have many complaints until there is a run-off. 7/10
