That cat, Jerry Mouse, and Spike the Dog (here's called Butch, his third name, his second being 'Killer') decide to sign a peace treaty that everyone likes. It's strange and a bit unnatural when I see them as a friend, and their friends seem to think so. But in the end, thanks to a disagreement about the sausage, everything has returned to normal and everything is right. This short is the second of three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited and I have no idea why this one was. This caricature can be found on a disc on one of the DVD's Spotlight collection "Tom & Jerry" My Rating: B
