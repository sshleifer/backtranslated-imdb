This series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by authors and archaeologists and other anthropologists. It revives the book and gives even more meaning to the author's subsequent opus, * Collapse *. The Diamond itself appears to be appealing and caring, not just as an uninterested or absent academic. This series clearly shows that his book was not merely a response to the need to "publish or collapse", as the saying goes on about the academy, but a profound consideration of the answer to the question of someone whom he respects: "Why did you get so much money so white people, and we have so little? "Having respected the intelligence of the examiner and his community, Diamond sought an answer that did not offend that intelligence or that community. I like to think about his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as "South Park" "Blame Canada": "Blame Wheat!"
