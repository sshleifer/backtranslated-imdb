Much has been said about this film and I would like to join those who have praised him. It's a very unique movie that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster movie, without making a mess. At the points just laugh loudly, in other points you feel for the characters whose faults and mistakes you are looking at. Sabu's genius can be displayed in relation to some film sequences. One of them is that all three who jostle each other have an erotic daily dream about the young woman they just walked on the street. This sequence is nicely made and well illustrated by the characters of all three runners. At the same time, it's erotic and funny. Another example of Saboo's genius is part of the movie in which the runners are tired. The first of them, a typical loser among the three guys, hallucinates that the woman who left him for someone else returns and you see them dance with each other and will shoot in the next one with deep moving ones. All racers come to this point where they think they have something lost or are on their way again. And in one part of the film they stop running, running in the line, just laughing. So, here is all the beauty and fun of what we call the life that Saba manages to show during the entire film. His characters are decaying (at the end?), But they do not take away their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" justifying Sabu's claim to be a genius. Go watch them! <br /> <br />
