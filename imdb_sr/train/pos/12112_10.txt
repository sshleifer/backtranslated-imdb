The premise of this series of anime is about the bread, all the things on which the plot is based! I really laughed. The main character has the special bread with which he was born, and goes to the baking school. I wish it was available on DVD, and it does not matter if it's subtitled or synchronized - it's so good. Even the song itself is fun. At one point in the thematic poem, there is an Afro-Japanese man with an afro on a horse, who holds the French baget as if he were a samurai sword. These images will not make sense if you do not see the anime. You'll laugh until your sides get hurt. It's definitely the most unique anime I've ever seen.
