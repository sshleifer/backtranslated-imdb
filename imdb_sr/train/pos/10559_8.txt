I did not write a review about IMDb for a long time, but I felt compelled to write this! When I looked at this movie, I found a review that encouraged people NOT to watch this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant person! Nothing is a fantastic movie, full of laughter and above all ... imagination! Are not you ill and tired of being armed with the same old cycle of brown tires? Sometimes a movie like NISHA appears and gives you something you've never seen before. I do not even care if you do not like (even hate) a movie, but no one has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a huge impact on reputation and no negative review should discredit such a film. Just say you hate him and why you hate him ... but do not try to tell people that you should not look. We have our own minds and we will make our own thoughts thanks to. If my assessment is good, I would say that more people will enjoy this film, unlike those who hate it. Give your mind a little candy! See NOTHING!
