This film should be watched in the right spirit. First, the central relationship between father and son clearly shows that the film was conceived as a sign to his film Vong Fei Hung "Drunk Teacher" (the ideas from this film are repeated in "Drunk Teacher II" rather than "Young Master"; that Chan moved away From this plan and the renamed characters indicates that he himself was not convinced that the material complied properly, and, indeed, the film conveys the feeling that it is incomplete, for example, the romantic connection about which half of the shop turns the "Young Master" from of the same period, also feels insufficient, but at least all of its central threads are related to theft the characters who are trying to find his central theme, just to leave the effort, probably because of the time and budget. Or the film is simply too ambitious because it is committed to develop From the central character above all other concerns - Because of this, there is a lack of kung fu throughout the movie. Chan wants to make a romantic comedy that has kung fu in it, but also the historical element and the romantic element encountered something more than complicated. It leaves us with a comedy. Since Chan is a concern for character development, comedy is mostly characterized - as in the conflict between Chan's character and his best friend, quarrels about a girl. But there are a lot of slapsticks. Frankly, I think that comedy is amusing enough to forgive me the incompleteness of the act. This film is an attempt by Chan's side to find a sustainable formula that can be used and developed over time. That does not work, and Chan finds this formula only after leaving the historical elements of his earlier films, creating a modern action comedy "The Police Story". But to look at this film, it is still very informative about how Chan managed to pass through the historical genre, and perhaps why he left it.
