A warm, touching movie that has fantastic quality. Ellen Burstin is, as always, wonderful. Something about this will persecute you. Most of all, you have to see this incredible 5-year-old. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so fascinated by her presence, I had to buy a movie so I could watch it all the time. She is the miracle of God's creation. Judging by the high rating of IMDB, I'm not the only one who was hypnotized by this young actress.
