I fully enjoyed this true form of accepting Dick Tracy's person. This is a well-made product that used modern technology to create a story about a comedian. If you are an amateur or have recently watched some of Dica Traci's old movies, then you are sure that you will get a kick from this performance. Pastel colors and greater than the characters of life carried out in the painstaking authentic understanding of the era that went past was the game as it should have been. I personally think that Madonna's musical element is the main part of this film - a CD that contains her music from this movie is the one I've often listened over the years, just so well made and performed musically and adapted to that age. In my head, Madonna's most beautiful moment on the screen, but especially music. This will surely lead to a "kid" in you.
