No Strings Attached is one of the best performances of Carlos Mencia until today. Mencia is known for poking and ridiculing racial issues. However, he is doing more than that in this stand-up performance, which was held in San Francisco. In general, Mencia material not only laughs at you, it also makes you think about what is really bad in society today. In this hour, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration, what women really think when they seek equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion of Christ's torture Mela Gibson and the argument he got with a woman regarding whether or not Jesus was hit, and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally handicapped. Mencia even discusses whether she should have the right to speak and tell a joke. Carlos Mencia does not scare offense, which often leads him to problems with critics. For example, he is somewhat distant (and admits) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and what he currently most likely is doing in heaven. Mensina's main message in all his performances is that we all have a voice and that we should use that voice to talk about what we feel and we are not afraid to offend. He reminds us that we have the right to freedom of speech and that we must use this right as Americans. If you enjoy this show, I certainly recommend watching Mind of Mencia, its shows on the Comedi Central.
