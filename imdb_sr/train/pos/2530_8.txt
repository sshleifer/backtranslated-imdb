One of the joys of collecting Bela Lugosi's recent collection is to see great movies such as The Invisible Rai. Boris Karlof and Bela Lugoshi joined in a meteorite and radiation film, while science is completely absurd (especially Karloph's technique, such as Janos Ruk, which determines the position of a particular meteorite) and is completely funny, it did not care The movie is completely fun. The effects are good for the time, the acting is excellent, and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of the pulp of sci-fi comics and novels from the 1940s and 1950s, together with guns and funny science. You have to watch this movie!
