Full House is a great performance. And today I grew up on it. I started looking at him when I was 8, and now I'm 12 and I'm still watching him. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. she's my favorite. she had such a sense of humor. In case there are people who barely watch the show on this scene, it should be because you will get used to it. I became hooked on it after the first show I saw, which was just the first episode of 2002. I really think this performance should fall on many generations in families. and that's great because it's a suitable show for all ages. and for all parents, she teaches children lessons on how to continue with her life. nothing terrible happens, such as violence or cursing. It's really great sit-com. I give him 5 out of 5 stars. What do you think? OH and the best time to watch is when you are home sick from school or even from an old office. It will make you feel much better. Believe me, I am hardly ill at home, but I still know that it will feel better. and to everyone who thinks the play is stupid, it's too bad for you because you will not get so far in your life even if you are content with your life. you really should watch it and you'll stick to it. I'm just telling you what happened to me and everyone else who started watching this great show. so I have to go to lunch. Remember that you have to start watching a full home and soon!
