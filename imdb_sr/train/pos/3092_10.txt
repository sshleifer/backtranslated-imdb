You probably already already know all this, but on ABC you can see five more episodes that are never broadcast. It is a crime that this beautifully written and acting performance has been canceled. Actors who play Lauru, Vhit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Ani and Omega, Steven Caseman - are all incredible and natural in these roles. Even children are great. Vonderful shov. So sad that it's gone. Of course, I wonder why they were canceled. There is no way I can allow myself to believe that Mrs. Moinahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it. She was in perfect time in this market. I again watched all the episodes on ABC.com - I hope they all will appear on DVD one day. Thank you for reading.
