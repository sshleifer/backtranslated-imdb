This film deals with the Irish rebellion of the twenties of the last century and more specifically the life of one man after informing his friends of the benefits on his head and subsequent consequences. Watching the movie, I had the feeling that you can take the script with just a few minor changes, do it again, and unfortunately, it still keeps up with modern events. But the remake would not be nearly as good. The magnificent performance of Victor McLaglin (deservedly earned by the Oscars) and an ensemble that includes the majority, if not all of Hollywood's actors at the time, most of them are recognizable art actors who either were founded at that time or just starting from. A very good movie worth watching. Recommended.
