One thing is certain ... you should not watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a person who must live with a sin that can not stand. The story is a stroke, not an ordinary explanation, so you're wondering what's going on. In the end, the points are merged and the performances make sense. All the characters were fine and Vil Smith did another good day at the office. No doubt it is necessary to ask a lot of moral questions, but if you just accept and buy in his agony it is easier. to accept what he chose. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey that leads you is interesting, if not irresistible. Good enough movie that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. I would recommend this movie if you like the kind of thing you need to think, not just watching explosions and fights.
