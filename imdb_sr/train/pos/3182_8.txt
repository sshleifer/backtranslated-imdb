Convenient British airline pilot George Tailor (a solid portrait of Guiseppe Pambieri) was beaten by robbers after a wild night in Hong Kong. George gets to meet and falls in sweet and virgin Dr. Emmy Vong (a fine and charming performance by the beautiful Tea Li). George gets health again and returns to work. When Emmy does not hear from George for a long time, she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute. While the director / co-writer Bitto Albertini really delivers a satisfactory amount of anticipated delicious nudity and sexual intercourse, this movie is just not your routine in the leering. Instead, it is a surprisingly thought-out, touching and tragic love story between two well-drawn and very attractive characters (Chai like Emi Vong is especially brilliant and dear). The painting starts colorful and cheerful, but the tone radically turns into a darker and more cruel mood about two-thirds of times. Emi descended into a wedding after falsely assuming that George left her gloomy and disturbing; also incredible sad and heartbreaking surprise. However, the narration is certainly melodramatic, but never too stupid or garbage. Moreover, the scene of sex is quite tasty and even truly erotic. The notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a pretty significant support, such as George's jealous and unwilling secretary Helen Miller. Sophisticated Cinema Guido Mancori offers a lot of amazing shots of exotic locations. Nico Fidenco is a fan, a pulsating hit hits the groove spot. Worth to look at those who are looking for something else.
