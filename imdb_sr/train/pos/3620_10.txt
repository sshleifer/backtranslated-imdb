I just saw this movie tonight, the prime minister. It was great!! I'm a big fan of sports movies, and this was there as one of my favorite movies. Dennis Kuaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Kuaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin, where you live ... and she was supposed to buy you a drink once ... well ... she kind of stood by you. .. but she did not want !: C) [not that anyone will believe ...]) Anyway, it's a great movie. Anyone who loves a good sports movie should come out and see him! : C) \ t
