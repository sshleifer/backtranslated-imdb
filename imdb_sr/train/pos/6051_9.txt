This is a great British film. Smartly watched script with many lines that can be cited, which perfectly captures what magical mushrooms can do to a man over the weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is excellent along with the one most rated by British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bovles with a wrist that pulls out of his mouth is masterful casting, and Gari Stretch, with his dark look, brings something strange to the atmosphere. Though it seems to be charged as a biker movie, I think it will find the audience outside this, solely on the assumption that many people were there and that they got a t-shirt. Also a great original soundtrack with a shiny version of Freebird. This could indeed be the successor to the famous Ealing comedies of the 21st century. Like weeds in wolf fields: it's a breeder!
