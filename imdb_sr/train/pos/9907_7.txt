"Slaughter High" is perhaps the most prized black film from the 1980s. This is one of the rare films in the genre that is enchanting. This also relies heavily on the standard formula of a slasher: a group of young men and women are killed one by one disgustingly to the final calculation. The movies in their genre are to go over the top. Marty, the killer, has a good reason to be angry with his former colleagues. They struck him with electric currents while he was naked in a little girl in the dressing room, struck with a spear in the groin and, in addition, set up his experiment from a scientific laboratory in order to destroy it. So, the victims in this movie are similar to you. When they reunite years later - at a meeting of high school students Marty himself set - you realize they have not grown so mature. They are a bunch of sociopaths. It's amazing why you would not wonder why they were the only ones who appeared at the gathering, which, by the way, is held at school. who has since fallen into oblivion. And who would have thought that it was a good idea to drink beer and alcoholic beverages found in an abandoned building in a room with its exposed cabinets - like Marty's? There are many jumps of faith that the viewer should take to enjoy this film. The end has little or no sense. Scenarists have a strange understanding of how the April movie works: the film claims that jokes are no longer allowed afternoon. All in all, the movie is one of the best examples of slasher genres, despite all its drawbacks. It's hard to figure out why he has not yet found his way to a DVD, when so many other racers cross the special editions.
