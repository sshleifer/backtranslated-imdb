For a long time, all good Canadian actors seemed to be heading south of the border, and (I suppose) all those second-rowers filled up the tops and left the remains for sexual comedies. This film was a real surprise: despite the unusual plots that are typical of fars, the actors tried to put something in their characters, and what we, the viewer, returned, was almost the right suspension of belief . When the stats from the music video attacked the policemen who threw it out, you almost believed that it was possible. If you are a fan of some of the better sex fakes (Canadian or not), you should definitely look for this out. And a big surprise, this sex farce is also burdened with some very good nudity.
