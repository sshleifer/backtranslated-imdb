Outside a great regime, production, acting and predictable drama, there is an essential message in the script: "Listening to the end" To hear the voice rush, listen. Voice, listen. To access yourself, listen. To discover the needs of any situation or other, listen. Script writers seem to convey the "secret of life". Listening leads to awareness of one's own Self. She awakes the other senses, especially the vision and extends the horizon. One soul can also be discovered. The art of this film, "How it is in Heaven," demonstrated magnificently the development of life, not only its joys and sorrows, but ultimately the hope of life. All this with the first instruction of the main character of the choir; <br /> <br /> "Just listen, keep it all the way"
