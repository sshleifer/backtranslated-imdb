Look at Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in the film about a dead girl who is chasing a new girlfriend. It's Gabrielle from the Desperate Housevives and the guy who was wearing "Panthen's sexual colonial" in Anchorman. If you are looking for a movie that is nominated for the Golden Globe then you have to reconsider how you watch movies. However, if you are willing to stop the reality in 90 minutes and want to watch some funny movie then you have come to the right place. The characters are funny. They work very well together. The real match is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He was as funny as on Friends, and she was funny and looked good at the same time. I went with my wife, she also enjoyed me.
