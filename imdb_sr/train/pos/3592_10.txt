Another powerful blow. This time she spends around Diana Gusman, who is always fighting in schools. Instead of being thrown out, she takes her anger somewhere else, into a boxing ring. She is trained to be a boxer and she meets Adrian's pen and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a strong message to take your dreams and go with them, even if someone does not believe in you (in this case, her father does not believe in it). It just makes a movie worthwhile. Enjoy
