Russell, my fav, is gorgeous in this movie. But more than that, the film covers a huge spectrum of human passion and sorrow. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that the tolerance of other people provides a way to save mankind. An incredible love story between Lachlin and Lil. I repeat their scenes. Anyone who has ever been in love with companions with these people. All the characters are great.
