I'm a nineteen-year-old man and I'm really tired of seeing Care Bear all the time. Rooney is a great dancer who cares if she is gay. This guy had to be a cheerleader or something like that. Beats Barney, I can not pull the songs out of my head .... must ... stop singing ........ Doodlebops songs. ....... NOW. It must have 10 rows of text, so I have to keep ..... about when I say all Canadian things like OOOUT Aboooot. Horrible Canadians ... Jazmine is too rhyme, it must be Dutch. Knock knock, who is there, Dee Dee, super hottie Bus driver Bob can not play, take lessons from Rooney
