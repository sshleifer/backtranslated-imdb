I was lucky to be extra in this great movie and I liked every minute of shooting. I went to the London premiere and had a great conversation with Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon, as well as my wife. Then, a few weeks later, I went to the cinema with the members of our bicycle club. What a great movie, deserves to be there with all the big biker movies. Now we have DVD Sue, my wife can not get enough, like children. Take a few clubs that seem to think I'm a movie star, so you can just dream. I think they're just jealous. The only disadvantage of the first part of the shooting was time, rain, rain and more rain, but we were in Wales. I hope there will be monitoring so you can notify me. Danni Beck
