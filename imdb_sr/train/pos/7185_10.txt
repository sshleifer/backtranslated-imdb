Sitting on the front porch of his house in Burbank, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadlei had the same size in every garment other than the hat. Ted, one of the greatest stuntmen, said that every time Zorro put on his mask, he was the one on the screen. It was a little exaggeration: there were moments that Zorro was obviously Reed Hadlei, but in cascades We can be pleased that Ted was at work. And what stops! As the witness comments here, "Zorro's fighting legion" is one of the biggest serials. It's exciting and generally very well made. Reed Hadlei was a good actor and, as someone else commented, he made a very good fop. But, of course, it's an action that makes this movie so brilliant. And what else can we expect, with the leadership of this excellent team, Vitnea and English, with great music from incredibly fruitful Villiam Lava (the list here says it was unprotected, but that's incorrect, those other composers who the names listed here were indeed unregistered, and I do not know if they wrote some music - it sounds like Lava), and with the crime, among others, the Great Charles King, and dozens of important parts? It is important to note the criminal who worked Radio Tarzan, Jim Pierce, who was a son of Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I invite you to read his mini-bio.) There is one chapter that slows things down depressingly, but, hell, that's only a few minutes (maybe 20) and when you pass through it, well, you have returned to excitement. Turner Classic Movies deserves great gratitude for presenting this great series, so we should ask TCM to bring us even more. And we should thank everyone involved in seeing it as a chapter or series rather than a re-cut function.
