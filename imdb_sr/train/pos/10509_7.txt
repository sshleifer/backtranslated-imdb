I did not read the novel, although I understand that this is something different from it; The fact that I enjoyed this more, along with the fact that it really is not my genre, leads me to decide not to ask for a book. Since I did not read any of Austen's writing, I really can not compare this with any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialogue in this is smart, witty and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. This made me very happy, with perfect British and verbal material. Every acting performance is spot-on, and Paltrow completely nails the role of a love conductor. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. However, I think that several of them are extremely irritating, and although I think that at least something of that should have been ridiculous, this was usually repeated overly, and frankly, it was not fun when they first appeared. Installation and cinema are magical, and everything looks quite wonderful. Plots and pacing are great, you're never bored. It ends up in a really * obvious way, but maybe it's what the audience prefers. I can not claim that it did not entertain me, it was from the beginning to the end, and I would look at it again. There is a short tongue. I recommend this to any lovers of romantic stories. 7/10
