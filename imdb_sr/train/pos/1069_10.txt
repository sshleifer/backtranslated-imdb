I bought Dark Angel Season 1 and 2 two weeks ago, after I caught several episodes of the first season on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for a brilliant show. I did not enjoy anything more than Firefly (also incredible show). I will admit that Season 2 is sometimes not so good, but there are still some incredible episodes (see Check this, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Agenda, Lighting Light, Freak Nation etc.) And Alec is great. I've heard some of the plans for the next season 3, and I must say, I can not believe it's canceled - I will not spoil you - but it would swing! I also think that there are many potentials as a movie (although at this moment it seems unlikely). As evidence of my obsession, Mak's Barcode number is 332960073452, and for two weeks I had, I'm 3 episodes away from seeing both seasons twice. It's too good.
