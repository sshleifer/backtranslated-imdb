A film / documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. From this follows what they do and maybe more what they do not do. The tempo is very quiet ... so you have to relax ....... to breathe ... to breathe before you see it ...... First I think .... but nothing is happening and you are a little angry at it .. and that's the problem, because the mood of the movie and really nice socially realistic pictures that are good in this movie ...... ..... a lot of people will say its disgusting ...... but not so bad ... I think it is more used for marketing .... and there are some really funny moments ... the old woman stripping ..... I guarantee her the most unpleasant stripper in the history of the movie ... his movie that is real ... we Slim that this is ... right in your face ... ... and it makes it a bit scary. Computer manipulation here ... her real life ... and as we all know movies I can win the reality when it comes to doing sick things .... so it's much worse in the real world ....... If you spend a movie you can begin to watch your neighbors and think ... maybe they are like a face in a movie ... I bet they have a lot there ... sick ... crazy people who live with a beautiful facade ........ after I've seen a movie, I feel it's more interesting Look at my neighbors ija ........ <br /> But maybe you should not watch this movie at the first meeting .........
