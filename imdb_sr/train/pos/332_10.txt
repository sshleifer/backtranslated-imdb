Although I have not seen this mini-series in over twenty years, I still remember how the balance between characters, complications and stories of marvelous adventures succeeded. The use of special effects was restrained in creating a more poetic rather than a literal story of a story. The two versions I have seen have been called (English and French), but actors seem to speak their language, not only Italian, so there is a problem of synchronization. That does not spoil the story. Among actors, Irene Pappas like Penelope is most recognizable for North Americans. It is recommended to all the followers of Odysseus's return.
