After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should ever show such an idea in order to imagine that he would ever be able to approach the portrait of Mr. Jeremi Brett IS Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion there can be no other. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I have to admit, others, but still others. It could be argued that Mr. Rathbone's scripts are inferior to the absolutely top production produced by Mr. Brett and I would agree on that. However, when everything is said and done, Jeremy Bret will always be the only actor to truly become "Sherlock Holmes" forever. The book should be closed on this topic, and we, the public, have left us to enjoy the unique performances of Mr.Bretta. Bill Rogers <br /> (sonarman65@iahoo.com)
