"Hate of the minute" is probably one of the better movies that come from Michigan in recent years. Not to say that it's a great movie in any way, but it's certainly worth watching. "Hate" records the rude adventures of Eric Seaver (played by director Kallio), previously abused the child upstairs, and begin to listen to his evil side. "Hatred" is very beautiful visual. The recordings are creative, and the lighting is pretty curious and interesting to watch. This film actually has an element of production value for it, as opposed to other recent Michigan issues such as "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies". Subtle dolls and stylized recording composition show good use of the budget of this movie in the amount of $ 350,000. . Basically, things just sort of happen. Eric Seaver does not develop at all. Basically, he was always crazy, only people began to notice. The film just walks on its cheerful path with very little development. Also, the end is very fast. However - since this is a movie about horror, since we care about complications? We just want people to die, and "hatred" certainly brings. As the number of bodies rose, people in the theater began to cheer: "Kill her, kill them all!" When people scream on the screen, it's always fun. It is a place where "hatred" thrives. That's fun. And in the end, that's all that's really important.
