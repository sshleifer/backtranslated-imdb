A fragment in the life of one of the first female painters who achieved historical glory, "Artemisia" tells the true story of the passionate aspiration of a young artist for the artistic expression and the changes she encounters with. The film contains lavish costumes and sets and a good actor and actor. However, she is intricate in an attempt to portray the esotericism of art and time and is not inspired by the presentation of the passion of the artist as painted on canvas and explored through her engagement with men. A good movie for those who are interested in Renaissance painting or film about periods.
