Unqualified "10." The level of writing and acting in this Australian film reminiscent of the best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Mary Streep are very good together. Neill responds to the Streep line for the line, and takes it for taking - it's one of the best showcases of his wonderful acting talent, and he's in his sexy and gorgeous best, regardless of the intensity of his role. This fascinating movie is a treat for every movie lover who loves a dramatic courtroom, portrayed in most human but non-sensational terms. The film - which won several top awards in Australia - can boast not only superlative actors and directors, but also wonderful and authentic Australian locations. This proves that people are the same in the world. And after all these years, people still enjoy the repetition of the famous Streep line, the accent and everything: "Dingo ate my grandma!" Including that imp "Elaine Benis" on "Seinfeld".
