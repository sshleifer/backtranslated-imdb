And a pretty unexpected line of complications - for the era: there is a Plague in New Orleans - and only Richard Vidmark can stop it! Elia Casanova brand: rivers, workers, crowds, fugitives, blue collar, violence on the buttocks - all shown here. Zero Mostel, as Dom Delouise, made a big mistake, but he certainly watched as his goal. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes, a tough, cool woman - I thought she and Vidmark were a convincing couple. It is conceived as a compliment if anything. I've never heard of this movie, and yes, you have to admire Vidmark's performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas - it seemed to play that role many times, they make an incredible but effective team. The plague is by itself McGuffin - and you have to know that it was not exactly done in order to be in real life - less, at least not? - but I found out that he was carrying the shop well. See this. Good. *** outta ****
