I did not want to watch this show. But I'm glad I did. Critics of this simply do not understand! It's one of the funniest and fun stuff on TV at this moment! Although, when interviews were conducted with ordinary people, they probably looked useless; But, put them in the mouths of animals and insects, and this is a rebellion of laughter. I laughed so much that I had tears in my eyes. A pig with babies sucking and her mother is invaluable. The birds of a husband and wife talk about health problems, and a male bird who takes shit after a woman says she is constipated completely broke me! Creature Comforts is the most eminent show I've ever seen! I hope he returns next summer when this race is over.
