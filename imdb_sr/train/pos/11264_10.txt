This was one of the most entertaining and informative shows I've ever seen. This must be seen for anyone over 16 years of age. This broadcast from me and my 2 boys laughed out loud from the beginning. I do not know if everything was true in the show, but the way it was shown did not leave any doubt that Mr. Vuhl was not only very familiar, but he also had an explosion that presented this information to very happy students who were present. If Mr. Wooll ever decides to re-make this format, he will have to rent a building of the size of the Georgian dome to keep all the people who will want to see it. I agree with the idea that this is an HBO series. It would have an amazing follow-up
