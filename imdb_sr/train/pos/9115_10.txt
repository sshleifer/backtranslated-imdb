The idea is a very short film with lots of information. Interesting, fun and leaves the viewer to want more. The producer produced a short film of excellent quality that can not be compared to another short film I saw. I rated this film at the highest possible level. I also recommend that this be shown to managers and business people in any institution. From this comes the fact that people with ideas never listen, their voice is never heard. It is a lesson to be learned from any office that wants to go ahead. I hope that the produced product will produce the second part of this 'idea'. I'm looking forward to watching the sequence. Once again, we congratulate Halakah on the media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.
