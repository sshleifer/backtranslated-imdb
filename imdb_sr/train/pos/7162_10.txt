This is one of my favorite films of all time. I read the book and I like it, but this film expands everything that the book made famous. The acting is fantastic, especially from Jon Voight, played by Mr. Sir, a very bad character. This movie has a certain way of telling you that keeps you in the circle, all the way to where it's all gathered for the big end. I also love the way in which it is directed, flickering back and forth between modern days and the story of Stanley's ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for the film, and Andrew Davis is doing a great job. I certainly recommend this to everyone who enjoys good movies.
