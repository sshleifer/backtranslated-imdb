I agree that the Capital City should be on DVD. I only saw this show accidentally in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Sakon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working abroad in London in the financial change industry. I loved Rolf in that role and I liked every other role he was in. I can not believe that the show lasted only 13 episodes. I loved Villiam Armstrong as Hudson's brilliant charming friend in the series. When they broadcasted this show in New York City, it was always late at night or at a time when it was out of work. The show is less than an hour. I felt that this show should have lasted longer, but the changes in casting in the second season really made shov a little less interesting. I do not care about Silviu, but I missed the actress, Julie Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this performance a chance and it often worked. They showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. American characters were not arrogant or trying to outstrip their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they tried to internationalize acting teams, not to make them British. I loved watching Julia Ormond in the early role. I felt that this show should last longer. Sometimes I felt that the shows lasted as much as the show in less than an hour. They could transfer actors to New York and it would be a hit in America.
