This film is about the development. People are growing and people are fading, people are surprised and people are disappointed. It has more and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hatred. It's a really classic drama that has fantastic performances from the entire actor, but especially Vhoopi Goldberg in her debut. be obliged every Saturday in all prisons in the world - touch your compassion. Rating: 10 out of 10. PS: I admit: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene.
