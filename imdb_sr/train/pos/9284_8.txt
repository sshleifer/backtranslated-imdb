This film is described as a comedy, but it was not at all a comedy. Like every other film from Panahia, it was a very realistic drama showing a common thread of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; much lighter than the director's dark and serious circle (my favorite Iranian film). The power of girls and the joke between them and the soldiers was quite convincing (as if it were a documentary) and quite ridiculous. The shooting of a real match and the result was amazing. He added realism similar to Keni in Australia, of course, a completely different film. Appearances of all non-professional actors? soldiers and girls? were very credible. It was very touching to see the passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks that Muslim girls in a tent are different from their daughters, should see this film? It will be a real eye opener. For me, the soldiers represented the current paradigm. They started officially responding to standard official policies for all girls' requests. As the film progressed, it was increasingly difficult for them to maintain that position. When everything that looks like Tehran breaks into wild celebration, everyone is trapped in it, and the ridiculousness of the current policy is obvious to everyone. It was a very mobile and unexpected end, and gave the movie a really nice blend of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Although the movie is about adults, I think kids of the mature spirit of about seven years really appreciate this movie (as long as they can read subtitles). It is interesting that a repressive country like Iran is capable of producing such films as Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps the restrictions imposed by directors there must be extremely manageable. Australian (and other) filmmakers could draw a sheet from their book.
