In 1994, I had a really long holiday around the 4th of July - something like 17 days in a row, with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and holidays. At that time I stayed in the city, I hung a lot in my parents' house. I did not have the TV in my apartment, so I watched the tube tube. I just finished watching the segment of Ks files when the program appeared under the name Personal FKS. I'm hooked right away. I have always been fascinated by the objects in our home that came from the family homes of my parents and the inheritance of relatives possession, and I often wondered about their history, values, and so on. After my long break I went to my house for lunch only to catch FKS. I recall one episode during which hosted by Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed and updated and that one reconstruction had been completed in order for the Personal FKS to return to air. It's never been! Personal FKS was the first and best of the collector's shows. And he disappeared from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still in pain. So, FX.
