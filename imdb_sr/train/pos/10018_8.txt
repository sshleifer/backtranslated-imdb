This night listener is better than people ever say. It has weaknesses, and it seems to have a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but I think it's a nasty atmosphere and intriguing performances to make up for it. The whole thing feels like one of those fires "this happened to my friend's friend" stories of ghosts. One big complaint to the movie is pacing: but slow and sometimes unpleasant pacing is intentional. Everything that is happening in this film is kept well in the domain of opportunity, and real life is just some kind of problem? So, there are no glittering ends or unraveling on the ground, there is no "shovdovn" scene. Thank Heaven. You must enter the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a (usually) good movie. Villiams is not great, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character should be somewhat generic ("no one") because he is Everiman, an avatar with which we ourselves enter the story. The performance of Tony Collette should be nominated for the Oscars (even if he might not have won). Try it. For the quality and content, The Night Listener is surely the first twenty percent of the films that are coming out these days.
