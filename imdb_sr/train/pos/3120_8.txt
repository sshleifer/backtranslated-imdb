Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for the end! I heard that many people complain about the way this movie was made, and some even compare the style of the camera with the Blair Vitch Project. All I have to say is ... are you kidding me? Come on, it was not that bad at all. I think it helps action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would rather like than highly styled choreography. As for the rest of the film, I really did not even notice it. You can say that Damon really felt comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, but in this case it's a really good thing. Really becomes Jason Bourne in this war. Damon also has great support for Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was an excellent addition to the acting team, adding even deeper secrets to the CIA. character development in all this. This film is far above the other two Bourne films and is definitely one of the best movies in the 2007 season!
