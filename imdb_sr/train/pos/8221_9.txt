Sudden impact is the fourth of the films about Dirty Harry and one of the best features of these films is that they do not degrade quality from one movie to the next. So, Sudden Impact provides another exciting ride through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time Harry is trying to solve a series of murders while on holiday. Harry's always at work. Clint Eastwood plays Harry while playing all his action men, slowly, deliberately and without fear. As the first Dirty Harry film to be filmed in the 80s, Sudden Impact is missing the feeling of the 70s that feature the first three films. This does not mean that quality is lower. The bottom line: full of intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another decent addition to the Dirty Harry series.
