You know the story - a group of brave uninvited enters a competition that seems to have no chance to win - that's the story Hollywood has done to death (Bring It On, Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Best etc.). Now Korea is going with the Taekwondo team fighting for glory? and guess what ?? The result is predictable, but ultimately satisfactory. The fact that this movie does not fall on your face is up to a talented young actor who really takes care of the characters, which in turn keeps looking until the end. Fans of your typical martial arts movie can be disappointed? Taekwondo does not bring ordinary rollover movements and acrobatics seen in most Kung Fu films; Action is limited to (though impressive) hitting and occasional hitting. It does not matter, however, because the interaction of characters and their struggle to make something of themselves make this film a success.
