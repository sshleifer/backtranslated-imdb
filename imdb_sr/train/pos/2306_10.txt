I've never heard of Man on the Moon until I saw him last night at ONE HDTV. Look, my taste is like any other, eclectic. My favorites range from Blue Velvet to Dr. Strangelovea to The Ghost and Mrs. Muir through The Vizard of Oz and The Loved One, Eraserhead, Repo Man, and The Spi Vithin. is a superbly made, gentle, cordial, joyful and tragic film, beautifully shot, in which actors really live in a moment, not acting. This sweet story will soon be in our private library. This beautiful story of life in a far-finer era in rural Louisiana literally takes you to your pastoral ambiance. It's hard to stay stoka during the last moments of the film, especially when a young girl is in the measure in which the older sister heart disturbs private pain and forgives everyone. Instead of spoiling your enjoyment or bothering you with the dread of my boring prose, I will now complete this suggestion from a person who enjoys movies that speak from our heart. If you do not buy any other movie, buy Man on the Moon. This mobile story is one where you will enjoy again and again. It is a joy and a jewel, a film that is too scarce in this world of heart cure. The simple virtues that appear in Man on the Moon are a joy to watch. Paul Vincent Zecchino Manasota Kay, Florida April 05, 2009
