Arthur is a medieval rich kid drinking as a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says everything that comes to his mind. He loves to boast of his wealth and knows that he is a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he does not know and thinks everything is funny. Arthur must marry a high-class girl to inherit a great fortune, but she falls in love with the poor waitress Lisa Minnelli (it looks very strange). This is a damn funny movie. I watched this movie because it is a very famous Indian film 'Sharabee' based on the character of Artur. Although 'Sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'Arthur', I think these are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. It's very rough. There are so many fantastic lines in the movie. It's not a rebellion of laughter, but it has fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fianc√©e's father and he is constantly talking about 'bad'. Duddlei Moore is sure he has some comics. He is very good with words and body language. I liked the scene where he talks standing with a seated couple at the hotel about a small country and he constantly talks to his wife and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud won an Oscar for this film. I do not know that actor. I do not think he did a great job, but maybe I was watching more of his work, maybe I will agree in the future. The film has some flat patches, but not long. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel.
