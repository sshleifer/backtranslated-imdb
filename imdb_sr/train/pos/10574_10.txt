This is a wonderful movie. Continuous reading requires a few views to be fully evaluated. Musical productions of Busby Berkeley will never be duplicated. I think this film easily surpasses all his other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagnei are incredible together. Some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today's movies. Put a rational explanation of how they did it on the side and enjoy the spectacle as it is.
