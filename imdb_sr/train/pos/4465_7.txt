ANCHORS AVEIGH is a fun MGM musical that will be enjoyed by fans of this genre, but I would not rate it there with classics like SINGING IN THE KIÅ I or THE BAND WAGON. This was the first of three musicals in which Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared together. Kelli and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two Hollywood holiday sailors who meet with a young boy (Dean Stockvell) who introduces them to her attractive young aunt (Kathrin Graison) who fights for an actress who works as MGM. Although both are initially drawn to Grayson, she ultimately favors Joe, but Clarence later links with a waitress (Pamela Britton) who, as he learns, comes from his Brooklyn home town. A tiny plot leaves room for several great music numbers, including "We do not like to leave," Joe and Clarence, complaining to their fellow sailors while leaving the ship; Grayson's fierce saying of "The Blind"; Sinatra's Dream Performance "I Fall In Love Too Easi" (number unfortunately deleted from some of the prints of this film), and "The Vorri Song", a fantasy dance that Kelly works with animated Jerry Mouse from the glory of Tom and Jerry. Kelly also works with a kind of Kissing Bandit of a fantasy ballet that competes with his Pirate ballet at a later PIRATE. Kelly is here in top form, in a strong and energetic performance that has brought him the only Oscar nomination for the best actor, and Sinatra's sweety character here is undoubtedly sexy. Fun party for fans of the music factory MGM.
