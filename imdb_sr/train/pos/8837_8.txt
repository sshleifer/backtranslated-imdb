My personal feeling is that you can not divorce this film from its political / historical grounds, as many (American) reviewers do. It's not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It's about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the East and the West. Just as the guys were torn between Esther and everyone else, Esther was torn between Tovarish Joe and the guys. There is a shame in certain situations that are lost to an audience that has never lived under Tito. I think the film is underestimated and it's bad that we lost the director. Such films make freedom feel more important. It's not just "another Eastern European film coming" ... it's a sensitive portrait of teenagers walking with a fine line that could ultimately lead them to real freedom.
