Snobs and pseudo experts believe that this is "far from the best De Sica". Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will find the problem of connecting with this masterpiece. De Sica spoke in a very direct way. His Italian has no intricate self-examination of contemporary Italian filmmakers, or a bitter own parody of Pietro Germi, a sharp bitter-sweet Mario Monicelli, the severity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us stories like the father was sitting on the edge of the bed for children before they went to bed. There is no attempt at intellectualization. Miracolo Milano and to a lesser extent Il Giudizio Universale are real fairy tales, or what we call magical realism today. The movie is a gem from the beginning to the end, and Toto is the kind of character you accept with an open heart, but that of course requires that you have a heart. Cinema in the purest form. Magnificent.
