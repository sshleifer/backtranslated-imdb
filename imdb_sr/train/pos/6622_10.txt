I just went to the screening of the film during the Crescento Expression, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a short introduction. The film started and I was stunned from the first frame: a long, continuous footage of futuristic Paris in the magnificent black and white. I should not continue with the details because I think this movie is worth seeing. Sci-fi story can be found on average for many ... I was really good at it. The action is excellent, the camera is free to fly everywhere and think everywhere. Things you can not do or see are wonderful. The performance of actors is good, in my opinion nobody cares for the wrong note. Now, what I found is a brilliant animation. 3D graphic appearance 2D. He revived the BV strip. Background details give more texture as if it was done manually (I'm sure that it was, but when you change the angle you see the depth). The Producer Producer talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director, she says, is brilliant, but maybe she was pretty inexperienced because she had only one short film in her CV. So, many people had the true faith in them. They started their own studio from the beginning and since they faced the challenge they brought to them. Do not miss it. I think you will not regret ... maybe Richard Linklater for the ultimate look of this movie is superior to his.
