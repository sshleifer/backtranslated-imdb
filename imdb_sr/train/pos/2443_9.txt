This film might not put the Catholic Church in the best light, but it tells a story based on true events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, is beautiful and pink. Sometimes people and groups are doing things that at the time seem like the right thing, but in retrospect they do not look as good as they used to be. "Separated Love" tells the story of a family, it involves religion, but in fact the story is about the family and the ability of the family to stay together, no matter what is being cast away. This film is also based on genuine events that do not mean that this story, by the way, is true, but if you would look at newspaper articles from that period you could see that none of the churches had led an incident in a way that helped the family. Both churches are here to blame, a Catholic church that has imposed such a regulation on the family and does not respond to the violence that came with him and the Protestant church because she told her mother she should only bow to her husband and priest. not to be beaten. In this case, this family also fell. I believe this film works well in showing this fight both in the church and in the family. In no way does it form or form a Catholic church; on the contrary, it shows that an incident can change the course of the ideas of that religion and how one person can have an effect far more than self.
