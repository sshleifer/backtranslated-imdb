As the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although he was not released years later), this is worth watching. De Niro's role is not huge, but fun as one of two friends who first try to prevent the marriage of other friends just to get him later forced to force him. Any heavy De Niro fan will get a shot from the early performance of the undoubtedly best actor today.
