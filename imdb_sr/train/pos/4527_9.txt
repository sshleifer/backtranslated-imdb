One of the ten best comedy ever This looks like a comedy so happy and loud that sings. Keaton's comedies are brilliant, harmonious, intelligently arranged, he thought. Beautifully entertaining, deliberately beautiful and inventive, THREE AGES are supposed to belong to a draft of ten comedies if I would sketch one. A triple love story will impress spectators; I want to bring this approach. Keaton's comedy is like Lang's DESTINI upside down or A REBOURS. The pair again pass through the waters of time and the epoch in the Stone Age, in Rome and in Keaton's times, in a Muslim country, in Renaissance Italy and in China. The same device works in both films: one, dark, spooky melodrama; - Another, light, virtuosic comedy. In Keaton, in essence, is the same pair; and maybe it's the same with Lang. It's a beautiful baby that Buster and Beeri want. I found THREE AGENES well written and smart, not to be flattering; The plot is basically very POPEIE, like a baby piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the male rivals Keaton and Beera. One would be tempted to say this looks like an ambitious party, but it's not, but it's great fun, big party, enough fun. And Vallace Beeri is a good opponent.
