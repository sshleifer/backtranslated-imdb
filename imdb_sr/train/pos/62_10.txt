I absolutely loved this movie. I bought it as soon as I could find a copy. This film had so many emotions, and it felt so real, I really could sympathize with the characters. Every time I watch it, the end cries me. I can really identify myself with Phillip's busy character, and to feel the same thing happened to me. Do the same thing. I recommend this film to everyone and everyone. Especially those who are affected by any school shootings. It is truly one of the biggest movies of all time.
