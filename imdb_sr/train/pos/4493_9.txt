This is a great film about a traditional working-class family in northern England. Filmed at a Bolton site, starring James Mason as the father who is the dominant force in his home. Or it looks like that. Smartly, the film based on the show shows the complexity of family life. Supportive acting sets are great, and many celebrities support.
