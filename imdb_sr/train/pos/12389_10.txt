Boring with normal, Millions movies to watch this Halloween Night, which I watched over and over again, I took a chance on "Sentinel," hoping my horror juices would run again. I recall you, I just returned from watching the remake of the Dark Trap "Houses on the Faulty Hill" - complete and complete shit. Fortunately, "Sentinel" BLEV ME AVAI! In an exciting story about a model that moved to a creepy Brooklin Hights building, the film offered everything I hope to find in a good movie - (1) Camps and fantastic juicy characters, exchanges and dialogue, including chores by Christopher Valken, Jeff Goldblum and especially, Martin Balsam, as an absent professor - (2) Terrible terror! Not to give up, but there are scenes in this movie that cooled me down to pancreas - (3) Fantastic mountain, great makeup and wacky (if very uneven) direction from Michael Winner, which pretty well runs with this unrealistic treatment. If you love "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this will be your favorite queen. Just to emphasize my love for this movie - after I first watched it, I dropped my jaw, tipped it over and looked at it again. Now is one of the favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and check!
