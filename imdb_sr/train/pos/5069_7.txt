The film is more about a pony than a gray owl. It's also about native inhabitants, Canada, English, Gray Sove and North Bai Nugget. Great story. This is an excellent movie, more like a book, which raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The key scene is the Gray Owl which recognizes Ponya and her reaction. A few observations on user ratings. Keep in mind that user ratings are bi-polar clusters at 5 and 7; It's not for everyone, but it has strong monitoring. This film is underestimated and overlooked, but will be spotted for years to come. Also, few women watched the film, but they were judged by more than men. Is it properly sold? <br /> <br />
