I.K, in my opinion, is a cute, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fri) was really a boring guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more in line with Catherine (Meg Rian) than James. In any case, everyone who was involved in this film did an absolutely extraordinary job. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this sweet, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you, either to Tim Robbins or Meg Rian Fan who has not seen him. You have a lot of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, go back to your friend and watch it.
