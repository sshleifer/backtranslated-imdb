After the usual hunting scene, Jerry accidentally found himself in the bottle of invisible ink, which was part of the chemical set. He quickly reveals that he is invisible ... so that predictable results appear, which means he uses his new hidden condition to torture Tom. Jerry often defends himself, but often has a sadistic line in him that tortures a cat whenever possible, even when it is not provoked. disappears in front of his eyes, or milk from the vessel. Tom can not stand anymore and tries to sleep this nightmare, but Jerry burns his paw! Man, I hope that little kids have not thought about these cartoons of the 40s and 50s! I've always found Jerry, a little mouse, more cute than a sweet one. Fortunately, in cartoons, in general, whatever damage to character, there is no more a second and it returns to normal. The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of times when Tom discovers what a story with Jerry is, and tries to find out where the mouse is located (such as throwing flour) on the floor to see his footprints).
