My goodness. This film really shows the talents of actors. Billy Connelli bends his muscles. A truly incredible man, if you look at him in Absolution as a rebel, Boondock Saints as a madman / killer, and then finally into Fido like a zombie! His figure in Fidu looks like a cute, frightening, absolutely fantastic! Carie Ann Moss is not even a hack! Jumping in career from Matrix and Moment as a darker character, to a hearty housewife from 1950 who warms the heart! It's rare for these days to see that actors are not able to be so castrated. Now on the story (No Spoilers, do not worry). This film by Mack Brook (Author of the Zombie Survival Guide & Vorld Var Z) was happy with joy! Finally a well-made reversal of zombies and comedy. If you love zombies, if you do not like zombies, if you are bored, or if you are too busy, go watch this movie!
