As a person who asked for existence as a "professional" person with income supported by the BS from chemistry and MS in business management, my common sense has always been spasmodically maintained in outer forgiveness in things that are more artistic. My post-graduate studies were always emotionally and spiritually supported by photography, stained glass, ceramics, forging / welding metals and artistic drawings that included a silky screening. And I'm healthy. by running, walking and, recently, hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states such as Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking get one end of the Earth with time to stop and watch and listen and photograph or record sounds. Within this background, I was obsessed with RICH AND TIMES. I was equally impressed with the documentary content of the artist Andy Goldsworthy, as well as the skills and smoothness of the director / cameraman Thomas Riedelsheimer. Actually, I could not separate Goldsvorthi art from the Riedelsheimer camera path. <br /> <br /> Beautiful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
