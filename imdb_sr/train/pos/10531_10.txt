I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I reviewed the local Hastings because we had the need to rent something we've never seen before and came across this fine movie. We had no idea what it would be, but it turned out to be spectacular. 2 inches above. I liked the film being shot, and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think that I suggest you to quickly run into your local video store and find this movie. I'd like to tell you some of my favorite parts, but that could ruin your movie, so I will not. This film is definitely on my top 10 list of good films. Do you really think there's nothing noisy?
