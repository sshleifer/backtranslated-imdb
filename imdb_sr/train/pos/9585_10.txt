Wonderfully assembled .. I wish he was followed by this documentary that will follow the lives of some people and celebrate the lives of others lost ... it should be part of two ... real. He was great ... the movie was not long enough .. I would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow !! this is so important for a time in the community .. if you read this, please consider doing another such documentary ... I'm really tired of listening to naive writers how AIDS and men go together when they do not; in fact, its heterosexuals to look at ... this film did not even think about HIV or AIDS, and I was so happy about it. I really appreciated the omissions and definitions. Thank you very much for allowing this film to exist.
