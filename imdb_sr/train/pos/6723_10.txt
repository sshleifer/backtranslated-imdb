Riding gig is an incredible movie. It really shows how these people lived only then to surf. Their lives were basically surfing, living, breathe, and having fun. They did not care about money, work, girls or anything. For them were the waves of their girlfriend. I've never been on the surfboard and it looks so hard, I do not understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense. This is a great movie and if you like surfing then you should see this movie. If you are a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing, how it came to life, who is really known for it or what ever, then you really should see it. Maybe it's a documentary, but it's really good. -Tara F.-
