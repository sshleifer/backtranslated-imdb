This is a movie that has many things that only the Japanese can understand. Even well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. I guess he tried to send some kind of message, but that just wasted me. What I felt was that it was essentially a central movie with special effects. Some kid becomes "One" and in the end there is almost no importance to the iokai war that makes no sense at all. It would be nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between Azumi bean laundry iokai and those that look like a big tongued umbrella (Rihanna eats your heart!) I could not see the plot. Bottom line: beautiful pictures, the child is screaming, the river princess is awfully cute, and the rest is shit.
