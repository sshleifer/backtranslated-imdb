Many people hated this movie, but I'm guilty of two facts - 1 - They want it to be too much as the first couple of American films. and 2 - they are trying to understand him too seriously. The one I found is the best of all six, and I absolutely love the Dvight. The action is predictable, I will say it, but what kind of teen comedy is NOT? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds, etc. Etc. Everyone is incredibly predictable, but still damn funny! I say this is worth watching, I love him, I think he's ridiculous. Just do not look at it when compared to the first, because it's nothing like that. After watching Naked Mile and this, it became apparent that all American films were around, and only around the Stiflers. What is FINE menu. Watch out. Enjoy. Love. kD
