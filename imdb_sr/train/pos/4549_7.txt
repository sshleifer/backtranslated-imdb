"My left foot" is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of Christina Brown, an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with her left foot, the only one in her body that she had control of. Daniel Dai-Levis won his first Oscar for best actor for this film, for which I'm not quite sure he deserved, but still worth the attention. Dai-Levis gives Brovna a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, as Brovn's loyal mother, also won an Oscar for a compelling and touching role. My problem with this movie is that it is sometimes too realistic. When Brovn is desperate and has to help somebody and do all with his left foot, the movie is hard to watch. This gives him a often depressing feeling that can turn off some viewers for some time. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have a handicap and other difficulties that need to be overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and still feel that we have problems are inspired by this film, because if something with a much worse state than us overcomes their difficulties, we can certainly do the same thing. Well made, occasionally comfortable, but hard to watch. It can not be for everyone, but it's not bad at all. *** from ****
