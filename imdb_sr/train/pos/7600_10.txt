After I became totally dependent on Sik Feet Under, I did not think there would ever be another performance that would come near to being as good as this shov. Well, I made a mistake! Lost is spellbinding !! I absolutely love this show and I can not turn it off. The wealth of the characters, the intricacy of the action, the beautiful environment are amazing. I'm completely and totally hooked. I do not know how the creators do it, but every character touches me very deeply. I feel their joy, pain, everything, up to my core !!! I do not have a cable so I rented a series on Netflick. When I put it, I watch all the episodes at once and I feel sad when it's over. I can not wait for the next disk to get to my house. This is probably the best TV show I've ever seen !!!
