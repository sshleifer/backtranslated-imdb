This was probably one of the most perfect films of the forties - Varner Bros at the very peak of their style. Sol Solito is probably his best achievement - beautiful compositions and lighting with delicate shadows. Mak Steiner contributes to one of his most complex and most beautiful scores - the incarnation of his classic method of light motif. Music adds great emotions and excitement to the action and is remarkable and unforgettable. It is interesting to note that the same production team that made this film went right to the "New, Voiager" later that year - a fine film that won honors and awards and went as a historic favorite, ciefley because he acted Bette Davis. In my opinion, "Gai Sisters" is a much better movie - better made in all departments, and more interesting, more complex and pleasant. The most unusual movie entertaining those who take it for what they are, rather than designing their own contemporary creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Every thing must be judged in its own time and for what it is trying to achieve under its conditions. Most of the complaints I read in these reviews are so childish and totally omitted. If you are hungry with a perfect mint fillet, do not go to the baking table and start to whine and complain about cakes. The art of film criticism is indeed lost on a large part of the population. We're sorry, maybe if this movie had Rolling Stones scores and hundreds of intricate sublots searching for the soul, you'd all be happy. I'll take the old movie without modern intellectual pretensions day after day!
