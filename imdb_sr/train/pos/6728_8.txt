I came across this movie on the cable and I was completely hooked. The story of a group of surfers traveling in great waves, waves that are monstrously huge, waves that would make a rational person escape terror is one that manages to be spectacular and understand why people spend their lives in search of waves. There is nothing special about the film, except that it brings together some very interesting people who are in love with what they do and allows them to speak. Surely there are scenes that surf, but what makes this film so special are people. There are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do and go over the people who watch. Halfway to this movie you will want to go and learn to surf. There are not a few documentary films that have managed to show the passion these people have and the ability of the movies to feel that this is an excellent movie. Look at him.
