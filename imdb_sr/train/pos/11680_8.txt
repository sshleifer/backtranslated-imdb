OK Clara Bov is a silent film from 1927, a spin-off Raina, with Bova playing a half-Hawaiian wild daughter of the local king of pineapple who falls in love with an old English engineer - Clive Brooke. I will compete with a local widow (Arlette Marchal) for his attention, but both women get a great surprise when his wife appears (Patricia Dupont). The predatory woman is ready for divorce until she finds out that she may be at the limit of wealth. The bow has speed. The bow has the ability to spare and has several great scenes: its opening bare baths, its hull in the grass skirt and the dog rescue scene with Bov and Brook who are doing their Stunts. Note: IMDb credit list is wrong. Film credits (from the DVD I have) cite Patricia Dupont as playing Haldane --- no Margaret Truak as mentioned on the IMDb.
