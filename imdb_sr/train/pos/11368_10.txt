Amazingly complex and well-made study of the "First" serial killer in the USSR. At the time of perestroika this intense piece was brought to life with the advent of Stephen Reach and Donald Suterland. This test of Cicatilla as a killer is well rounded and suggests some of his behavior. While it is properly portrayed to others, there is subtlety that is convincing, without the graphics being open. Not for the bad heart, however, because the theme of the subject is often disturbing, but is necessary for its full development of the main actors in this fact-based story. HBO has equipped us with a great movie in an unusual way. I congratulate the director and editor of this great work. That's in my Top 10 list.
