I loved this film, because it seemed to me so perfectly caught up with what I imagined that life in French colonial Africa had to be like in the 50s ("my" generation). But I was really thrilled with his quiet rhythm and a glorious ending. In the last 5 minutes of this film, you have to focus carefully on what's happening. I have never been impressed with the "final work" of the film. I remember shouting "wow!" when I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the couch !!
