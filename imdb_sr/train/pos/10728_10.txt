Perfect spatial fantasy movie. a group of children accidentally go up into space and have to withdraw, but are they sure that it is. Then everything will be sad. You do not want Kate Capsav, the leading lady gives the Golden Globe, but unfortunately, neither she nor Lea Thompson have won. That's so bad. I can not say that enough, this film is so beautiful, Lea Thompson's Lord, the perfect girl for this movie. This film is certainly the best. I'm sorry, but better than Star Vars. Star Wars are so overburdened and the Spatial Camp is so underrated. It should have been reversed Excellent 10 / 10- 0r maybe 11/10. It's not good in mathematics
