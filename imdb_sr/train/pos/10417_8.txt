"The Bag of Baghdad" is impressive in the form of the sorceress of the Magyar Magician (Conrad Veidt). He plans lies and magic spells to get the kingdom from his real ruler, young King Ahmed, and the beautiful princesses from her father ... He ultimately becomes a victim, like all tyrants (in books and legends) love and the common man whom he ignored, here embodied by a small thief (Saba). The army of good and evil, black and white, are topically executed in both visual and literary terms ... The script is poetic, simple and very beautiful ... Costumes of magicians and his people grow and fall like wings of black birds, suddenly attacking at night to destroy and create terror ... The brilliant hero wears white turbans and dresses, and his princess is dressed in pink and pale blue ... For spectacular scenes, it matches everything that was before, while using color has brought to life a world that it did not seem possible before. .. Flying carpet and flying white horse, with a giant spirit (excellent Rek River game), with evil sorcerers, and with good acting Saboo and Veid, "Bag of Baghdad" captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Arabian nights ... <1940 version of the year remains the best fairy tale on the screen!
