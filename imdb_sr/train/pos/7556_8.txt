Okay, that was a pretty good episode. Much better than the loan it gets. The camera's operation is wonderful. Still the best. I love that last blow. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great, and the guests (without helpless victims) are strong. What I do not like in this episode is that many of the things that have remained unexplained. why is it changing sex? What is the purpose? and aliens? what? why were they never shown up in later mythology? This episode gives high three. Another of my favorites, but the holes bother me. Still ... I will not let it destroy my party.
