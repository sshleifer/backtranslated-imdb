1985 was a good year for movies - maybe even great - but the one who missed the gong went a long way to persuade fans that the Oscar is just a little more than decorating for good party members. 11 nominations and no title: such was the contempt of the Academy according to one of its greatest directors; and the one who had to wait eight years before any prejudice prevented them from handing him a statue before allowing them to give him a list of Shindler's List, which is probably not so good (and I'm half -Polski). Br /> Do not misunderstand me, Schindler was a classic. And I do not even say "from Africa" ​​(which won that year); but this, in my opinion, was the class behind this: an epic story of the suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and I'm not a big circus. Perhaps it was music (super), or cinema (lavish), but more likely simply acting: Vhoopi, who proved to all of us that he is much more than a comedian; Danny Glover, for whom I have not heard before; and, of course, Oprah. Other is history; but, at that time: who knew?
