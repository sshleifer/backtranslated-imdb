The first and second seasons began to shake, with good episodes between the middle ones, and occasionally resorted to clich√©s stories. But when he began to set the universe in which he exists and began to develop his characters more, he became much more entertaining and entertaining. The main reason for this show is that four men are: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry sense of humor seems to be much better, Peter's direction is great and makes each episode much fun, and Joe & Paul never succeeds in making a fun and interesting episode. When you get to know what's going on and get to know the characters, I doubt your show will be a favorite. For those who are in the show, I suggest the episodes "The Other Side", a good serious episode, and the "Window Opportunity", a classic comedy episode.
