I saw The Blob a few times and is one of the better films from the 1950s alien invasion. The strange meteor is right in front of a small town and an older man is going to explore this. A strange substance resembling a stomach, then fastens to one of his hands, and the young couple who saw the meteorite arrive on time and takes him to a local doctor, where the old man then absorbs the mass. The doctor and his sister are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not trust a young couple and accuse them of inventing it all. They finally believe when the mass, now huge, appears in the city cinema, and everyone enters the streets and screams. Then he fastens for dinner with a young couple and some other. The blob stops by spraying the burden of the firefighters on it and freezes, which is its weakness. Then it is transported by air to frozen waste in the Arctic and dumped there. But it's just frozen, not dead ... This movie has a typical setting for a period: teens and a small town. Blob has a good rock and roll style song at the beginning and the film is atmospheric. Continued, beware! Blob followed in 1972, and the remake came in 1988, but this is the best Blob movie. The actor was led by Steve McKueen (The Great Escape) and the movie that made him star and Aneta Corsaut plays her girlfriend. I do not know any of the other stars. Blob is indispensable for all fans of science fiction. Fantastic. Rating: 4 stars from 5.
