Revenge of the cameraman is an unusual short story, not because of a theme (adultery) or because it is animated (Vinsor McCai has so far introduced Little Nemo in the movie), but because it shows mistakes to tell the story! Ladislav Starevicz initially wanted to record real bugs fighting but could not get them to do it on the camera because of the hot lights they suffered and he took the dead and started using stop motion techniques to manipulate the movements to his satisfaction. This short work represents a good job of putting human characteristics on small creatures such as riding motorcycles, painting, shooting, kissing and dancing. Starevic would also be made by Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first significant job would be this. If you are interested in this and other short films, check in the local library to borrow DVD The Cameraman't Revenge and other fantastic stories from the entertainment picture.
