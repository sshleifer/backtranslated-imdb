Train Ghost is a treat for those who value the typical humor of 1940. It includes the Second World War in a plot, but not as much as I originally believed it would, and the characters are a unique mix that plays their roles pretty well. Askei, playing the role of Tommy Guner, is what illuminates the story of parts that could have been portrayed as annoying or "drawn." daily standards. It's unique and the way characters communicate with everyone is fantastic for the revival of the mystery that is the Spiritual Train. Gander is basically an obstacle to all other members, while the others are well-balanced. He is always at the center of attention and can be called "boring", but those are those who do not value humor from 1940. His humor is innocent and childish, making him cute for watching. If there was no Askei / Gander, then this film would be shorter in action, enjoyment and the result would not be so effective my opinion.
