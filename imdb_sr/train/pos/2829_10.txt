No doubt, Private Lessons II is the biggest movie I've ever seen. Japanese imports (poorly) translated into English, it's a joy to watch. Not much does make sense, but that does not matter. It's the greatest comedy around, and it has never been deliberately funny. The film is scarce and inaccessible on the video, but I caught it a while late, late into the night on the cable network. My copy of the recorded material was viewed on dozens and dozens of times as I slowly, per person, present this movie jewel to the world. Joanne Pacula plays a tutor / lover Ken, our hero. (Apparently she just worked for her check.) Ken plays Goro Inagaki, a Japanese pop band SMAP, who gives him everything and has great hair through the film. Stacy Edwards, from the "In the Compani of Men" fame, appears in the film and is probably happy to find another film later. It takes at least three views to understand what the plot is. When watching, you can enjoy elements such as the abnormal amount of vases Ken has in his home (at least 50), or that Ken wears a fine shirt with an embroidered corn shell. The film is predictable, but highly quoted. My friends and I are creating the whole scene again. Yes, it sounds like we are poor losers and we are ... but we are losing losers who have seen "Private Lessons II". Be one in ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You will thank me for that.
