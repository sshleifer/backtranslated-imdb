I really liked this movie because I have a husband just like the guy in this movie. This film is about Lindsey who meets Ben in the middle of winter when the baseball season is not. It's a funny movie with all baseball obsessions that Ben has. He can not detach himself from what he loves most, that's what makes him so ridiculous and why so many women can connect with Lindsey in real life. And the people he sits on baseball games are as obsessed as he is.
