This is a documentary that I accidentally met on the British TV Channel More4 and I have to say that it was extremely interesting and challenging. I will also look for a book that was the original material for this documentary. Basically, this is the theory of Professor Jared Diamond about why certain parts of earthly societies have advanced and others are not. The argument he presented was new to me and he was discussing how the happiness of the right crops and real animals, where he is able to indulge in, is certainly convincing. As far as the documentary itself is concerned, it is well recorded and well translated, not in most reconstructed scenes that spoil many modern documentaries. Diamond also helps to not obey, which is the fault of many intellectuals when trying to transmit message to the masses. People argued that his theory is Marxist, but I do not buy it and I see it more sociological geologist. It was also refreshing to hear the theory of the evolution of a society that is not based on religion. Recommended viewing.
