Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Harkova talk about the Chinese spirit, despite being one of the biggest films ever made in Vukia piano, is a beautiful and romantic love story, as well as an impressive choreographed martial arts film that should belong to the collection of every movie lover. A very missed superstar in Hong Kong Leslie Cheung plays a traveling taxider who spend the night in a haunted temple. While staying in the temple, he meets colorful characters including the Ian (Vu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, Tree Devil, and the wonderful spirit Lit Sin Seen, played by the wonderful Joei Vong. In order to free him from the devil's evil claw, he must reincarnate his body and travel to the underworld to win an even more powerful demon. A lot of good things can not be said about this movie. Pacing is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the feverish finish finals should leave you with a bit of a chance to breathe. Chemistry between the beautiful tragic Joey Vong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended too soon) really allows the viewer to feel both. Actually, acting in general is so lively and full of life, I would say this is one of the funniest viewing experiences I've ever had. Mu Ma's contribution was given to Wu Ma in his portrayal of the mysterious Swordsman Iin. His superior person of the disappointed hell of a sword who was trying to destroy evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional HK drama. Divine scores, rich cinema with brilliant colors and frenetic action pieces Ching Siu Tunga round off this beautiful film. Find a copy wherever you can. 10/10
