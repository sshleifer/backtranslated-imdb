Although Cinderella is not an obvious choice to continue, I love Jaka and Gusa so I did not hesitate. The format of the mice that wrote the Cinderella book was inspiring. I enjoy writing the story and I hope that the children will be encouraged by it. The three stories are sweet and fun, although the songs are forgotten. Jake and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also enjoyed seeing Lucifer, Bruno, Mike Choir and everything else. Pom Pom turned out to be the perfect companion for Lucifer and I loved Guverness. A continuation made for a change. My rating 8/10.
