Atlantis is probably the best Disney movie I've ever seen for years. It has an excellent action scene, magic, intelligent and colorful scenario. Atlantida, returns the magic of Disney classic, such as the "King of the Lions" or "Alladin". After watching this, I'm sure this year's summer blockbuster season will be great. I recommend to all of you, "Alantis: The Lost Empire is like breath of inspiration." /> 9 of 10
