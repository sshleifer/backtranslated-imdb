One of the best films by Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Excellent music by Irving Berlin. Strong support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betti Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allvin. The incredible songs include "Let Iourself Go", "Let's face the music", and "Let's put all My Eggs in one basket." The last song was presented by Astaire playing jazz piano and then a sweet dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings "Let Iourself Go" with Grable among reserve singers. "Get Thee Behind Me" is a song that is held with you for days. She also sings "But where are you?" Snappi and fast pace, this entry into the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best. The classic and incredible finale, "Let's face music and dance" is among the most famous numbers. Rogers wears one of the brilliant dresses in the history of the film ... a glittering number of spangles that swing around her legs while dancing (burdened edge) and also is a bit seen. Wonderful. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters made again in Pennies from Heaven. Luckily, he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball had bigger parts in 1936, but have several scenes and have little impact. Allvin has a bigger role, but it's OK. Rogers has one of his best solo numbers in the series "Let Iourself Go" .... Jazzi and thumping, it's a great song. /> Have fun all the way, although I've been tired of the "We've joined the Navy" for the third time.
