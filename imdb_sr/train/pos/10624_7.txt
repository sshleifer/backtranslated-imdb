I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. The film is not great, but it has many great elements. Lighting and scene together with camera performance are great. The story is slow and weak, but fun. The acting is bad, but not worse than you will find on the SiFi channel. The music is pretty good and the up is good. He has a great leather face in the film and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the entire movie, and while it was generally predictable, it was still pleasant. Women are sufficiently attractive and the main actor is doing his job well so that he is calm and dreadful. The film was extremely clean for a contemporary film, and violence was appropriate for children of 13 years. There was no sex scene. I gave her 7 out of 10 and I think that's fair. I would look at him again if I had nothing better to do. The angel who sounded like gay was the most boring aspect of the film, the devil is pretty creepy.
