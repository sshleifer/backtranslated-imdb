The series were short themes originally displayed in theaters in connection with a feature film that was associated with a series of pulp magazine fiction. Familiar with "chapters of chapters", they were expanded moving images broken into several segments called "chapters" or "episodes". Each chapter would be shown in the same theater for a week. The series will end with a pistol, because the hero and heroine will find themselves in the most recent dangerous situation from which there can be no escapes. The audience will have to come back next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape again and fight the villain. The series were particularly popular among children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday in movies included a chapter of at least one series, along with animated cartoons, motion pictures, and two feature films. > The Golden Age for serial publications was 1936-1945. This was one of the best in the era. Zorro was seen in many films, but Reed Hadlei ("Racket Squad", The Undiing Brain) was excellent in that role. The action is constant, and we are guided by a chapter by chapter to the ultimate goal where we will find out the identity of the criminal. Zorro triumphs, as always.
