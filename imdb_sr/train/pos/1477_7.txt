I watched this film on Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (because at the same time I talked to my mom in the law). Anyone can tell me what happened to her, and I watched her husband hear that someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom, and then she opened the door, she was already dead. Did she kill? How could she organize everything as phone calls while she was at home when her husband talked with this strange fan? I'm so curious! (I finally read that she suffered from the personality of Multiple Disorder Personalities). Pre.
