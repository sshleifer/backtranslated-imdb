Clint Eastwood re-presents his role as Dirty Harry, who is on this occasion in the case of the avenger (Sondre Locke) who kills people who raped her and her sister on a carnival many years ago. Eastwood plays a role that his and the movie is mostly more action than a story, not to regret it. Sudden Impact is a really fun party.
