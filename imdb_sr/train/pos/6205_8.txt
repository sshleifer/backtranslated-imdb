Perfect, angry and incredible, Fai Grim is hard to live, but Parker Posei is truly the only actress who could take this story and run with her. Suddenly it's touching, funny, tricky. Supporting actors also undertake to do so. I will not even try to tell you the plot. It includes characters from Hartley's Henry Fool and tries to talk about an international spy. > The movie works well if you continue with it - understanding it is. in a sense, completely funny. It's becoming more and more funny as you run. (I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice). Fai Grim requires an adventurous movie guest who is ready to get caught up with something that is not a cookie cutter. In the end, it offers something that defies the description.
