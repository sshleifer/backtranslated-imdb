For those who play video games here, did anyone notice that the GTA: Vice City Mansion is inside the game and some other things, including movie-related weapons that are related to this movie, and this film inspired the creators of the game (Rockstar Games) to copy some things from this movie and, by the way, this is one of the best 80s movies out there, I recommend this for anyone who has not seen it yet 10/10 without questions
