I saw it in "Dance with movies," and it was great. I really felt like Jake. Talk about adding insult to injuries! Not only have your parents divorced, but you are also a monster. It was both sincere and scary - there were a few moments in which the audience screamed in real fear. It kind of reminded me of a horror movie in Japan, except that the story was really good. And that's what separated the "Jake's Closet" from the usual indie movie puzzle - a great scenario with exceptional characters. Also, by mixing elements of a horror film with a family drama, the movie gets the best of both genres and avoids the clich√©s of both. If you do not come out in the movies, be sure to get a DVD.
