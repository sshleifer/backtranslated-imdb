This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I watched it on a DVD, and there are no special features on the disc, even to me, but that's not necessarily what I care about. I tend to judge movies from case to case, depending on, among other things, if it is a large studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller movie and I am ready to forgive a few things. That's what he said, I think he has one of the most fantastic and original title sequences I've seen. I enjoyed the acting of all the main players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has the most funny lines. The character portrayed by Claire Forlany may appear unrealistic for some people, but I personally know real people with emotional problems that easily look at life's decisions as well as her character. This helped me pick up the nuances in which her injuries could pass through the facade of her humor. This is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does NOT include in free sex and nudity. There is little adult language, but sometimes it can be very fun. (Especially, the figure of Alan Arkine, who can not swear in the right way.) Also, beware of the names of famous actors.
