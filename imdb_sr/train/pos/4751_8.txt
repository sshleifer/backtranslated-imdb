I have no idea why this film is so bad by many IMDb users (some say it's his worst movie ever.) What? Did not one of you see Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is completely stupid, and only an excuse to hang all the action sequences. Ghost! What did you expect from Jet Li film? Did you honestly believe that someone came up with a story, and then just filled it up with the action? Of course not! The black mask is excellent, from wall to wall, almost for the entire duration. It is also tastefully terrible, and we get many cut limbs, broken heads, and creative ways of looking at bad guys (and a few innocent people!) Who are slaughtered. Most of Li's other martial films are in a children's school compared to the Black Mask; there is no stopping on unscrupulous violence, bloodshed, or action sequences! And that made me happy. Again: if you enter the Jet Li film expecting a magnificent dialogue and an intriguing action, you go for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite in his films (however, beware of terrible recording).
