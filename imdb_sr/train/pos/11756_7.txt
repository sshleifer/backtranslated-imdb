The film did not go well at the box office. I saw it in a short overview. Always enjoyed the movie. I live in one of the cities mentioned in the film in which the previous players moved. It's not the best movie ever shown, but it's pleasant. Robin is well with his Role. Best line of film at the beginning, according to Robin's character Jack: "I've been that SOB!" Cleaned up here to offend no one. <br /> <br /> I was glad when the DVD arrived a few years ago in wide screen / letter format. I am not a fan of football or a real sports fan. But you do not have to be the one who loves this movie.
