On the winter of December 28, 1986, two boring 14-year-olds rent a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, it looks interesting," "Who's Jackie Chan?", "I never heard of him." Two hours later after watching the film, in a stunning style, we wanted to find out more. 16 years later (and seriously from the pocket of collecting JC movies!) The film still grip me like no other. Ok, maybe I have a soft position because it was my "first" (Cannonball Run does not count !!) JC movie, but it's a great movie. It has all the classic JC elements, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and Action! Some comments say that it was dated, made in 1985, of course it's dated! But then Javas, Casablanca, Singin 'in the Rain and Godfather !!!!!! Without movies like a police story, where Hollywood action would be today? PS sets standards, many scenes are stolen for use in other films. To truly understand it, you have to see it on a wide screen, otherwise it's missing out on the movie (yes, it really falls off the bus going around the corner!). If you have not already done this, SEE THIS FILM NOW !!!! <br /> <br />
