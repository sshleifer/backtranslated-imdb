- After their sons were sentenced to life imprisonment, Adelle (Debbie Reinolds) and Helen (Shirley Vinters) began to receive threatening phone calls because someone had fallen into their minds. The couple decides to move to California to avoid the publicity of the trial and start a new life. Starting a dance school that is very successful. One of the students has a rich unmarried father with whom Adelle quickly falls in love. In the meantime, Helen is busy raising hares and becoming too in love with the evangelizer on the radio. It's just time before everything breaks down, and women enter the world of madness and murder. - Can not I compare what's with Helen? Vhoever Slev Auntie Roo ?, also starring Shelley Vinters. Where this film seemed almost restrained in the presentation of Madonna Aunt Roo, there is nothing to keep Helen in the film. Maybe it will take a lot of time to show the movie, but when she jumps, Helen is one bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to mess with her. Vinters were so wonderful that I was not able to enjoy her performance. I will not spoil the movie, but the things Helen is capable of are completely over-the-top. - As well as Vinters, Reinolds is totally ridiculous in his role as gold. dancer. I had the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would force her to get some reward. This is not Citizen Kane! Stop being so serious. Hey, Debbie, do not you realize that the main purpose is to be the victim of Winters' madness. - I just love these former-female star-in-the-twilight-horror in their careers. What about Helen? It's fun as any other.
