This is one of the best movies by Jodie Foster, who is largely ignored because of a misunderstanding of the public as a teenager. She has wonderful performances, especially the battle between Jodie and her mother, played by convincing Salli Kellerman. Three girls who play Jodie's friends are a bit amateur, but I think it's worth seeing them.
