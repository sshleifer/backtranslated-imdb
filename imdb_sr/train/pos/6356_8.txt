I thought that Grinch stole Christmas pretty good movie. It was not terrible, nor was it great, but it was pleasant to watch. I felt as if Jim Carrei was a little boring on time. a person with special education, when everything was supposed to be evil and cunning, but still it turned out kind of retarded. Most of the time I thought it was just embarrassing. This movie could have been "SO" much better that they changed Grinch's personality, and included some other scenes of laughter, because most humor was not funny. I liked how Grinch stole Christmas, but it's nothing to excite you see him.
