Shirley MacLaine in the second role-to-measure. As a aunt to a single mother in the Chicago neighborhood of 1962, a veteran art actress gets another job as a brave woman who will not allow any refusal to defeat her spirit of success. Children, girls and girls of pre-teenagers, are attracted by their witty aunt Zoe, although many magic tricks and practical jokes have been learned from her, and applied to all the wrong options, they are eventually thrown out of school. The plot is cleverly captured in the Cuban rocket crisis, with all social implications. Men built bomb shelters, people watching TV shows about what looked like the only TV, restaurant, and general fog of discomfort and fear in the air. When the "harmless" miracle is thrown out of proportion, the climatic conclusion nevertheless makes the viewer good. Yes, Virginia, the sun will appear tomorrow! Clearly, this is a small budget production, this is still a sweet little film, filled with magic from which the Sunday matinees were made. With several "Oldies" choices thrown into Effective Sound Track, the whole family will definitely enjoy this.
