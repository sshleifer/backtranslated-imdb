From the very beginning, you see that "Anchors Aveigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a ridiculous team! Songs that sing together are pure entertainment. Kathrin Graison is beautiful and really sweet. Dean Stockvell is the lightest actor I've ever seen. If you love the piano, you will be surprised by Jose Iturbi. This film was the first to combine animation with real actors and it made it beautiful in an unforgettable dance number. No doubt one of Kellie's most entertaining films.
