Given the timing of the release, the story revealing in the thriller in 1950, "Panic in the streets" was hardly a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious immigrant is found and portrayed as no one until further examination by a public health inspector who claims that the body carries the strain of bubonic plague. Nevertheless, with today's drama in the world, this unusually helps this movie become credible for today's viewers. The actors and the crew are flawless. In his first role, Richard Vidmark, after his breakthrough performance in the film Night and City, Jack Palance in his debut film, played Paul Douglas and the young (and pretty sweet) Barbara Bel Geddes. The whole range of non-licensed, non-professional actors (typical of Kazan's director) fill in the remaining slots. Elijah Kazan directs Joe McDonald's films (later on will work with Richard Vimark in 1953, much superior "Pickup on the South Street"), and the great Alfred Nevman gets him. Almost everyone involved here has done a better job, 'Panic in the streets' is still a very valuable hour. Especially for film-noir enthusiasts.
