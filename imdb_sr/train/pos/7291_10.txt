When you are usually watching a short film, you are always afraid that the person who creates the movie will try to throw it too much. That's not the case with this. A great story about a young girl who had enough and other world powers that are trying to help make things right. A blurred line of the right and wrong. Young girl and father give great performances in this beautiful short film, but Eric's performance is definitely a thief in this story. > I definitely recommend this film because of its complexity, performance and great stories.
