A typical mess between Cheech and Chong's reality that includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, more drugs, Pee Vee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, stand up comedy, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !!. Not as coherent or as acceptable as Up in Smoke, but it's still incredibly funny, and it does not get as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes, which include an introductory scene in which they get gas for their car and driving to work. Funny is the song Chekhov (Mexican Americans) and Chong's song. Another important scene is the scene of a social work office with Jones (a sound machine), a police academy series and an old funny man. All in all, this is a great continuation of Up and Smoke and is quite visible when sober or not. Celluloid rehabilitation
