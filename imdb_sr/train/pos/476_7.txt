A brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with the woman who is there. By itself, it would be a pretty bad corner for the story. So there's more. The fact is that the chess player is totally alienated from the world because of his brightness in the game and the fact that there is some history that permeates the players. This film is moving back and forth from the romantic frivolity. at a tournament of tensions to historical events that have shaped the chess players and doing quite nicely. It's easy to grow in relation to the two main characters and it's easy to believe that we could work together like in this movie. The additional effect of the tournament is very good and creates a nice voltage setting. I have no idea about the power of chess players because I do not play the game myself, but it looks nice and convincing. All in all, the majority of the film is very easily reduced. And again it is very easily forgotten. That's why it's nice to watch, but nothing more than that. 7 out of 10 chess players caught between cannon and hard place
