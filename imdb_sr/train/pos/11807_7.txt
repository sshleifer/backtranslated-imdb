After I saw Dick Tracy at $ 6.99 in the Future Shop, I decided to run it without prior knowledge and I was a big fan of films about mafia and crime. I was very surprised when I saw a very fun, smart entertainment movie with solid performances. The movie moves well, of course, has another solid performance from Varenne Beattie, but the true features of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy when I learned that Pacino was nominated for his performance as a top gangster trying to demolish the city. Madonna was great as a girl in trouble, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you enter with the view that you want to watch a fun, smart movie with great acting and solid scenario, then try Dick Tracy. I do not think you will be disappointed. And watch the quizzes of Paul Sorvin, James Caan, Kathi Bates, and Dustin Hoffman.
