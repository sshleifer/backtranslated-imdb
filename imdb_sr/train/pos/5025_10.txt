Man, some of you have to calm down. This film was an art genius. Instead of looking for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality, why can not you understand that this is a work of fiction? Story. Fun, for God's sake (no intention of playing). It seems to me that too many people here try to be a film critic - and they do not do well. I am so impressed by the film and the work of Bill Pacton directed, that I will personally contact him to tell him. You know, if you did not try to analyze some of the stories, you might enjoy the movie. Me and all my friends!
