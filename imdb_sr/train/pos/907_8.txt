This film is a great attempt to revive traditional Indian values ​​that are replaced by the West. It is a common family story that shows all the ethics each person should follow while communicating with each individual cousin. it's about tying the knot with Amrita Rao, which is also very Desi and it also works pretty well ... The film's genre is the same as HAHK and such films deserve to be made in India to revive old traditional values. Movies do not get 10 because it's not very good in music that has a lot in every movie, besides being flawless.
