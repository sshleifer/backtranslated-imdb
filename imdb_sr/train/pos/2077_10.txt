This timeless proverb is in this film and in my heart. I've been waiting for this eternal story for so many years! Maybe I was not ready. It is possible that my sensibility would not appreciate his power. So with pleasure I now greet you with pleasure in my soul. Its now a legendary luminescence. But now I finally discovered the priceless gifts of the great talents of LUISE RAINER. Oh, how many faces can she talk like her? Some said that it was done from her quiet years, and that it was good, but her speech is eloquent enough when given a chance. She really deserved her Oscar. This film is in the epic in the most classical dimension. All parts are equal, necessary and perfect. They can go if they want, but avoid the narrative that remains with life. GOOD COUNTRY enriches it in a way that does not expect. But all this will not come from the joy that I have done. But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years. These are the expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with complete perfection. But, I dare that a million new films tell the story of the BUCK BUCK with such a shrewdness, strength, conviction and blessing. will never come near the aromatic scent that still stems from the core of this story. Time will not reduce this effort nor will progress improve its size.
