Star Wars: Episode 4. Star Vars ever. his first film I've ever Sean's bad guys beat and his very good ending. I really should have waited for Hing for the next stars, because in this movie there are things that you just need to discover in the last one. With many movies I always have the feeling that it could be a donderder, but not this one. and I'll never forget that the pieces were boots for Luk, he's his father. I also love Bob feat lik and hes back ground plaier. If you have never seen a movie with old wars, you will go to this. It is the best. Thank you Lucas
