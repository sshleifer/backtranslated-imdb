I ran through this movie at a local video store during their annual sales on the sidewalk. When scanning thousands of videos, hoping to find a few cartoon films, I came across this movie. I read the back of the film and I knew that God's hand was working for me to buy this movie. You see, I have a group of three foster parents (and will soon be adopted) who live with my family. Immediately my foster children established a relationship with three children who acted in the film. The film helped them to better understand their circumstances. For the first time, the oldest of the brothers and sisters (7 years / women) decided to open a little about my past and the tragedy she experienced. She fights the whole issue of trust. This is the first time I saw her crying. After watching the movie, I asked her what this means for a child to be adopted. She replied, "That means being happy." It has to take care of families that nurture children and consider adopting. That certainly opened up communication lines with us.
