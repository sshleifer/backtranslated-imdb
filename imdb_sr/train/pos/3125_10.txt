The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Reviev: After an exciting set of two, we get the final war. Here's my download: Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) at the door of those who know everything. He ran for too long. This time is over. Bourne Ultimatum has an excellent plot, great writing, fantastic direction, uncertainty and some of the best action of the year. Matt Damon delivers its best performance so far. He has the conviction and superstition of the murdered killer. There is some intelligent humor and some fine suspension here. Reactions to certain events will either make you laugh (in a good way) or cheer. (or both) I heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and a lot of applause. The audience worshiped it. Bourne Ultimatum delivers everything in a nice gift. All goods, and then some. This is, in my opinion, the best movie of this year. Last word: Excellent conclusion. Best of trilogy. This is how to do summer movie trillers. I love the Bourne trilogy.
