... but I still enjoyed this show. I read some of the comments that previous reviewers had to say about this show, and it's hard for me to completely undo all the criticisms in my head (except for one: the show was stagnant, but it got stagnant). Many things people bring about this show are on the money: pretentious; forcibly; overvrought; desperate for attention; self-satisfied; boring narration. But you know what? I really liked it. She was different, she was original, indeed, really tried; and that's what made up for all the minuses. The show was bright, verbal, quick, witty, interesting, fun to watch ... you know, it was only once a week, I could take it once a week and I'm looking forward to it and enjoying it. I'll complain about his death. But I guess it will not bring anyone back to life.
