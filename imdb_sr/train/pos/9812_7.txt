"Great Forgiveness" introduces us to the first holodec adventure, in this case, Captain Picard presents himself as a private investigator of Dickon Hill. This episode creates a kind of standard sample, which is repeated several times on TNG, as well as DS 9 and Voiager. After entering the Holodeck, something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under various circumstances beyond the gameplay (represented by the failure of the Holodeck Security Program). This concept is used to expand the Star Trek features and enable some kind of genre mix. The stories of Picard's Dickon Hill are examples of the 1940's criminal fiction and their representation on the screen is called Film Noir, often leading in the antichero stereotype (see, for example, Chandler's stories about Marlbo's or Polany's classic "Chinese Quarter." Star Trek Never focuses on the story (it's mostly a simple "how-to-do-it-from-here" scenario), but gives actors a different approach to their characters. These Holodeck "games" are usually used for recreation and reflect the private interests of members Therefore, the technical aspect is already established Neglected, and from that point of view, the stories are never sound (but did Star Trek ever have a technical, scientific point, do I think in addition to some utopian concepts?). "Great Forgiveness" shows the relaxed Patrick Stevart, McFadden which hardly looked better in the Star Trek episode (at least early), and Data also has some great scenes (although it's hard for me to believe that pulling the lamp off from the wall would really surprise him, due to the fact that he was researching that period and his customs). Veslei continues to turn tranquil Trekkies into potential killers (why did not they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters end it?), But all this is funny ...
