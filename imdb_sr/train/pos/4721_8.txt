A sad story about the fallen pilot B-17. Brady was shot down in the occupied territory. Local rangers expanded his kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives. I've never heard of this movie and it took me two hours. After the movie is over, I'm glad I took the time. That's the whole story to explain the look of Brady's face at the beginning of the film.
