The entry of Takashi Miike in childrens territory won me almost immediately because it shows nervousness and courage in working with elements of fantasy. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a kid, I thought there was something sinister around most fairy tales; Terrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike realizes that these classic stories are a bit more scary (and more disturbing) than they seem to be at first glance. The author of the film takes an archetypal story about a child on a miraculous path from a preschool classroom. He points out very real fears from the world filled with endless dangerous missions. Westerners like to diminish the seriousness behind the sleeping books written especially for children. I appreciate the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for a jugular story, but also shows signs of restraint. But Miike, who was himself, is even more weird than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Recommended.
