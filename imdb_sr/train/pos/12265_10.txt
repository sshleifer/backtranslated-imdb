"Tintin and I" were primarily impressed with me as a masterpiece. Photography and editing are really breathtaking (almost anti-dogma). We follow the life of Tintin's Tray Herge through an open interview of 1971. the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century. In the midst of these Herga has his demons with whom he has to fight, and much of his drawing activity seems to be an attempt to trample and escape into the world of perfection. Although there are spectacular photographs of the panorama of the drawings from Tintin's albums, as well as some reconstructions and reading of the passages from the album, the story of Herge is uttered entirely through interviews and archival materials, and never through reconstructions. a true, pathetic artist. But the fantastic world that came from his imagination will continue to amaze readers over and over again.
