Without being one of my favorites, this is good for changing the rhythm ... even in a few minutes. It all starts with a great fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (here it's renamed "Butch"). They all beat each other, but suddenly Spike brings a heroic and wonderful decision: stops the fight and suggests that everyone be friends. So, they all sign a peace agreement and become friends ... that will not last long. Meanwhile, the three become courteous, patient and kind to each other. They even survive when one of them is in danger of life. Relationships do nothing but excellent, until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy. The three of them are guilty of returning to their usual struggles and rivalries. But nevertheless ... to see Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is truly a wonderful and grateful experience, even for a while. Oh, by the way, as an interesting fact, two songs from the "Wizard of Oz" are played here in instrumental versions: "Let's See The Wizard" and "Somewhere Over Rainbows".
