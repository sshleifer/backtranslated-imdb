I remember seeing Sabrina for the first time when he came to TV in the UK at ITV1 when I was 13/14. I'm now 24 and I still love him now as much as I was watching for the first time. I got a little stick from some of my friends because I'm still watching "children's show", but I do not care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my favorite character and later Morgan became another of my favorite characters. I remember spending so much time watching various events in honor of Sabrine at the TV station Nickeleoden UK. I love Melliss Joan-Hart, she was great at Clarrissa Ekplaring All, but much better at this. I was destroyed when they decided to finish it! I hope it will soon be released on DVD here in the UK - I'll be the first in line! lol k
