The finals of the season sent a mix of messages, I felt a sense of joy, as well as a sense of lying and deception. Roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire nine seasons were a lie because her husband, Dan, died. She also admits that the family never got a lottery, and which season was a lie only if she wanted or wanted to be. I'm still confused when she said that Becky ended up with David, and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit they are pregnant. So I believe that she just wanted to be so, but she did not. So the finals of the season were good, but they felt mixed feelings. I will always be the fan of this show. :)
