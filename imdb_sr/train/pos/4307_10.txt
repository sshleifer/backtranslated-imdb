Well, maybe not just before Rodney King's riots, but even a few months before, there was enough time. My parents said they saw him and the next thing you know is that the police were released and LA burned to the ground. It only shows the state of racial relations in America. The action of White Mack (Kevin Kline) and African American Simon (Danny Glover) became friends after Simon rescued Mack's life in a black ghetto. In the meantime, film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that unreasonable violence is really cool ... until he shoots him. There is also existentialism in the film: Mack and his family realize that they do not live the way they really want it. this came out much earlier. Perhaps we will never be able to have stable relations in this country. In any case, "Grand Canion" is a great movie. Kevin Kline confirms that she is my favorite actor. Also starring Mari McDonnell, Mari-Louise Parker and Alfre Voodard.
