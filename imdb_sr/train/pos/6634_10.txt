How can you not rate this film with 10/10? I admit to saying that this movie is not really fun, but the goal is not to tell you the story but history! This is the first "real" film about the history of cinema ('only Prince de Galles' was the first, but it was not technically perfect?) And has undoubtedly great international value. These people you can see ending their working day in the film had the opportunity to participate in the historical moment, becoming the first people who were able to see themselves moving! And above all, the bullet is a wonderful shot! And it's very touching when you think of the first people who saw it! What a moment! First historical for science (because Lumiere brothers first invented cinema for scientific reasons) and for art later. Film for worship!
