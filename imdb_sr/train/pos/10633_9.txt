This movie is unique as it is foreseen ...... A different story is precisely this, it shows that from the need for survival or maintenance, one can find the ability to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind. That was the first time I saw it on cable television in the late 70's and really showed the gay community's constraints at that time. I believe this film was ahead of its time in showing a small part of the obscure way of life. It is truly a classic in the sense that it was the predecessor of what is now shown as an extended family. This film should be available on DVD / VHS so that only extra ordinary performances by Meg Foster & Perry King can be recognized, but to show how far we have come and still have to go where the issues are in question.
