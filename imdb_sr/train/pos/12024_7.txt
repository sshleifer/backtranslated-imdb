The good thing about this movie is to stand alone - you do not have to see the original. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest disadvantage. It would be nice to include several original characters in a new story and see how their lives developed. Sinclair, as in the original, is excellent and gives the best comedy moments while trying to deal with unpleasant and unpleasant situations, but the support is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsith should be congratulated on the courageous attempt to change the image and create the original sequel, but the film is ultimately flawed and missing the heat of the original
