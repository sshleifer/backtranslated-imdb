This is the first 10 out of 10 that I gave for any movie. What made this movie so good for me? Permanent action - no slow parts, great acting, smart writing. I also liked the style of shooting in which trembling and various angles just made you feel like you were part of the scene. In the end, I see an action movie that does not try to satisfy all sectors of the public (ie, No Compulsory Romance). . Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a little before you drive your car!
