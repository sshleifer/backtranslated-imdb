Although I agree that this is a good, but not an excellent movie, because of the many reasons that other posters mentioned, I still enjoy. One of the reasons is music: I would draw attention to the cool looks of Candoly - Conte and Pete - in a well-organized scene in the nightclub. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day, and they succeeded in convincingly interfering Jimmy Stevart's mind playing a hysterical trumpet duet, one trumpet in each of Stevart's ears. And Candolis really played well, although I doubt that real music for that scene was later called. I do not know much about George Dunning, who is responsible for music (except that he seems to have worked with Trio Stooges on more than one occasion), but casting Candoli brothers as jazz-varlocks was a really nice touch.
