It seems that this film is well remembered when Tom and Jerry signed the peace agreement. Things are idyllic for some time, but, predictably, it's sour. Probably the most memorable moment was an endless fight with pipes, a tug and a baseball bat, which included two dogs and Butch at the beginning and at the end of the short ball. I enjoyed one group and you should try to catch it on Cartoon Network.
