This film is a fun and extremely sarcastic view of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed with the photo that consisted of colorful colors and furnished settings, especially when you think this is the first ZukoviÄ‡ attempt. One warning, do not take the message of the film seriously. It's not for mass consumption (and that's not a compliment). The message is somewhat stylized post-college, a beginner's view of society. I enjoyed the basic line of the statement of the fictional 'zine' verbally whipping mobility of the nineties.
