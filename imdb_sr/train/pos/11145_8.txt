After racism, rural exodus - also known as migration from the country - is another socio-political issue of the sixties. VestSide Story dealt with racism with a love feast in an artistic way. Now Midnight Covboi deals with rural exodus with the tragedy of friendship in a psychological way. It has a deep end that testifies to the death of one of two destinies of destiny. Director John Schlesinger has skillfully delivered us deepest secrets of thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and estimates of two New York Citys. scums. While handsome Joe Buck (Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world praying for him to share a wild love fantasy, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in a clean and sunny Florida. Accordingly, Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money for migrating to Florida. In addition, Ratso helps Joe find a way to do everything he can. They start to share everything in their lives. They share food, share medicines, share uninhabited homes, share wages and share their destiny. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing that makes all the beautiful women want to have fun; Moreover, Ratso can not see Florida because his heart had fallen ill when he was on a bus that led him there. Power is always right, and Feeble is not entitled to daylight. From there, "Midnight" gives a factual view. In spite of the tragedy, Midnight Covbo does not have any melodramas. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inescapable destiny. Thanks to this, Midnight Covboi is a provocative look at the socio-political issue, the rural exodus.
