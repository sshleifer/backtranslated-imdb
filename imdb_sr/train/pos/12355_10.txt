I can understand those who do not like this movie cause of lack of knowledge. First of all, these girls are not geisha, but tenants in a brothel, and those who do not know the difference will not understand half. film, and certainly not the end. This is a complete artwork about the life and needs of women in this era. Everything is important, and certainly the way in which it is dressed, over the whole film means more than words. For those who thought it was a boring movie of geisha, I suggest you read a bit about this society before you make a conclusion that is so out of the realm. This is Kurosavin's work on life, and I'm sure the director understood the quiet meaning of Kurosavin's composition in the right intellectual range.
