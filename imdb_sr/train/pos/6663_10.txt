This film talks about a dysfunctional family, but not about any dysfunctional family. It is about the family of the Father of our nation (India), although the film focuses mainly on the alienated relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harryl Gandhi. This shows how Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life in order to realize our freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son tried to get closer, Mahatma would come between them. This is a beautifully made movie. Akshaie Khanna turned out to be a top actor. He was very natural expressing emotions. Darshan Jarivala, who mostly plays in the Plais-Gurukant Desai lawyer in Guru, beautifully portrayed Gandhi. (As a real human being, unlike Ben Kingsley who made him look like God) Shefali Shah, a girl from Monsoon Weddings, also did a good job showing how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son. This film is touching and its soundtrack "Raghupati Raghava" is singing in a very unique way. I saw this film just three hours ago (it was released in Dubai the previous day - 2nd), and when the film is over, "Pin Drop Silence" and while leaving the theater, no one pushed the other (can you imagine us Indians are not pushing us? ) NO ONE! It was sacred silence ...
