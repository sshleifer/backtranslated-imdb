I fell in love with this quiet action drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could play so well. Boiled from childhood to know nothing but war and combat, Todt (Kurt Russell) was thrown onto the planet after he became obsolete by genetically modified soldiers. born - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, not Schvarzenegger, not Bruce Villis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and makes it completely his own - original, funny and too human. I miss the fact that sequels are never made. 10/10 -LD <br /> <br /> _________ </ br> My Faith: http: //vvv.angelfire.com / ni5 / jbc33 /
