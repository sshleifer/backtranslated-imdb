In this small movie we have some great characters, but very shallow graphics. It's nice to watch because Singleton works perfectly on presenting esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. That's why the viewer forgets the non-existent realism that this film is supposed to be. In fact, here we have all possible clich√©s and stereotypes that are put on celluloid in a rate greater than that of soap. It's definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but better than an average film college.
