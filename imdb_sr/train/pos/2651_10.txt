That's right. The film is better than the book. Do not misunderstand me, I love the book. But the film is much better. This film has the best of Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. (I have not seen Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than those used in the book. But I've already talked about those in my commentary on the mini-series. But, I missed a few. The film was shot at a better location than where the mini-series was shot. And REDRUM scenes are more freaky than those in the book. So, if you're looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But count on nightmares every night for 3 weeks
