A funny action comedy in which Damian Szifron takes Dise's life, a policeman whose wife deceived him. He lives in a hotel that feels guilty about the unbelief of his wife, falling into depression, stops worrying, red lights only from fun, feeling pity. And Silberman, a Jewish psychiatrist on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust police at all. He was told to follow the Diaspora in his daily duties, incapable of refusing the conditional sentence. Soon the situation returns when Silberman himself finds out that his wife cheats him, and in the end he is comforted by the person he was supposed to help, a person he did not believe at first. Nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, hysterical women. Strange characters in a wonderful comedy about friendship and heroism.
