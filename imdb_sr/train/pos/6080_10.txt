Othello, the classic Shakespeare story of love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school, I actually discovered that Othello was probably my favorite Shakespeare story because of the fact that it was fascinating, the fact that Shakespeare perfectly won the feeling of friendship, love and racism. I mean, when you really study this story, you can enter into so many philosophies about why Otelo is crazy with jealousy in a moment's eye. But later, for my report, I also looked at this version of Othelle and I must say it was absolutely brilliant. Laverance and Kenneth so well grasped the story and realized it was darkness. Otelo is a great soldier in his city, whom everyone likes, including the king. But when the king finds out that Othelle was screaming with his daughter, Desdemona, the king was angry, but she had excluded her. Othello is welcome to the city and makes his best friend, Cassia, his side man instead of Iago, who was standing next to Othello. Because of his crazy jealousy, he is for vengeance. He still pretends to be Otel's best friend; he only suggests that Otel is defrauded by Desdemona with Kassi, he never says that they are, only makes Otto think that this is happening. Othello is crazy and there are no pleasant plans for Desmond or Cassio, and Iago is more than happy to help him. Othello is an incredible story, I recommend that you read it. It's an incredible story that keeps you in mind after reading it. Otello's film is also great and I recommend it once, he has perfectly processed the story and has a great sense of watching, or you can be in total shock from what is happening between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly he believes that his truth is love would betray him . This is a great movie, great acting, a good set, and a good direction, that's what Shakespeare thought when he wrote the story. 10/10
