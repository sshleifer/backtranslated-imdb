Albeniza's music pervades this film. Once and again he plays with original instrumentation (eg Piano, but never full of orchestra), but often again works with various contemporary ensembles (eg Guitar) and treatments (eg Jazz piano). Only occasionally music is the only focus of the film: the great majority of time music is set on various dances, often flamenco, but not always. I suppose there are 12 14 scenes that do not unite the plot. Not all scenes will reach the height for the individual viewer. In my case, about a half reached the peak, although all the others in their way were very good. Those who worked for me, have driven me into the aesthetic pleasure of goose; Indeed, the final scene left me a poster of joy. And in a very magical way, it brings you deep into Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. The film is almost without words, although each scene carries the title Albeniz pieces. Watching this very beautiful movie sharpens my complaint that virtually none of Saurin's films are available on a DVD in the US. I'm referring specifically to his flamenco version "Carmen", a spectacular piece of art that is available in Europe, but not here (European DVD will not play on US DVD players). This is a scandal.
