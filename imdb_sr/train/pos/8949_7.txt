Vertigo plays Stevart (in his last turn as a romantic lead) and Novak raises this, Stevart's second "Christmas Movie", a mid-level entertainment movie. Chemistry between the two stars makes a fairly mobile experience, and further discovery can be obtained from the film if witches are seen as a metaphor for private pain that impedes the relationships of many people. All in all, a beautiful diversion with legendary stars, 7/10.
