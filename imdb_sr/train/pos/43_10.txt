I loved this film very much. It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends for such a tragedy. Alicia was just an upset soul and Deanna was so happy just to see somebody after she was shot. The only complaint to me was that at the beginning it was a bit slow and it took some time to get to the bottom of the matter. Besides, it was great.
