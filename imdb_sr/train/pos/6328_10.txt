It is so satisfying to see that a great piece of work is transformed into another without distortion or infection. I could not suppose such extraordinary literature could be recreated as a movie worth seeing. If you liked Bulgakov's book, you would understandably be afraid to see some misinterpretation done more for an art film project than to bring the story to the deeper meaning of the screen. There are several examples of this with Majstorovo and Margarita. As much as the story is complex and strained, the film leaves nothing. It was as though the director had read Bulgakov's work in the same way that the orchestral conductor reads the result - and the note was not missed. Why can not we find such talent here in the US? Now my favorite book and movie have the same title.
