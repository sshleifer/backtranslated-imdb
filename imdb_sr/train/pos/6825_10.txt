I was absolutely delighted at the Day of the Opening of John Cassavetes. It's his first film that I've seen on a larger scale, so he feels more mainstream, but he still does not feel like he's based more on himself than in the previous films. That may be what makes it so intense. There is also something that is undoubtedly catharsic about watching this movie. This is in fact what Cassavetes made in his career, the ideal that came out behind the camera during his career as a director and here expressing it in front. Rovlands's character, middle-aged actress Mirtle Gordon, can not force her to play her upcoming production as written, so she uncontrollably follows the pulse after the impulse, resulting in what looks like a chaos on the scene, until she finds the right one . This is a shy abstract premise. This is a movie that fails to capture the inherent management through which it passes through emotional cleansing. Nobody understands why Myrtle does many things that he does, and this is seen and even portrayed as something destructive, but maybe best for her. This can be a cleaning, not a malfunction. Withdrawing, a bushel, rebellion, all this culminates in melting. Cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch, which at an early stage, ardently claims that she has nothing in common with her character, but she is in a quiet, but emotionally corrupt fear that the opposite is true. The last scene, the pinnacle of performance Mirtle shares with the character who is painfully alienated from her who plays with her, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, hard, enlightening and pleasant moments I have ever seen.
