Clair Denis returns his theme of alienated fathers, men who are determined to follow their bliss, ignoring the emotions of their family, but while Nenette and Boni live in the narrow world of Marseille, our examination of Louis Trebor leads us to the Intruder from a distant location along the French-Swiss border halfway around the world, in Korea and Tahiti. The film re-starts in the middle course, and Louis, in the sixties, faces a painful heart while trying to maintain a high level of fitness. We learned that Louis is not a stranger to violence because his cabin is a place where smugglers and gunfire are roaming. Louis sleeps with a big knife under the pillow with guns nearby. Denis is not in a hurry to move the action, and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his everyday activities and those few people he is dealing with alongside the border, including his son Sidney (Gregoire Colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and mustache) "Lunatic": portrayed as a dedicated father of two children. There are many short scenes that, although seemingly unconnected, create the impression of Louis and his environment. Mrs. Godard's work is exciting here. The control metaphor is Louis's heart transplant for which he goes to Korea and then Tahiti to look for another son who was not found and where Louis's new heart is rejected by Sidney as he discarded the old one. We are used to short scenes in Denis's movie that are inexplicable: Nenette walks Boni with spoon feeding; drive by killing Bonnie's father, and then with the briefest pictures of Bonnie with a wound in the head; scene in the morgue with a body with a scarring transplant, but the body of the Sidney. The implication, of the latter two, is the rejection, whether real or imagined, by a father, kills something inexplicable in a son.
