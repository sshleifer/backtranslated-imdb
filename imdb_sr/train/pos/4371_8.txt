When Braveheart first came out, I was delighted, and one of the most exciting movie lovers. When Rob Roi came out, I was intrigued, and although I enjoyed the film, I did not think it was a great movie. However, as time passed, my gratitude to Rob Rooy rose, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart declined. Brave heart is a great party, but it certainly has flaws. The most important, in my opinion, is the rude portrait of Robert Bruce, who was undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. The second is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which interferes with the film in relation to many historical distortions. I believe that the fact that in this film, viewed only (at least in the retrospective), is the first time that the beginning of the ego-mania Mel Gibson is visible. On the contrary, Rob Roi has grown up to me over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the mistakes I have most memorized in the Brave Heart. But also because Rob Roi is a good wine, it becomes more mature and more complex with every kind of vision.
