I rented this movie when it came out on a video cassette and I really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago and since then I've watched it several times. I would have to agree with others when they said that the Indian Year was a nostalgic movie. When I look at it, I want to be 10-14 years old again. I think that's why we love a movie to a certain extent. We all sometimes want to be able to bring our lives to life as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Would not it be nice for all your friends / parents to be young again? Do not you have to worry about your business, being a parent etc ... ??? I know I'd like to jump into De Lorean and go back to the past. While I enjoyed the movie, my favorite movie for all time was the Meatballs with Bill Murray. I wish I could make an Indian summer version of it.
