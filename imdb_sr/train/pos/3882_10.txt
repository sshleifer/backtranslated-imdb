I watched this tape, he immediately rolled over, looked at it again and laughed twice. I strongly recommend this tape to those who are not disgusting, but embarrassing about the transvestite. It shows that transvestitism is a characteristic, not a whole being. Comedy is not one question. This man is brilliant. All comics should strive for his sincerity, intelligence, and talent.
