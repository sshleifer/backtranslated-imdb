I am sure that most people already know the story - Scribble Ebenezer Scrooge gets a visit from three spirits (the Spirits of the Christmas past, the present and are still coming) that emphasize parts of their lives in the hope of saving his soul and changing his way. Dickens's classic story in one form or another endured a test of time to become a beloved favorite destination. As I grew up watching the 1951 version, starring Alastair Sims, and I believe he was the ultimate Scrooge, I was impressed with this version, which was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays the convincing and evil Ebenezer Scrooge, and actors who play ghosts are pretty scary and threatening. David Warner is also a good Bob Cratchit. This version is beautifully captured and uses more modern shooting styles (for the 1980s) which makes it more pleasant for my kids than the 1951 black and white version. . This is a worthy adaptation story and the one I watch almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.
