Funny. USA. Charming. These are all the words that floated through my head as I watched this beautiful, simple movie. It's rare that the film really moves me, but "shall we dance?" It was done with grace. The mild humor, mixed with occasional subtle agony, has made it one of the best experiences in my movie watching history. He left me a quiet feeling of excitement, but with a slight tone of sorrow mixed. And dance, oh yes, dance. Even if you are not a fan of art, or you can not put one leg in front of the other, the steps shown here will take your breath off, and make you want to apply for the classes as fast as you can. It was absolutely enchanting, even the parts that show Sugiama (a touchingly portrayed by Koji Iakusho) stiff steps when he first learned to dance, they were beautiful in a witty, childish way. Yet this film was not entirely related to dance, but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. We are witnessing a shy man who learns to express his suppressed feelings through dance, a wonderful dance instructor who again reveals his love for art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful auxiliary actor. Beauty. The pain. Emotion. All love and small agony of life are here, expressed by the delicate feeling of fine Japanese watercolor combined with emotional strength and the gracefulness of culture. <br /> <br />
