I enjoy movies like this because of their spirit, without any boring intention. His decent, clean movie about a baseball team that is lagging behind, and a young fan wants to win, because his dad said it was the only way to get back for him. The ghost shines through two ways: funny with Danny Glover and young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the celestial messenger Al, who takes on the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. It's an energetic movie. It will make you laugh and really involve you in sports. In this lies my grip. The only thing that's boring to me is those sports movies that turn you into unexpected fans for the team. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's just strange that I should get away from the film thinking that the Angels are a strong, cool team, when my basic loyalty, like she, lay in Toronto Blue Jaisu. It's interesting, really. If it's just a movie about a juvenile team, then that's fine.
