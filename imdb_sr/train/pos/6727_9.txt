A few days ago, I realized that the creators of this film put the game into words in their title. This film is not primarily about the act of "riding giants", but mainly about people who are giants in sports, riding giants, to change the accent. from Vedge, one of the toughest and best bodysurfing sites in the world. I was on the surf from 15 to 18 feet, and I drove and I was on multiple occasions loaded with waves of 10 and 12 feet. This experience is the reason why I am fully concerned about the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, apparently a normal mortal, could get rid of riding Maverick by himself for more than a decade is beyond my comprehension. The first safety rule for any water sports is "Never surf / dive / swim yourself". He went where healthy people did not want to, and he lived to tell it. I would not go there that the water was 75 degrees, and sharks all the others. In the hot water world: the first shot of the wave on the jaw always makes the skin flicker on my whole body. These are not just frightening waves; these are uncontrolled waves of evacuation. When we see Laird Hamilton not only survived the waves from 40 to 60 feet (I can barely be able to enter those numbers), but actually I'm doing my face as a fun day in Rincon, I'm blown away. There is a great devotion and focus on large-wave riders that can be compared to those in the world. This is an excellent movie. I gave him 9 instead of 10 just because I ignore to mention that there are big rider riders in the world outside the Hamilton / Kalama crew, and I think they deserved to mention it. He splits at Ken Bradshaw at the outer cabins, and he's 10!
