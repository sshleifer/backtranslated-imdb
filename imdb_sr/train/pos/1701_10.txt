This is a stupid movie about a man who is thinking. If you do not expect Star Vars and enjoy the British humor, it could turn into a cult classic for you, both for my wife and for me - from the casting of "voice" by Cari Grant and Jack Nicholson as a marquee to the overly simplistic population of Big Bean is a movie which you can either sleep or watch carefully and enjoy in any case. It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy the relaxing light humor that quickly takes the joke as you go, you will enjoy this movie.
