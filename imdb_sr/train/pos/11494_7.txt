The production of Roger Corman is unheard of and as such is nasty and unhealthy. If you hate pregnant women, take a look at this movie because it's full of grave killings and failed abortions. Brooke Adams plays Virginia. She and her husband go to some fertility clinic because they can not have children on their own. There they meet Dr. Meierling (James Karen from ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr. Meierling has a very high success rate in getting couples in pregnancy. (Here, put in a joke.) Is it because he creates some genetic killers of supermutant babies? That's what Virginia begins to think when she starts to have some weird side effects and extreme mood of treatment. Then he begins to take things into his own hands. In this you will have to get the rest of the details somewhere else, because if I tell you everything that she had, you could hurt yourself too fast on Netflik. It's moving a little slowly, but once it's picked up in the last third, all the systems have gone! I am highly recommended by my non-PC fetal violence forces. 33 1/2 of seventeen stars.
