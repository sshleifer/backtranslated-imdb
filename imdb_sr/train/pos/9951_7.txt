If you've ever wondered why they do not make pornography with complications, watch Dream Quests. On the one hand, you have to give Armstrong a loan and that you have made an effort to take advantage of this idea and use such powerful adult actors to put behind you some power of the name. On the other hand, it also quickly becomes clear why most pornography never has more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue linking sex scenes. These people simply can not act (and the story, unfortunately, is poor to the absurd level). effort to cut corners. Also, I want to see more attempts like this one. Maybe one day I'll see the perfect combination of pornography and complications.
