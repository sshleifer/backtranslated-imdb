When I first looked at this movie, I thought it was a typical thing "loved one's neighbor." The more the film took place, the more I was involved. The acting is magnificent of both actors, the direction was excellent, the story is unusual. I shot my eyes for the first time in my life for the movie. He must have a real video in any serious video. 11 of 10
