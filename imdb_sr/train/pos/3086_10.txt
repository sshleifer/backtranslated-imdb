Here is Italy (I am writing from Venice). Why cancel? ABC was supposed to give her a chance to build an audience. Actors (with Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jai Hernandez and Bridget Moinahan) are among the best I've seen in recent times. We need more of these shows that viewers make intelligent individuals, not meaningless trunks. I hope ABC will re-examine your decision or be picked up by another station.
