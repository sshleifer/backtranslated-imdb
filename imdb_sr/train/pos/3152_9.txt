This show was absolutely great, and I'm always looking forward to watching. All the characters were funny and horrible in their own way, each episode provided non-stop laughter, and it was completely fun and different from many other shows. All were absolutely crazy and astounding funny, which you could not help but love this play . This was one of the best shows ever emitted, and I will watch this show whenever it can, because it never grows old, never becomes a fool, and never becomes uninteresting.
