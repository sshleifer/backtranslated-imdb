I've seen a trailer for this movie many times, and I must say that Ned Kelly looks like he's going to be a wonderful movie. When I first saw the trailer, I could not separate my eyes from it (it surely attracted me attention). Heath Ledger adheres to what he knows and what he does for him, time pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, who sees a fraction of a second looks fantastic. I think this film will be hit, and it will be seen again and again.
