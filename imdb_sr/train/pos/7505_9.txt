If there is one genre that I've never been a fan, it's a biography. Always misleading, filled with false information, overly dramatized scenes and scams all over the place, biographies are almost never done properly. Even in the hands of genuinely talented directors such as Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Moward, they often cause great harm to people trying to catch on the screen. Skepticism takes the place of hyper with most biographies that reach the big screen, and Notorious Bettie Page is not different. Some critics and viewers of the theaters opposed Gretchen Mol, considering the role of Beti Page, saying she was no longer famous and no party. I never suspected that Mol could deal with this part, but I did not expect her to act like me when I watched the movie a few hours ago. Mol delivers the Oscars with a dignified performance as a legendary girl from 1950, who, after an early life of abuse (subtlety and tastefully shown, something a few directors would do), inevitably became one of the most popular models of all time. The image covers a lot of terrain in 90 minutes of operation, but in spite of no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that there is a small piece missing in the story. Director / co-scriptwriter Marri Harron and the fantastic scenario of Guinevere Turner are just disturbed too quickly and not as clear as they should end. Nevertheless, it should be given the merit of two ladies to create an almost impeccable biography that manages to honor and its theme and the decade that masters impersonate. Come for Oscar, Mol, Turner and Harron should be nominated. It's a suspicion that this will happen, although there are certainly no three women who deserve more. 9/10
