This series is "something different". Sometimes European series are less precise than those in the US, but this time the authors have hit the right target by creating a mix that functions smoothly. Edel & Starck is great, it has everything: great plot, smart, witty, always well-delivered lines, stunning theater time that has been shown by all the stars and beautiful shots of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It's fun to see how things work in the field of justice in other countries than in the United States, and once "feel" the old way of Europe to deal with life. It is an honor for all the actors and the team for a well-made comedy that will be required to be seen in the years to come. Watching the series in German is great.
