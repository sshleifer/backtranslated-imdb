"Holes" is my favorite movie of all time! So far, I've been watching this movie three times in cinemas and I'm looking forward to buying DVDs in the upcoming September. I read the book after I saw the movie and I was amazed how much the book and the movie were similar. The director of this film has perfectly finished the book in film form. Also, all actors selected to play the roles played beautifully their characters, especially Mak Kasch as ZigZag. Support for all those involved in making this movie was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I certainly recommend it to everyone!
