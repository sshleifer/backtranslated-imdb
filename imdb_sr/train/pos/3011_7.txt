One of the better Vance films manages more on an interesting story and skillful direction by none other than Michael Curtiz. This time around the generally hated financier was found dead - killed in the head - in his locked bedroom on the top floor. Philo Vance, who heard about the situation while going to Italy, decided to end his holiday and try to solve what he thinks is the murder and what everyone else is thinking about suicide. Villiam Povell is a kind Philo Vance as you will find. He does not seem to be pressuring and always very smooth in what he says and works. Povell is helped by a host of very talented actors - some top actors and actresses like Marie Astor as a niece who hated her uncle, Ralf Morgan as the dead man's secretary, Paul Cavanaugh as a rival dog, Arthur Hohl as a mysterious butler, Helen Vinson, as a neighboring house is a blond hair, and two really good performances by James Leigh as Chinese cooks and dirty Eugene Palette as a wise cop. Add to the mixture the miraculously comical reversal of Etienne Girardot as a public mortician who always misses his meal. It is precisely this depth of the suspects and the story that has many complications and reversals that makes the killing case in a kennel a fast-moving, fun mystery.
