In the beginning, I was worried about the idea that Sarah Silverman had her own show. The films she appeared in were not very funny, and her humor was a little distant. However, I was very surprised when I saw that her true colors shine in this Comedi Central gem. I could put it in rank with Ami Sedaris in Strangers vith Candi - Sarah's figure is a true sociopath, very comparable to Sedri's Jerry Blank. One drop of this show is its support cast. The character of her sister is good; Sometimes it was funny, but it meant in the end that it did not steal Sarah's shov. However, the rest of the actors are extremely sub-parallel in comparison. I'm glad, however, that the Comedi Central gave Sarah an opportunity to show her unique and crazy feeling of herself and humor.
