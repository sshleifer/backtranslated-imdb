The extra is called to play the general in a film about the Russian Revolution. However, it is not an ordinary supplement. He is Serguis Alexander, the former commander of the Russian army, who is now forced to re-live the same scene, in which he passed a professional and personal tragedy, in order to satisfy a director who once was a revolutionary in Russia and which was humiliated by Alexander. Now it may be time for this broken man to finally "win" his final battle. This is a powerful film with a precise direction Von Sternberg, which provides the greatest irony in Aleksandrov's character in every way. Jannings earned his Oscar for a role with a very touching performance that played the general at its peak and in its deepest valley. Povell rendered malicious support because the director and Brent, who was an avenger, is perfect in his role, and his face and movements show as much expression as Jannings' love. All about brightness. Rating, 10.
