I love Eddie Izzard. I think this is terrible, and other special television should be looked at. She also has a good book "Dress for killing" that is bought, which I think people should read. I loved what this program won by Emma, ​​and everyone who loves the story will probably laugh from Eddie. Enjoy :)
