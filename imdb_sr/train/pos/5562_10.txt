This is fun jokes from all Cheech & Chong shifts. That's the first thing I've seen with these guys. I found it really good. My dad recommended that I get it. HOW THEY IS A GREAT MODEL OF ROLE, AND MY GRANDMA IS GIVEN FOR ME, KNOWING THAT IT IS IT. What kind of family do I have? So this movie is pretty good and great for renting when you want to see a good classic. I need to warn you that this is not funny. It has its moments, but it's not as funny as there is anything about Mary. Check it out anyway. I'm sure you'll laugh. Unless your anti-drug activist or something.
