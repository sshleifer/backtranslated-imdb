This is truly a great film with a revolutionary message (both in shape and content) that should not be missed by any fan of the French New wave or Underground film. We are barely opening or closing loans - we have only embarked on the world of consumerism, revolution and youth. This film has little to do with the documentary film and is more interesting to play with our advertising ideas and its relationship to reality. The lines of the real, rather than the real, are transmitted in ways that are familiar with movies dealing with documentary films, but this time we do it for consumption and marketing, not for describing the real one.
