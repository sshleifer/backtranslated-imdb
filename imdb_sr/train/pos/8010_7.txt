Earlier, I thought this film was the weakest of Muppet's films. Now, I would like to withdraw this statement. In my opinion, the weakest MUppet movie was a TV movie "Christmas is a very cheerful chocolate", and this is a wonderful life that was really terrible. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles are more favorable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. The best songs are the song 'You Can not Answer', the one you sing Muppet Babies and the songs for the big finale. As I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I liked the Muppet Babies sequence here (I was told that this was what inspired Muppet Babies shov). Muppets from Sesame Street even appear at the wedding. As Kermit puts it in the closing sentence: "What could better end?". But I want that what was between the beginning and the end is a bit more fun. There are sweet broods from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and the great dance sequence from Rizzo and Rats (the choreography of the late, great Jim Henson) and the movie is certainly entertaining. However, I must say that MUPPET MOVIE, BIG MUFFER CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are three definitive MUppet movies.
