Good movie with a great soundtrack stretching through the rock landscape of the 70's and 80's. Radiofreccia describes one generation, describes life in a small village near Correggia (the birthplace of Ligabue, a singer who wrote a book that inspired the film) describes the lives of young people and their problems relating to the world. It reminds of Trainspotting, with little Italian touch.
