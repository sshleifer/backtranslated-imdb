It looks like I never write a review about the IMDb, unless I'm surprised at how good a movie is or how bad it is. This film belongs to the first category. Every year I try to see all nominated for the best foreign film at the Oscars, even those I know I will not like. "As in paradise" seems to fit the bill. The action sounds sweet and sentimental and slowly .... For my tastes, which go more towards an original, dark and / or bold foreign film (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, A lot of modern Japanese / Korean films) "As in Heaven" it does not sound particularly interesting ... He was not released in the United States, so I sat down to watch the VCD I found in Singapore, preparing to "move it from the list". After the blunt beginning, "As in Paradise" becomes a rare film in which it really gets inspired by what's happening on the screen. Poor points: Characters in the film are pure characters - Wounded Dreamer, City Silence, Rape wife, a loose woman who craves for love, push the minister ... Fortunately, they are largely a sympathetic group, and they are well written and well behaved. Ingela Olsson, as wife of Inger, would be nominated for an Oscar for her performance in English. Powerful points: music is beautiful, and the main song sung by Gabriel is really dramatic and unforgettable. And watch out for a lively 87-year-old actress who plays Olga, who keeps up with dance steps and younger ladies! I will not discuss the ending, but I will say it makes sense. These are the many emotional things that are happening in the last hour of the film, and you're not quite sure why they are happening. Although nothing is explained by words, all this makes sense because the films come to a suitable crescend. **** from the *****. Probably the strongest Swedish movie I've ever seen.
