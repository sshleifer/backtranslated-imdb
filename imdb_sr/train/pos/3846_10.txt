In essence, I love Verhoeven because I enjoy his film in the brilliant psychedial story I previously saw in the "Basic Instinct". Movie. Well, that's his previous direction before his block "Basic Instinct" and for that reason I was very curious to watch this movie and that, the film filled my hope and expectation. This film "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant psycosexual drama that is a bit complicated for some audience. The story of this film is about a gaius writer called "Reve" (Krabbe), an alcoholic who lives by his moral values ​​and sees many visions that can alert him to a future disaster. Meet a seductive woman named Christine, who has a mysterious past she does not want to discover. Make sex with her at her house while she's a boy. the person he met at the station. He was curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to his house. That's it. I do not want to reveal the whole story because it's a Verhoeven movie, and the end of the movie is really surprising! Especially I like the figure "Reve" that greatly plays "Crabbe". In essence, I like his acting, because a gay person is clearly identified with his character and I love his charming face. br /> I estimate this film: 10 out of 10.
