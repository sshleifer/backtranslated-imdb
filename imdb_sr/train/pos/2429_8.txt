If you liked Deep Cover, you might like this movie. Many of the poetic interludes of the Fishburne recital in Deep Cover are from the lyrical scenario "Once In The Life", the screen adaptation of a piece written by Fishburne. If you love Larry as much as I do, you will love this movie that is all Larry, everything is hot, and everything is presented. Of course, there is a pistol game and unauthorized use of substances, this is, after all, a gangster movie, but the scenario is beautiful and the story is touching, even a little on the side of the chicken. AMAZING FILM ... dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you've ever sneaked in at night or have been hanging out in a club, you'll get the proper impact of the hacked sets (the meteorological echo in captivity in life). Full of intelligent prejudices and complex relationships, this movie is tight ... every feeling is reflected in the set and shooting of the camera. GOOD WORK!
