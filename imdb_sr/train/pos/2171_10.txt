A real classic, ten out of ten! Each actor is perfect, the script is a terrific array of uncertain scenes. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains take away breath. I wonder if this movie is already on DVD, because this must be seen in the Videscreen version. I saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and since then I have never forgotten it. I remember that it was one of the first Varner films, a process called Varnerscope that gave a very neat cinema. Shelley Vinters and Jack Palance earned an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I could criticize is that he did not direct someone like, say Nicholas Rai, to increase his rhythm and tension.
