CB4 was terrible, but maybe Cundieff gave a better idea. More like Spinal Tap than anything else, the movie is clever from the very beginning. He was surprised by anyone who saw him in the mid-nineties. Performances are played for laughter, but not so much as cartoon characters, more like Brothers Mark. These guys are real and a bit diverse. They react to situations like any of us could. Well, maybe we will not throw the tantrum when our hats for the show are late on the gig, or we pull the pistols down and we break the record company, but you get a picture. N (n *** as) V (sa) H (hats) are taken seriously enough to pull you in, then you are hooked. rent or get it at all costs, even if you're not really in rap music, this will still leave you out of voice. Comparing with CB4 is like a comparison of George Lucas 'Star Wars with Gil Gerards'Buck Rogers' I think you see my point
