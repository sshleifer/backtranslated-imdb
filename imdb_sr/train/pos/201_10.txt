The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her things in this quiet (1928) silent comedy that also shows the beautiful Villyama Haines. Davis plays a kick from Georgia that breaks Hollivood with the help of Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A great lantern on Hollywood and her pretensions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (a shame they never made a conversation) and the recordings of guests Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Villiama S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glinn and Marion Davies is a rush. Necessary for any serious movie lover or for anyone who is interested in still malignant Marion Davies!
