I'm wondering what the rifle Beckett used in the movie, as well as the caliber of the bullet that was supposed to shoot. If it's loosely based on the sniper of Carlos Hathcock, I guess it's 7mm. round. I'm interested in the rifle itself. He also commented in a final film about a sniper about a gun that a Vietnamese man allowed him to use what belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I'd like to know what a rifle is. I know that this rifle was made around World War II or earlier. I just could not see it enough to watch a movie to recognize it. kills. After his wounds were somewhat cured of burns in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers in the USMC's skills they would need on the ground. His sniper career is still mentioned by our brothers and sisters who are trained in the USMC. I learned his name from my friend who was a former Marine. All information would be great.
