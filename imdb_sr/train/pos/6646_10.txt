Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest for freedom for India, ignored his family and son, this film talks about his son, Hiralal, who feels neglected for serving Mahdi Gandhi's society. The film begins in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi works as a lawyer and fights against the freedom of India against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his father who is a lawyer, since gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle, he wanted his wife and children to join the service of society and as a result, the hirral did not get the opportunity to finish schooling and not passed the exams, married his gulab (bhoomika Chavla) with love against his father's wishes. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to England to become a lawyer just like his father, but his father refuses to grant him a scholarship offered by a businessman and instead hand it over to another person by saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his should be open to the most deserving students living in the colony. It is upset and breaks between father and son increases, the hirral hates his father because he neglects him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal is struggling to make ends meet and land on the streets through unsuccessful business trials and huge debt, losing his wife and children. Akshaie Khanna gave a magnificent performance like Hiralal Gandhi .. all the beauty for him, the direction and the script is fantastic, the picture is great. Overall an excellent movie and must be seen. I give him 10/10
