Johnny makes one of his best workouts in style, making a powerful movie with a good story Iacuze. The election of the new head of Iacus is the beginning of the war within the organization. In my opinion, violence is wisely used in the context, making a very strong gang movie. I particularly love the way in which history is spoken, moving around all the roles in the Iacuza family and making us see violence as the only way they have to solve their problems ... Talking about technical aspects, the film is good an example of a paused, rhythmic and planned way to shoot a movie. One of the films of Hong Kong in the year. It's like Infernal Affairs, but without light scenes of action and violence, and confused stories. Recommended for all lovers in Asian movies. (I apologize for my English, better in Spanish lol)
