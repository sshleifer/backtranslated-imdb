The film is very complete in what it is, is constantly interested in flashback from childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father, and intertwining it with the tails of serial kill, it simply can not be mistaken. The plot itself, the story itself and the essence of the film, is fun. It's kind of a story with which the director (Bill Pakton) could do a lot, and in this case, he really did a lot with it. From the beginning to the end, you have continued to anticipate more and more about what is happening and where the film goes, and the creativity behind this story is the first class. I felt like this film was perfectly made from start to finish, and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without bored silences - an action that runs neatly, quickly and firmly from one scene to another. It shows how far people can go: they make such terrible things to their loved ones, and make such acts of evil in the name of 'God' when disappointed as in this case. It is also sometimes interesting in its traditions and assumes the concept of morality as a whole. All in all, this is a movie that can be easily overlooked, but I recommend that you do not do the same and check this movie - it's very valuable for your time.
