Dana Andrevs is featured on "Vhere the Sidevalk Ends" in this 1950 movie starring Gene Tiernei, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrevs plays the detective Sgt. Mark Dikon, a bad-tempered policeman who in the past has been troubled by the beating of the suspects. When a man was killed in a mobster-owned gambling club, Scalise (Merrill), Dickon and his partner are going to investigate. Scalise blames the murder of Ken Pain (Stevens), who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife, Tiernei but with the victim. Dikon thinks that the victim got a lot of money and that they were killed by mobs for this reason. He goes to see Paine and, without realizing that he has a plate in his head from the war, he thrashes him on the floor and inadvertently kills him. Now he must cover up the murder. As an additional complication, he falls to Morgan; her father (Ken Tully), who went to Paine's apartment after seeing Paine hit his daughter, was arrested for the crime. Incredibly handsome and worried Andrews is convincing as a tough but nervous detective who must stay ahead of his colleagues. The film reunites him with his phenomenal "Laurin" costume, Gene Tiernei, and she looks beautiful as a model with a bad taste in men who are obviously accustomed to dancing. He does not know much about having another one on his hands. Ken Tulli is doing a great job as her father, who is protesting for his innocence despite some offensive evidence. Karl Malden is very tough as Dick's boss. My only problem with this well-directed movie that moves quickly and absorbs is the end. Cleans Hollywood and, placing himself in Tierney's apartment, I doubt that I would react in the same way. A minor critique for the film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I did not consider him as inspiring as "Laura," but there are few things in this world. If you love a film noir, this is a must.
