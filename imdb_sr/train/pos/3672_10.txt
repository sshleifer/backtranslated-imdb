A fake documentary about a pair of Canadian producers, Bobby Miers (Matthews Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), who are trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. Hollywood North is a comedy story about their struggle to pull together all along, despite numerous conflicting issues. Hollywood north works like a movie in a way very similar to why this is Spinal Tap (1984). so good. Namely, although it is exaggerated in some way, it is very close to the truth, and the truth consists of "behind the scenes" of facts that are very different from the public personality of the industry. It's not easy to make a movie, which must have been particularly difficult in Canada in the late seventies. Films include dozens, if not hundreds of people. Many have incompatible wishes, motivations and personalities. Especially are the key financiers and talent on the screen, as if they either fall out or become unfounded at any stage while the movie is in production, it could jeopardize the whole thing, either due to the need for extensive re-recording or abandoning the movie. > So, it's no surprise that Hollivood North focuses on these types of relationships. The result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic. The script is flawless and performances are top-notch. This is an indispensable place for any movie lover and anyone who has a serious interest in film making. It should be more than entertaining for every viewer with little intelligence and sense of humor. 10 out of 10 of me.
