This is a superbly made simplified movie that explores a topic and gives each viewer something different from it. The premise is simple: the unnamed celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to explore the future role by visiting the store and watching people. He is especially interested in the cashier in the line "10 Items or Less" (Paz Vega), which he finds a kind, strong and curious presence. Both actors brilliantly play and bring a solid dimension to characters in character studies. It is not a conventional character study; each of them represents the whole world. The life of a treasurer is ensnared in a sharp and frustrating "real world," while the actor is so entangled in his fantastic existence that he can not do simple tasks like remembering phone numbers. He willingly admits to dressing his face when he talks to people, and the whole purpose of researching real people shows that he is not one of them. But not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work; we see the reverse process. Several characters recognize "Him" and invite them to inspire them in their film roles. The treasurer's favorite poem "Al Pasar la Barca," about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and rather instead of paying (ie doing honest work) for boat trips, could not be chosen better. She is paralyzed with the Vega figure, the only employee in the store with all the brains or ambitions, who is willing to work hard to succeed. (It's a pretty tendency for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) It's a weird little movie, probably made on the floor. If you do not mind slow tempo and "talkie" approach, this movie will entertain. The characters are perfectly contrasting, and the effective acting makes them lovely. Nice watch.
