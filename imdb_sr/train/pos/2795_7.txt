I like to play football and I thought this film is great because it contains many footballs. This was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad he won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good, as did Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheies Meiers was a great trainer. Jess (Parminder Nagra) likes to play football, but her parents want to learn how to cook a desire to marry. When Jazz begins to play secretly for the football team, he meets Juliet (Kiera Knightleti) and Joath (Jonathon Rhies Meiers), who is her coach. When her parents discover problems, her father allows her to play a big game at the wedding of her sister Pinki (Archie Punjabi). In the end, her parents realize how much she likes football and let her play abroad.
