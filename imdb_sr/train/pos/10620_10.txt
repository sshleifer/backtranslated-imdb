When I first watched, I discovered that this story is at least less boring than other Cannon Movie Tales. After much more, I think it is one of the best. Some of the songs are pretty bad, especially loving, but the two things that make up the movie stand out, even singing, worth the effort. One is an artistic direction. Like other stories about Cannon, this is a beautifully decorated period; Every piece of fabric and jewels (both of which have the main parts of the movie of this film) look fresh and new, and they oppose the ordinary peasant clothes. Even during a love song I find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess, beautifully done. The other thing is a comical time. Many films are cheesy, but imperial quagmire (and his ridicule at the end), a suspicious watchman, a guilty Nicholas and a stupid prince, were pretty funny and they look funny, quite deliberately. . And the sequence during the Veave-O song compensates songs that were not so good.
