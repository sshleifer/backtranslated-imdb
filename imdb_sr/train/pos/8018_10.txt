In this Muppet film, Kermit, Miss Piggi, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rovlf, Scooter, Camilli, Dr. Teeth, Floid, Animal, Janice and Zoot are university graduates who decide to bring their successful musical, Manhattan Melodies, to Broadway. Unfortunately, not one manufacturer will meet with Muppets. After being rejected by many producers, Scooter suggests that Muppetts decide to continue on their own. However, Kermit still believes he can get his show on Broadway, but after he finally finishes and let everyone know that he has sold the show, Kermit has received amnesia and others do not know where he is. This has many great scenes, including the live sequence that presented the Muppet Babies, a wedding sequence filled with Muppets, including cast Sesame Street and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock), Skutera as a movie server and a scene where Rizzo and other rats cook breakfast. The only complaint is that more characters are not included anymore. Of course, many of them appear at the wedding, but it should have some significant roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sveetums, and Lips should be part of The Electric Maihem in this movie, as it was in the last season The Muppet Shov- and the Great Muppet Caper, and Miss Piggis Foo Foo's dog should also be with her (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also performed by Steve Vhitmire, played a big role in this film, and was not very well known in that time).
