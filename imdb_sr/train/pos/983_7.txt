I think this film has a lot to offer, especially the particularly nasty performance of David Morse, and more than a passing performance by Mr. Fokka's always-worthy look. Although there is a lot of holes in the shop and the motivation is very, very difficult to follow in some cases, all in all, it seems nice to spend in front of the pipe.
