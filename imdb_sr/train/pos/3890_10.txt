This is a great stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the most entertaining person I've ever seen for years. His routine is hilarious and makes an excellent conversation with others who have seen her. HIGHLY I recommend this one. Part of the history of Europe is a bit slow, but the final jokes in French are pretty good, because you do not have to speak French to get it (although if you do, it's still ridiculous). Also, parts of the transvestite are pretty good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but it's ridiculous for the first time. Skip them if you can. It's almost not worth watching. However, this is a really funny, funny stand-up show that everyone should see. "Then I was dead!"
