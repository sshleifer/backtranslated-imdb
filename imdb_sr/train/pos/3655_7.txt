De Sica became one of my favorite directors, but this one was hit-and-miss for me. A young young idiot becomes the leader of a community of illegal immigrants in an abandoned area outside Milan. It is a detailed and brilliant story of innocent poor people, along with evil capitalists and police forces happy with triggers, but slowly evolves into a magical fantasy story, while boy Toto develops unlimited powers of superheroes. I had him here with a more conscientious Tot after 10 minutes, and when the magic died, I remained in the dust. There were so many orchestrated recordings, so many good characters among immigrants, that I continued to think that it was a loss of the film was not more serious with its material. The linking of neo-realism and fantasy is more expressed as an experiment of "look-what-can-do-do-mom", but as a fully developed work / art.
