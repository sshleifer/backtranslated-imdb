Taking the old collection of stories presents a challenge for the production team, as this classic character can be brought to the forefront and make it interesting to capture a new audience with the excitement of memories from its former audience. In my opinion, their mission is accomplished. It has to look for young children, teenagers and their parents. OK, there are a few scary moments that are solved in the short term, but parents with small children should sit firmly, the movie is moving to better things. I go with those cunning reviewers who point out that Emma Roberts gives us a positive role model for young women, not syrups. Nants balances their femininity with career skills. There is a lot of love here, laughing, not too seriously understood, a real mystery that can be solved (one you can understand as an additional bonus and nice characters. Nancy Drew even makes a good movie in my opinion.
