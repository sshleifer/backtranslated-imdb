It's always nice to see Angel Bassett playing his role. Sometimes she is intense, funny and even sexy in the role of Lena, a "colored" woman who is forced to make a home on an empty muddy coast near Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good at not quite a lovely role as her partner, Boesman. Villie Jonah gives a nice shade as a stranger who reveals Boesman and Lena a new living space. It's not often that you get the chance to see an intelligent movie dealing with mature topics. Although based on the show, the late director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens the material by filming it in the Cinemascope format. He also keeps things visually interesting through creatively blocking actors and showing us the things that are just mentioned in the show. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have sent Angela Bassett to Oscar nomination. This is definitely a movie worth the search.
