I really enjoyed the pilot, it was incredible how much I hoped it would be, if not better. Patrick Varburton was a mess, although at first I thought I would not be able to withstand his character. He and Megin Price had little chemistry, but we hope that the season will last, that they will be more comfortable. It must have been strange that Megin moved from the star to her last ground [Grounded For Life] to be a co-star. Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson look really new on the entire Sitcom scene, but I think it will be better in time. The character of David Spade, to my surprise, was not the main focus of this pilot. The way it delivers its lines is so different from anyone I've ever seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. It's good for him. I think that couples, even even single ones, will be able to connect with all the doubts and battles and be uncertain about your decisions that are being dealt with. All the situations in which the characters are placed just feel like real life, not sugars like most shows. I hope that for all actors CBS will give a chance. This performance has the potential to be one of the best series, if the chance and time are given.
