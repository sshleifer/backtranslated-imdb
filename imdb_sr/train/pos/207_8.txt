At first, it looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I entered it, it turned out to be a really funny movie. Basically, the forgotten comedians Villi Clark (winner of the Golden Globe, Oscar and BAFTA nominated Valter Matthau) and Al Levis (winner of the Oscars, and Golden Gloves nominated George Burns) were an excellent comedy duo, and re-assembled to revive the hospital sketch for TV show. Villi's nephew, Ben Clark (Golden Globe that wins Richard Benjamin), is convinced that they can re-assemble without feeling for each other, how wrong it is. They can not keep on continuing, they are both forgetful, especially during the conversation, but in the end they do it. Also featured is Lee Meredith as a sister in the sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, Al's Daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willie's sister and Muppets from Space's F. Murrai Abraham as a mechanic. I think it's the best line of Burns that mentions Matthau called him a "son of a bitch". He was nominated for Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Writing, a script adapted to other materials, nominated for BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Film - Music / Comedy and was nominated for Best Screenplai. Very good!
