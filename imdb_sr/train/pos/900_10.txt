This is one of the best Bollywood films I've seen so far. Family and friends feel the same. This film is both romantic and dramatic. In my opinion, we need more movies or films to keep the culture of South Asia alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao have acted well in this, and their couple are attracted by many people in films. This is a movie that must be seen, a family and a romantic movie. This film is also produced by Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kona. This film is their best moment ... the film's setting was beautiful, which is also a great attraction. This movie must be seen ... recommended to everyone!
