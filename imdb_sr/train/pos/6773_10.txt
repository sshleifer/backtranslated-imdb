I captured this movie on T.V. Last night, you know that Danny Masterson was a pretty good actor in the movie, and that was great to see him in something other than the 70's. The film was not rated, but in my opinion I would only evaluate it because of nudity and a lot of adult content. But I loved everything in all, I thought Dirt's Visecracks were pretty fun. It's basically a guy who does not have a job, a girl, or a money, and eventually gets a job as a private investigator (more than one messenger really.) He gets framed for the murder of a rock star and a rock star is one of the People who really need him help. I Give It .... *** 3 Stars.
