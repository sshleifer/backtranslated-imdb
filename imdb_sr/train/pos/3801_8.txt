This is a CGI animated film based on the French 2D animated series. The series appeared briefly on Cartoon Network, but its work was so short that its inclusion as one of the potential nominees for the Best Animated Film Oscar this year left most of the people I know to leave "Huh?" This is a story about Lian-Chu, a good heart muscle, and Guizdo, the brain of the operation, who, along with Hector with his fiery dragon, looked more like a dog. Travel the world by offering your services as dragon hunters, but you never get a reward. Zoe, the niece of love from the fairy tale of a king who blinds, comes to their lives. It seems that the world is devouring a huge monster and that all knights sent by the king have never returned or if they return, they return as an ash. In desperation, the king hires hunter hunters to stop the world's food. Zoe of course naturally ... What can I say to another then why is this film hidden underneath the rocks? This is a really good little movie that is completely out of radar, except as an incredible Oscar nominee. Her beautifully designed, fantastic film (The world that has been held has floating lands and crazy creatures) who constantly made me "Vov" on it. Voice for English voice with Forrest Vhitaker like Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson like Gvido (I mean Steve Bucsemi) is the first. It's equally a good script that does not talk about its audience, using some real expressions that are not usually heard in animated films (not Disnei and Picard). Everything is well done. Is it perfect? No, some parts take too long, but at the same time it's fun. If you have the opportunity to see this. It's one of the better animated films from 2008 and goes to my beautiful surprise list for 2009.
