With several Hammer stars, this highly effective piece of British horror revolves around the home and the fate of its former tenants, whose stories are told to a detective from Scotland, looking for a missing actor. The story number one, which is probably the least impressive of four, deals with the writer and his wife who just moved into the house and are planning to stay only briefly to write one of their horror novels. He creates a crazy character named Dominik, which is a very nasty look, and soon he gets angry when he starts looking at this man looking into life. After his wife convinced him to seek psychiatric help, a sub-plot was introduced, which, frankly, did not really work for me. I will not spoil it. The next story (best in my opinion) is played by the beautiful Peter Cushing as Philippe Grayson, the man who moved into his home for his years of retirement and soon makes his way to the nearby wax figures museum (dealing with stinking) , where he is very astonished to find a wax figure that looks just like a woman from his past. Shortly thereafter, an old friend (who also has a history with this woman) is in the city for work and goes to see him. The two men are waiting for an indecent awakening because they soon discover that this woman was more than she seems to be. The story of three stars is one of my favorite ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After moving to a house with her unusual daughter Jane, the nanny she hires becomes very suspicious about the way Reid pushes her daughter. So come to find out ... that she knew what Lee did, you would definitely understand. The last story is a pretty light heart of a vampire story that stars John Pertvee and Ingrid Pitt. After he bought a mantle merchant's cloak, actor Paul Henderson turns into a creature he has repeatedly shown in his career. performances. There and there were beautiful Gothic touches and an effective result that filled the atmosphere. This is the guard, and it's recommended.
