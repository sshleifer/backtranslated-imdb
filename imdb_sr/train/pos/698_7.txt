I've seen this movie for a while, after I ordered it to my friend, who is a great fan of Dominica Monaghan. The film itself was very interesting, although it had its positive points, what for me was Donnie Darko kind of "vtf?" factor after the film is over. Naturally, with positive and negative points. For me, the young girl in the movie was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan did a good job. Unfortunately, I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. It could only be me, and I do not claim to be a serious critic, in a way that I do not feel comfortable enough, but he just did not seem convincing as an actor. But perhaps it's even more impressive, because even though I'm not a critic, it attracts me. To conclude, I think this is certainly a movie worth watching. It was interesting, confusing, and you should have seen it.
