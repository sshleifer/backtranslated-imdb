Many years ago, I found a copy of this film for one or two dollars. In many ways, this is quite convenient, as it was made back in 1933, it was indeed a cheap recording studio of "poverty", Majestic. However, while the movie is rather performed, it is still worth watching and giving a few surprises. The story is very, very familiar, as in some German cities, people are upset about some recent deaths that look like the work of a vampire! Adding to this knowledge is Dvight Frie. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar - although he plays a lot of harmless freaks. In this case, he is obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for death. The film works well with some "red herring" (i.e., false traces) and although it does not need a genius to realize that Frie may not be responsible, VHO and VHI are intriguing and make it very different from the average horror movie. In addition, while production had little money to talk about, they still had some good actors - Lionel Atvill and Melvin Douglas - and also used Universal Studios at night (when they finished shooting for the day). As a result, the film looks pretty good, although I also thought that, as usual, Fai Vrai was terrible - she thought that this did not diminish the character of the film. I saw her in more films than most people on IMDb and I came to notice that her characters do not have depth - she always seems to be thrown like "screaming lady" and giving her a little new in every movie. All in all, for lovers of old horror films, this is great and worth seeing. For people who are not fans of this genre, it's probably pretty expensive.
