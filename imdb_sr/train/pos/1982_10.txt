This was my favorite movie as a child, and I have been in stage production several times, so it will always remain my favorite music and I doubt that anyone could ever make a story about Oliver Twist on the screen, better than this My Best Friend's Favorite The guy "must be Oliver Reed like Bill Sikes. Not only did he scare me when I looked at him as a six-year-old, but now, as a woman, I can more sympathize with Nensa's character, a bar employee / prostitute who helps Oliver get the life he deserves. Jake Wild as a skillful dodger was fantastic, and I do not think anyone could get him, like a street beggar and best friend of Fagin. The music is fantastic, especially Fagin's numbers, I am also grateful that Bill Sikes has not been assigned a musical number, would not help him to be such an evil character. Carol Reed greatly performed Nancy's sticky finish, retaining her as a G film, concealing her beating, but she gave enough to show the violence towards her. This film is charming, charismatic as a music singer, as well as a moving drama that monitors the young man while trying to find his place in life.
