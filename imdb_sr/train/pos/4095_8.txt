Now my friends, movies such as "La Bete" (called "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only work on the old continent :), in this film we see everything: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac, gorilla, in serious terms , his allegory, that people can sometimes be bestial, visceral and brutal, Valerian Borovczik (Director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape, and brutality. It's a stunning film experience, bizarre and a lot of grotesque scenes. For all lovers of European shocking exploitation, I recommend this film. If you like this, I recommend: "Orloff vs. invisible man" and "changed state".
