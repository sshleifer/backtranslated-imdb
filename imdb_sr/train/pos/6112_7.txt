It's primarily a chicken, it's a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between these two things. This film has the addition of some pretty sweet fighting scenes, I do not think any wires have been used or that it was not straight. It's not a terribly complicated movie so it's easy for the brain, there's no need to analyze anything to get a deeper meaning, quite simply, good chemistry between traces and a fun watch. I would love to have made a report on the full potential of girls looking only once, because it can be incredibly sweet, but throughout the movie they maintain that it is a low key species. I'd watch again ... with a girlfriend.
