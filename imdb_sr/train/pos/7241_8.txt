Paul Lukas played a Russian intellectual who lived as a waiter in the Great Sleme, directed by Villy Dieterle (1933). It's a surprisingly funny satira of building a celebrity personality. A waiter and a girl with a hat in a Russian restaurant played by Loretta Ioung become American souls as partners who do not make any quarrels. With the help of a publicist and spy writer 'Speed' McCann (miraculously dead Frank McHugh), they become adverts for walking For the "Stanislav System," as the "system" of bidding, what feels like < (since the offers are not rational, there are no grounds for accusations of their nonsense). Duel with displaced bridge guru Cedric Van Dorne (sounds close to Goren, right?). and I suppose that the choice of the name of the character "Stanislavski" was also broken up in some other type of system), the outspoken charlatan well played by Ferdinand Gottschalk, is broadcast on radio stations throughout America as a rewarding fight by Roscoe Carnes (another great actor in the 1930 comic book -ih). The bridge players are even on the engraved square, although the audience is above them, as opposed to the boxing "rings." A wide selection of American types has been prefigured by Preston Sturges comedy, although for the production of celebrities, "Grand Slam" most calls for two better films from the same (pre-Code) era with Lee Tracy playing fast-talking publicists: " Semi-naked truth "and" Bombshell ", but" Grand Slam "has its moments, especially for anyone who played a bridge with serious points. Loretta Ioung was already a horse for clothes. (It seems to me that her face is a little long and a horse, too. The idea of ​​the second era of beauty, I suppose ...) Film Unfortunately all except Glende Farrell's stroke, who plays McHugh's forgetful girl.
