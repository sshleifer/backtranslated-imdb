With a minimum budget, eight minutes of work and a great amount of imagination, Nacho Vigalondo has achieved one of the fastest short trousers I've ever seen. The subtlety of the script is truly remarkable, because it does not end until the last moment. Do not let anyone tell you what it is about, because you will be much more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his solo exhibition: directing, writing and acting in this impressive short film is the most significant effort I have seen for years. Also pay attention to the performance of Marta Belenguer, her reactions are incredible. Overall Rating: 8/10
