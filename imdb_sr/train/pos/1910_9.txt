And a. That's what I think. Of course it was a great show with John in it, but I personally think it's better without it. > When John was still nearby, I did not laugh as much as I do now. It is a pity that it is no longer done. (I do not mean ...) because I would like to see some new material. My favorite character must be Rory. Rory is almost always omitted. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT ABOUT RORY !!! ??? Frankly, this is a great show and you have to go and watch it for everyone who has never seen it. I almost guarantee you laugh. It even smiles.
