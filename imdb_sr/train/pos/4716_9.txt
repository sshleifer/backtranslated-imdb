This movie is too funny, totally non-PC gangster romp. If Mel Brooks was painting the mafia in the 30s, he would probably look like this. Too many excellent memory lines, and although this is not for everyone, there is no pulse for anyone who is not allowed to complete the whole bunch of times. Well, put it on and LAUGH you Iceholes !!!
