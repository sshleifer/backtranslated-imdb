I do not understand your remarks on this movie. It is a tense, exciting extension of the character created in the "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story that is least unrealistic is the fact that Charon Stone is still alive, not in prison on this late date. SPOILER ALERT: As the movie progresses, we are presented with three theories about what is happening: 1) Character Sharon Stone kills all these people because he is crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) a broken policeman David Thevlis kills these people to frame the character of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey's analyst kills these people for revenge. What disturbs most people about the film seems that none of these theories have ever been explained as a "real" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric institution for the murder of a policeman, the only murder that happens on the screen.) I think this is a brilliant story in the spirit of "2001, the Odyssey of the universe." Who cares what is really? The blonde is really crazy, the cop is really guilty and the analyst really wants revenge. What is important is the interaction between these and other characters in the story. Like real life, everyone is more complicated than any thought and reality is more complicated than a movie. Get over!
