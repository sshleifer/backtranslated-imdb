Well, what can I say, this film really did, it's not that bad, as many people say, I really liked it, although the idea is so simple and pretty boring, it's not. First I enjoyed the soundtrack (Brian Adams), it's really going with the movie. Another simple story and drama of the Spirit attracts your attention. The one thing I like the most is that they have not given the human voice a voice to interact with other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, there are not many animations that now look realistic? I know, making animals with a conversation is just so ... chrome. One of the most beautiful animations from 2002 in my opinion, I recommend it to everyone, and not just to children :) because it is very relking.
