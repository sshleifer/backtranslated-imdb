I'll never forget when I saw this title in the video store ever since. I was always a big fan of Veird Al and when I saw this video I rented it and watched it. I was too young to appreciate all the Al's subtle humor and satiety at that time, but I remember much later when I was old enough to figure out what I was looking at. If you are a fan of "Al", especially his previous work, you will enjoy this movie completely. This is done in the MTV-eskue "Rockumentary" style and tells a true (but sometimes excessive) story of how Al came to where he was in 1985. his music.
