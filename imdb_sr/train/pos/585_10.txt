After I looked at this film again, this time seemed to me infinitely superior than the time before when I watched it. The acting is stunningly beautiful. The characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is just as brilliant as a rebel son who fights. Other actors and actresses are equally fine in every way. Robert Redford creates a wonderful piece of speech from the twentieth century. The landscape is incredibly beautiful from the mountains and the west of Montana. All in all, this is one of the best movies from the 1990s. You need to look at this movie! <br /> <br />
