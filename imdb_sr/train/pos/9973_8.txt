I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' as opposed to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version pretty boring. If I can climb in the middle of the movie several times (as I did with the 1971 version) than me, it's not that great. Of course, this could have been due to the fact that I was only nine years old at the time the 1971 version came out. However, I saw many remakes, where I liked the original and the older ones. I discovered that the 1997 version of the version was more understandable and that it remained basically authentic to the original without disturbing the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version had more excitement and was not so "blas".
