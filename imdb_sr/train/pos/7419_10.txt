Based on the reviews I saw, I went to "Shower" expecting a cute little comedy; What I discovered is a deeply moving drama of family life told in some of the most beautiful photos I've ever had the privilege of seeing. In addition, later thinking made me appreciate the sudden cut in the scenes of the past (in the arid end of northern China, and in the highland of Tibet): does not this remember so often? I'm here for a moment, I'm following a landscape from the past, just so .... I would not just strongly recommend this film, but I'd place it among the two. or the three best films I've seen in my 60s. By the way, a few years ago, in America, another Asian "comedy" like "Do we dance?" was released. (Japanese). As with "Shower", the review did not give the slightest indication of the depth of that film, which proved to be a subtle psychological study (though full of funny moments). Is there a fear for the distributor that the movies look too "important" or "deep" to like US viewers?
