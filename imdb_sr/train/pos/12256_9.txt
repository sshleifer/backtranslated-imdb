Kate Beckinsale is great as a manipulative but irresistibly charming Emma in this television adaptation of the novel Jane Austin. When I read that novel, I was sometimes quite doubtful whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered a heroine story: for honestly, she is so terribly self-righteous and intrigued that she is tempted to dislike her seriously. Kate Beckinsale's interpretation, however, saves Emma from herself so that she says: she is shown with her innocence and generosity of her character in full view, and can not help but can not be given as (do not say love) in spite of her less friendly qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main, but not the only reason why this series is so beautiful; Raimond Coulthard is as perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, expressing the personal magnetism of this character completely (which is even more pronounced because Evan McGregor did not properly handle this role in Emma's 1996 emission), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Villiams is everything that should be in their roles. This production is, in short, a great achievement and one is to watch many times with increasing pleasure.
