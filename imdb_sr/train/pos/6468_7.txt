This is a pretty good movie ... some parts are lame and extremely handsome, and the movie does not justify the great actor (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor who really impressed me was Kai Kai Menon (he must not be confused with the singer KK). In the scene where I first met Amitabh's character, I thought that a man who can only look at AB, to stun, not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, he again proved to be worthy of Sarkar, along with AB for the second time. This guy should get more roles, he's brilliant. If you have read some other reviews here about IMDb, you already know the plot, and I agree that Akshaie Khanna's entry to Pakistan was a bit too easy. And a little love corner that he shared with "what-is-face" is completely unnecessary. But he is a pretty good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjai Dutt is cool to watch, always. and AB ... what to say. I do not know if I'm his biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for the place. An interesting watch, given that it is Bollivood, although slightly inspired by the Hollywood olds as "Great Escape" and "Bridge on the River Kvai".
