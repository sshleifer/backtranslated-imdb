Things to Come is an early Sci-fi movie that shows the imaginary world, or "Everytime" for 100 years. You can split it into around 4 different scenes or pieces. The film extends from 1940 to 2036, and mainly refers to how this ruler or "boss" wanted to regain flight in the airplanes, after everything was bombarded and a war broke out. Only this movie has about 3 errors: the sound is muddy and the video has some fever, the characters are not at all deep, and the overall action is not quite solid. The plot lacks something that I can not put my finger ... it looks just a little "flaky". But if you love science-fantastic and you are interested in what H.G. Vells may have happened in the next hundred years, this must be seen. It's worth looking at just to find out what everyone was afraid of: a long, exhausting war, because they just wanted to wage war with Germany, and there was a threat to biological weapons and everything else. The things that come are a pretty good movie that most people should see once.
