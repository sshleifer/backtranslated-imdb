One of my favorite films has begun to date as an adventure through the wild side of the team of four men from Atlanta. The idea that the Chulavasse River lives before it turns into a lake comes from Levis Burt Reinold, who unconsciously drowns his boys in their worst nightmare. But if the first half of the movie looks like an action movie, the other half carries the viewer in a completely different story, with our men who are forced to make the decision to (know) that they will forever change their lives. In very bad ways. At the end of the film, every person will be forced to deal with the scars of what was yet to be quite a weekend on the river, but muffled in the struggle for survival. The film (apart from some pretty obvious nonsense) is very well directed and beautifully shot in the nature paradise that steals your breath. And the photo is great. Voight, Reinolds, Coke and Beatty are excellent in showing how one event can be destroyed in different ways of four different lives that are related to the same mistake.
