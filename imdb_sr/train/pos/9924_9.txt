Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new to the cinema world. I enjoyed a lot of film because of the intricate plot, the different characters and the intense effects of the camera. I've seen some people complain about the camera and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, colorful and wild images were the culmination of mistakes made over time. Everything you see is the desired effect. Some may complain that something similar has never been done before, although this is what distinguishes it. In one deeper aspect, what you see is how Domino can see things through the eyes, thinking about it. When it comes to the story, I do not see anything wrong with it. In spite of its "untidy" nature, according to some, it is in fact only a quick form of narration. The plot is not so difficult to follow if you are actually focusing on what's happening. Maybe I'm just because I watch movies from many different aspects, such as acting, plot, etc. I'm not an "interpreter" or anything else that takes me movies, it just comes to me. With these words, I believe this is a really great movie, despite the fact that the future is cult classic, blockbuster, or whatever. I believe actors are great because everyone is doing fine jobs that effectively portray their characters, that's what makes the film ladies and gentlemen. All the characters are very unique and plus is that you are witnessing a small part of each of their lives, to separate them even more. Basically, I personally liked the actors and characters. All those who throw and burn this movie may not see it as me, or they just do not like it. Regardless, this is a great movie in your own right, no, it's a great movie period.
