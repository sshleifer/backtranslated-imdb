I just can not figure out how great matting Valter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It's like the movie does not need extra characters at all because you can never get tired of the dialogue between the two. Lemmon has already been in several famous films such as g. Matthau was fresh from his Oscar for The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder movie also with Lemmon). This film was not as good as this, because the story could not last for such a long time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this goes on in a fast hour and a half, although the introduction of the events that led to Lemmon ended up in Matthau's apartment for a long time (as well as this sentence). It's a tiny bit of disappointment, although for the rest of the running time you have a great time. I already wrote a comment on how the tracking of this movie is shit and I will not go deeper. in that. The reason why this is so joy is that the film was made just as the innocence of American films began to fade into oblivion quickly. There are some sexual references, but treat them in such an innocent way that you can not even get "Well, I Never ..." from the smirked person there. It's fun to watch a movie from a long-lost era, and that's probably why the sequel did not work because Matthau and Lemmon said a few f-words and that just does not fit them. Of course, both of them are now gone and you can be happy that you can still enjoy such a wonderful movie. I think he is the only male actor in this still alive movie, John Fiedler. Edelman recently died. So you have it. Simply one of the best comedies and movies ever. Add: Recently I learned that John Fiedler died, so he is deeply sad to all fans. I did not mean any disrespect and try to be more careful what I was blah blahing next time.
