An astoundingly interesting Western director who had little peers in the genre. Similar to other Anthony Mann images, The Far Countri combines a powerful story of cooking a pot with skillful knowledge of the landscape's impact. Both of which play some of Man's faults, such as honor, integrity, betrayal, and, of course, death! The story shows the charity partners Jeff Webster (James Stevart) and Ben Tatum (Valter Brennan) who travel to the Oregon Territories with the stock of cattle. Conscious of the flowering golden boom, they are planning to earn net profit by selling cattle in the city of Klondike. When they arrived in Skagvai, they found a self-styled judge, Mr. Gannona (John McIntire), who is ready to fulfill Webster's justice because Webster violated the law, all for a fair reason, by the way. The punishment Gannon takes partners from them, but they steal and pass them over the Canadian border with Davson with Gannon and his people in search. Here, beautiful women and a meek and lawless city will fulfill the fate of all involved. Interesting from start to finish, Far Countri is of great benefit from the anti-hero James Stevart who awaits the display and the Mann Slick direction of the borden chase scenario. Cinematography by Villiama H. Daniels is superlative, there has been no favors with current DVD prints, and the film has a few surprises and "Will he do it?" the core in which viewers enters. Paying dividends to re-watches for fortified fan genres, there still remains something important for spectators entering the wonderful, still dark, western world of Anthony Mann and James Stevart. 8/10
