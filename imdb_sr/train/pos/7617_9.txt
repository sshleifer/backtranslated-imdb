Very addictive series. Never before did I see the exact combination of drama, action, uncertainty, and science-fiction fantasy. I'm impressed with every chapter. The script is very intelligent, I do not know how the creators invented all these incredible stories, each character has a strange past, troubles, turbulent relationships, giving the show the human sense needed to create intimate characters. The most unlikely is that all the characters are interconnected: the numbers that they had previously met without knowing, and so on. The rest, the enigmatic security system and the Darma Initiative are elements that do not allow us to lose the chapter. Mr.JJ Abrams, what did you mean to make this incredible story?
