I spied on this short film on the best New Zealand short trousers DVD, all great, but The French Doors was amazing. It starts slowly and you wonder if something will happen. Just as you relax in a home-renewal drum, the most common thing is happening. EEEEkkk, I wanted to stop watching, but I was glued. Films descend into the underlying fear of the dark and with small, if not with special effects. It got you to the bone. A simple but brilliant concept opened all those memories when I was young and dreamed of the most challenging but spooky situations. Film creators of the visual style are buzzing, and the main character takes you convincingly through the story. It's a short quality that I have not seen yet. French doors have all the features of excellent features, unfortunately, they end in ten minutes. Never a big ending that asks you to want to know more. I loved it and did it well and thanks for the ride. These New Zealanders really make talents. New fan.
