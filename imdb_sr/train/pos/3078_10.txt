I loved this show ... smart acting, smart dialogue, great story with the right people ... please bring it back or make it available online ... really miss it .. I hope Davis really shines in this show . I like the idea of ​​SIXTH AMOUNT ... It really makes sense in this crazy world. Get rid of those stupid reality shov and give this chance another chance. Please, return it. When it came out of the air, I watched the web and I liked how I can watch it with minimal interruptions, in fact, online ABC makes it easy to enjoy the shows when you miss them in a hitting term ... the days of endless shooting have disappeared. Whenever you want to get her back, I'm ready.
