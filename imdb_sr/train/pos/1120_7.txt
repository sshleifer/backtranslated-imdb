It should not be confused with the same British black comedy that was released in 1994. But this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the peasant in the '80s. The plot goes = 4 nursing girls in Florida are planning a spring break of life, but they have plans put on hold when one of them testifies about the murder of a local woman, and when she sees that she is seen, so let's say that it becomes a deadly game of cats and mice, and things get even worse when it turns out to be a local sheriff. The shallow tomb is in my opinion one of the most exciting slasher that came out in the 80s, especially the late 80's, when slashers somehow started downhill, this was one of the few that did not even this the film should be more famous, the damage is not. This is a movie that actually confuses stereotypes (just try to guess who will be the last girl - I completely mistaken). The principle is appealing to everyone, and it's one of those movies that somehow hope that everyone will escape, which, of course, they do not. This, in combination with the fluffiness of the first half-hour of the jar (in a good way) with some flash of real bugs (second killing gives a real earthquake) and some unexpected sleaziness (although this is not a high budget thriller I did not expect a scene in Toples where the woman strangled by her own bras (accompanied by a hysterical religious radio), in a film from the late 80's. There's one or two bad things about this movie, but not bad just a little, like sub plots with two teenagers that do not go anywhere and the end that was stupid and the inability of the deputy to follow the logic. In SHALLOW GRAVE there are no sharp tools, but, at least in my opinion, it's a skater that goes through and through. The scenes in which girls are hunting through the forest by the malicious sheriff are tense and exciting. All in all, a very pleasant and valuable slasher, with great performances from all four main girls and that psycho sheriff.
