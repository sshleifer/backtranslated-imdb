I never tried to watch this movie in cinemas, although I remember I heard the name over and over again. I finally watched him this week and what a pleasure. For some reason, I expected it not to be very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and got stuck with it, and then I found myself completely withdrawn. talk about her fight in the ring, but what's wonderful with Diana is that she is a real fighter in her life. All she has to do is find her place where she is, and the ring helps her get there. A very intelligent story and I am amazed that this is the first time that Michelle Rodriguez - a great job. Adrian and her coach were also pretty good. This film is a bit rough around the edges, but it's not the least important. Story, will and performance completely outperform any defects (which usually come with an indie movie). A striking portrait of a girl who found and won over her circumstances and K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
