This movie has never attracted the attention it deserves, although this is one of the best pieces of the ensemble of the actors, and one of the most realistic stories I've ever seen on the screen. Clearly shot on a small budget in the right V.A. The hospital, the center of the story is Joel, very well played by Eric Stoltz. Joel is paralyzed in an accident on a motorcycle and comes to the hospital to the ward with other men who have spinal injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, her married lover, played by Helen Hunt, who shows the early signs of her later work at the Academy. Although Joel-Anna's relationship is a basic focus, there are many other well-developed characters in the department. Vesely Snipes does a huge job like angry Raimond. Even more impressive is Villiam Forsithe as a bitter and racist Bloss. I think that the two best scenes of Forsithe are when he becomes frustrated and angry with dancers, and later, when he feels sympathy for a young Korean who was killed in a beverage shop. My favorite scene with Snipes is discussed at the round table on sexual options after injuries. Chemistry between Stoltz and Hunta is very strong, and have two very intimate, but not free sex scenes. The orgasm in the department is both sexy and fun. There is another unforgettable scene in which Joel and Bloss and a Korean boy took a specially equipped van to the comic bar. It is truly a comedy of mistakes while its poor attempts to bring the van to see "naked ladies". The story is even harsher due to the fact that the director, Neal Jimenez, is paralyzed in real life. This is basically his story. This movie is real, not great or vague. To have such an amount of talent in a movie so small a budget is astounding. I recommend this film to everyone I see, because this is one of those films that even improve in a different way. It's a shame that such a big deal is overlooked, but through the video, it may get the attention that he so deserves so much.
