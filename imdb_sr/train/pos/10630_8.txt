I think it's sad that the leading comments on this film include the words "Clueless and appalling nonsense". I think it's a very fun movie and great fun. We must suspend the disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian may fall in love, have a baby and live together happily for the rest of their lives. But it's always great to see how he plays in the movie and his heart is heated. Is it impossible? Far are the inconceivable events described in other films. The acting is good, the script is ridiculous. The only negative comment is that the story could end when the family moved away from their home, instead of investigating whether a person retains the rest of homosexuality.
