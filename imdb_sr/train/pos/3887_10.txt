I managed to record this from my satellite, but I would like to get an original release in a format that we can use here in America. Eddie is really famous in this performance from San Francisco. I do not remember laughing so much in a steady routine. My wife and I enjoyed this ribbon and his work on Glorious just wanted to buy a copy and help Eddie financially through my purchase. We need more of his shows.
