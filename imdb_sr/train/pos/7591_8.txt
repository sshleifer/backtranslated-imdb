Disorder of genres, but mostly based on Stephen Chov's genre genres for inspiration. There is a magical kung-fu, a romance college, a sport, a gangster action, and some melodrama for a dressing. Production is great and pacing is fast, so it's easy to get through many flaws in this movie. The baby is abandoned near the basketball court. The homeless man brings him to the Shaolin Monastery in the middle of the city, along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless person somehow has but can not read. The old monk teaches a boy, but he points out when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a fake kung-fu master who is assisted by four strange monks. The new master is angry at the now 20-year-old boy because he did not pretend he was injured by the bad blows of the master and threw him to the night. He found the boy throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance from a man who brought him to the gangster club to play a darts. This leads to a great struggle, the boy's escape from the monastery, and the decision of a man to turn the boy into a basketball basketball. the first 10 minutes. In addition to extreme stereographic narration, the first problem is how little we meet with the main character to the end of the film. The man who uses the boy is sharply defined by the end of the first third. The action does not follow any new ground, except for the crazy action climax of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how wretched monks will come to an end. The effects, photos and stunt work are top-notch and compensated for an uninspiring complication. Stephen Chov has a much better command for complication and comedy, and this film will live in his shadow, but this is not a good reason to be ignored. It's pretty fun even with the ending of the skater. Recommended.
