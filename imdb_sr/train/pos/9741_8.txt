I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that "How to lose friends and alienate people" is nowhere near as "brutal" comedy as the trailer forced me to expect. I quickly got into the development of narration and remained preoccupied. The movement of more visual witty content was, I thought, obvious. (I think I got the impression that I testified to Pegg's attempts to restore lost control 'in real time', so to speak.) In other moments, there was time for sharing the main protagonists (ie Peggs and Dunst) of thinking about how events affected them and what led them to where they are now. All the characters were well thrown, to some extent interesting and in and of themselves, and generally pretty cute. (Every obvious merciless ambition shown was a tendency to alleviate the proper good natural resistance.) A fun, intelligent scripted, brilliantly directed and top-notch acting film that I would fundamentally recommend.
