I'm surprised to see a fairly low grade for this movie. For the first time I've seen this movie in 10 years and it reminded me of why I like it. Come back with me, kids, at a time when Michael Keaton was a real comedy, and you might find joy in this movie. It's a gentle comedy - the kind Ron Howard has specialized in - but if it's your thing, it needs to be checked. Keaton's charm is right for this project. "Gung Ho" is a bit outdated, because it is taking place at the last stage of the pre-global economic world, when it was still important what the country in which the business was based. It was, however, mocking, as well as a lesson about how people can learn from one another, to great benefit. Especially you liked the scene, but that's because the whole movie provides a slow, but constant flow of laughter. It's like I.V. drip. And I mean it in a good way.
