I have to admit - the only reason I bought this movie was because I'm a big fan of Gackt and * a huge * fan of Hide. I was expecting a good movie with a lot of footage that was, to say so, a nice woman's eye, but a bit cheerful story. I mean, the synopsis sounded really there. And now that I've just finished watching - I feel the need to tell the world about its brightness! Hide and Gackt both gave performances, and my eyes were still hot from the wages that lasted during the last half of the film. You get into the story, and you feel that the characters are in the end. The element of the vampirism - which I love, but it is very easy to exaggerate or destroy the film - is subtly blended in the story to make it something exotic, normal for this setting, and not by accidentally unnecessary addition of the story. First I rang him to 9 out of 10 ... and then I came back and tried to figure out why I did not give the last point. There was nothing. So ten out of ten is. After all, I'm not really a critic - the fact that I'm really trying to write a review means that I either really hate a movie or really love it. You can tell me which side I'm with Moon Child.
