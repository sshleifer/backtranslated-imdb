Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the South Park creators, come back with something completely different. They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as a baseball. It's like basketball other than baseball rules. Included and there is another letter in the title. Here's how you play: you just shoot the ball as these two guys try to deter you from making the bullet. Sounds simple. In fact, maybe I'll try one day. on the streets, it soon becomes a huge success. Who would know that 2 immature friends can invent a sport that has become so successful? My Opinion 'Basketball' is a very rough and stupid joke filled with a lot of violent slapstick, but it actually brings some laughter and lots of fun. A definitive recommendation for those of you who love slapstick and rude humor.
