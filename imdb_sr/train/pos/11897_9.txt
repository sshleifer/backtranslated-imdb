This is a nice little horor movie that fans of indie movies really appreciate. He has a good acting, much worse and decent complication. One will recall movies such as The Hills Have Eies and Pumpkinhead. Obviously, the budget was not so great, but the film really compensates for the atmosphere and solid performances of actors, which seem to be missing many of today's big-budget films. The film is really moving and there's a great direction and good camera work. There are no lost scenes, so the length of the movie is a bit short. In addition, the finish seems to leave a hole to continue, which would also be very interesting. So take popcorn, turn off the lights and enjoy this.
