This is another film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual for his earlier films - an actor with some stars. Richard Vidmark, Jean Peters, and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of communist agents who try to extract secrets from America - and they will not stop at nothing to succeed. with Peters on a subway car that was followed by federal agents. They know she's a link in a long chain of espionage. Everybody is an unknown joker in the equation - a little pocketbar (Vidmark) is also on the train and he manages to steal secrets that Peters wears. Vidmark thinks it's just another bag he searched - only later he realizes the seriousness of what he has stolen. Now Vidmark himself is - with the Commissars and the FBI on his trail. Vidmark and the rest are exceptional and the movie is caught from beginning to end. Although she did not get a top-class payment, the Thelma Ritter should be mentioned in particular. This supporting actress might have had the performance of her life as a dove. She rarely got the chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a rotten and sad old lady. - but with a small exception. At first, I loved the way Vidmark and Peters were interacting. It's one of a few times on a movie where you will see a woman who hit her mouth! It's hard now. Later, inexplicably, they become stunningly close-too close to be persuasive. However, with such a great drama and so effective a movie similar to Noir, this can be ignored. Watch this movie.
