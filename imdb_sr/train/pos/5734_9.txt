I consider myself a great admirer of the work of David Linch because it provides absolutely unique films to the viewers with typical "Linch elements". Seeing most of his works, I naively thought I could predict Linch's next step. I was dead. Dumbland is something I could not even imagine under the name of David Linch. However, after my recovery from the first shock, I began to think about this extremely primitive main character, and I came to the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust shown here reflected the bits from reality, emphasizing them distorting. There are things in our lives that we hardly ever emphasize, because they are either disgusting or terrible; however, they surround us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these parts. This is not a movie to enjoy, although you will sometimes laugh from a strange, distorted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of all things that we refuse to observe, simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it as it is, you do not have to love it. It just exists. Lastly, if you are careful enough, you will also find elements typical of Linch. I recommend it for tolerant people !!!
