I originally watched 8 simple rules about the Disney Channel UK for the first series and I was completely hooked. When they did not show it anymore, it was annoyed, but then abc 1 sat showed the second series. I did not think that the second series would start after I read John Ritter, but the second series was not surprising that the latest series was returned to the old excellent standard. I hope that it will soon produce more shows, although I could watch every show a thousand times. Kalei Couco is my favorite character as airhead Bridget and also performs incredibly in Charmed. Rory is also good, he also shares my name and Gramp. I'll continue to watch it until it's over, then I hope it will continue as funny as ever
