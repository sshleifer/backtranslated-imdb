Industry has put the ball on this. The trailer does not work for film justice, and when it opened, it was on the hand of a full screen. If people had the opportunity to see this, the mouth would have made it very successful. The two leading actors give great emotional performances that really attract you in the story, and especially characters. I checked this based on the recommendations of Richard Rooper or Ebert and Roeper in his book. An example of a great movie that has never been fully publicized except on a few screens. Which did not give her a chance to see her. Some movies are fast on video because they are not that good. This is an Oscar worthy and it's a tragedy at many levels, most of which will never even be heard. It may be through the mouth through a DVD or cable. If you have not seen this movie, you should. The great performances of the two leading actors make this film. It could have been just another formal teen movie after school special, but instead stands well for other high-profile films. My girlfriend falls on my mind. If you like that, you will be pleased. Both girls are in one incredible emotional scene for another without melodramaticity. Although Alicia is angry and Deanna cries through most of the movies, it's such a real way to not separate themselves as stereotyped characters or as melodramatic. The movie will run you in many scenes, and if you're an actor who's tough, use these real performances as your school. Erika is even better than in traffic. I hope that both these actors get more roles that use their talents and allow them to shine. Watch this movie and, if you like, recommend it to your friends not to get lost among all the shots that appear every year. This film is buried while Spiderman 2 is at the top of the board. What are we talking about? AGHhh. So, the world would be right again and recognize it.
