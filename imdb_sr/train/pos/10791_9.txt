A true hero of modern times, Chuck Norris left TV "Valker, Rekas Ranger" and looks for new steps for his art career. The president's man is the second movie of the future TV series, with Norris in the lead and with young actors such as Jennifer Tung or Judson Mills (one of the young Valcer's Ranks). The old master teaches the young aspirant. This is one of the most powerful themes of the "President's Man." In this team, the "Line in the Sand" reached a world surprise for his record of terrorism in the United States, a few months before the tragic September 11th. Eric Norris, Chuck's son, is the director. The film is fun, good action, lots of fighting and heroism. Chuck Norris has many plans for the future. The bells of innocence, his next picture, will be next. <br /> <br />
