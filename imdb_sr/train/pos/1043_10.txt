Ever since I can remember and have only 18 years, my mother and I were and we continue to watch older movies because I consider them much more useful in the long run (but do not realize that I do not like films I have today just as not as much as I love the films of the 40's and 50's) Anyway, now I must say the moment when I started to watch a movie my eyes were glued to the TV. Of course, my favorite character was the Grandma, who played Lucile Vatson. But I liked the way they portrayed Betty Davis and her family. Children ... have not even acted as children at least. But for that there is a good reason, you have to hide and start the greater part of your life, watching terrible things that children have seen in those days have destroyed their innocence. So people who say "oooo i hate how the children behaved ... blah blah blah" read between the lines and know they saw things that children should not see. Paul Lukas ... dear Paul has done an incredible job !!! Now I know that many people are crazy that he left the Oscars and Boggy is not, but hey both worked incredible jobs so I think he could go. But Lukas's performance was so incredible that I tired of tears to the end of the film. I loved this film so much and I recommend it to everyone! : -D
