This movie has a great acting, great photo and a very powerful story that really makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you fit, whether you accept to play a role or get rid of ... There are already great comments that are deal with these aspects. I want to comment on the formal setting of the film. Basically, these are two people on the roof. There is a unity of place and time, with two protagonists, and he worked as a choir. Many directors have turned Greek tragedies into the film, many filmmakers have recorded contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director, in my opinion, failed as wonderful as Ettore Scola in approaching the purity and power of the great Greek tragedies. in the story and formal environment. Masterpiece.
