I absolutely love this movie and I really would like to have it one day. It's just a fascinating legend about the eagle carrying a turquoise necklace, I loved it and I would like to see her again! I do not remember too much about it, but the Indian boy lives in a beautiful village with his family, and I do not remember what is happening, but he should come out alone in the desert. His sister packs his food and he leaves. While he's out there, some other guys from India run out and put him on feathers, and he turns into an eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle carrying a turquoise necklace, it's a boy. I've always been fascinated by legends, especially the legends of American Indians, and I'd love to have this one released on DVD one day.
