As a drunken playwright Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as an adult man trapped in childhood. As it turned out, the role fit perfectly to him, as well as the actor. Soon there were many disappointments (including the fading sequel to this film), but this does not diminish the charm or attractiveness of this image, which is wisely written and directed. Some of Moore's drunken scenes are forced, parts of the film are uncertain, but the actors come up with so much pleasure that it's hard to withstand the movie. He has a great heart and gives the Oscar winner John Gielgood a cunning, funny role as Arthur's maid, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a marvelous relationship. Liza Minnelli (as a love interest) is loud in a low-key, and Moore is cute but smart and alive; Shadow Arthur has never shaken, but at least we have this high-level career document. *** from the ****
