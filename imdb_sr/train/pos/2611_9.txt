This is widely accepted in Australia as one of the finest police drama ever produced here ... and for my money, anywhere. It's raw, big, the characters are real, the situation is convincing and it is not ashamed of the dark side of the life that police and criminals, victims, lawyers and other people in their various orbits face daily. > <br /> This show lasted 2 seasons and was interrupted because the show did not sell well abroad. We are all sorry for his loss: however, like Favlity Tovers, we will be able to respect him as a series of limited lengths of evenly high quality.
