This film was great and I wanted to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. A boy has to feed himself and take care of the eagle until he is old enough to be sacrificed for crops. The boy rescues the eagle not to be killed and escape from the tribe. The eagle helps him feed by picking up a duck from a small pond that the boy fears. Later the boy fires on a deer who claimed that the thugs claimed that the arrows were very close to them. Only until he checks the thickness of the red lines determines who actually got the deer. But this was unfortunate because other boys were even more cruel to him, and eventually he was persecuted on the cliff, but when you think that his true love for the eagle will turn him into a golden eagle from the Necklace as a reminder of who was . Please, if anyone knows where to buy this movie, please let me know. I have not seen him for more than 30 years, but I still remember parts of film.deniselacei2000@iahoo.com
