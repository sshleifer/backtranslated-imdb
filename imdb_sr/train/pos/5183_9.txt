This film is one of my favorites. I saw this while I was in college in the early nineties, and although I could not identify myself with thirty times in the film, I felt that the story, characters and the movie were top-notch. To people who have been negatively speaking about the Indian summer, feel free to hold your exaggerated films of the Armagedon type and leave movies with a great, healthy story to those who value them.
