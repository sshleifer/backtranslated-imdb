David Aames is a rich and handsome guy who lives in New York. When Julie Gianni, his sleeping partner, gets very jealous after David falls to the Spanish beauty of Sofia, she puts David in her car and tells him that he is the only guy he loves and wants to be, but since he is in love with Sofia, decided to commit suicide with David in a car with her, riding from the bridge. David survives a collision, but he remains a disfigured person. He was then charged with the murder of Julie. The thing is, David does not know what is real, and what is not, because he constantly has these strange dreams (most of which are actually nightmares) and flashbacks, some of which simply do not make sense. Everything will soon return to him as he begins to find out the truth. Here are all the stars here, including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Ly, and Noah Tailor who all give good performances in the movie. Everyone in the film has put off a lot of different things about characters, such as happiness, sorrow, anger, etc. There's a kite in the brilliant film, Steven Spielberg. Vanilla Ski is a well-made, different, interesting and original movie that will leave you talking about it after completion. It's not just a thriller, it's a real psychological thriller. The movie trailer is really good, but the movie is so different from what it might be. It was directed very well and there were some really great scenes here. All in all, a pleasant movie that should really be dedicated to attention. They surely shot a lot of movies "Are they dead, if not dead".
