I always enjoy this movie when it appears on TV. One scene that always stands out, for me she is with Mirna Loi and the painter's supervisor, where she gives him a very explicit instruction on the colors and as soon as she goes, he turns his boys and says: "Do you you got it, it's yellow, blue, green, and white "
