The bad geeks Marty (Simon Scuddamore) terribly burned up for the brutal acrobatics of April football. The blaze for a decade and those involved (including Caroline Monroe, known to the horror fans for turning into a maniac, without a face and the last horror movie) in a joke are excited about the upcoming 10-year high school gathering that is not aware that the court craze -masked killer is hiding in (now closed) school and coming out of revenge. Chaulk this is to blame pleasure, I knew it was a bad movie. It has all the characteristics of one. Still, there is something about what makes me feel obligated to watch it from time to time (preferably with beer in hand). I am even willing to overlook an absolutely horrible ending (which, I must say, I hate) I think I like because it has a fun atmosphere and some pretty cool murders.
