FREDDI moved from scary to funny, in this sixth edition of the Nightmare series. It's been 2 years, actually 11, since this film is in 2001. The street except one, John Doe (Jacobb from section 5, even the doe movie gives the hint that he is), in which it is used to bring more children to reach the streets of the elm. his daughter returns to the Easter Street. When she finds out what's going on, she and other kids decide to kill FREDDI once and for all. We also see some of FREDDI's nasty wallpapers. Many people hate this movie, but I liked it. He tried to find out what FREDDI worked with his sorcerers ... COMDEI and makes the series funnier than terrible. So this movie is really sick for speaking. It's not a star in the series, part 2 and still holds it. <br /> <br />
