If you get it, it's magnificent. If you do not, it's decent. Please understand that "getting" does not mean that you have gone. at school. There is much more to this film that, sometimes, school shooting becomes insignificant. Above all, it is a film about acceptance, and a superficial - traumatic event, but also people who are different for any reason. It is also a film about unbearable pain and how different people endure it. In this case, the contrast between Alicia's fury and Deannine Obsession creates an atmosphere of such tangible concern that half the film is interested in how the director could draw a happy ending from the hat. Fortunately, the audience was given the credit of being human beings; does not offend our intelligence with a rampant, incredibly moralistic ending. Above and beyond, I'm trying to keep a clear head on movies that are fiction and all that. Still, I must confess that I cried like a lost little baby during this film. There were some things that hit * very close to home and opened some old wounds that were never completely cured. But this is not necessarily a bad thing.
