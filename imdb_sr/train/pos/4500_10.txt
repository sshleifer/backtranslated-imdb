Hunki Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves home to Manchester to be close to her father. By the way, he falls in love with Anne, a 20-year-old woman, and who is by chance his wife, Richard Crane. Despite the warnings from her new colleagues, Owen continues to lead Anna for herself, going so far to sabotage Ann and cheat Richard's marriage. This is a romantic drama with many witty tones and quick intellect. The actors are extraordinary: the green "pupil's prince" and "touching evil" slam on the screen as a cunning, yet cordial Owen; Annis of the "Dune" of fame is lively and proves she agrees well with Green; The To The King's Kitchen is a real threat as Richard, whose comical mistakes and snobbism underscores his masterful, hate-building toward Owen. This is a perfect love triangle, and despite the weaknesses and misconceptions of our three characters, you better go away because you know and watch them.
