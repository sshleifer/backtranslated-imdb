Long before Tim Lahej and Jerry B. Jenkins shook the world of the Christian subculture (and earned millions in the process) with LEFT BEHIND books, MARK IV Pictures, the Christian Evangelist Association of Evangelist Association films Billy Graham mastervork. What I love the most in this genre is his incredible attention to detail, sitting in the living room. Instead of leading us to the dramatic scenes of this "post-infuriating" affliction, we sit in the living room and hear about it on the news, because filmmakers can not show it. The premise of the film is based on pre-Millenial, pre-Tribulation eschatalogi, believing that Christ comes once for secretly taking the right church, and then comes the end of the seven-year hell on earth. What terrified me in high school, now makes me laugh. Patti's intriguing adventures and her trip through trouble (and two of the three sequels of the film) speak of her exceptional story of disbelief and ultimate curse. I hate to admit it, but I still enjoy watching this. Even SIT EKSACT has the result of Monti Python and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in the history who watched it.
