Rob Roi is also an underestimated epic of passion and action! Liam Neeson gives a superb performance like Rob Roi MacGregor, one of the best in his career. Jessica Lange is perfect for writing as his wife Marie. They have the most passion and chemistry I've seen on the couple. Team Roth is one of the best villains on the screen. His rape from Mary is disgusting and disturbing. He's really a magnificent bastard in this movie. scripted ans won, and the direction of Michael Caton-Jones is flawless. 10 of 10
