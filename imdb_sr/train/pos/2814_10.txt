This is the best film ever made to deal with AIDS. It's a documentary about two men who live and die from this illness. The film is beautiful, heartbreaking, ridiculous and incredibly moving. Above all, this is an incredible true love story. Make sure you have several hackies ready before you look at this movie - you will need it. Extraordinary.
