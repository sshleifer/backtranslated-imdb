This is David Zucker's only film that does not lie to any of the first of its kind. The most entertaining film of 98 with Night at the Rockburi immediately after, but I did not think that something about Mary was funny, so that's not counted except for what he and Frank are. Do not listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert, he does not know a good party just look at his criticisms.
