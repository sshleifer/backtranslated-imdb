Last night he watched this French horror movie and he liked it a lot. The whole film takes place in a prison cell with three prisoners who find a manuscript log in the wall of a serial killer who escaped from jail 20 years ago, somehow without leaving the cell. As they look through the diary, they discover that they are dealing with black arts and commands that could be their way out of cell and freedom. What they learn is something completely different and scary at the very least. I love low-budget horror films, which deliver goods in a fairly high-quality way, and tell a good story. This film does exactly that, despite having worked for some time. The result and the horror they had caused me was very interesting, and I enjoyed the ride. It was not much worse, but that would not fit into the story, although it's pretty good up there.
