This is the work of Neil Simon who received many praise! "Unusual Couple" is one of the gems that keeps in itself. You have Felika Ungara (Jack Lemmon); hipohondar, restless fake freak and big thorn on the side of his roommate, Oscar Madison (Valter Matthau); total gad. These people have great jobs. Felix is ​​a journalist, and Oscar is a sports writer. Both of these men are divorced, Felic's wife is nearby, while Oscar is on the other side of the United States (West Coast). So, what can you say? The two men who live together on one roof without madness to each other, is impossible and incredible. It's a lot of fun and fun. I liked it when these two British neighbors were talking to both gentlemen, and after Oscar cast Felix, he was lucky and lived with them when he refused dinner with them the night before. It's time for Felix to be needed. I suppose that the fairy tales are tidy to cheer. They can be restless, but they need to be patient too. A very funny movie and a new classic. Neil Simon "The Odd Couple" is a classic movie that must be seen. 5 STARS!
