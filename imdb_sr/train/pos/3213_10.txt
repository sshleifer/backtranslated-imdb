What a perfect example "Less is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sergeant Todd) has only 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! As a black and white photo, when around your mind needs to fill in the gaps, facial expressions, physical drama, emotional gesture, everything is combined to make it stronger. This is one of the 5 best movies I can not live with, up there with classics like Road Varrior. If you liked this, see "Mad Mak 2, The Road Varrior" and "Braveheart", starring Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was also in the soldier. "The Thirteenth Warrior" is played by Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" in the lead with Harrison Ford.
