What a funny movie! If you are a fan of Gialla, Red Kueen kills 7 times is a real winner. To begin with, it's hard to make a mistake with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both of them are beautiful - especially the unruly Bouchet of wide eyes as a woman who feels guilty for fear of her life. Scenes of killing in the Red Queen kill 7 times are especially nice and have enough blood to make the most fans happy. One of the first murders comes quite unexpectedly and really starts the movie. The killer, Red Queen, is one of the most exciting and interesting killers I've seen in an Italian movie. 70s and fashion sets are lovely. In fact, all the images are interesting, because the funny Red Queen crosses the bridge overnight at one of my favorite moments in the movie. I was interested in the perfect shop. Finally, the result of Bruno Nicolai can be the best I've heard from the composer. The main topic is so unforgettable that I did not manage to get her out of my head for two days. The only two questions I have with Red Queen kills 7 times come in the end of the movie. First, the person responsible for the killings is too easy to see. If you saw more than a pair of Gialli, you will not have a problem finding out who is behind the murders. Secondly, the ending feels somewhat overly and, as a result, a bit confusing. I'm definitely not the one who needs every plot, but I admit I'm at a loss to explain everything. Second viewing can only clarify this.
