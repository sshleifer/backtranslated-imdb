I usually enjoy movies such as "Chances Are", but I was not quite pleased with this for several reasons. The first half was pretty well done, while Alek Finch was dying and was reincarnated into a new body (played by Robert Dovnei Jr.). He meets with his wife (Cibill Shepherd) and friend (Rian O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. Scenes with them meet again, and Dovnei rediscovers who once was well done, and there is a lot of emotions and happiness when Shepherd finally believes her husband is reincarnated, but from there the film goes downhill. There are several sexual scenes that completely rejected me, especially Dovei and Shepherd, wanting to meet again despite the difference in their age. After that, however, the film manages to end up in the most satisfactory way, given the circumstances of the action. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral until the end. This story had great potential, and scenes in the sky were well made. There is a good song singing Peter Cetera and Cher, but in the end, the film is not great. For a better, similar film, try "Heaven Can Wait". Honestly, but I really do not want to see him because of the scenes in the second half. *** from ****
