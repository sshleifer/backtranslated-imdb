If you like "Othello," you'll love this movie because half of the movie is about the stage production of the show. The film has a great role to play with Signe Hasso and Shelley Vinters as a woman in Colman's life while Edmond O'Brien plays an engaging agent for the press. Several supporting players that I especially liked were Millard Mitchell as a seated reporter who sees the corner and Joe Savier, a 1940 response from Drew Carey, who plays a cop on this case. Great moments in this with realistic noir.
