Full House is a delightful series about Dad, Danna Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car accident. So Danny asks his son-Katsopolisa Jesse and best friend Joey Gladstone, to help raise his three girls, Donna Jo "DJ" Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show ever, and I can watch it all day. I have the Full House-it always makes me laugh, and there are sad parts. The Full House in never a dull moment. The main characters are Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sveetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen (Michelle Tanner.
