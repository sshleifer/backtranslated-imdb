This is a gem, a real piece of Americana for everything that implies this. If you are programmed yourself to resist "life" stories, just hold on to it and leave it to others who still believe. And what makes lubrication on cakes is really pleasant is that the fact is based on the real dirt on the story of wealth, there is no need to choose what has been changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and the complex, self-confident, lower order of the father he portrayed could have been successfully performed by someone with his skill and insight. Simple comments, which refuse to accept a father trying to determine the law as long as he feels that he may be out of the way, reveals the limit of commentators, not writers or actors. This is not for cynical, or simply intelligent.
