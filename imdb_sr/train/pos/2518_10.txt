This is, in all categories, the best movie I've ever seen. Forget Hollywood - their movies are always sucked out - it's art! The story of the Moonlight begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire, who despises what has become and lives in denial. His desire for a final death leads him to Mallep, where refugees from several Asian countries live. Here, he meets Shaw, an orphan living on the street. From here, the film is an intense experience that is based on the visual and emotional part of the film. Has all; You laugh, cry, angry, excited, sad, happy ... Never was the film touched by me like this movie. And actors are incredible - I've never heard someone speak so many languages ​​without it sounding strange. Great commendation to the editor for creating this masterpiece ... The last comment on this brilliant film is to starring Gackt (former vocalist Malice Mizer) and Hide (vocalist L'Arc) ~ en ~ ciel ) in excellent roles like Sho and Kei. I am wondering how Gackt can change its way of speaking and acting depending on the age in which it behaves. It needs to be seen. If you never see movies, watch Moon Child, Crov (Brandon Lee) and recently published masterpiece Final Fantasi VII - Advent Children. Of course in the original languages, of course!
