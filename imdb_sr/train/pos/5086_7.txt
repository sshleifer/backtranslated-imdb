When I heard that Patrick Svaize was finally returning to his acting career with King Solomon's mines, I was very excited. I was expecting a great action adventure like Indiana Jones. What I got was an epic 4-hour period (with commercials) that was very slow. The second and third hour could have been completely released and the story would not suffer because of it. The ending was good (there are no spoilers here), but I continued to want more. Well, all he can do is to make Svaize deal with "RoadHouse 2" in order to get back to the genre of the action that celebrated him. Until then, if you are a worshiper of King Solomon's mines than you read the book or watch the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is also not very good, but only one hour and forty minutes of your life disappeared instead of 4 hours.
