Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spent most of her life taking care of her father. Now that she died, she is free - but she does not know what she wants. Boris Boier is a monk who escaped from the monastery to taste more life. They happen accidentally in Algeria, they fall in love and get married. But he can not leave his past behind and she can not live without it ... The road has gone too far with a romantic full of hysterically bad dialogue and situations. Dietrich and Boier are doing their best to give good performances, but NITKO can not get away with some of its lines! Still, in a way, it's a classic. It was shot in the beautiful Technicolor (try to see it on DVD) where every frame is beautifully beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed in nines (even in the middle of the desert) and struck hysterical poses to show clothes and her body. Boier is just walking around watching the affected (there is no shock there). Still, I was never bored. It was great to watch and nonstop stupid dialogue held me in the seams. The place almost fell from my chair because I was so laughing! Now I love rolling romance and I give them plenty of space, but really - this is incredible! It also takes very short 80 minutes. As a classic camp, I give this 8. As a serious film - 1.
