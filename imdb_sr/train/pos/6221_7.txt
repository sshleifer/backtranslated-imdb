Had this movie been better, it would have been worse with the best Astaire and Rogers. As it is, it's a fine movie, but too long with a boring subroutine, i.e. Scott are two navies. Scott first met Hilliard when he looked like a stereotypical librarian, and later, after Ginger Rogers asked his friend (Blue, but the infallible Lucille Ball) to glamor. In the meantime, Astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dance partner are standing. The result is beautiful dance numbers, and Astaire and Rogers as a team, as well as separately: "I put all my eggs in one basket", "Let go," and "I'd rather run a band". Hilliard is sweet, but slightly lethargic like ordinary Jane's glamorous girl, though she sings well her two songs, "But where are you?" and "Get Thee Behind Me, Satan" - one poster did not care for that song, but I love the title. Rogers is lively, and young Astaire is a dynamo. The peak of the film comes to an end with "Let's Face the Music and Dance", one of the most beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly performed by Rogers and Astaire. In it, they reflect glamor and fantasy from the 30's. It really needs to be kept and looked over and over again.
