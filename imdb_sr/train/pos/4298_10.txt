This film impressed me so much at least once a year. Sometimes I feel embarrassed. Sometimes it seems to empower me. And I always find that the characters are human and real. It's a movie that shows you a true life situation in LA, starting with repetitive helicopter search lights that hide the dangers that lie so close to the ordinary lives of the characters. It's also a movie that shows you how kind of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference. The great canyon reminds you that any action you take, either intentionally or not, has strong consequences. I thought this film was in many ways similar to Robert Altman's Short Cut film. Both of them had stars accompanied by actors and actresses, and both films have allowed you to gradually see how the characters are interconnected and influenced one another, for the better or worse. The great canyon has done a better job of providing a cohesive message (hopefully desperate reality) than Altman's film, although I found them both intriguing in their own way. This movie must definitely see !!!
