The mysterious murders in the European village are the result of the fact that the army of the VAMPIRE BAT was burdening the horrific community. This surprisingly effective small thriller has been created by Majestic Pictures, one of the Hollywood studies for poverty. The scanty production values ​​and rough editing actually contribute to its nasty atmosphere and give it almost expressionistic quality. All in all, it leaves the viewer feeling that he is caught in a bad dream, which is suitable for such a thriller. Although the explanation for horrible crimes is quite funny and not due to the proper development of the plot, the film boasts a good vote. Grove Lionel Atvill gives another of his typically fine performances, this time as a doctor working on a scientific research in the old castle. Beautiful Fai Vrai plays her assistant in a role that requires her to do something more than a nice and upset. Dour Melvin Douglas appears as a confused police inspector who is also a handsome little girl, Miss Vrai. Maude Eburne, which could be extremely funny considering the right situation, steals most of her scenes like Miss Vrai's hipochondriac tunt. Older Lionel Belmore plays in fear of the burgers in the village. And the little Dvette Frie, who will always be remembered for his strange roles in the films FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula, is here most effective as a bachelor who loves a bat.
