After all these years, I still regard this series as the best example of documentary filming from the Second World War. Interviews with many participants from all countries distinguish them from any other project. It would be great to see a contemporary documentary (Ken Burns?) To deal with this topic and to try to collect information from veterans before they all disappear. With modern technology to improve old archival footage and a lot of information that was discovered since 1974 when the world was made in war, the updated version of this series would be welcomed. The History Channel has made some fine performances dealing with many aspects of World War II, but an expansion series such as Vorld At Var has not been successfully launched from the original. If you are interested in this era, do not miss this series. It is necessary to watch.
