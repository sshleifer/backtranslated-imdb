I would like to comment on April Love. It's one of my favorite favorites because my father, Nelson Malone, plays a horse coach. I remember clearly when Hollivood arrived in Lexington, KI, where we lived at the time when we made April love. My dad was in numerous performances and he was a talented man. I told him that he would try one of the offered parts, and here he is, he came home with the script. How exciting it is! Also, a number of my colleagues were in mass scenes - especially those shown in an amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the film re-screened, and April Love's song Pat Boone continues to be played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of the long time ago when you see movies that they are making today with all sex, ugly tongue and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April love ...
