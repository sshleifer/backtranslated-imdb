Corbin Bernsen gives an incredibly intense and amazing performance like Dr. Alan Feinstone, a wealthy and successful dentist Beverly Hills who is obsessed with perfection. When he discovered that his beautiful blonde trophy of women cheated him and that the IRS began to bother him about tax problems, Feinstone burst out under pressure and violently walked around the bandage. The director Brian Iuzna, working on a suitable dark, witty and crazy scenario by Stuart Gordon, Denis Paolo and Charles Finch, reveals a scruffy neurosis and a psychosis that sneaks under a creaky, clean, well-maintained surface of a respectable rich American with delicious malice. Moreover, Yuzna additionally spashes terrible events with a wickedly distorted sense of humor in a black shell. Bernsen positively shines like Dr. Feinstone; he sincerely projects a truly disturbing underground grace that lies beneath Feinstone's deceptively quiet and secure veneer. They are excellent and supportive actors: Linda Hoffman as Feinstone's bitch, Brooke's unfaithful wife, Earl Boen as IRS smuggling agent, Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as fearless assistant Jessica, Patti Toi as the conqueror Karen. Virginia Keehne as a sweet, sarcastic teenager Sarah, Ken Foree as a basic, non-stupid detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as Gibbs's equally clever partner Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadswick as a female muffin cleaner for Matt's pool, and Mark Ruffalo as blindly to Steve Landers. The first-class makeup f / k is equally bloody, rude and disturbing as it should be. Levie Isaaks's polished cinema can boast of great crazy camera angles and some delicious zoom-ups. Alan Hovartha's fierce result also hit the place of crawling meat. Pleasure.
