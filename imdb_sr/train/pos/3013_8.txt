Талентированный детектив г. Philo Vance (Villiam Povell) is canceling a trip abroad to investigate a seemingly cropped and dried suicide case for which he has a good reason to suspect that it's really a much more, rather delicious complex murder! As for movies about the mystery of murder, it just can not be better than this. Populated with suspicious characters associated with the dog show and having a good reason to kill the obvious victim of the suicide of Archer Coe, it's really difficult to grasp this or wrap your head around him, but the boy, is it fascinating to watch how it is taking place Before us. Even the police, the coroner and district prosecutor showed that colorful, enriched characters add the level of unexpected realistic realism to this procedure and increase his overall "fun" factor. I especially enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), who always seemed rude and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this time. Also detective Sgt. Heath welcomes, often later wonderfully witty at his own expense, a critical commentary during the Vance investigation. I can not imagine any valid criticism to give this film in fact, except perhaps that it is not particularly well known. It does not prevent the movie from being just fun watching. Watch and see if you can wrap your head around this mystery. We recommend you try it!
