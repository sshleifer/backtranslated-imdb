The film is not visually stunning in a conventional sense. It does not represent a series of beautiful pictures. Instead, it's a visually interesting movie. It forces the viewer to constantly deal with or conceive the context of different shots. Such things are easy to try, but it is difficult to succeed. The film refuses to use a single genre to help less interested viewers get what's happening. Instead, the film touches and moves through different genres. The trick to love the movie is to enjoy this playfulness. I guess 99% of North American viewers just do not get it. If you try to attach a story to this movie, or a philosophical message, or a symbolic structure, etc., waste time. There is none of that. The film only occasionally deals with these genres and others. The only unifying force in the film is Claire Denis's own feeling of what agrees. There are so few feature films that are approaching satisfying Kant's description of art, namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself, rather than simply embracing experiences under the terms. The film usually takes an easier time and decides for a simpler pleasure in understanding what is happening. Most films are not art. Most films are not approaching art. When the film works, as it does, and still enjoys a large number of viewers, this is something amazing. My negative comment is that sometimes I find that the film was too simplified to buy various narrative threads that pass through it. The story of father-son Tahiti, although not quite conventional, ends so that things become clear and simple. It's too dominating.
