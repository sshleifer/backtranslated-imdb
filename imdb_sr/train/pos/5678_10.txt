We can still use Black Adder today. Imagine that Rovan Atkinson continues the role of assistant premier played by beautiful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as dirty Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode host Kenneth Connor plays as a British actor. Every time, says Edmund Macbeth. Two speakers make a stupid little action to defend the evil spirits. These are the funniest things to see. Of course, none of these great and comic geniuses could be without Ben Elton and Richard Kurtis, who are also behind movies like Love Actually, the Thin Blue Line, the Four Weddings, and the Funeral. Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and funny. I was hoping that Hugh Laurie would live up to his British humor live on Saturday evening. If a gang in the SNL did some research, they would know how treacherous Hugh Laurie would pay tribute to their stage.
