I watched McCoy's gathering and I was glad to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! To see them now was wonderful, because I always watched the show grow up so TV said it would be reunion you were eccentric !!!! The only thing I could not figure out was why Lassie McCoy and Michael Vinkelman (Little Luke) were not there. I know that Valter Brennan has died. So I found myself on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site, so if there is someone who can tell me what happened to Lidia Reed (Hassie McCoi) and Michael Vinkelman (little Luke I would be grateful !! Only the thing I could learn about Michael Winkelman was that he should have been born in 1946. This show had a value and morale, and each show had learned a lesson.The whole actor was incredible the only thing that was better than finding a obout, either I would be happy to meet them, because it's impossible if there is anyone who can help please!
