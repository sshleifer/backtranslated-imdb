This was one of the funniest and biggest sitcoms that hit national television. Unfortunately, the show is not among the big sitcoms in which it really belongs. The actors did a great job, and the six to six season was at its peak. Although the seventh season was not as good compared to the previous six, it was still funny. The eighth season was a real problem. Without Topher's grace or Ashton Kutcher, Shov simply broke up. Do not say too much, other actors were not good if either of the two main characters left, such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtvood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are great). show that they will have the same impact. And the inclusion of Randi (Josh Meiers) did not help even because he was not well received by the fans. I believe that if the show ended a year ago, it would certainly have entered history as one of the best comedies. Season 8 was a bit boring, but the finale was great. I will miss the show, I just hope that one day I will wake up to find out that the concert is again on an 80-th show with the same acting, because I will miss the hell.
