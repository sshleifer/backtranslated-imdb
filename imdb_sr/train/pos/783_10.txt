The first thing that comes to mind after watching this movie is "beauty." Beauty is everywhere, in the acting performance (Andie is as brilliant as ever), in well-designed recordings, and in the idea of ​​the red line of the author - Love. I think Kenny's character is the only white spot in these boring and predictable lives. His interaction makes Andie's character live as much as possible. When he left, it became obvious that we can not really appreciate and stick to our inner beliefs and sacred desires. any shape, even in this little British village, which is perfectly shown. Another reason I love this movie is that he is so British in all ways - everything that houses and "fagots" and accents :))). Andie is doing a great job again! It is a shame that this film got such low ratings. 10 out of ten!
