Well, it's time. I really gave up everything and hoped that this episode will feature episode episodes this season. Although there were still too many applications, at least this episode turned out well. It's pretty funny that the director Rob Schmidt, who has only bad bad wrong turn, and writer John Esposito, whose only previous work on the script, included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveiard Shift. provoking episode of the season. In "Right To Die" we are treated the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the beginning of the episode, the couple is leading a conversation. Abbey caught Cliff cheating and he desperately tries to win it. While they talk, they find themselves in a car accident in which Cliff remains with only cuts and bruises, but the abbey was thrown from the car and ignited when a spark ignited the gasoline dripped on it was on fire. And these are just people to set up. Once at the hospital Cliff has to decide whether or not the abbey should live in this state without skin and just nerve reflexes. There is also an adverse effect. Every time it's done, the abbot goes as a ghost and causes troubles to all kinds of people. Hands down this is the best episode of the season and is certainly one of the best episodes ever. From the terrible effects of a tense letters who threw in a couple of turns that I never saw coming and uncertainty so tangible you can almost touch it, right to the mind must have the right to live forever.
