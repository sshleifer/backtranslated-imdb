This movie is wonderful. Writing, directing, acting are all fantastic. A very humorous and smart scenario. Quality performances by actors, Alli Sheedi is strong and dynamic and wonderfully weird. Really original and heart-warm unpredictable. The scenes live with fresh energy and truly talented production.
