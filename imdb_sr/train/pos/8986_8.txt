Anton Nevcombe makes a movie and he's the main theme. Looking at him knocking out the song, if not the entire album, he quickly showed that the guy was a real talent. He thinks that he is a god, but he is so fruitful and interesting. DV is not so interesting in comparison with music or in any other way. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" , Anton tells the cameraman, "So let go of this guitar!". Great use of archive / home video material. It's great to see how rock documents are still made. A cool document about the creative process. If you like this, watch Nirvana live! Tonight! Rasprodato! on DVD. Good experience Anton is this movie. 8 of 10
