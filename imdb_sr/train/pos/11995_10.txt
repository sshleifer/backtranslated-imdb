"Spin it!" The 90s opened up with Smart Disney's favorite, "TaleSpin", a series of cartoons on television featuring characters from the "Jungle Book". Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as you fly by the sea duck like you've never seen: from Cape Suzette, to Louie's, up the mountains, through the jungle, on the water, in the volcanoes, looking for an adventure, looking for mild, looking for fun, all in one action adventure of cartoon !!!!! This was my favorite as my family. This took place at Disney's afternoon during the first half of the nineties, while original cartoons did not move to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on vacation once in 1996 before I got the cable in March 1997. Good news: Today's DVDs are here !!!!! Relive the fun and excitement of "Dun, Dun, Dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" 10/10
