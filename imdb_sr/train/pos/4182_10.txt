I saw this Australian movie 10 years ago and I never forgot it. The film shows the horrors of war in the way Hollivood usually covers. The relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is accentuated by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end, we are not really different. If you can find any kind of copy - buy or rent. You will not be disappointed, just delighted.
