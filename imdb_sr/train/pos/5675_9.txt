Blackadder 3 is probably a Blackadder series that people are least likely to hear - it basically has the same principles as the second and fourth, and there's nothing revolutionary about it. But it's still great - the fiery duke of Vellington and the fat stupid Dr. Johnson (the first dictionaries in England) make up this series with which to count. There are many more hilarious liners in this series, and humor appears in a lesser known era - in historically precise and pleasant episodes. Blackadder's third trip is not the most famous and famous, but the role of Roven Atkinson as a stupid prince's butler is ridiculously and effectively done, and Hugh Laurie is in his best series. Very good! 9/10
