Moon Child was one of the more symbolic films I saw. What really appealed to me is an illustration of immorality / mortality and obstacles and guiding through life. The film shows a large number of vampire Keys who have the power of immorality and advantages for him. Whether it's supernatural abilities or eternal life, that's what people usually want. The Moon's child shows the pain and disadvantages of immortality, since feelings of loss affect virtually all characters, especially the main characters of Shaw and Kei. The meaning of the title 'The Moon Child' reveals how the film approaches the end where it clearly shows that every month is shining in someone else's way, giving directions. I'm a personality that is pretty much like the one on which the film is shown. The disadvantages of the film lie in some parts of the acting and special effects, because the film has made it less authentic. The scene in which Toshi dies can be more powerful and realistic if more authentic feelings are involved in acting. Some scene effects with special effects such as gun pistols could also have been more authentic without being a much-liked action video game. The sparks that came out of the arms seemed too fake and I think it could have been eliminated or fixed. Still, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should consider. The symbolic ideas and performances of the film will be easily accepted by all and may appeal to many viewers. It's a pretty imaginary movie and fun to watch.
