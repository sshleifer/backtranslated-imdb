I felt this film - in general. I am impressed with Russell Crove's talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, a typical Aussie blend of soft silent access, a little confident and very persistent. I really liked cinema and directing. Pace was right and portraits of almost all the characters were impressive. God, it's not Russell's talent even in 1993. glittering! ... and I still have not seen the Gladiator.
