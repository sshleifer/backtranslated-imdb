I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Vaffle are cats that are so different from each other, but they are called collectively "brothers." I often try to mimic tired, sighing the accent of their butler, Hovis, or even Gordon's Scottish quarter. There should be more episodes of human Kimberly. The emission of cats that are being dressed up in pre-teen girls to get into a sleeping party, in order to get thirsty paws on their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a hilarious classic. We can not drink rootbeer in our house now without doing Catscratch voices or Hanson Brothers from the movie 'Slap Shot'. Future classic. Where can I get the first two seasons on a DVD?
