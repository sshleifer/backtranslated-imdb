Dramatic writer Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) played a series of flop games after a great blow. He gets a play written by his disciple, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), which is fantastic. It's so good that Sidney says he would kill for it. Will it? Thriller Thoughts. It was originally a performance ... and it's being shown. It's mostly on one set and everyone is talking, but I've never been bored. It is very well written with many plants and good processing. Caine is brilliant as Bruhl - another of his great performances. Reeve is, surprisingly, very good. I never thought of him as an actor, but he is really good in that role. Dian Cannon does wonders with Bruhl's signed role. Irena Wort is also good (and pretty funny) like Helga Ten Drop, a psychic. However, her focus was on my nerves. Director Sydney Lumet agrees well with his set. The camera always moves and keeps your attention. EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD !!!!! My only remark is that the two gai characters in this movie turn out to be angry sociopaths and also contain one of the most romantic kisses I've ever seen-but these are mild discomforts. good thriller. Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and it seems to have completely disappeared because it was premiered in 1982. That's bad - it deserves better.
