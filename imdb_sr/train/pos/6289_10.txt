This movie took a lot of rods. Critics published it when it came out and was charged with destroying Nicolas Cage's career. What I do not think people get is that it does not need to be an epic, the Oscars for the movie, it's just some great Bruck-Buster action at its best. Fast cars, quick assembly and great sound record - do exactly what the sheet says. Also, for anyone who loves cars, it's a clean treat. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, Hummer and do not forget Eleanor! I think it would be hard for you to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie! Then maybe it's just me!
