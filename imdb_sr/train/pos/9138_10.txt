I own this film and I've been watching it several times since its release. The prince did not dazzle us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he is a musician and I feel that this is what he has shown here, he is just the best to tell this story through the influence. Most of this film is clear and young, but it's a mistake for directors / writers, but it's a great movie with even better music. Principals and moral beliefs in the Purple Rain are quite powerful, and if more movies rely on the basics, we would teach them as younger children, we would have a better environment around them, seeing that art reflects a life that reflects art.
