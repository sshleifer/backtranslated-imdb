Bacall works well here - especially since this is her second film. This is often in the shadow because it is between two great successes: "Have and Do not Have" (1944) and "The Great Dream" (1945), which coincided with Humphrey Bogart. He is approved that this is not matched with other films, but I think he is not guilty of himself. I think there was an abuse in that she showed the British lady of the upper crust. No accent. I think all weird accents were confusing - Boier certainly was not a Spaniard. It was difficult to keep right from the people. I really liked the black and white cinema. Mood is used for great effect - I especially liked the foggy scene. Lighting also greatly enriches intrigue and tension. Bacall is simply gorgeous. Boier does not exactly fit into the romantic role of the leading man - so he and Bacall were a little strange together. Not great chemistry - and certainly not Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still like this picture. There is a great tension and she is moving well enough. I must say that I found the girl's murder pretty brave for this movie. Katina Pakinou and Peter Lorre stand out as auxiliary actors. Pakinou as a hotel guard is absolutely malicious and evil in his portrait. Her scene in which he laughs as Mr. Muckerji goes after he is revealed as a murderer of a child is quite disturbing. Lorre also works quite well in his slim, snake-like picture of Conteras - a sluggish coward to the end. Vanda Bendrik is also pretty good at portraying the child of Else - especially since she was her first picture, and then she was only 16 years old (although she looks much younger). She turned out to be married later for Auie Murphy, who proved to be a short-lived, violent marriage.
