In 1990 Brad Pitt and Juiliette Levis made TV Too Ioung to Die where they both played almost the same parts as in California. I have no doubt that this is what led to their participation in the film on a big screen. California finds an ambitious writer David Duchovy and his friend, art photographer Michelle Forbes on some kind of rocky relationship due to Duchovna's obsession by writing a book and entering into the minds and souls of serial killers. In fact, he has the most unusual planned odyssey, wants to go across the country and visit the location of several famous serial killers. But he and Forbes broke up. Destiny intervenes in many ways, not financially with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliet Lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to share the price of gas on this cross-country trip. It turns out that Pitt is himself a serial killer and he decides to research a little on his own, exploring the mind of someone who is fascinated by amoralism. California is not the type of film I usually process. go for, but in fact the acting ability and charisma of Brad Pitt make it work to a great extent. Pitt is the definition of a walking Gothic refugee from liberation. But better than him is Juliette Levis who once again plays this low self-esteem that looks good. Look at her scene with Forbes while she's hair and Levis describes her sad and pathetic life. Levis' dialogue and the Forbes reaction should be shown in the acting hours throughout the country. For those who like their shots, they do not come better than California.
