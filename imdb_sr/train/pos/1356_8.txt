I began to look at Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that impresses you is a refreshing format, which, although similar to many other real shoves at your core, is still very fun. Donald Trump is a wonderful and host of both the main judge of the show. An overthrow is also being reported in which intelligent people with a good appearance are selected as competitors. But the best part of the show is in New York. Mark Burnett may have made a lot of crap in his time, but his handling of cinema is great, as it makes the NIC look like a character. Jazz melodies together with some great camera make New York look spectacular. An apprentice will forever easily make my first 3 real shows of all time (Amazing Race is number 1, however). But just like the incredible collision, this show is always best viewed moderately. If you continue to watch it for a while, the originality of the show will quickly be exhausted (the same as in the TAR). Star Worth, broadcasters in this country, have done a great job in presenting the show. The first three seasons were shown in a row, and after two years two seasons were shown, which kept the concept fresh. In conclusion, you will love this show, especially the first 2 seasons. However, if you continue to watch the concert continuously, his charm will disappear quickly.
