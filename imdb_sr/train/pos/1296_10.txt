It's an extremely difficult movie to watch, especially because it targets the deepest core of all our lives. But in the end, it's a very beautiful and deeply moving movie. Any person who considers it cynical must say that they have largely missed the meaning of the entire message of the film. For those who really watch the movie, they see that the way in which problems are solved is absolutely necessary, and the outcome is ultimately stimulating. It is, of course, very difficult to watch, a difficult subject, and even brutal. However, this is extremely important for society and everything. It shows the climax of what world cinema is currently doing (I will not limit that term to France only) and everyone should try to see it. I'll tell you it's best to come in with a clean head, without disturbing your opposing views, and let the movie work for you.
