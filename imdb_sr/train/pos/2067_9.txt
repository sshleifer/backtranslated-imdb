Although it is universally recognized that Fearful Simmetry was under the strong influence of Kolchak's episodes. They were, they are, they will be, whether it makes a break or honor is a completely controversial point. As a great admirer of both series, I am submissive to this other belief, although less charity can not. James Vhitmore was brave to take over the task of directing such heavy episodes, invisible elephants and gorilla suits sound like a recipe for disaster, but he pulls it with style, and the teaser is an absolute gem. Lance Guest is working hard to make a credible figure from Kyle Lang and Jack Rader who are scared of dread like Ed Meecham. Forget the suspicious originality of Fearful Simmetry and enjoy it as a deeply satisfying Ks File.
