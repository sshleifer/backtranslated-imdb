I bought this cheap from the rest of the rental at our local store. She was in a state of shock, and I had never heard of it before. Obviously nobody else had it. I can not believe my happiness. You go through the whole empire of emotions and try to cross over the complex message - the very moral and non-triumphal attitude of the Party of Mandela, no doubt. Despite its huge length (I had to look at two sessions) - it was like a book that could not be postponed. Perhaps songs are not all that is remembered, but the spirit of things burns forever. I can not understand the comments that a musical (clearly designed for the scene) is not realistic! I also saw the "South Pacific" and read the book, and I guarantee that music is not realistic in relation to the book. I'll keep this little discovery until it's gone. One day, this will make a better budget. <br /> <br />
