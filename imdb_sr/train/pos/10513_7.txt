If you have any idea of ​​the production of Jane Austen, you will now repeat it in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the films in her novels are a bit boring, but I love Austin's characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings that they like to repeat as in Emma. What makes Emma a good Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her leading role. The fact that each of the characters in the movie seems to be unable to think of anything other than how to get a good partner and soon married the movie makes it hilarious.
