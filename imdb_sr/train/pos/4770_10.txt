The only show I watched from 90210! Why were they interrupted? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you were part of it all! The least they have to do is release it to DVD! I checked a similar show, but nothing came close. The actors had incredible chemistry and I enjoyed every episode with many expectations. They made a big mistake by dragging the show. If anyone has any information on where to get DVD North Shore, please place a few rows here. Thank you! Aloha!
