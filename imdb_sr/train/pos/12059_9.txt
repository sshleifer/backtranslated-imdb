I love stories about ghosts in general, but I personally love the cold, atmospheric and elegantly freaking stories of the ghosts of the British period. This qualifies for all points. A na√Øve young lawyer ("lawyer" in Britspeak) was sent to a small village near the sea to inhabit the old property of a deceased woman. It's a twenties, a time when many middle-class Britons go to the seaside holiday for "their health." Well, guess, there's nothing "healthy" in the village of Crithin Gifford, the creepy place of an awkward elderly woman, imaginary Victorian estate, located on the edge of a salty wet fog. When a lawyer saves the life of a little girl (none of the nationals will help the endangered tooth - find out why later in the film), he accidentally provokes the anger of a wicked spirit, a woman in black. It is not a film, a transient twist, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. The viewer only sees a few times, but you feel her malicious presence in every frame. While the camera follows a lawyer while reading legal papers, you expect to see a woman in black at any time. When a lawyer goes to the generator scepter to turn on the electricity for a creepy old house, the camera pulls it up and you think it will appear there too. Waiting for a woman in black to appear is uncomfortably tense. We have already seen many elements of this story (a locked room that no one enters, a fog, a naive outsider who ignores the warnings of the local population), but the director somehow manages to combine them in a completely new and attractive spirit. do it. Watch him with a friend so you can have someone warm to catch him while waiting for a woman in black. . .
