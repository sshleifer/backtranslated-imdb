During the Second World War, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun fantasy adventure for children, with Angel Lansbury in the role of a witch who, with the help of three evacuees and "magic professors", hinders the Nazi invasion. Great inventive, with a lot of laughter, this film will delight children of all ages with their brilliant characters, an exciting story and appealing melodies. Lansburi is perfect as Eglantine, not exactly the perfect witch who takes three children into the adventure of life, and her three young stars (Cindi O'Callaghan, Roi Snart and Ian Veighill) are as impressive as the Cocknei Rascals who help fight the nasty Hun- a. Special effects are somewhat outdated, but face it, children do not care too much about these things as long as they are having fun. And they'll have fun. With impressive scenes that greatly intertwine live action and animation with great effect, and a more authentic movie magic of a hundred Harry Potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this beautiful film of escapism. In fact, only a pretty drawn music number was set in Portobello Road's perfection of the film, but with much more to enjoy, which can be easily forgiven. In addition, any film featuring British television legend Bruce Forsith as a 'Flash' Harv style sleeper is guaranteed a good rating from me.
