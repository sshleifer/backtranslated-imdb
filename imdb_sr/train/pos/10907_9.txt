I turned around the TV, and HBO showed a double blow of incredibly terrible medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey, this looks fun" - I really like the documentaries - so we started to watch. At first I thought that Jonny Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that because of his condition he never passed puberty, a high voice and a smaller body. He was on a crusade to collect money for his business. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with the wonderful feeling of spirituality ... I cried, I watched something, laughed, got up to take another handkerchief, and then he was still crying. Once Jonny Kennedy 'time has elapsed', he flew to heaven to be with angels. He was more than ready; He learned his lessons from this life and was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.
