Others do not make such a category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in the wardrobe is still considered a good clean, sometimes supreme entertainment. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at the pinnacle of problem Hadlei brothers and sisters, and they really took over the roles and ran with them. Malone won the Oscars, and Stack was nominated in the accompanying categories, with both honors being deserved. They are in contrast to mild traces. Both Bacall and Hudson could never have been called bad actors, but they both had better parts and played them much more convincingly than here. It's kind of hard for me to accept that Rock Hudson plays such a redheaded heterosexual like him, but it's more personal bias than anything else. But this does not deprive the overall entertainment value of the film, which is significant and this film is highly regarded. If you're upstairs and this movie is coming up, I'd say you're watching it. That's worth it.
