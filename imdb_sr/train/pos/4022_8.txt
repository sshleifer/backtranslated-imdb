Another detailed work on the subject by Dr. Dvivedija returns us to the pre-defined Punjab in time. Dr Dvivedi chose a difficult theme for his film debut. He worked on all the details to make the story alive. Treatment of the topic is very delicate. Although at that time we were not in the region, sets and costumes look real. Unlike most of the movies on the partition, this does not focus on the bloody details of violence in order to attract audiences, but to its consequences. The characters revive. Priianshu Chatterjee gave impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai showed his heart, showing the pain of a man who was guilty of guilt. The rest of the actors did a good job.
