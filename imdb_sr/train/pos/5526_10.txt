I love cinema, so what I'm ready to admit is confusing me deeply. I gave the thumbs "Che, Part 1 and 2" without having seen a movie. I know terribly. But I felt in the trap he committed ... who? Actually, I do not know, but there is a negative word that spread like wildfire and, as far as I am smart, I fell into it. But, fortunately, I encountered the Argeninean film directed by Martin Donovan, the man I love and whom I admire. When I told him I would not see him because I knew that the film was unsuccessful, he looked at me as if he was ready to hit me right in the face, and Donovan was a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why. I immediately went to see both of the pieces and "Che, part 1 and 2" was the best movie I saw in 2008. That is, such a purity that will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. Respect for the audience is something we're not used to. I do not know if we've ever been. Nudity, movement, no concessions and Benicio del Toro is extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can notice it. The humanity of man is enormous. So, thank you to Martin Donovan once again for honoring you so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone who took part in this film. Do not commit the mistake I wanted to commit. Go see, now, on the big screen
