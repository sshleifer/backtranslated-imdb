For me movies and acting are all about telling a story. The story of David and Betsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. In this film I thought that the stories of Gregory Peck and Susan Haivard were the best. To know and understand the story of David and his way to become King of Israel, he made this story even more inviting. You could have sensed his lust for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the true human side of this man who was more than his life in his time. The fear of Susan Haiverard, reluctance, and obedience to his authority as her king was, was beautifully presented. David's sorrow could also be felt by the fact that Uriah spent the night at the gate, not at home. Like the sorrow when he was killed in the battle. The powerful and authoritative condemnation of King Raimondo Massey led me to feel his anger. The sets were real enough, and the atmosphere was convincing. All in all, I think this was one of the best movies of this kind. I gave him a score of ten.
