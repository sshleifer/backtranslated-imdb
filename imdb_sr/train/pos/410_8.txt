I rented this film in DVD form without knowing anything about it, part of the winter marathon watching a movie every night. After a few horrific American action adventure films (ballistic, stinking, cradle of life), Zhu warriors have conceived me as a great original film creativity. The story is complete nonsense, but I have found the sincerity of the film, the humility and complete lack of refreshing irony, and the film looks spectacular. Of course, special effects are not technically flawless as those produced by Hollivood, but filmmakers are wisely more interested in color, composition, and movement than realism, so many footage takes away breath. In one frame, two of the superhuman characters stand on the rocky columns of the rock, a large moon rises before them, the picture perfectly balanced with three elements. In the second, a princess-warrior spreads through the sky behind her shining sword as a missile looking for heat. And colors explode from shot to bullet, used to express emotions, not to show reality. The characters have the same simplicity and directness of characters from the comics, not offering a great depth in themselves, but referring to the architects who are deeper responding. Physically, a few actors are stunningly beautiful. They play their roles straight up, without irony or cunning, and they are so convincing. Most strange of everything, despite the clumsiness of the plot and the thin characterization, I found myself very close to tears in the end, shifted by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wild original vision of the director. <br /> <br />
