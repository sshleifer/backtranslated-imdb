Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspirational film. The very end when all the crowds in the stadium rise and people raise their hands, it gives me a cold whenever I see it. It's brilliant. Joseph is beautiful as a lonely and sad little kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he communicates with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and the angels are ridiculous and exciting. A very nice family movie with - I admit - a fairly banal happy ending. But not important, the film retains its basic quality with good acting and inspirational topics.
