From the NASCAR view of a maniac like me, the movie is interesting. You can see many racing cars from 1983. Even heavy racing scenes are not that realistic. But I must admit that I did not see any races before 1995, because before that they did not show any NASCAR races in Germany. From the perspective of Burt Reynolds fans I, the film basically is what we are accustomed to see from Reinolds in the '80s: Burt at the speed car of a car, as in his Bandit films. If you love NASCAR and Burt Reinolds, this film is inevitable. If you only love one of these two things, I recommend that you watch it. If you do not like NASCAR or Burt Reinolds, you should still give a chance, but remember, this film was far from conquering Academy Academy Oscar. It's a typical humor of the 80's. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you will also like it.
