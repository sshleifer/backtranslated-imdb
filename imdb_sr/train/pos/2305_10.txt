I thought this was a good movie. It would be nice if we saw something more about the movie about the two sisters who knew about each and every one of the same boys before he was killed. I'm sure the movie would have been made in this way, it would be a very different ending, which is why this move was such a good movie. This shows that no matter what happens in your life with your brothers and sisters, you can always go through it and that if they are two sisters dealing with a boy (the same boy), working through pain and pain makes things better and easier to work between them. It's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in one's life that you can still get to it in order to get even closer. I really enjoy watching this movie, and I still do it when it arrives. It looks like I look at him every time he comes. It would be nice if there was a second part for this movie, maybe the older sister appears and has her baby, it would really make a great ending of the story since he died, in that way he would stay. alive though he's dead.
