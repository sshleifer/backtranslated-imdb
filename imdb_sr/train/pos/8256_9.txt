I saw this film at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deadly smart, modern and fun. The actor was ROCK SOLID. Excellent work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelli and up and down, Alekia Fast. Writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie were subject to a political subtext - but they did not shoot you down. and it made sense. There is a spirited carnivorous spirit in this film. FIDO guarantees healing. <br /> <br /> He loved !!!
