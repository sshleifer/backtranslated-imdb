If there is one thing to recommend about this movie, it's intriguing. The assumption certainly attracts audiences because it is a mystery, and through the film there are indications that there is something dark. However, there is not much tension, and Villiams's mildly manipulated images do not do much to connect us with his obsession with the boy. They are not very clear. The production felt abruptly and the holes were obvious. Certainly it seems like an overview for much more complete and better effort. The book is probably better. One thing is certain: Taupine must have written something really good to inspire at least one complimentary effort.
