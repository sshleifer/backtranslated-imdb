The first time I met this show when I was in Japan last year. I found it on the internet when I asked for sub-titles that would help me with my Japanese. The housewife's mother warned me to cling to it because she thought it was weird, but it was wonderful for me! Koiuki showed such conflicting character traits and Matsujun's spirit made my day every time I turned on! The first time I saw him at "Hana Iori Dango", but I liked it very much! Although the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed when I discovered that they had not changed. much through the show. Their relationship has grown, but they are not really. Still, there was fun for everyone (even for Fukushima!).
