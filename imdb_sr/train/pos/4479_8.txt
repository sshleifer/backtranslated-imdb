Since I first saw Anchors Aveigh in 1945, watching the cassette has a lot of nostalgia behind me. At the age of 15, it was easy to be pulled into the first major MGM Technicolor musical. Now I may be most interested in thinking about the future career of leading players. Although Sinatra made several negligible films shortly after appearing after Dorsea's day, as a solo singer, this was his first major film show. As the other viewer noticed, it looks almost like warming up to "On the City". Sinatra may have had to work hard on it, but his dance with Kelli is credible, and he would be better in the next couple. However, by observing its structure, it is easy to understand why it was caricatured like beans. Who could imagine winning an Academy Award for acting within a decade, and continue to play many roles as a hard detective or leader in the fight. Although Jenny Kelly dominated the personality and dance, his incredible performance did not suggest he would become the main creative force, almost an icon for MGM musicals, where he developed a dance style complementary to that of Fred Astaira. Finally, it was strange to see the fresh Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play the "exciting" killer in Compulsion, based on the 1920s Leopold-Loeb murder. Additional remark: One reviewer praised Betti Garrett's performance as a Sinatra's love interest. Later, she played against him in the film On the Tovn, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film.
