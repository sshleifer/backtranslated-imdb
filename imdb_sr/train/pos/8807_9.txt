This is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes and 9 seconds from artists from all over the world. Documentary films are diverse and deal with all kinds of concepts, the only thing that is shared is 11/11 as a theme (in some cases very small). Some of the segments are weak, while others are very strong; some are political, some are not; some are exclusively tied to September 11, some simply use September 11 as a topic that touches on human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream, while others are abstract and artistic). This film was by no means censored by anyone, so the thoughts that you see are very crude and powerful. This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think that the two segments could actually log out of the right wings (one from Egypt, where a dead US soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber are returning as ghosts, and the other from the United Kingdom describing the downfall of Chile by the United States of September 11, 1973 , resulting in the result of the United States in 50,000 deaths and terrible crimes). The Mexican segment was the most powerful, describing the decline of the towers and the resulting death in a vivid fashion (you must see that it is believed). Although the final product is uneven, with some segments being almost "meaningless," I still recommend it. It's very difficult to rank this movie because the segments differ everywhere (some are weak, some are very powerful;). I give this grade of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered the issues that are usually censored (the Mexican segment, the segment of the UK, the segment of Japan, the segment of Egypt).
