It's a shame that Deliverance is generally known as a rape movie and for Dueling Banjos. Even the people who watched the movie can not turn their thoughts away from this scene of rape. It's not as bad as a rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not as bad as any scene of rape in any movie. People tend to miss the power of a movie that contains a notorious scene. The Backcountry in which it was filmed is beautiful and completely opposed to the dark subject. Actors, both large and smaller, make you feel like you are rafting along that river along with them. What separates this film from others is the tangible feeling of fear that inspires him. There are not many movies that would make you feel like that. Conclusion: This film is a classic. I can not say much more than that.
