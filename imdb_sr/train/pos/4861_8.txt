Joan Fontaine is "Girl in Trouble" in this 1937 musical music featuring Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The plot, the British woman (Fontaine), is in love with the American, who was mistakenly replaced for Astaire, a star of musical comedy. contains some wonderful Gershwin music, including "Nice work if you can get it" and "Foggy Day". The best scene is the number "Stiff Upper Lip", which takes place in a fun home. Astaire's singing voice sounds more powerful in this movie than in others, and has some great sounds. dance numbers. Burns plays his main publicist, and Allen is Burns' secretary. She's hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who must dance with Aster at the end of the film. Stevens could easily use a double game as he shows a dancing in a long frame, and takes place between the trees. I think it's double, except that the dance was so bad. It's definitely worth seeing despite his defects.
