I saw this movie. This film is the best according to today's need. Miraz in marriages today is the biggest problem. In making this problem this film is the best. In this film, Indian values ​​are very well stated. Today's youth must understand this problem. The smaller number of girls. And because of this dowry, the girls committed suicide. If this problem persists, then the day when there are no girls is not far. So keep in mind this statement, today's youth must realize that we can not take a dowry in marriages. We must learn from this film that a dowry should not be taken. And if we understand this problem then we can see a new trend in society. This is the biggest change in society.
