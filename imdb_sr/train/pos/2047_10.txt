This film hit my home. Like 29, I remember the 80's and my father who worked at the factory. I realized, if I work hard, if I had the pride and I would never give up, I could have an American dream, a house, several children, a car that everyone would call my own. However, I noticed, without a degree in something (unlike a father who stopped in the ninth grade) and a sharp sense of greed and laziness, you can not get anywhere. I want to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It was made for TV, and I saw it an hour ago. I can not find it anywhere! I would like to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, to see what they think and to remind them that the Americans used to work for the sake of honor and that we are proud of what we have achieved !! I think the feeling is still there, but in a heavy spiral string with so many things being done abroad ...
