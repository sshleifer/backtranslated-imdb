This is a good movie, but it's not recommended if you do not like intelligent movies. It's about two guys who want the world to go away, and that's exactly what they get. The performance is great, the ending was not predictable, and in fact he had a good story unlike most of the films these days. People complain that the movie is too simple or too boring. I think we should keep movies such as The Tokic Avenger (Actually I Like B Movies) or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandi. One note: If you notice this, this has exactly the same actors from Cube except four actors. Make two notes: Wait after the loan (Believe me about this). Enjoy the movie.
