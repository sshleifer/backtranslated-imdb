Good Martina excursion, it is a lively and pleasant giallo with fine performances of good looks and mainly two leading names, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. For me, the pitch blackmail puzzle is so intricate and confusing that you just sit and enjoy instead of trying to anticipate. Just when everything seems solved, we started to deal with another series of plants, favorable plants, that must be said. Sexy with lots of bleeding kills this film with London, Athens and Greece offshore locations. The super finale set in the Aegean walls brings together things and lots of fun.
