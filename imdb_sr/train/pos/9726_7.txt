Well, that was a nice surprise. his trailer did not predict a good movie at all, it was even a bit misleading. A special part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardonic and funny. Less real, however, I do not think that the guy who came there where he got showed signs of such disrespect for everything his current company represents. A man does not become a top-class suit just to suddenly doubt everything. The ending of the film, during the performance of Dolce Vita, was too tattered, clich√© and rather disappointing. And of course, a guy like Pegg's character would not go through his first week in a blitz New York magazine like this one. I hope that one day I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here she looked like a poor actress playing bimbo. And by the way, I do not see why it's the "sexual symbol" of the year, I see sexy girls in almost every cover of each magazine.
