This is a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reasons why many people are typing this movie? I'll tell you. In this film you have a black criminal who oversees a white professor. A black policeman telling a white professor that he is wrong to defend a black criminal and a black cop turns out to be right. what makes a white professor stupid. It always comes down to race. This is a great movie. Do not pay attention to racists. If you can go beyond the fact that there are characters played by blacks in this movie that outperform the white personality, then you should not have trouble to enjoy this movie. I recommended everyone to see this movie.
