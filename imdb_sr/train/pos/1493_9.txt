I thought Mukhsin was beautifully written. It's not just about the party. There are tones of subtle messages that I think Iasmin tried to cross. And yes, it can be confusing for some of you (especially if you did not watch Sepet and / or Guber 76 times). I bet you've noticed how to use characters from two movies right? It's really ironic how the characters are related. As the boss of her neighbor, she is a prostitute from Gubre. And a chicken snooker base turns out to be the religious and wives of a godly man in the future. I absolutely love voice-overs. His raw, yet lush, fresh. Like, when they recorded the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin Board, then Mukhins' voice, who spoke 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim ..' (a scene when it climbed up to the tree) suddenly appeared. in a mild manner, hissing how poor) is shown in the image. For example, even children can be really harsh (complete with a sharp and boring voice) and simply a bad mouth. And how can you be so busy and talk about the LP, when your life is not resolved. All I can say is that this film has fully reached my expectation if I do not overcome it. He held me for the screen, I could not even take a look at him. Not even to see you in the cinema. Ha-ha.
