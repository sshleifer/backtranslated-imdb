It's unusual to watch a movie in which the performance of an actor is so good that it can be felt that the film will be uninterested, if it does not exist at all, without his presence. In spite of the incredible direction - in fact, there are many scenes that appear to have been shot too quickly and carelessly - seemingly low budget, a strange story about a man who wants to take the place of an exiled priest, and another week, the presence Pierre Fresnai is so impressive that he is shocking from the start to the terrible end. I've never seen, nor can I imagine a better performance for the future, even Paul Scofield plays in "The Man for All Seasons". . In fact, the end could even be considered as ridiculous if Fresnai did not play a transcended priest who returns to the Church by committing a crime. "Suis Maurice Morand, pretrial catholikue (" I am Maurice Morand, Catholic priest ") was told with such a brilliance that one can forget the crazy yet another impressive thing this film has is a unique scene in which Morand - who, despite being unwanted - still a priest - makes a huge amount of grapevine in the cabaret, turn him into Christ's blood. Gerard - a man who wants to return Moranda to the Church or replace it alone - must drink it if he does not want to leave him in the cabaret. He does this in the midst of cheering and applause from the people who we are but simply drinking three of the four vines. In the following scene, the dialogue between Moranda and garbage collector is also remarkable. "Do you carry people?" Morand asks, who hates what is right done. "It would be too much work" is a smart answer. The rest of the movie is not worth commenting, but it's certainly worth seeing because of the very strong and unusual emotional atmosphere created all the time. I think "Le defrokue" is a very strange film, but all viewers have to watch it - if good Catholics are mandatory - because it's very rare jewel in the history of film. <br /> <br />
