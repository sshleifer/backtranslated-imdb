A slightly fictionalized biographical portrait of early years by Abraham Lincoln from John Ford director, primarily focused on a trial in which a young lawyer defends two brothers charged with murder. The film offers an interesting view of this important American lawyer. the figure and the film are well made, but it seems a little incomplete without any major moments from his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas. The apparent intention was to introduce Lincoln as a young man who develops attributes that will make him the great man he will become. But the result for me was that, although I admired the presentation, it was not as satisfactory as I think it could have been with a larger scope. In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have an Henry Fund that efficiently displays peaceful power. Fondin's performance includes some ganglish manners and other effects that are quite effective in presenting Lincoln, especially in combination with some effective makeup and costumes that are occasionally unclear. The carrier is solid and surprisingly does not include many of Ford's regular auxiliary heads (sometimes referred to as its shareholders), but we have Vard Bond one of the most prolific actor in Hollywood. Bond appeared in more than 100 best films from any other actor, both original and revised. He also performed in the 11 best nominated paintings. The film contains a scene that would appear to inspire a fairly similar scene in the movie "Kill the Bird Mist", where it would be better than that, although this scene is one of the most effective in this movie.
