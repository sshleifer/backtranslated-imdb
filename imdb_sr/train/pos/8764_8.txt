Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) are always best friends, and after graduation they decide to travel to Thailand. Because of the incident, they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him to a weekend in Hong Kong. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene misunderstand the heroin for smuggling drugs and are sent to jail. Now is the time for extreme survival and true friendship. This was a pretty good movie, I saw it several times and after a while you noticed that there are a couple of holes in the plot, but the movie still entertains you. Claire Today has done a great job as usual, she's a great actress. I would give Brokedovn Palace 8/10
