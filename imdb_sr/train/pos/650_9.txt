A great movie, pretty challenging but really fun. Unfortunately, there are no memorized quotes here, but this one is my favorite: Alekandre: If you leave someone you loved, you must say what I'm saying to you now: "Goodbye, I'm going." But to disappear, to hide as a criminal, is untrustworthy. (not watching it with English subtitles) In my opinion, this all expresses. So much tactics are involved in relations between Alexander and others, yet everyone craves for a little more truth. However, knowledge of the truth can hurt even more, as is Alexander's experience. The usual interpretation is that the film criticizes the very possibility of "liberated love" by showing unwanted implications for the people involved. This, in fact, shows it in a convincing way, but I would be glad if the reasons were treated a little deeper: it is not about the fact that the liberated love itself is doomed to failure, but people (I think of people) should work on himself, and to try to overcome the ruling moral before, and not through the practice of liberated love. Still, the movie is real and it's really worth watching.
