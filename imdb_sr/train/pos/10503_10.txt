When I first got my N64 when I was five or six, I fell in love with it, and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I loved it too! The graphics were great for the time, a good plot, great tracks and more, the best music I heard in the Nintendo game. I do not remember the plot, but I think Princess Peach was abducted from Bovser, and Mario must save her. The game is to get 120 stars from the curse in the castle. Each one had about five or six challenges to get the stars. There are secrete parts of the castle, where you can get more stars. I think there are three levels to beat Bovser on * Let's start with the characters. He's the main character, and he gets useful tips from Toad, so he's basically one of your allies. I heard that Luigi and Ioshi are in the game The Main Criminal is the Bovser, and there's a bunch of other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really great. Next, to make People say that playing is more important than graphics, and I agree completely. But with great complication, there are great graphics. Especially during this time. I have a whole lot of other Nintendo games like 007 and do not compare their graphics with Super Mario.Bright colors, great effects and great sound effects. The use of graphics in watercourses is very good. In addition to Bovser World, it has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br / Now, music. This is my favorite part of the game. Growing up, when I played this in my youth, I would like to leave the game all night, so music would sleep. Jolly Roger Bai, who was calm and beautiful. There are others who are also great, especially in, once again, the worlds with Bovser, they are the ones who hold me the most and who are my favorites. This game was my favorite past time as a developing player, and I love it. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) GO PLAI THE GAME!
