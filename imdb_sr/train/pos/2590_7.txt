People who misbehave this movie are those who do not understand the film. These are people who love film movie films and who are unfavorable to any movie that does not play Leonardo DiCaprio. Vilder Napalm is a tiny little movie that can seem strange and maybe even silly at first, but what he's lacking in conspiracy is more than compensating for the essence. One thing in particular about the film was impressed by the use of music that plays a big role. Those film music students will notice how important music is in the film, both in Vida and Vilder's life, as well as in the background. Vilder's theme, Vidina theme and Vallace's theme are being heard in the introductory sequence, and it's funny how some of the lyrics are played. For example, in a scene where people sing "Duke of Earl", Vida is with Willder when men sing something like "She's my girlfriend," and then she goes to Vallace to give him something when men sing lyric "She'll be my girl" smartly shows the tension between two brothers There are various types of intimidation in the film, and although it may look like a flop outside, the real student of the film will notice how good this movie is really.
