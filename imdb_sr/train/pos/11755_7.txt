I love this movie, but music at all the gatherings of former students is just stupid. The fateful play was played in 1972. This means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. dances were from the 1950s and early 1960s. After I just attended my 30th meeting in high school, I assure you that the last music will be played at the gathering or dancing of the former high school people are the music of their parents. I understand the difficulties in finding the relevant music from the 1970s - we all know how it was leaping music time. But it was not completely deprived of life, and film producers should have watched more. I found these dance scenes very disturbing for my otherwise ready suspicion of disbelief in the rest of the film. This was a bad decision by the Director and / or the manufacturer.
