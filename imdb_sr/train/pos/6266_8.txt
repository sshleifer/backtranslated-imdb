This picture for me has very high results because it is an extremely fun and fun incendiary Alien Invaders taking over the city and many of its 'men'. The city and the players are all decorated style from the 1950s and the entire film has a deliberately sticky and kitsching feeling. Some of the scenes are hilarious like the birth of an alien creature. All actors give a full bloody and serious idea of ​​what makes the movie even smoother, and special effects and aliens are at least intended to add to the party at the third rate. These kinds of movies often deserve the following: 8/10.
