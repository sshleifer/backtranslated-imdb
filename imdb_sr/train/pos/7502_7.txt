Although I really did not feel anything about Lance's character, and I felt that his wife could do much better with anyone else. It could have been a much more powerful movie to spend more time developing character, maybe with Lance - I would be more comfortable. "And to quote Glenn Quinn's character Ben:" I'm a star here, so I'm talented! "" If you watch a movie, just watch it, even when it's in the background ... its facial expressions, everything in your eyes, you surely know what motivates Ben, exactly how he thinks about the comments, even if it's a quick look behind his back characters. Great acting in a fair film.
