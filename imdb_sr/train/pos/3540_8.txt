I bought this game on an impulsive purchase from Valmartos. Nice to meet you. It was very fun to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I thought the graphics were the best I ever saw in a movie / game. The bonuses were very difficult! I think the snipers are too hard, so frustrating me that I did not play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people who were shooting at you without anything that would hide behind you or life to be worn. The only thing I can change is the upgrade system. I did not notice any difference in relation to non-upgraded equipment on the upgraded, as the purchase of the upgrade of the armor did not make the shield stronger or more filling on my life meter. I really liked K copter. I think the developers have done a good job.
