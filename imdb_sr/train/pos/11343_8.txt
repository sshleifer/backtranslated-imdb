I remember seeing it on TV in the late 70's - and stayed with me! Charming, loud, vibrant - an excellent movie for children. I recently put it on some friends at the party - and of course they thought I was crazy and I expected puppets to get something sick and la "Meet the abominations" but not - her healthy, pure fun. Jack vild is in good shape, like mom cass, and somehow attractive vitchi poo. If you like the banana, and you are in your 30s, it will re-create this surreal childhood on Saturday morning Vibe! Even if I now realized that Puff himself a little shit - just like everything he does is caught and escaped! A quality TV movie - if you, like me, are in death metal - you will be liked!
