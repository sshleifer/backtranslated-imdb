I liked almost all the films in the Dirty Harry series, except for what I think is called "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was a bit weak in the areas, but I still enjoyed it. This one is one of my favorites in the series, if nothing else for the big line "Come on, make me a day". This also has an interesting, though famous story that somebody kills those who made her mistake. Just think of "Magnum Force" with less mystery about who is behind the murders and you have your plot. It is allowed to have something more than this because it has a very fine final billing in an amusement park. It also features Dirty Harry who buys a bulldog as a gift, and Sandra Locke stumbles on a rather humorous scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood had to have a pretty central actor Sandra Lok in many of his films. It brings points every time even when the movie is generally pleasing to me. She was allowed to be not bad here, but her character could have been much better than anyone else. Another problem with this film and other films about Dirty Harry, sometimes look like commercials for weapons. I like weapons like the next person, but do we really need scenes from him that explain all the different strengths of his latest weapon and how many bullets he holds? However, a very nice entry to the Dirty Harry series.
