What has always been missing from the story of Matrix is ​​how things came into being in the real world. Do not say more, because this part of the story covered most of the bases. What was really interesting was how much it was a political, perhaps even cheap recording of the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things that a man could remember in the fight against the robotic horde, which were intended only as servants of mankind. What was also interesting to me was the use of fear and how it perpetuated the idea of ​​the unknown. We, people, often fall into that trap, allowing us to miss the lack of logic and thought because people can not believe in the opposite. Well presented and assembled, this is the real proof that illogical people can be.
