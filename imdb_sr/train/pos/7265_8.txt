Good story. Good script. Good casting. Good acting. Good directing. Good artistic direction. Good photo. Good sound. Good editing. All right. Put it all together and end up with a good party. It's a shame that at this moment there are not enough films of this caliber. We can be fortunate that writers / directors like John Hughes are occasionally able to hear their creative voices. Completely satisfactory, I have to conclude that something in that movie is fine.
