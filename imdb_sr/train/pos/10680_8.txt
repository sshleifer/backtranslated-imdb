As is almost always the case, when Britain comes with a fun and / or successful sit-com or quiz, Ianksi will come and steal the format and produce its inferior version. The man about the house is, of course, no exception to that rule. The Ianks version (Three's Compani) was an incomprehensible, stupid pope that seemed to last forever. The main example of quantity over (non-existent) quality. The original, on the other hand, is a precious gem with a mind (such as Favlti Tovers) to pull the plug exactly at the right time (unlike the 637 episodes of 'joy' created by Three). She was cute, there was great chemistry between Ropera, Richard O'Sullivan made it all that easy, scenarios, although not exactly the Oscar Wilde standard, were constantly entertaining and Chrissi was the most beloved woman walking on this planet's face since when the Dead Sea just felt bad. Nuff said.
