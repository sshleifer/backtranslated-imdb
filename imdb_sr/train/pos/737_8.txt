It's amazing that actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, the # 1 fan of the punk rock band The Ramones, in "Rock 'n' Roll High School. The socks are so lush, you do not mind that it's obviously too old to still be in high school (this fact equals that all children look like 24). The movie is a fast-paced game that is not being exploited; in the end, everything is blown up into pieces, and that should be. Mary Voron, an inborn and funny presence as a Nazi-like headmaster, gets a brilliant, unique battle at the beginning, where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how much is needed for this or Is it a coincidence?) And Dei Ioung is very attractive as the best soles, Kate Rambeau. The smallest link, ironically, in this "high school" chain is Ramones. They can not act, they are not funny, and their concert segment takes too long. One Ramones song, "I Vant Iou Around", is treated as a fantasy and well caught; other random songs are good, especially rare by Paul McCartney's ballad sensation at first ("Have we met somewhere before?"). Great fun! *** from the ****
