I was reviewing some of the old VHS tapes I had and came across the TV show John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together. It made me go to my computer and looked at it to see if I could find the DVD version of this show. I was disappointed that I could not find it on DVD yet. The show was broadcast in 1979 and it was a great show. I have a video and a CD, but I would like to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the picture quality is pretty good, but pale, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also several other songs that are not put on CD. As a fan of John Denver and Muppet, this DVD would really be a good seller. If you do not have a CD, it's a wonderful Chritmas collection of songs that were taken from that show. The album is also good if you find it and you still have a player to play.
