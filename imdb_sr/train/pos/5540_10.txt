At first, this movie looks so bad that I almost fell in the trance when I first saw it. It was like a bad dream. Cosmic drilling. But I gave her another chance, then the other, and so on ... Finally, I was depending on this film, because of his dreamy slow rhythm, beautiful natural sets, bathed in mild autumn lightning and a special musical score that was made since the 70's progressive rock and absolute extraordinary folk songs by actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lamb (Troubadour). You should notice a song about the hazelnut, silver trout and lady that disappears in the air ..., is heard in the middle and at the end of the film. Let us appreciate the natural charms of Elizabeth Suzuki. If the film was made by some "repertoire" directors such as Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, the critics would turn to the floor, rotating about the film as if I personally think this film is one million times better than any Fellini's movie # # @ !! Definitely not for pretentious.
