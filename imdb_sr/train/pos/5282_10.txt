I do not know ... Maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some Muslim religious actions (hajj), but I felt that the film was so underrated. I just can not believe that the film has so far been voted by only 223 people, since the film was produced in 2004 and since then has won many awards. About the movie ... it's one of those sweet actors Rade, a French teenager who needs to sit in Bacallour, asks his pious old man to take him to Mecca. It can be strange (if you do not know much about Islam), the father wants his son driving From their home in France to Saudi Arabia on a pilgrimage once in a lifetime. The generational gap between father and son is based on sufficiently simple terms ('you may know how to read and write, but you do not know anything about life,' an unnamed father to his son), but a sort of literature about the bromide generation is avoided. \ tBot of them are kind in their frustrations. The father never speaks French, although the Order understands Arabic, but can only answer in French. Although many people are on the road: "A terrible old woman returning to the Bosnian border and talking Mustafa (Jacki Nercesian), who helps them on the Turkish border, withdrawn and shy women who wear burka on the way to Damascus arrive on the road to Belgrade" the focus is always on the discord between father and son. There is not much conversation in the film that makes it pleasant for the eyes. "In every city you see magnificent views. The director shows you even the Blue Mosque and Hay Sofia, although the movie is not relatively long. I generally do not like movies that they do not have enough dialogue and take their power from the subtlety of the camera, but this really was great. In spite of some unanswered details (such as Redina's invisible French girl), the film is inviting the senses. Great work of art and remember this film is Ismail Ferroukhi's debut.
