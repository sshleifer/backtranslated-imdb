I've never seen such an incredible acting in the movie as I saw it when I saw Danijela Dan-Levis playing Christie Brovn in the Mi Left Foot. In fact, from the scene his role is not even completed. He played the role of Christy Brovn or at least was disabled as he did through filming the film and the necessary operation because of the damage done to his superior performance by his back. For me, this is incredible and through all the pains he suffered to play this role, I believe it is quite correct to say that he put on the scene of the most Oscars of a dignified performance in history. He was such a master in this difficult part to believe that no one could do better or with more influence than him. Although I can not say that this is the greatest film of all time, I can say that he played this impossible role, and then continued to act until he was acting anymore, no doubt the biggest leg I've ever seen an actor. to do. Probably a man too.
