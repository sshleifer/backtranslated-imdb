Eglimata (= Crime) is a story of small crimes that everyday people make in a crazy scenario can lead to an absolute catastrophe. One of the smartest Greek series ever! Actors like Ketti Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible 'wrong' laughter. Every viewer seems to recognize the bad side of himself in one of the characters or at least the sides of his being as they want. Actors of all ages who played larger and smaller portions got an equally large space in the heart of the Greek audience. My personal favorites (apart from the first two mentioned) are Vasilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but so many amazing actors have gone through some episodes from time to time. Whoever in the world understands the Greek should find a way to watch this series, although it's been more than 5 years that she was on TV. In Greece, the constant repeat series (ANT1) is present at any time as a summer or early afternoon zone. We will never forget Eglimat or any team!
