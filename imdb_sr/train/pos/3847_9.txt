At that time, this film had controversies written everywhere in it (as well as most of Verhoeven's projects). It contains very graphic displays of deadly scenes; A parachute that does not open the body * smack * of the guys on the floor. A man who ate his teeth in his throat. And the guy who overhanged a speedboat * glows * a bloody corpse that falls. But apart from the above, this film also contains some great (and stunningly beautiful) scenes captured in the gray fishing town that is Vlissingen, Thousands of rusty buds flying over the screen, in a slightly unimportant part of the film, the beautiful (holy) woman who puts flowers in milk, surrounded by plates of meat that drops blood steam love scene between the two male characters in the cemetery. The story is finished in a crazy, but filled 10 minutes, which does not disappoint, and will leave you to sigh the breath of relief. Of course, with the professionals who come, some special effects are exaggerated, and they are obviously done to see how far Verhoeven can push the up-factor (eg from their sockets). Also, while the two leading actors (Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk) perfectly live their lives, Herman's character (portrayed by rather non-charming Thom Hoffman) only feels unusually underdeveloped, making it difficult to worry, even after his tragic deaths. I did my best to give you a little idea of ​​what you can expect from this wonderful movie, and as you can see, it's not easy to summarize. in words. Do yourself a favor, if you find a movie somewhere, watch it! And enjoy the unique style and content of this masterpiece.
