Every kid has this movie in which he enters VHS when he has nothing to do or when he is near the guard. It was that movie for me. I can tell you the whole story exactly, at least I have at least 100 times seen it, and I can say it's a good movie for kids / family. > I still have a tape, I have not been looking at it for 5 years, but maybe I will go through this week, and be a child for that day. You just need to love bear for care, and their messege. <br /> <br />
