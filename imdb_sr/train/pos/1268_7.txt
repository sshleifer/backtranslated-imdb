Just Cause takes some of the best parts of the three films, Cape Fear, The Touch of Evil and the Silence of the Lamb, and mixes them to come up with a good movie thriller. Sean Conneri is a liberal law professor, married to former district attorney Kate Capshaw, and he is a crusade against the death penalty. Granny Blair Undervood Ruby Dee covers the Conference at the conference and urges him to handle the attraction of his granddaughter. He's sitting on a death sentence for killing a young girl. When Conneri arrives in this rural district of Florida, she is against the hard sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne, who is rude in dealing with crimes like Orson Velles was in contact with evil. Later, after Conneri gets a verdict with evidence that he is discovered, he feels pretty good about himself. At that moment, the movie brings a decisive shift from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. Say that everything is not what seems to be mildly said. The actors equally turn into good performances. Special mention must be made of Ed Harris, who plays Hannibal Lecter as a serial killer on the death penalty with Underwood. He will make your skin crawl and he will begin to question Connery about some comfortable liberal premises on which he bases his beliefs. Many of the verified liberals I knew appeared to think quite differently when they became victims of crime. Of course the other way around is true. Many conservative laws and ranks if ever included in the wrong end of the criminal justice system want to make sure that his rights are truly guaranteed. The criminal justice system is not the end, but the process and it never stops for the whole society. I guess if Just Cause has a morale that would probably be.
