Comedy jewel. Many loud moments were laughing, shops and pubs were laughing uncontrollably. The characters are recognizable, and the dialogue is well observed - I know people like this! Humor is surprisingly gentle, and the movie (it can sound strange) puts me in the mind of Ealing Comedy. It's a weird movie with lots of details. Certainly it takes a few reviews. I watched him several times (I showed all my friends!) And every time I noticed something new - a little dialogue, something visual I did not pick up before. I could be very picky and find some shortcomings in the movie, but I will not, because everything is a great game, a good movie that is really worth watching, and everyone who has a sense of humor must enjoy. It's a movie that will find friends and I hope there are many. Oh ... and he has great music.
