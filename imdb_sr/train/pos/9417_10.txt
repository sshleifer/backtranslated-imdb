A modest, subtle and skinny movie "The Man in a White Suit" is another breath of fresh air in a movie format from the Ealing studio. Although I doubt that some modern viewers could initially see it as vague, I doubt that many might not be fascinated by the professional way of working, the themes and characters are genuinely transferred during the course of the film. Honestly great Alex Guinness gives another fine characterization in the movie, perhaps not so obviously virtuous as Ealing's inspiration "Kind Hearts and Coronets" from 1949. This time he plays only one character, not eight, but as a reckless inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, finds the correct tone and expression. Together with Ginis's subtle, expressive performance, the rest of the actors are effective. From the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger stand out. Thesiger is incredibly absurd as a wealthy but influential business velear, while Parker is as reliable as an inefficient, yet key owner and father of the mill. Father, that is, Joan Greenwood, the handsome sweet actress actress, who is at his insurmountable climax in this film. A brilliant and seductive aspect and diction, it is quite high in this film, a fine contrast with a similarly unusual but still unreliable Guinness. The scene in which she apparently tried to tempt him, the couple played so adeptly that he was deeply touchy and fun ... The themes are being processed very efficiently, with no easy moral drawings. The complexity of the relationship between science, business, and the workforce is studied for insight and pleasure. This film is technically adequate in all areas; evocative photography, blending sound effects and music and imaginary script, all quietly impress. A completely satisfying movie, with the magnificent Guinness and Greenwood. Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
