"Elvira, the Mistress of the Dark" is the kind of "Harper Vallei P.T.A." with the supernormal touch. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is leaving the job as a television horror film host, after the owner of the new station gets updated with her. She now relies on the show in Las Vegas to spend, but finds out she needs to find more money to start the show. Things seem hopelessly to raise that money until it receives a notice of the death of its aunt, which then takes Elvira to Massachusetts to read a will. The house to be repaired, the dog and the cook are all that left her aunt, and again it seems that Elvira has problems with money for the show in Las Vegas. Adults from a small and narrow town are aggravating things by making things difficult for Elvira. Only a local piece (Daniel Greene) and a group of teens will make friends with her. Elvira's Uncle "V. Morgan Sheppard" presses to negotiate with Elvira for a cook, but Elvira soon learns about her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting, and a couple of very effective casseroles. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but is determined to get him to know his power. Elvira then faces burning at the stake on the old city arsenal of magic and a clearing between her and her uncle. The action is quite simple, but humor and well-developed characters keep it at a good pace. "Elvira, the Mistress of the Dark" is full of sweet, rude, rude and clever humor through many gags, punks, props, songs and parodies. The touch of an occult film makes this one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is a well-made movie with a great performance of all performers; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conavai (from Grease). Many people (including me) were wondering if the character Elvira can wear a feature film, and the answer is wonderful, YES!
