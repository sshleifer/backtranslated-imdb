Well, I saw "Everyone laughed" when he came out in Europe around 1982 and kept an unclean but expensive gem. I just saw him again on the tape, almost twenty years later ... Bogdanovich has a true cordiality over his characters and kindly compassion that is hard and not feel. Great comedians and actors, good lines everywhere and for everything and pretty good editing. I laughed and smiled all the time. Like all of us, sometimes. Go get her.
