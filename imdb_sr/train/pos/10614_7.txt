Three girls (an all-female media team, including a cult actress Barbara Bach, no less) visiting a small city to cover the festival, eventually rented rooms in a house that they were supposed to avoid as a plague. A well-made little swinger, suffering from some redundant dialogue scenes and fairly thin plots (this does not seem to be the best way to hide his secrets). One of the main themes is quite disturbing (as in: vintage shock material), and that's basically what the movie is doing. Performance and cinema are pretty much above the nominal value (as compared to many other late 70s / early 80s in the same spirit), but what really recommends this film is a rather long top-notch scene in the basement environment. Since the introduction of the character "Keller Junior", its performance made my jaw open and it did not close to the end of the film. A very pleasant surprise for actor Sidney Lassicka (who was smiling in the film "Letio above the cuckoo's nest" and now completely crazy in "Invisible") takes on one of the leading roles.
