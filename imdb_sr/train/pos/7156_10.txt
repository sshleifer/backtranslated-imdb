Holes is a great movie. I love him a lot, and that's one of my favorite movies. It's one of the few films Disney produces that are not stupid. Holes are usually a very cool movie. I'd like Disney to make more similar pictures. Holes are really a rare type of Disney flicker that shows it's cool. Do not get the wrong idea, I do not mean bad Disney, but most of her things are child-centered and that's OK. Children deserve their own entertainment. But Disnei is guilty of trying to appeal to a teenage audience and they usually fail. But not with holes. It's a type of film that everyone can watch and enjoy, not to think it's somehow banal. Really, it's a movie that even many young hoodies can enjoy because there are characters they can connect to. He's not too cheesy and lives a bit on the edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more nervous shifts like this one.
