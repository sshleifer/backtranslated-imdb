Arguebli Al Pacino is the best actor. He plays Tony Montana, the Small Cuban Cabinet has turned into a rich and powerful crime in Miami, and he does it with only two things that he has in this world, his balls and words, and he does not break. No one for them. He begins to do jobs for the great time of the Cuban dealer, Frank Loggia, and quickly goes to the chart of the organization along with his long-time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). She will soon have an eye for Boss's sexy Elvira wife (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees Thoni's threat to his position, he tries to kill Tonia, but without luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him. the film has great support, among them is F. Murrai Abraham as a gangster, another famous face is Harris Iulin as a rotten cop trying to shake Tony, marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Loans Oliver Stone's eloquent script. This film is one of the brightest points of Brian DePalme in his long career of ups and downs, you can see that this guy is very talented. The movie has a magnificent look at it. Also pay attention to two unforgettable scenes: the one in the restaurant restaurant ("Say good night to a bad guy"). the second is the latest shooting where Tony shows he still knows how to shoot and kill about 20 assassins who attacked his house. This is certainly one of the most impressive endings of the film I've ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and movies about crime, this is an inevitable place. For others we recommend. 10/10
