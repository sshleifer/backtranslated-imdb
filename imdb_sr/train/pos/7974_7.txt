I found this film as a common French slap in America. The camera often focuses on obese people, on messy houses and on unfavorable rural areas. While narration seems to sympathize and admire the small towns that are familiar with the viewer, cinema exploits and humiliates them. There were, undoubtedly, thin people to see themselves in Glenkou and in orderly, organized houses, but Malle decided to show us the worst of what is seen there. I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to reveal their worst elements to the American public. I assure you, as a frequent guest in France, that everything is not good. Foreign immigrants are not assimilated, creating serious social inequalities. However, Americans do not want to expose the French because of their prejudices towards their compatriots and their envy towards the United States, so we probably will not watch movies on the subject.
