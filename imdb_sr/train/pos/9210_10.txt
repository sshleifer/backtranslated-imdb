I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, I'm an older man and I love most of the Western ones. I love movies that are partly based on facts. If I'm not mistaken, this is such a film. I love movies about revenge, that's what I think in my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the film were an introductory scene with whips and a shooting scene. I felt that the scene of coral beating was a little exaggerated, but it did not affect how I felt about the whole film. I saw what I think is the continuation of this film in the episode of a smoker gun. I also enjoyed it. I recommend you take the time to watch this movie, I'll watch it again. I also felt that the romantic parts of this film were well-played. I thought it was so beyond the character that Randy Travis played a criminal, but I always enjoy his acting.
