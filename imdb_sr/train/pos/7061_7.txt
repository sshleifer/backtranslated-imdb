Of course, the original is better, but this is not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it's made in 3 stories, but hey, so what? I thought it was good to be honest. In fact, I liked how Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love, which shows what love can do. The stories were not so bad. And I liked Cinderella's voice in that. In the original, I have nothing against her voice, but I think it sounds better here, more beautiful. And I liked her personality in that, she had more spine, and yet she was kind. So, I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams become real 7/10.
