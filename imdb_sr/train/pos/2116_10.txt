Has it ever been a more charming film than this? One of the reasons that everything works so well is that a group of actors really interact and influence the lives of others. In the center is the "romantic" of James Stuart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can not get along face to face, but are completely anonymously connected as buddies. But there are also helpful characters and, unlike many romantic comedies (including "Iou Got Mail", a recent update of the Shop), they are not only encouraged to support two potentials and their needs. They all become an intricate part of the rich tapestry of charm Ernst Lubiƒç. One of the most interesting scenes in the history of the film takes place when almost tragic Frank Morgan blatantly and humbly asks someone to have a Christmas dinner. Must see! **** from the ****
