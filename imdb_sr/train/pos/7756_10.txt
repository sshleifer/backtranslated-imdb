I'm not sure whether this is some kind of masterpiece or just mucks the paper raised with performance and visuals. Anyway, I'm sure I like it. From stunningly distorted, brilliant, intertwined stories, to the deliciously evil performances of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, to the vivid, colorful color with which everything is captured, this is a high-class garbage, and that's great fun. Not to mention the fun and cleverly covered sex texts that permeate the whole movie, always threatening to escape from the picture into a dialogue, but it will never do it. I would lie if I said that the pure entertainment value of the film did not contribute to my love for it, but there is some sort of bizarre art behind the unintentional (or is it?) Comedy and I really dug it up. I could really get into this melodrama.
