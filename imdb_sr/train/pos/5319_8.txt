Forget that this is a "B" movie. Forget it's in a lot of ways out of date. Instead, writer-director Ida Lupino deserves credit for addressing the topic which at that time (1950) was a taboo in Hollivood. To my knowledge, this was the first film to deal with the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that this crime has on its victims. Although most actors are at best pedestrians, Mala Povers, who was eighteen or nineteen at the time, is an excellent performer as a traumatized young woman, Ann, who is trying to escape from her "shame" . Based on her work in this film, I'm surprised she did not have a successful acting career. Tod Andrevs also has some nice moments as a minister who helps her to help her. Ms. Lupino, apparently working on a limited budget, was still able to create some unforgettable scenes such as search through the streets and streets that led to the rape, and the police that followed him. And, she created a bitter-sweet end that left me wondering if Ann could ever again have a normal life again.
