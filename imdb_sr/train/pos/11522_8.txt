I wanted to see this the longest, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite films, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought it was a great follow-up after that, but it's starting to retire. The acting and direction were great. In fact, everything in the movie seemed to run aside from the script. Sometimes the only thing that kept my attention was the fact that in the actress is the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This movie was good, but I was expecting more. P.S. Look for the great hands of Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
