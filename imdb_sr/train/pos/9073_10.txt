My wife and I took our 13-year-old son to watch this movie and we were absolutely delighted with the good movie entertainment. This is especially appealing to boys and boys who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the movie, and especially in Hallie Kate Eisenberg's commentary, "The guys are so weird." It is refreshing to watch a movie that shows that boys and girls really differ in their emotional and social composition. The boys are really doing such strange things and they usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers stupid! We enjoyed the film so much that my son and my 11-year-old friend, me and my daughters, the 23-year-old boy, went to watch the movie the next day for the boys. We had more fun for the second time and everyone had fun. The pre-adolescent actor is reckless and beautifully reminiscent of the TV Classic "Freaks and Geeks". We all feel it will become a hit that is not unlike "Freaks & Geeks" who did not survive his first season, but he sold out his DVD release. You see him especially if you have boys and you will see that he stimulates a conversation about entertainment and safety! Girls will love it because of the ability to say: "The boys are so weird!" Do not miss ...
