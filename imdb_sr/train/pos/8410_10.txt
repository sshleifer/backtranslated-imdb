In this really fascinating, dark film, a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, and in return the devil takes his picture (this is brilliantly worked in the film and is audibly pronounced when Balduin, a pupil used to practice fencing in front of a mirror), a visual metaphor for "a man in war with himself" who represents his immediate future. The student enjoys in his own money, but the woman he loves is unachievable (he made a pact with the devil, cut off forever from the love and other riches of the soul) you can have love or you can replace your soul for money, you can not have both. Balduina is pursued by his double (the interlates express this beautifully as the action.) Some of the scenes are incredible, the sense of failure when the Devil disappears with Balduin's mirror image is incredible, and the feeling that his pact has always cut him from human society (the scene in which he escapes from his double and ending in a 'devastation' on the edge of the city, is no longer completely human (he lost his soul) he is like a hunting animal outside human society There is still much to say about this incredible movie, Paul Vegener was an incredible actor and director , my cultural he oj, which helps if you know something about German history at the time this film was filmed and about the German duplicate. Tradition (do not google, get an appropriate book) Just remember, it's a very early film, sometimes it's a bit clumsy, but considering what has to say and it's a tragic final, it's one of the best ever (yes Is!)
