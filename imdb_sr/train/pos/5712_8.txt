This is an irresistible big, cheerful and technically great movie! The film contains some of the greatest looks you'll ever see in a movie from the 30s, although it's obvious they are more than the actual location. Often if the figure falls or shakes the door too aggressively, the entire set will obviously move. Best moments of the film were quiet, antique, flashy moments. This shows that the true heart of Rene Clair was in a quiet film. Overall humor is really great in this movie. Also, of course, musical moments were more than big. This is really a pleasant light and simply a pleasant early French musical. Although the best moments are quiet moments, this does not mean that the film is not filled with some great humorous dialogue, which is very well delivered by the main actors, who all of us looked like actors, who worked in this case remarkably. good for film's overall style and a pleasant atmosphere without worry. It's no wonder that this was so good, because this film is actually based on Georges Berre's set design. It's technically a really great movie, with some great innovative camera and some really great movie. editing, which creates some quick and pleasant viewing of a favorable sequence. This film is never a boring moment! Rene Clair was such a smart director, who knew how to build and plan comic moments in movies. It's a very creative movie, which, despite its simplicity, still feels like a completely original and cleverly constructed movie, which never enjoys entertainment. The last half hour is especially memorable, without spoilage. too, and is indeed one of the greatest, but also the most creative moments in the early comedy. The film is filled with some really fun characters, which are, of course, very stereotyped and stupid. and they are obviously thrown out for their looks. All this contributes to the pleasant light comedy atmosphere and the beauty of the film. One of the most beautiful movies you'll ever see! 8/10
