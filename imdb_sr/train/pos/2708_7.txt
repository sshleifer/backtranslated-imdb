After being in prison for at least 10 years and more than 40 years for causing drugs and refusing to give up his achievements, Jackie (Erica Gavin of Russ Meier "Viken" and "Beiond the Vallei of Dolls" , in her latest film role) must get used to life in a big dollhouse, or at least try, in this early film by Jonathan Demme. Due to the difficult nature and steep look, I would rank it as one of his best films, just below "Silence of the Lambs" and "Stop Making Sense", but so far above all his other films. This smaller classic is just camps, sleazy, and fun enough that an incredibly good culprit pleasure and happiness never crossed into all out parodies on Women in the jail's jail. MALO rinsed the bad taste of meaningless "Philadelphia" from the mouth. However, the film is not without its flaws ('a non-frivolous shov is a huge deal to get out and go too long, Barbera Steele is sadly futile, among other small things) But do not let these flux stop you from watching a otherwise enjoyable movie. My Rating: B- DVD Extra: 5 minutes interview for Roger Corman; Cast & Crev Bios; Original Trailer; and "Candi Stripe Nurses" trailers (with nudity), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (with nudity), & "Crazi Mama" Eie Candi: Juanita Brovn, Cheril "Rainbeauk" Smith, Eric Gavin, Robert Collins, Ella Reid, Linda Gold and some others
