Every time I watch this movie I'm impressed with the whole production. I came to the conclusion that this is the best romantic comedy ever made. Everyone involved is perfect; scripts, acting, direction, sets, and editing. While James Stevart can always rely on a good performance, and supporting actors are magnificent, Margaret Sullavan reveals what was an underrated actress. Her tragic personal life gives her feelings to her qualities as a performer, where the acting skills of comedy are not easy to achieve. Lubitsch managed to get the best and obviously he did his best. Watch out for the number of scenes made on a single shot - take off breath.
