I've always been interested in watching movies in Hong Kong, but everyone has not managed to meet my expectations ... until now! GORANI RAJ does not contain flat humor that most HK movies have, nor another fast story that is pulled into a movie. The story is not complicated, but there are never scenes that only fill some "intelligent" spaces (the only truly intelligent martial arts film I've seen is TUGGING, but since Hollywood is on, it's not a real HK movie for me). There are some incredible fighting scenes in this film, from the first (which is one of the best I've ever seen, but so short) to the last major scenes! But mind, there is also a lot of blood flowing (people are cut in half, cut off, etc.). The production is pretty good, and special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled, although some shots must be quite technical (note: a sheet of paper that throws and stabbed the wall!). Yes, not Tsui Hark or John Voo made my favorite movie in Hong Kong, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure I'll check out more of this director! Ace.
