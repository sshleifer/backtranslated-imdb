French Naudet brothers did something that no one else did, they had a video camera on the day the tragedy occurred. They were in building number 2, when you could see papers disappearing, people hit the ground from jumping from such a height. the camera still worked, when the white dust covered them, they found the entrance to the store and walked in, but all that shot was real and I think they did a fantastic job to capture it. The stars leave Naudet brothers who shot this amazing movie I watch every 9/11, so I will never forget what this country has gone through. I believe that if I remember correctly, this shows the first death of firefighter priests, while he was taken to the church and his honorable funeral.
