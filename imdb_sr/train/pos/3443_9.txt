A striking, honest, bold and unforgettable psychological film of horror that touches upon the painful experiences of pain caused by rape - "Descent" is a film that went under radar due to a lack of distribution, because, frankly, the film is so brutal in its displays, that, if it is he was liberated theatrical, maybe he met himself with some kind of biased hatred. Film deserves to be revealed, not only for its dark subjects, and not only because of its incredible direction and authentic style - but above all because of its performance. Chad Faust is absolutely stunning, brings enough sickness and enough vulnerability to create it, does not apply to him, but he sees this broken man with a distorted perspective of his sexuality, not only with raped women, but also with fragile uncertainty deep inside himself. It is a support that is so complex, courageous and emotional on Faust's part. And it's hard to forget. However, the standpoint is Rosario Davson, whose performance here is absolute revelation. A tour of realistic drama ticks and one of the finest but loud performances for quite some time. While Davson sees some good accompanying appearances in some great films, she here proves that she has what it takes to deliver some emotionally brisk and moving performances, faithfully and thematically. One of the best movies this year (and in 2007 it was strong) - whether this was an underestimated and intelligent movie hit, it would be praiseworthy for him, as well as Davson and Faust. It is a shame that it was too dull for a widespread complaint. Such films deserve better!
