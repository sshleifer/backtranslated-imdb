Apparently, a film that had great influence not only on the genre of friends, but also on the action genre. George Lucas had to be a fan of this film, because most of his series from "Star Wars" is a gift to Gunga Din. The characters playing Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks are just the predecessors of Han Solo, Luke Skivalker and Chevbacce. Even Sam Jaffe's Gunga Din is flooded with C-3PO and R2-D2 and he either does not like: Jar Jar Binks. Today, this film is seen as a non-PC, but there is a speech by Eduard Cianelli as the leader of the Indian opposition to the British paradise that can be reflected in most of today's feelings. This young boy was a great movie. Three strong male leaders and only a hint of romance. There was a time when young boys were considered to be kissing a girl in Saturday's matinee film. Not like today when more skin is greeted with enthusiasm. Too late for sadly lost innocence. I hope this movie will not be forgotten and some who have surfed the channels will stand on the TCM and catch a movie with action, adventure and thousands instead of CGI actors.
