This is the movie Noir "B series", and my voice reflects membership in this genre. Last night I saw a movie at the left bank in Paris, where a two-week film was opened by noir run. The film has some disadvantages, yes, but too tasty elements to ignore. As the previous reviewer noticed, the drum scene is incredible! (B-movies could catch where A-films were forbidden to enter!) And the plot is intriguing. As far as Franchot Tone is concerned, however, I do not agree: it is convenient for me to be mysterious; just a real nuance angry. It should be kept in mind that some kind of German expressionism is happening here (the director, Robert Siodmark, was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), and thus turns into a whole movie. At least it does for me. However, this is the lovely Ella Raines who only held this viewer captured during the entire film in her only third-best performance. The type "Girl Friday" with a strong resemblance to Gene Tiernei, it's a miracle that she did not become the name of the household. But she is so good that I just ordered another of her films ('Impact') from the Internet, and I can not wait to see it.
