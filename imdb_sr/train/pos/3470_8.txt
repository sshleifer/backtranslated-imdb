Although I'm pretty young, The Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE band! I've never had the opportunity to hear their music like releases, but I love them since I can remember. It's a kind of movie worth a try once. I see why it was not published in the cinema, but it's certainly a great movie to be put on TV. I ran through my TV guide and by accident I watched this movie, he did not have much detail other than something like: "John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after the Beatles interrupted, Jared Harris Stars." I've never heard of him (played by John) or Aiden Kuinn who played Paul. However, they are certainly underestimated by the actors! The film slowly began, but as it evolved, I could see how Kuinn, but especially Harris, played his characters. As a big fan, I know what Lennon and McCartney really are. The scenario was brilliant and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and manners. Kuinn played well with McCartney, but he sometimes went into his Irish accent. Make-up make it look great. THIS PARAGRAPH CAN BE INCLUDED AS A * SPOILER *: As I mentioned before, it slowly began, but soon it developed and became a pretty emotional movie. In the park I found something that is a total waste of time and quite unusual for both musicians. As far as Lennon's indecent line in the Italian restaurant is concerned, it is completely unnecessary. The ending was very sharp and tears my eyes whenever I look. It's completely different from other biographical films I've seen in terms of how the Beatles gathered and celebrated, and they never knew it well. E.g. "Backbeat". In conclusion, I would say, if you are fans of Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney, give him a chance to have a pleasant surprise. In only 95 minutes, it is worth waiting for the film to develop. If someone knows whether the 1976 meeting really happened, send it to the 'commentary page' for this movie. It would be very interested.
