I love this movie. As a kid, this was one of the first films I saw to be annoying. Certainly, now it's mild, but lately, it was great. Dentists are one thing that many people are scared of, so why not record a drama about killing a dentist? It's cheesy, it's fun, it's sometimes scary, but it's great. And I always had love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen perfectly plays Dr. Feinstone, no one could have done better. And for the horror movie of low budget, the effects are quite good. I love music on the topic, it goes well with the film. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also playing this curious policeman, and doing a good job. There is a fair amount of blood, and some really cool scenes of torture and death. Check this out!
