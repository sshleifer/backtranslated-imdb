I waited for years until I saw this, because all the reviews I read said it was terrible! I rented it by expecting the worst, and while it's hardly the best sandels movie there, it's much worse! Sandler often talks to the camera and the movie is not taken seriously, but it's all part of the fun! A great way to lose the afternoon, and you may even laugh twice! Good movie, it's worth renting!
