The stupid movie is really, really funny. Yes, it has its dead moments, it can be a bit too obvious, in the second half it is a little diminishing, and the story is unbearable confusion, but it laughs loudly ridiculously. And it's worth seeing only Ed McMahon as the right wing. This movie is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly funny, not appreciated film.
