1936 was the most fertile year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second film for RKO that year is the third movie in this collection? Mark Sandrich '' Follow the Fleet ''. This time, Astaire is painfully uncomfortable like Bake Baker, a sailor on vacation who just happens to come across a cafe on the coast where Sherri Martin screams romantic sweet things in everyone's ear. Yes, you guessed it? They were once again hot for each other. Only this time, Sherrina's sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens the whole fine romance by falling on Bake's strong friend of maritime affairs, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); somehow use them and throw somebody type, thus forcing Sherri to reconsider their opinions about all sailors in general. Irving Berlin gives an indelible class to this classic, classic result, including the standards 'Let Iourself Go', 'I put all my eggs in one basket' and 'Let's face music and dance'; The latter is a divinely inspired sketch of suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and fundamental sub-band for Fred and Ginger. Transfer to 'Follov The Fleet' is a bit weaker. The gray scale remains well balanced, but is now a bit dense, with almost the same tonal variations as the previous titles. The grain is still present. Thus, artefacts are also associated with age. Once you are placed in a slightly dense and sometimes slightly focused image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for the film of this vintage. The sound is Mono, but very well balanced. The accessories include features, a theatrical trailer and a brief theme, but weird? no audio comments. Taking into account the importance of this film in the overall Astaire / Rogers canon, this is unusual control of Varner Home Video.
