I watched "Elephant Valk" for the first time in around 30 years, and I was stunned as much as the story is about the superb "Rebecca". As others have said, a cute young thing is removed from the leg, alternately charming and imaginary master of the castle, only to find her marriage endangered by the inevitable memory of a relative greater than life. You have a strict and unapproved servant, a crisis that will either tie a couple or destroy them irreparably, the culmination of the fiery destruction of a luxurious property. In the meantime, the "Elephant Walk" also owes some of his angry jungle atmosphere to the "Letter", the love triangle Bette Davis is set on a Singapore rubber plantation, not a tea plantation in Sri Lanka. Maltin gives "Elephant Valk" only two stars, and IMDb readers are not much more polite, but I enjoyed it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Tailor never looked lovely, and Peter Finch is doing a credible job as a good man who can not shake off the influence of his fatherly father. Dana Andrevs - favorite in "Lauri" and "Best Years of Our Life" - was lost as Elizabeth's frustrated fan. The real star is a bungalow, one of the most beautiful interiors in the history of the film.
