A wonderful movie to watch with stunning scenes and talented actors, such as Misha Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of watching, your eyes lock into the screen and do nothing but breathe in the atmosphere of the film waiting for what fate will bring to the characters. This movie forces you to abandon your position as a standard audience, it introduces you, makes you part of the story ... Costumes and settings are brilliant; especially olyaus crust is skillfully built. It's definitely not Akira Kurosawa, but still gets a lot from the masters, especially a stylish story that tells us that we are in a prominent land of film that is quite far from Hollywood dance.
