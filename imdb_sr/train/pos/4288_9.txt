Rain or shine outside, enter the cinema. It makes you happy. (If not, exit immediately.) The lights go out. Calm down with a bar of ice cream. Movable images begin to blink on the screen. You feel satisfied. In the dark you came back at the beginning of time. Sitting around campfire ... watching a modern version of flashing flames 24 times a second and sharing the joy of discovering unknown turns and turning scenarios with the rest of your clan / viewer. Those who are not satisfied with themselves, should not write comments. (Living Romantic Comedies ...)
