Cor blimei. This film really surprised me because the masterpiece is a comedy. Billy Zane is astounding as a central character, and everyone succeeds in doing it well enough to make the comedy natural and easy. I recommend that you watch this movie with a bunch of friends, several bottles of your drinks of your choice, and prepare to be stunned and entertained. From space, this is in the true "B" film tradition. But what makes it more than that is the caliber of people who took part in the film. Ron Pearlman, for example. I still find my giggling on a scene where Zane climbs down a series of steps without an obvious reason in an almost ballet style. It's all a little crazy, and it's all better for that.
