I saw this film the day it came out last year. I thought funny. Well, it's on the video now and I saw it again. I love this movie! Things they do sometimes are stupid, but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time. Special effects are fine, but the witty dialogue will give you rolling. I am the person who will say that I am inspired by this film, so if you like drama and other things, avoid it. But for all the rest, enjoy! The acting is wonderful. Hank Azaria is the best hand down (neither communist nor fruit), followed by Ben Stiller (uh, do not correct me, that hurts me), and then Villiam H. Macchi delivers the best results (surpasses fargo). he praised everything from the manuscript to the garage, but I think that Kel Mitchell was pretty good as an invisible boy. Two problems: The saddest part of the movie is the subtitle of the romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani and a hearing on Caslan's conditional release. Some scenes absolutely enhance the story in no way, but they are an explosion. Kinka, and especially writers tend to drag on the scene until it's gone, but the bam is shifting and you're ready for more. I swear after I've seen this, you will be tired of an explosive peak (which I think was pretty cool). The camera is pretty cool, moving with furious pace with actors. Also, Tom Vaits brings an extraordinary performance (he has some sort of cool cool cold towards him) and as someone else has said, the best parts are when their characters show some kind of humanity. Captain Amazing is quite fun, (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan - I was rolling) and the rush is pretty cool as Casanova. One beef: the most entertaining ever comedy (eddie izzard) is almost lost, but his heart is in the right place. All in all, a wonderful movie. I give him twenty stars and I hope that one day everyone will see the glow in the best parody of the movie, Six Million Dollars. Now I laugh when I think about it. 20/10
