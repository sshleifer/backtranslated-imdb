This is a fantastic series. It's very well made and very interesting. As a huge World War II buffer, I learned a lot before I saw this series. One of the best things for this is all interviews with past individuals when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking that it was. This is nothing against the men you see being interviewed in today's programs, only that most of these people were not really involved in the upper positions of what was then happening. One of the best parts is the story of Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about the Second World War, but they really think that only those who died (like me) want to buy it or watch it many times. My only real complaint about the entire series is that some facts are not as accurate as we know now. Especially when information about the Soviet Union is exaggerated or simply inaccurate in some places. This information is now different, now we know about the fall of the USSR. All in all, a fascinating view of the Second World War and a compulsory view of every serious World War II historian, either professionally or personally.
