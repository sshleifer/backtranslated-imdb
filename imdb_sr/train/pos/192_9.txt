Before I saw Shov People, my impression of a silent comedy was essentially a slapstick, and just a slapstick. I could not imagine how the comedy on the screen could be possible without relying on the spoken word or numerous difficulties. But this masterpiece showed me that I was wrong. Davis, in my opinion, was probably the greatest comic actress who appeared before Lucille Ball. I mention Luci primarily because Davis's manners and facial expressions reminded me of her to the extent that I wondered if Davis was not one of Bal's primary influence. This comes from a 21-year-old who has never seen a quiet comedy before, and I must say that no matter how much it actually relates to a certain period (not, obviously), you will not be bored. You'll probably even laugh more than you would on most comedies. This is not only my favorite quiet comedy, but it's easy among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
