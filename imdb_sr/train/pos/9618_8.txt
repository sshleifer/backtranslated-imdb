I recently bought this film and I do not regret that I have it at all, because in fact I am very pleased to add this film to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hai, film directors, filmed less than a month and spent about a million euros to produce this brilliant film. This proves that not only great productions make great movies. The title of this movie perfectly fits. In computer language, BUG indicates a program error that causes reactions in the function of a computer. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also great moments of beauty. The rogue events in this film begin with the death of BUG. The man is the witness of "crime" on the other side of the road ... From there everything complicates ... I point out John Carrol Linch ("Fargo"), Vallece, a man who can not straighten everything at all.
