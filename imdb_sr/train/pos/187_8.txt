Marion Davies starred in this remarkable comedy Shov People, released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays a peasant from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives at Hollivood with her father (Dell Henderson). The blindness they come in is a whistle-like Davis's modest southern costume. Davis makes a comedy job, not what she wants, but brings her success. He met his fellow slugger Villiam Haines, who was immediately hit by her. Then, Davies gets a job at the prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and records a job in congested periods. A handsome or fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her ropes how to be a typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davis leaves his friend and father for a good life, but of course he learns that this is not what she really is. Marion Davies is wonderful, because she - unexpectedly - launches the scale of the emotions needed for a "serious" actress. Villiam Haines is his usual comedy, and there are also the appearances of Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, King Vidor. This is a silent movie with several "sound effects" because sound images have just come to their own. Mild movie.
