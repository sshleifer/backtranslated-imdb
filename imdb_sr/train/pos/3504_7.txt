This film feels like a film project. It's as if the film's authors chose a cross-section of the society without experience and had to work. The characters are somehow unobstructed and naive. Despite this amateur feel, the film is effective. It's like a cross section of life with neighborhood kids who try to understand or nurture their sincere sexual feelings. Since she was raised by grandmother, of course, from this generation there is a disgrace related to sexuality. This provides some predictable, but well-conceived conflict. Probably the most entertaining was the way in which the main figure grew a little in its romantic relationship, achieving a greater depth of sexual feelings. Good watch, but nothing exciting.
