In colonies, we are not all familiar with Arthur Askei, so I almost skipped this film (which recently had my TCM review) because of negative comments about his appearance in "Ghost Traine" - which I expected to be basically boring. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised when I heard how laughing. The physical aspects of Askei's comedy and his moment when the line comes out suggests what would have been that Charlie Chaplin and Voody Allen had a baby. There is no comparison with Bud Abbot or any other common comic relief providers that appear in the films of this genre. Moreover, the thread that connects Askei with the British comedy 30 years later can be felt; At least from the American point of view, it is clear that he has more in common with the Monti Pithon group than with any of his colleagues here. As far as the rest of the film is concerned - the more you see the movies, the more likely you will eventually end up, but it's still fun and atmospheric and it's worth awaiting your next performance.
