This is a big documentary. Each auto racing fan should have a copy of this extraordinary movie. The director of "Stephen Lov" has done an excellent job, as well as the main stars of the film "Father and Son," Mario & Michael Andretti. DVD looks and sounds incredible. And the best of all is IMAKS! Excellent test drive for home theater.
