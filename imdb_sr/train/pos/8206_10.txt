Clint Eastwood is back as Dirty Harry Calahan in the fourth Dirty Harry series. Clint is older, but he still has, Harry was told to spend a holiday after the trouble that happened because of the robbery (from where comes the "Make Mi Dai" memorable)! a woman turned into a vendetta after raiding an amusement park and began to receive punches one by one. The latest movie for Sandra Locke in Clint Eastwood! Improvement after The Enforcer, which was a bit more comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood sunglasses were Gargoiles best known for the sunglasses worn by Arnold Shvartzeneger in the Terminator. It's worth watching if you love Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry films or as an action criminal thriller.
