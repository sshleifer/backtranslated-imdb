Sit there for half an hour and watch the story, believing in it all, and then watch another half an hour of the same story that is completely revealed ... and then reconnect. One of the most exciting feature films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I do not know if - except Andrew Jarecki's "Capturing the Friedmans" - there has ever been something like "Forbidden Lie". Anna Broinovsky. He presents, reveals, defends, reveals and questions everything about Norma Khouri, the author of "Honor Lost", the honored and lambasted bestseller of 2001 on the honor of killing in Jordan. What is incredible and what makes the movie so remarkable is that this "exposure" of Khouri was made with the full participation of Khouri. For the initial part of the film, Khouri presents her story of the alleged honorary murder of her friend in Amman, a story about the book. Sounds quite convincing, convincing. Then her story is split, exposed, truly convincing and convincing people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, investigative journalists and Australia, where Khouri lived Some time. Khouri returns and denies accusations, taking a successful lie tester test. There is another segment of devastating expositions - not to be stated here, as this would diminish the value of shock ... and then Khouri returns and faces charges (not everything, but essential in matters of books). /> And the Houdini act continues, with a round after a round in this difficult, combat rewarding battle, a surprise after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in terms of resolution. Brilliant.
