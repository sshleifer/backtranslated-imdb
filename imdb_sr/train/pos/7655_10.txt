Since I have not seen this film for about 20 years, I am still impressed with his powerful stroke and star game. Of course, one year ago. Mickey Rooney is truly UNDECLARED in his role as the leading "Killer". (In relation to another review - no one other than Orson Welles evoked the name of Mickey Rooney as the greatest film actor, too.) I also recall the jazz-brass results and naked black and white photos. I like Mick's last line before he goes for his lead poisoning. (I think Davies picked him up for a line in one of their songs - Grab.) This is a great movie and an unjustly buried movie. Let's get him out! Side note - The recently published magazine Reviev has given a big record of Don Segal's "Babiface Nelson", made several years before "Last Mile" and also starring Mickey Rooney. Another excitement of Mickey's intense and cute performance. Perhaps it is the beginning of gratitude for some truly top-notch film performances.
