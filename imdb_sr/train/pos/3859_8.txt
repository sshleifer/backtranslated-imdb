De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) Paula Verhoevena is one of the most interesting thrillers I've ever seen. It was really a pleasant surprise. The story relates to bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), because he is lured into a relationship with the beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renee Soutendijk), but in Gerard's twisted mind there could be more in the story. Verhoeven and cameraman Jan De Bont create a beautiful and dense atmosphere full of surreal and painful sexual images, this really pulls you in the story, you do not want to watch, but you can not turn around. This is by far the best Verhoeven movie (maybe just the second for Robocop). True Fourth Man is not for everyone, some sex scenes are fairly free (just ignore them, but believe me, if you watch at least ten minutes you will be hooked in. This is one of those movies that you need To know how this ends, The truth is that in Hitchcock's tradition, convincing, controversial and exciting, I even like the spider's metaphor. 8/10
