An excellent, pre-code amoral story with Barbara Stanvick as a new inspiration (writing Nietzsche!) In order to expose her sensibility and exploit herself, she uses men in her own favor. It's not fair to the German philosopher, but it's interesting that it was the year when Hitler came to power. Stanvick, even in this young version, does not do much for me, but she certainly works well here, always drives herself and the movie forward. There is not so much meat here as you would expect, but there are many risky situations and stunning incentives and allusions. Excellent entertainment, if not particularly attractive presentation of men, and I assume in all honest not very attractive view of gold digging a female. Still, it's life!
