Unlike other baseball movies, this film specifically distinguished itself due to hits of incredible special effects and a well-orchestrated soundtrack, which was very interesting. Although I liked this movie, he had some flaws like some irreverence (i.e. By the end when Rai Mitchell hit the homer did not get on the board and that would not be the result, I must say that I was truly impressed by the presence and the morale of this Movie: Just have faith, Do not give up.
