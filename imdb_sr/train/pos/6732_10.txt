This is the best documentary I've ever seen !! I just saw the Lords of Dogton and I wanted to find out more about Stacy Peralta, and I was surprised and happy to know that this was one of his films. Great Job Staci! Last week I went back to work, I was bored with O * and ^% and this film appeared. I grew up in Orange County in the 80s, surfed up and down the local beaches, and my dad when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents led me every weekend, I surfed the body, and then I moved. This film was fascinated by me. It was the way before my time, but it was great to see what these guys went through .. PIONEER! This film is a collection.
