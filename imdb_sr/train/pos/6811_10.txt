Although I do not like the remake in general, believing that the remake is a waste of time; this film is an exception. Until now I did not know before reading the previous comment that it is a remake, so my opinion is purely about the film itself, not about the comparison. The story and the way it's written is no question: it's Capote. There is no need for more words. The game of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is excellent. I've seen some movies with them, each in one or the other. I was sure they were good actors, and in the case of Eric, I always wondered why his sister was famous star number 1, not her brother. This time, this security has been brought to light, there is no doubt. His game, just like Mr. Edwards's game, is obviously the top of all of their professions. I recommend this movie to be on the 50 best movies to see and keep your DVD shelves.
