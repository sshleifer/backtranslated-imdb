I liked it very much. In fact, if I see it again (and I plan), I can just like it. I will repeat other reviewers again saying that this movie really grows on you while watching. It starts somehow slowly, but the embrace path is very natural and has a mood. Just get yourself into it. I really liked the summer atmosphere of the film and I thought that the film was very moving as a whole. The characters have a powerful element of realism and the movie will slowly and gently intertwine the spell as you engage in different interactions between them and want to know how it will eventually turn out and which paths the characters will choose. I'm very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments about it - there are obscure TV movies that have more comments than Rich In Love. One thing I will say is that I missed the end that drove me out and I have to watch it again to see it. This is a movie that may not be for everyone, but I think it's really underestimated (even some of my biggest movie friends who watched almost every movie that did not see it), and it seems that there are not many messages, but it seems to me They liked a lot and everyone who likes family drama that is warm in the landscape, the atmosphere and the busy, low rhythm should look at this. Particular attention should be paid to the fact that it is taking place in South Carolina, and for those (like me) who love the south, and the films that are being held there, this is a gem. I'll add my voice for a bit of comments and recommend this little movie.
