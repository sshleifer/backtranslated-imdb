It's been a long time since I saw this movie (at least 15 years old), and yet I still persecute a vivid picture of the terrible consequences that prisoners of war can confront despite the terms of the Geneva Convention. The Australian underwater demolition unit was trapped in an archipelago near Japan after a successful mine-laying mission in the Japanese port. Once in jail, these men expect the same treatment as all other prisoners of war, but they soon find out from a friendly Japanese prison guards that they are being tried as spies because they were trapped in uniform. The consequences of such a violation, the Japanese combat code, is the execution by cutting off. Despite their requests, and the appeals of the compassionate prison guards, the day of counting is approaching as a timed bomb. The tension is so high that you will actually hear the typing, although it can only be that your chest picks up the percussion of the marching execution squad. The ending is actually too painful to be much less repeated in my head. write here. But I can promise you-- you'll never forget. Good luck finding videos in the United States
