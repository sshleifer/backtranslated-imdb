Why is this film not the 250 best? This film looks still incredibly fresh 56 years after its production, but it could only be made after VVII due to the perception of the proximity of death. People were aware that life could be stopped at an unexpected moment. And what after life? I liked the scene at the end of the judgment and all the people of all nations gathered. The phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer - a typical British judge), Doctor Reeves (Roger Livesei) defends Peter Carter (David Niven) and June (Kim Hunter) against US prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raimond Massei I - there is a reason why) is an American. Everything is so imaginative! Michael Povell has written, directed and produced this stunning movie that is a real "tour". The message of the film is clear: in the universe the law is the most important, but on earth nothing goes beyond love between people. The way this wonderful story is told is far more interesting than any Hollywood movie.
