Arthur Bach is extremely unhappy in his life as a multimillionaire and is drawn to people "beneath him" in a social position - he pays for a whore in introductory scenes, and then is incredibly attracted to thieves. He also drinks a lot, and sometimes he drives while drinking, which of course is not ridiculous. The film is excellent, but behind comedy is some reality. John Gielgud wiped the floor with everyone else on the screen and created the image for centuries. Talk about earning an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but Gielgud will remember "Hobson" the most.
