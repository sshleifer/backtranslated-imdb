The Worst Movie of All Time? Vov, vhoa nov. You can not be serious. Perhaps everything is related to what you expect from the movie. I live in Oregon, so I had to enjoy the beautifully photographed photos of the famous but still incredibly beautiful Smith Rocks and other areas in Central Oregon (as well as the sweet comedy of our Ken Kenya and Ken Babbs who look at the Sissi's grandmother's cradle at the beginning film). They were enough to encourage me to make the movie better than the "average". Or ... Maybe it's all about what you expect. After reading the book "Avers" and thinking about myself "goodness, no one could ever make a movie from this interesting, strange, strange book ... especially 20 years later, when the sea (MORAIS - can not be emphasized on the Internet) have changed "- I was quite pleasantly surprised when I first watched the movie when it came out in 1994, and I even liked to see it again today. Sissi was greatly thrown, and I do not care what you say, and I was pleasantly surprised by the performances of Rain Phoenix and John Hurt. I'm not a lesbian, nor I would also be trans, but I met many people who are similar to those they were supposed to show - and these "real" people behaved in the same way as these actors acted. It's a bit sloppy, that's it - always a bit "on." Gus Van Sant is a weird, born Oregon, but he did a good job by adjusting this crazy book, IMHO.
