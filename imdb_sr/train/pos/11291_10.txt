Could anyone buy this movie? My Uncle "Hutch" was a Real (non Reel) pilot who was seen throwing his wings in the air, then tugging at the fist as he received his pilot's wings. He is only on the screen for a few seconds, but my family would like to have a movie. He was killed in a battle over Italy, then he was only 24 years old. Do we know the film studio that made it? Anyone else saw him in the video, such as Blockbuster? I would like that entire catalogs of these old films would be available, because it's so cheap that DVDs will be made these days. Thank you.
