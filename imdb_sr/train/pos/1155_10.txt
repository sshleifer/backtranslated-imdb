That's very funny. He has an excellent actor who gives each of them great performances. Especially Salli Field and Kevin Kline. This is a well-written script by Andrea Bergman (Honeimoon and Vegas). I do not like soap operas, although I never look at them. But I love this movie because it's so crazy and out of the wall that it's hell out of any stupid soap that they have on a daily television. In my opinion, it's the best 1991 film.
