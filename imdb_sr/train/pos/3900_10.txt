This is at the top of my list of the hysterical fun shows I've ever seen. I laughed so much, I'm sure I missed a half joke. This shows Izzard as a brilliantly talented comedian like he is. What I especially like is that it seems that I never "dumb" material for my audience. His timing is flawless and routine is connected as a performance, and not just as a series of gags. Thumbs vai up.
