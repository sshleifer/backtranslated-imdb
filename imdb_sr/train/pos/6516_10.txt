Hello. I just watched this movie today for the fourteenth time in 3 days. I'm a history teacher who has too much time on my hands. I need a life. I found a movie that had an incredible resemblance to a broken mountain. I found out that I look like Jean Lafitte if he was white. also, my favorite line in the whole movie was from Mr. Petey - "this baby can shoot about 300 meters!" Oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British came, and a drummer who was so devoted to his job, and he drummed to death, as if that drum had completely ended the war ... but would not. Well, that's all I would like to say about this movie. Oh, one more thing. Bonnie Brown is a crazy physical bipolar swinging mood BEEIOTCH. that is all.
