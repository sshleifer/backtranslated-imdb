Despite the close story, Johnnie To's Election feels like it used to be a long shot, with many characters and complex strands that are abandoned or ultimately unresolved. Some of them are processed in a really great and far superior way, Choice 2: Harmony is a virtue, but it is still a fascinating thriller about controversial Triada elections that circumvent common shootings and explosions (albeit not violence) in favor of continually changing the alliance which can be converted into the time required for a phone call. It is also a film in which the most cruel character is not always the most dangerous, as it is only too clear an end: one can imagine the lifetime of psychological counseling that is necessary for all the trauma that an unfortunate person causes. Simon Iam, often a turning actor, but always the best in the direction of To, may have never been better in leadership, not only because Toni Leung's extrovert performance makes his silence stronger.
