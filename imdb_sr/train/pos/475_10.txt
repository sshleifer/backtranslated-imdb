Once again proving his incredible versatility, John Turturro plays an introspective Russian chess genius preparing for a return tournament, and creates an incredible relationship with gadabout fellow Emili Vatson at an Italian hotel in the 1920s. They fall in love with the horror of their soccer-hiking mother (Geraldine James). A beautiful love story, whose shine cheek could lead to the appearance of the brain. But, despite his origins in the story of Nabakovo, it certainly is not. Romantic elements and the feeling of time and place have won the psychological analysis of the hand. John Turturro, appearing in "Barton Fink," "Brother, where are you?" "Veliki Lebovski" proves that he does not depend on Coen Bros films to confirm his status.
