You never saw anything like that. When the pointer starts, it's the brightest thriller on the edge of your seat that you'll ever see - although you know the outcome. And all this is real, because the documentary - incredible. While it was over, it was on my Top 10 list of great movies of all time. Anyone I know who saw this movie gives a rating of 4 stars. Even if you do not care about politics or the politics of Venezuela, you will find yourself nervous and - believe - on the edge of your seat.
