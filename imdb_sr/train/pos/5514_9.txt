I watched the first part two days ago and today I saw the other part. Of course, these two parts are worldly, so I'm a little shaken by everything I've seen. I felt depressed with knowledge of the inevitability of Che's death; for me, he blurred the entire film. I suppose that was exactly what Soderberg wanted to feel, slowly evolving the inevitability of his death. The second part was so weak compared to, again the inevitability, but in Cuba it was positive, and in Bolivia it was so negative. The movement's policy in Bolivia is only aloud, but it rarely faced a didactic one. For me, the unforgettable scenes were all at the end of the film: Confrontation with the prisoners and a milder conversation with a Bolivian official where this official Cheu asks the question of the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. I did not consider national differences as important as they did in the conflict, Argentine vs. Bolivia. I thought Soderbergh was wonderfully concerned with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; how to get food without antagonizing peasants who do not have enough of themselves. I was amazed that it would be hard to try something Che tried. I guess everything is in time; whether there is enough anger against the government to start the movement; there was no Bolivia. Che, in a letter to Fidel, who read at the beginning of the film, realized the terrible corundum of the revolutionary: If not now, when, for 50 years. Very film-challenging and well-designed film; Do it all to see it.
