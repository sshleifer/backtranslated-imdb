Of course, I would have to give this film 10 out of 10 because my uncle was the main screenwriter of the film Once Upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego wrote scenarios for over 50 years in Italy. He was a great storyteller and someone suggested that his stories be written. So Rodolfo Sonego. If you look at his biography, you can see the number of films that were filmed in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor who starred in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my city in 1968 to check locations for the "girl in Australia" and make a big movie about the bride after World War II. You can see his humor in all his films. I recently found a copy of this movie on DVD. GREAT
