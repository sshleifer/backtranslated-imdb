Barbra Streisand is touring this Hollywood story. Her performances and songs are unique and special in the halls of great films. The scene in which Kristopherson met an unexpected audience, against wishes and her crowd, just to turn them around with her magnificent performance "Woman on the Moon", is one of the best examples of a film about how well a performer can conquer the audience. That's right. The scene where Evergreen records with the best in work ... all live, without the synchronization of lips, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being Diva, but she brings this. Kristopherson had moments, far beyond most of her film appearances, one of 1937 (Janet Gainor, Frederic March), although I will always to enjoy Judi Garland and James Mason a musical remake of 1954. I have not yet seen a DVD and I do not know its quality.
