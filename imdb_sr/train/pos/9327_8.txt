I am writing this after I just saw the Shining Son at the Gay and Lesbian Film Festival Mardi Gras 2002 in Sydney, Australia. brothers die from AIDS, they enter a path of reconciliation that warms the heart. Twice lead to the magnificent work of creating a gradual warmth and respect that develops between them as the film progresses. I have one suspicion about the film - while a brother who dies seems sick, he does not look like it. A person of 0 T4 cells would look pretty sick - even a make-up job to make the actor look sick was busy. A little grip, but one that makes it a little less realistic. Despite this small insult, the perfect son is a wonderful movie and if you have the opportunity to see it. I hope for a DVD release in the near future!
