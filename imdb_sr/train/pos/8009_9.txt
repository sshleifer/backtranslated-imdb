Ah, true memories. At that time, I lived in the Netherlands and I looked forward to seeing it every Sunday evening and later on Tuesday. I saw it during my 14-16. Very good for my (at the time of schooling) English because Dutch TV gives subtitles for other languages, except for current children's shows. So you would hear the original voices and language. - The best series were the first three, and after the third series, the big character, the Nazi Von Gelb, who was so heavy an enemy, disappeared from the series (I think they never really caught him, he always escaped), leaving space appears in the next story) because it is obvious that the series is also divided into Germany, and the Nazi enemy will not go very well! It's a pity, because Jeffrey Toon has done such a wonderful convincing job of showing intelligent Nazi aristocrats, who had this continuous obsession to avenge England. It was a great pleasure to see this kind of quality performance in the youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good friend and the young were so normal. At that time, I was very convincing and as a child I could only imagine being part of these young people, who at that time were about four years older than me. To me it was a very exciting series, which in my memory was singled out as a special show with the "Prisoner". I hope it will publish a quality DVD series, that would be wonderful. Even bad copies are still nice to watch. Later, the series were not so good, diluted, and not so much fun as the first three. I hope that other series with Von Gelb will be on DVD.
