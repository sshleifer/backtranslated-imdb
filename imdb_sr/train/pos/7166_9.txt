Holes, a novel, was forced into me in an educational course. I did not think I would love a children's novel; Plus, the other couple of books that I was forced to read for the class were really bad. But, to my surprise, I absolutely loved the holes. It's really one of the most perfect novels I've ever read. I think he has a rare quality that makes him attractive to teenagers, teenagers and adults. Anyone who reads it, I think it will go to a better person. Although I can not say that for the film, I am happy to say that they were mostly right. I think movie viewers will not go as enriched, but they will certainly be entertained, without the side effects being foolish when they sit down. It's an intelligent story and it's very well said. I think it moves too fast. Roman has more time developing characters. And flashbacks come and go so fast that they do not have too much time to register. In the past, the interracial romance is felt more clichely and swollen than in a novel. And the end, which connects all the loose threads, looks very funny. This is exactly the same in the novel, but there is a sense of absurdity that does not exist in the film. It works much better. I also do not like a lot of pop songs. I wish that Disney did not feel the need to sell music. Actors are excellent, from young to old professionals. Jon Voight is particularly good. Still, I'm not quite sure why we need Catwoman and Fonze. 9/10.
