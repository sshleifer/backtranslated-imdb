The valiant efforts to exploit the mining disaster as a means of declaring the repulsion of this director for war. The audience not only learned a lot about early mining rescue procedures, but we learned that Europeans had pacifists during the period between the First World War and the Second World War (due to the lack of a better term). The speeches of both representatives of each country at the end of the film are inspirational with regard to time. Although the revised edition, through the technology of transposing early foreign films, "cut off the heads of characters" sometimes, this film has its own many different aspects. Character analysis, lighting techniques, historical content and a script that has been tested and inspired by many writers and directors. Pabst went to Direct and put on the screen Veil & Brecht's "Three Penny Opera", starring the original star, Lotte Lenia.
