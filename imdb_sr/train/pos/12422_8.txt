With mixed reviews, this was not much expected, and it was pleasantly surprised. It's a very fun little crime movie with interesting characters, great portraits, writing that's breathless and good at speed. It looks good, funky. It's obvious that people love this movie or just hate it, and I'm the one who likes it.
