I initially achieved Sarah-in shov with a nice thick eighth, but I fought a little bit with her humor late and thin is what was solved. I'll explain. Or you will love Sarah's humor. , or you will not. If you do not, I doubt that somebody might convince you. You people know who you are and this is perfectly good, but then you know it. Moving on, the first season gave us fantastic portions of Sarah, her friends and family and her lifelong ventures. In an unforgettable episode, she was "withdrawn" by officer Jai who first met her luck. - "Do you know why I stand here?" he asks. "Because you have all C's in high school?" she answers questionably. It looked like a real question. - That's funny in my book. Sara can come to you from unusual corners. In the second episode, her affair with God was especially fun. God is small and jealous, he added a beautiful joke. It's smart, it's a weird view, but it would show us the truth in humor and we were laughing. Then came the second season. Although it is not yet without some new and inventive comedy, it seems that we moved a little into banal jokes and farts. I smile right here and there, but it looks like a lot of stuffing as they and writers struggle to encourage some original material. Sophomoric and tedious are the feelings I have for episodes lately, but I'm gutting out for the gems I find (a turtle) and waiting to turn her around. I was a fan of routine "Jesus is magic" and I would like to think that I understand what she is capable of. Let's get back to it.
