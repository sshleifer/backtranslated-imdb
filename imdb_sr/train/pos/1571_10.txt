Ever since Spongebob Skuarepantsi watched a bigger caricature on TV. The colors are great, voices can not be better, the characters are so original, big big cartoon. I hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon. I hope the DVD will soon come out! I love these cartoons and I hope that more people will get involved in this great cartoon. It's very difficult to find a DVD with Season, so if someone finds a store that sells, let me know. The only Catscratch goods available at Nick Shop is a great shirt, but very very expensive !!! If you like Spongebob; and who does not? and you will love Catscratch!
