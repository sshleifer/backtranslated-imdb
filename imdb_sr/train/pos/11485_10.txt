The nigh day tells you that you are thinking, even re-thinking about why two boys / boys would do what they did - commit suicide by slaughtering their classmates. It encompasses what must be beyond the bizarre way of existence for two men who have decided to withdraw from common courtesy to define their own / common world through unified destruction. It's not the perfect movie, but given the money / time that the director and actors had - it's a remarkable product. As for the explanation of the motives and actions of the two young suicides / killers, it's better than the 'Elephant' - in the sense that a film that is under our 'rationalistic' skin is far, far better, than just about everything you're likely to see. Wrong but honest with terrible sincerity.
