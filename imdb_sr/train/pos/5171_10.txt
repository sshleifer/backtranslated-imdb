If I could go back, even as an adult, and to spend the days of my summer spent in the camp ... I would be there so fast. The camps I went out were not as big. They were in Texas where mosquitoes actually took people, but we had horses and fishing. Film cinema was amazing, the characters were funny and credible, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Raimi's character and sub-antiquity were priceless. So who ever thought this film is chrome ... I have deep regret because they can not stop their infidelity for a long time to re-imagine life in the camp as adults or never went as children. The whole point was that these people had the opportunity to return and become juveniles, and that's how they did it at all times. I wish I could. It was funny, intelligent, nicely scripted, brilliantly thrown and art is backing me back, so I want to look over it again and again only for the landscape. Varieties such as Dances with Wolves and LADYHAVK ... good movies, but the wilderness becomes a character as well as actors. Rent it, see, buy and watch it again and again and again ... never grow old. ; 0)
