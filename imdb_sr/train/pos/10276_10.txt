Opening the film Bach Toccata is a sound hint of what will happen in this intense drama. All the compositions that Bach perfected to keep his listeners (and performers) intrigued and entertained, refer to this film. There is no mutual gentleness between the two main characters and leading women on the final scene, which I think is justified to say that she was raped, although her victim felt she was warned that she was a cad. Mamet unconditionally explores the emotional gap and gender differences, but I feel that I do not know how they complement one another with a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet has ever developed a healthy, witty attitude towards the sexes, I wonder how this job would end? Since it exists, it is very dark and disgusting.
