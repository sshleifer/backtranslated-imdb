I swear, the zombie was killed as twice, and he was constantly returning. I gave this film 8. Let's face people, this is exactly what other reviewers say, ie, "Pretty Camera," a film. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to total indie movie recording. The fact that Todd Sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents. Yes, the story has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies over and over again, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, a fun and bloody horror film, one to share with your buds, or to distort people who really care about LOL. Calm down people, I suppose you all liked garbage pieces like "Titanic" or "Tvister". Peace and support for independent movie shooting !!!
