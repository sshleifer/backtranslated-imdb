I absolutely loved this soap. That was one of my favorites. I will very much recommend :) ... I like Brazilian soaps, they are dealing with real life events. I'm really sad that soap is over, but I'm sure I'll find it somewhere. For those of you who did not see it, look at it. I liked the characters, the plot, and how things eventually appeared for the villains. The only thing I would change is the end for Xia and her long-lasting love. I can not wait to see him again and recommend it. Xia is by far the best soap I've ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO KSICA .. I hope you like it.
