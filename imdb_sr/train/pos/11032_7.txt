Damaged by the injustice after much feeling felt on that platform, a mountain rescuer for Mount Aces, Gabriel Walker (Stalone), returns to his girlfriend Jane (Janine Turner), while over the clouds where the weather seems to be somewhat predominantly, spectacularly unsafe abduction in the air went wrong and $ 100 million taken from the Finance Ministry's aircraft was lost in the middle of nothing, followed by a collision? Skewed from the snow peaks, and need mountain guides to return stolen money, highly trained mountaineers make an urgent call seeking help from a rescue unit ?? Unfortunately, Gab and Hall (Michael Rooker) have to unite to come to the scene of the accident unaware that the call for help was fake, and a bunch of ruthless terrorists led by psychotics (John) Lithgov), waiting only to discover the path of the stormy mountain with the discarded money cases? With breath-taking images, gorgeous landscapes, dizzying heights, dangerous climbs, icy temperatures, "Cliffhanger" is definitely Stallone's best action adventure movie?
