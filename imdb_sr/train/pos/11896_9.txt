A few years ago, I came across a reprise of this sho and fell in love with him. It contains Tea Leoni and Holland Tailor and I laugh, one episode after the next. I guess it was not that big and it was canceled after several seasons, but I think that was a good move, and I would suggest that you watch it ... if the opportunity arises.
