Spoilers! Classic 70's trash! The Swedish gal (Helga) was what made this film so brilliant. She was beautiful, but what really made me sexually. Throughout the film, she has exhausted enormous amounts of sexuality. Her best scenes were when she stimulated herself. Whenever she was on the screen, I got caught. Also, Dr. Julia (sister of the murky male focus film) was very interesting visually. Although most 12-year-old girls have larger breasts than Julia, she knew how to use the little she had and her scenes (especially scenes with silk blouse and black skirt) also endlessly grabbed my attention. You also loved a great scene in which some of the blind mice deprived her of something; I do not know if I have ever seen something funny at the same time, and yet again sexy. Classic stuff!
