Recently, as usual, while I was watching this, one of my favorite movies on DVD, the whole thing just drove me away. I'm a big fan of Hazel O'Connor and a soundtrack for this movie just tears me, especially the "Vill Iou" track. It's a purely nostalgic journey for me back to my youth. This is the second most successful Kuadrophenia (also played by Phil Daniels). An excellent soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the Thousand Years of the Dark 80s in which I grew up. The ending is so sad, I'm like a blonde for hours after completing the movie. I expect to cancel this DVD from a re-view, I can watch it over and over again and never Be bored, just for the music itself. Hazel, I'm sorry about your dear dad. God bless you all. kk
