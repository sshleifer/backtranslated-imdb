I, like many horror fans, violently feed the same banal big budget Hollywood treatments and MTV high school in the past 20 years. Here, in the end, the original movie about the horror genre that crochets all make boxes. If you want a hot main actress, you want a vampire, you want a cool weapon, you want cool vehicles and you want blood. , a lot, after loading the cane - you got it. With excellent choreography of the fight and the accompanying role of the Queen of Screaming Hammer Horror Stephanie Beacham, this is truly a fantastic thing. Despite the low budget, deciding to use a 35mm stock and adding quality CG effects to mik, director James Eaves has created something that feels much bigger. Required for old school horror fans.
