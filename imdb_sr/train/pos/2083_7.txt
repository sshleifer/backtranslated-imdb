The film was interesting for Hollywood on the novel of the same name Pearl S. Buck. While some today think it is full of racial stereotypes, it was itself progressive in itself during the very idea of ​​Chinese protagonists. I found that white Chinese-playing actors were not as bad as I expected, that it was not an Asian blackface equivalent. Then there were no Asian actors in America (even George Takei did not play), and Rainer did a good job with her. It was not the best performance I've ever seen, but for the pre-old school method it was nice. The grasshopper scene was very well recorded and contained convincing special effects. I wonder if the release time during the Great Depression turned this movie into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval that confuses the peasants and seems to leave them all behind. . If this were a Western family, the locusts would eventually win, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and resentment. However, he teaches his lesson here, and then he wins.
