Peter Ustinov plays the embezzlement that just comes out of the prison when the film starts. As soon as he left the gate, he immediately began to work on the scheme to re-make a bundle of stealing, although this time had fairly high sights. This is actually one of the bad spots of the film, because he obviously does not know anything about computers (few were in 1968), but he managed to become a computer genius literally overnight! Yeah, right. In any case, he comes up with a scheme to present himself as a computer expert and get a job in a major US corporation in order to eventually blame the ton of cash. Bearing in mind that his computer knowledge is rudimentary, it's amazing how he carries out a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate into the computer system and his defense. But it's still a movie, so I was able to stop the unbelief. By the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) can escape with a million pounds. At the end, however, it becomes very, very confusing and Smith announces that she has managed to accumulate more than two million insightful investments in the companies that began to start (although she did not know that they were all false companies) . That should mean that at the end of this action she bought was worthless. What they seem to imply (and perhaps I guess wrong) is that Ustinov and his new partners quickly redeemed the supplies before it became known, and that would result in lost shares. In any case, the film seems to announce a magical ending, with no one being hurt and everyone is happy - and that simply made no sense. It's a pity, really, because the acting and most of the writing were great. Karl Malden, Bob Nevhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were wonderful. If I seem to have interpreted the end, let me know, because the movie was eventually very vague in detail.
