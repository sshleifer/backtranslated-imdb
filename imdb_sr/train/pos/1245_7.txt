Whenever I see the majority of comments, it's called 'skipping ignition for Eddie Murphy'. These critics want to look at some of the things that are working these days and maybe ease their attitude in retrospect ... "The Golden Child" is not a highbrow party, but thanks to some of the actors she breathes new life into the old one and gives Murphy one of his best the role. I do not understand the pervading lack of 'love' for her efforts, in general. Maybe it was released at a time when the uprising was tired of typing, a thrill of excitement per minute? Stephen Spielberg started with Indian Jones; it is unjust that this is a scapegoat when, perhaps, his greatest sin is also completely harmless. Nothing is necessarily wrong with attempts to harness trends. Yes, it's stupid, but even a casual observer should be able to understand that it's 'funny' where the Hollywood idea of ​​mysticism begins and ends. What's more important than the conviction of a story like this is that the audience has fun tour guides to show them mysterious scenes. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphi are in the money for this capacity. My advice is to buy a ticket and drive.
