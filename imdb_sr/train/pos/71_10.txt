I could not believe that the comments were made about the film. While reading the terrible views on the film, I actually wondered if you actually looked at the same film I made. <br /> <br What I looked was amazing! I think the actresses and the director have done a fantastic job in the film. I did not have the pleasure to see any of the actresses before and I could not be more disgusted with the amazing work they did. I had to say his most likely film I've been watching for a long time. What I do not see is why everyone has such a problem with Dean's drug choice in a suicide attempt, from comments that have prompted you to act as a selection of actresses and her stupid choice. I do not understand this, it's a movie written by someone else, and it was directed by someone else, as it can be an actress's mistake that I can not see. I think it was a really compelling film that I would see and recommend again. Opinions are what they are and what's really bad is that many are so close. I hope to see one of the actors soon, I think they all played great roles. Busy Philipps will someday be the most watched actress and I hope she will laugh at anyone who has been criticized! You go girl!
