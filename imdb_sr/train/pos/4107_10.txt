I loved this movie! It's really bizarre, extremely funny, morbid, funny ... It does not make sense to talk about the content of the movie, because then I would give it a result! You need to see her without knowing what this is about! Everything is connected and has its own and why. It begins subtly, and then things start to roll faster and faster until they culminate with the crazier outburst you can imagine! It's even more fun to watch a movie the other time, after you know all the "tricks". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a real master piece! I recommend this movie, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
