The legendary Boris Karlof finished his famous career by making four cheap feverish rises in Mexico. This is a fierce period of Gothic horror from the crowd. Karlof gives a typically enviable and dignified performance like Matthias Mortwell, an elderly ecclesiastical patriarch who invites several of his tiny, greedy and disturbing relatives to his terrible castle to read a will. Soon, disgusting guests will distance themselves from lethal toys of natural size that inhabit this place. The former Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of the "Tintorera" shame portrays a summer heroine hero, and Jules looks absolutely ecstatic as the only cute female character. A cumbersome, non-directional direction, frivolous scripts in numbers, ugly, washed cinemas, funny pieces of homicide (a thick giggling thrown into the face with a miniature cannon!) Morbid gloomy atmosphere, largely bad acting (Karloff in particular except), cute gently gore, bad the synchronization and exciting rays of the conclusion that give all this edible lemon a certain value and hence a strange party. A real champagne.
