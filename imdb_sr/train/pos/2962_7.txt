Parker and Stone transplanted their humorous humor from an animated masterpiece to a feature film with generally good results. Most of the film is Trei and Matt, who are sent with their new toy box. The plot itself is simple: two average guys invented a new sport, a mix of a basketball track with a baseball scoring that becomes national craziness. They meet through a number of sports movie clichÃ©s and send them, along with any other popular culture that comes into their aspects. It works as a stretched South Park episode, with the usual dialogue with the machine gun, toilet humor and homilies from the heart. If this film has weaknesses, it's a relationship with the team that gave us the "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" series. This effect is clearly seen in the great use of lame notes and the presence of a great and fairly two-dimensional Jasmine Bleeth in the role that is usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn does a little better playing a corporate barrack that has been his party scene since the time when Bullitt and Ernest Borgnine did what he can, but must admit that he is perfect for the role of a crazy team owner. /> For those who have not yet noticed, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable than a vannabes rock star than comics. This is manifested in the prominent sense given to the soundtrack in almost everything they create. As usual, they give here a good choice, including the compulsory route of their own ultra-non-PC DVDs. Particularly worth mentioning is Dian Bachar, who deserves some kind of reward for supporting a difficult task to play with Stan and Parker and Stone's wild cartoons. In short, this is a fun comedy that retains its full potential due to too much reliance on the "naked gun / plane" formula. Parker and Stone could do something really great (or absolutely horrible) if they were to get full control of the future film. America, or lock these guys or put them in place.
