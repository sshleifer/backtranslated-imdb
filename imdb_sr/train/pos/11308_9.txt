TCM keeps me awake all the time ... they keep coming in with movies I've never heard of ... Senso .... now Ossession ... very early Visconti movie !! ... vov ... Italian version The Postman Alvais Rings Tvits ... brilliant !! acted beautifully and directed ... I never heard of one of those who were excellent, Clara Calamai, as for Giovanne, and especially for Massimo Girotti like Gino ... what a sensual man !! more muscular and more attractive than anyone on the screen in 1943 !!! His gaze was ahead of his time ... many of the male stars of the 1950s were probably inspired by him ... he should have been a great world star !! The film is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and the less glossier of the MGM version (which I really love) with John Garfield and Lana Turner do you remember those white clothes? who can forget ... This Italian version is different .. more realistic and with a very different ending ... see it watch ... I'm going to buy it !!
