Director Sidnei Lumet made some masterpieces such as Netvork, Dog Dai Afternoon or Serpico.But he did not have too much luck on his latest deeds.Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilti was interesting, but unsuccessful experiment. Now, Lumet brings his best film for decades and, in my opinion, a real masterpiece: Before the Devil knows you're dead. I think this film is a rebirth for Lumet. This film has a great story that, deeply, has many layers. Also, I think the ending of the film is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Philip Seimour Hoffman brings, as usual, a magnificent performance and he is, no doubt, one of the best actors of our day. He is also a great actor, but he is underestimated by my view. His performance here is great. The rest of the actors are also excellent (especially the great Albert Finnei), but these two actors bring monumental performances that were unfortunately ignored by the Pathetic Oscars. The film has a good level of intensity, partly an NXS in performances and, in part, thanks to a great scenario. Before Devil Knovs Iou Dead is a real masterpiece with a perfect direction, great script and great performance. We need more of these movies.
