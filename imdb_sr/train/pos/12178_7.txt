I think this film got a low score because it was judging the worst moments. There's a diarrhea scar and a shameful scene of damaged walnuts, but there are also a few moments that made me laugh out loud. In this film, Jason Lee performs some wonderful subtle comedies, and Julia Stiles herself is damn funny. In addition, this movie acts as the most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). In any case, better movies for watching, but definitely not the worst gifts ... Cheerful
