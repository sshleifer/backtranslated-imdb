This film is in contradiction to the first one concerning Care Bears and Care Bear Bear. I will not deny it. However, if you look at "Part Two" as a special movie, then it's a very good movie. I remember seeing this in the early 80s (and it fit into his targeted demographic audience), and absolutely loved him much more than the first film (not that I did not enjoy it in any such a movie, only this one had a little extra ). I'm sure it's darker than the first, but maybe that's why it's so good. And it's darker in the deeper kind of subtle ways (kids might not fully understand it, but they can still be a little scared about the atmosphere they are releasing, and the adults who watch it will surely get faster because now I'm watching this movie again now in my mid-20s) where you basically have a young girl dealing with evil spirit / demon in exchange for something else. Get an image? But simply looking at it as a child, as I said, it may have been a little scary, but nothing was traumatized. In fact, if anything gave me another fantasy game that I could play when I was in those years. I can not tell you how many times I pretended that Dark Heart wants to shut me up, help me catch Care Bear, tried to hand me over to his dark side, and other stuff like that, etc. The film was also good for my imagination. And it also has a great emotional depth. I watched him at least once a week. Also Hadlei Kai was the perfect choice for the voice of Dark Heart (I always thought so and will always). Now it's just a pity that they never made a soundtrack. Sometimes I just want to hear how it grows without watching a movie, no matter how good it is. "What is the benefit of love and care if it can not be saved?"
