Why is not this published? Somehow I thought it was a little garbage because it was not. How wrong can a girl be! This film, in a word, is enchanting. You will be enchanted. It keeps your attention from the very beginning and its pace does not slow down. The final part of the movie, the "episodes" it was (not giving anything, you saw it in the trailer) is also unmissable. You will choose your favorite, you will be shocked, you will not be able to go and cook coffee, because you need to find out what's going on. Adrenaline rises and you can not watch. Acting actors, this is very convincing. And do not stop there, they have the last shock for you. This also brings into question the reality of TV and if you would watch. And how far are we from this, really? An endemol (made by an elder brother) made a TV show in the Netherlands last year, offering a kidney-dying woman to patients in need of transplantation. The show was ultimately discovered as a fraud, allegedly to raise awareness of organ donation, but are we getting too close to comfort?
