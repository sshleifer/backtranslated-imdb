About a year and a half ago, my father told me about the French door. I thought it sounded interesting enough, but I did not try to find it anywhere. Then, about a year ago, I remembered this film and thought "Hey why not," and tried to find it on the Internet. Finally, after a week of watching, I found it on atomic films. I called Dad to the computer and told him, "Hey, Dad, I found this creepy movie you told me many years ago!" He laughed at me, turned around and turned off the lights so he was dark at the computer screen and told me to watch it. I started well ... Then when he began to take care of what was there, I found him very nervous. In the end I pushed back my chair and got up ... it made me jump! even after the fourth or fifth time is still disturbed. GREAT FILM!
