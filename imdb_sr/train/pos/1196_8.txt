I watched a few days of shooting this film that summer, the end result was just two scenes in the movie. The location was the Silvan Lake in Black Hills. Bring the wagon, stop the car, etc. So this young Dakota loved the film and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd was destroyed so that the shooting scenes were real. (that Doris, the animals were hurt during the shooting) I think the ending was copied by Jack Nicholson in Shining? A great Western / social commentary from the '50s. This should be in the same class as the noon for a true Western drama or to be used as a social statement, such as the Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Vithout A Cause in the 1950s.
