At the beginning of this film, one commentator says he was told he had two attacks on him: he is a black man and a man. But besides, he also has a third strike: he's gay. "You'll have to be stronger than you ever imagined," they say. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about gay niggers and Hispanics who are transvestites or transsexuals. The wonder "Paris is Burning" is that the director Jennie Livingston has a theme that could easily become a freak joke and allow people in her humanity. We learn their views on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so unattainable that it is tragic. Many people seriously deny: <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are footage in this film of naked transsexuals. If you have a problem with homosexuality, then this film is not for you. But if you see this movie, you will realize that "Paris burns" is not just about men who wear women's clothes, but about a group of people who are routinely marginalized and suppressed by society as a whole, and what they do to get In my life I felt the feeling communion. I watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991, because it says so much: it is a commentary on materialism in our culture, about gender roles, about the rich and poor people, about the media and what glory, glory and bragging. "Paris is Burning" is one of the most humorous and saddest movies I've ever seen.
