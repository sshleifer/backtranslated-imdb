Pushing Daisies was a great show. Like Dead Like Me and Vonderfalls, you can say that it was created by Brian Fuller. I can understand how people who do not have much love for theater, cinema, musicals and the like, would be upset. This is not a typical television program, and it's fantastic for some. It seems that these people need a bit more linear and dull tone to be happy. This program explodes in color, hints at old film scenes, singing with incredible music and talented performances. There is nothing random in the choices made from bones to the leitmotif. The story has many turning points, but it is very affordable because there are talk about love, sincerity, courage, loss, and many other things that we face daily. The only unfortunate aspect was the ending of the show and it rushed because Pushing Daisies was canceled. Do not approach this as a typical TV show. Think about it as a dinner in the theater, then relax and enjoy!
