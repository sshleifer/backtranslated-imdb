The peg is pure entertainment. Great stories and a great actor and nothing else to measure. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that draws audiences together with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin firm support that most leading actors can only dream of. Some great guest stars add color and enthusiasm to individual episodes - Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas at The Zombie. It's easy to see how the boy spent watching Kolchak how Chris Carter created The Ks Files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
