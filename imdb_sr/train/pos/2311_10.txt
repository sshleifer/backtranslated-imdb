First film Reese Vitherspooon. Loved it. The plot and the acting were superb. You are emotionally involved with characters. In my opinion, it must be seen. After watching this movie you will see why the acting career Reese Vitherspoon was so successful. Other members of the band are also doing a great job. The film runs extremely well. There is no boring moment in the whole picture. The man on the Moon's length is right. As I said earlier, I think this film is excellent. I've seen it many times and I enjoyed every impression.
