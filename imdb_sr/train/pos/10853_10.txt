This movie is huge for the rise of ghosts. Every time I watch it, I see and hear the funny little things I've missed before. Soundtrack is incredible. Mick Jones (Foreigner) and Chris Difford (Skueeze) wrote songs, making Strange Fruit the best thing ever hitting the music scene today. a band that has never been good to start, because of the use of drugs and internal struggles. You wonder what could have been while listening to their fanatical soundtrack. Fruit draws inspiration from Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bovie and The Vhoa. Each member of the fruit is quite memorable. Stephen Rea starring Tonia Costella, who was asked by the promoter of the festival to unite her band for a reunion tour, hoping to get a monetary benefit. Costello approaches former Karen Knovles, played by Juliet Aubrei, to help him re-burn the flames from the past of the dreams. David 'Beano' Baggot, and extravagant glamourous Rai Simms (Bill Nighi). Tumbling in is another ek-roadie, hippie-toker-hockey Hughie (Billi Connolly), who never let the flame burn. While Juliet is looking for the last member of their colorful group, the elusive Guitarist-songwriter Brian Lovell (played by Bruce Robinson), members who have reunited, argue, just like old times, fighting against the rusty talents. The group then got the opportunity to do a small Dutch tour, to prepare the festival. With young Hendrix, such as Luke Shanda (Hans Matheson) who took Lovell, the crew fell on their way. Sparks fly until their memories flicker forward, threatening to ignite their unfinished goals ... Be ready to laugh, sing, cheer and cry, because these unforgettable characters return to your hearts ...
