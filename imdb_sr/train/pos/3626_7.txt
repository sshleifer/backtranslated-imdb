This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school teacher of natural science / baseball coach, inspired by his players to try out professionals and fulfill their lifelong dream of playing in mainstream schools. Dennis Kuaid, who is not a foreigner for sports films, plays Morris with enough conviction to make the job work, and producers are working a credible job of recreating real-world events that have led to Morris a short period of time as a relief pitcher for dumb rays in Tampa Beju. . The first half of the film, which deals with his group of baseball players in high school (everyone who looks too old to really be in high school) is less efficient and probably too long. All in all, the film is suffering from pacing problems and several additional backgrounds that we could probably do. However, this is still a rather inclusive film with an inspirational theme that once again proves that baseball is a national game for a reason. GRADE: B-
