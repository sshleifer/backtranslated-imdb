To all reviewers on this site, I must say that this movie is worth watching. That's how it was made in 1972, so what? The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of her time. People who have not studied the culture of the decades would think this film is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series, "Left Behind" (made for the present time) seems incredible. However, the only cheezy part of the film is fashion, which was again over 30 years in the past. BUT. The message sent in this movie is very powerful and carefully preserved. He has so much to say, but I refuse to say that. (out of fear not to ruin it) So go and watch this movie! If you do not like the message you send, then you have questions that need attention!
