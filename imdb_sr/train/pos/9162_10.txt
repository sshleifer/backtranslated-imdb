Although I did not begin to read "Classics" in literature until my 47th year, it's never too late. Jane Eire is a favorite for many reasons, mostly because there is no part of the book that I like more, just the parts I enjoyed more. The Mini TV series from 1983 with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I was hoping to be. I saw him as a full-length movie in 2006 by Dalton's Mr. Rochester 'was very good, but I absolutely loved Zelah's' Jane Eire'. Choosing another "Classics" movie I recently saw, I was disappointed in production, direction and dialogue. It was only faithful to the greed and arrogance of Hollivood. An artistic license for major works in literature is nothing but plagiarism. Using a title after such a license is a scam. Leave it to the British to have this right (among other things). You will not be able to read the book again without reviving a movie with the appropriate context and spirit. Bravo BBC.
