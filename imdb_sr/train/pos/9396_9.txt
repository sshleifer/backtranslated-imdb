In any number of films, Nicholas Cage can be found as a powerful, quiet hero, Denis Hopper as a killer maniac, Lara Flinn Boile as a vampire / rogue, and the late, complained J.T. Valsh is tough. These are the types of roles that these four can play in a dream, and they did it often enough to see them play and bordering with the clich√©. What a relief, that is, John Dahl, a master who got a little mood in action, directed this shaded noirish thriller. Hopper manages to stay away from the top, Cage shows a little more depth than his usually superficial action heroes, Boile is alternately scrapped, innocent, and intrigued, and we get the feeling of the heavy iron of the soul that is central to his character, Wayne. Dahl's direction gives a sense of emptiness in the land of the great heavens where the story unfolds, and at the same time it is intimate enough to show that wrinkled foreheads can indicate a radical change in the action. They rotate superb, and one of the other great turns in this movie is that some of the supporting characters behave like they have a brain. It is not uncommon for smaller characters like deputy sheriffs to have more brain than their superiors. But with a director who is smart as Dahl, you should not be surprised by the intelligence of anything that is related to this movie. Excellent movie.
