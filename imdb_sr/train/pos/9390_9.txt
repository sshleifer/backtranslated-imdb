This movie kicked me on Nick Cage's kick. This is a story full of crafts - film motives and moves. Of course, Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Valsh and Laura Fliin Boile are the perfect couple to catch the unexpected man who fell into their net. Everything about this movie is good - cinema, tempo of the story and most of all the end. Cage points out what works best - it's not about the action hero, but about being caught in the traps of life.
