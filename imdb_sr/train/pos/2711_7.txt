When I think about 'Women in Prison', my mind often goes to the sleek Italian-Spanish production of directors such as Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei; and while these films are often very weak, they are also very similar once you see them; Maybe you saw them all. I must admit that these types of films are not my favorites at all; but in fact the idea of ​​women behind bars was done very well on a few occasions outside Italy and Spain; Roger Korman, Nev World Pictures, is responsible for some of the best. Caged Heat is the director of the Oscars of the director Jonathan Demme, and this is a well-made little mirror with lots of fun! Of course, the film focuses on the story of a girlfriend caught in the commission of a criminal offense and sent to a female prison where she is familiar with a multitude of violent prisoners. This prison is administered by ruler McKueen who is wheelchair-bound; and she is offended by the game they are wearing; Guiding them to plan to escape. This film is much easier on the mood than I used to women in prison; but this is more than offset by some great action scenes and dialogue, and that's what ensures that Caged Heat enjoys it. It must be said that the plot is not particularly genuine or ambitious and basically follows the structure similar to many other women in the pre-screen prison films; but that's not a big problem. The film is never boring and filled with prominent scenes; including an attempt to escape while working in the field and robbery of the bank. The film helped secure the direction of a man who would go to the forefront of the masterpiece "The Silence of the Lambs" and a great actor with many views; including the best legendary Barbar Steele in the role of chief prison officer. All in all, Caged Heat can not leave the viewer much to think through; but it's a brilliantly fun little movie and everyone who enjoys this kind of movie will surely want to find it.
