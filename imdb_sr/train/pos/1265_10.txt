hi .. I think Just Cause is one of my favorite films about Sean Conneri, it's a tense psychological thriller with great performances in Cast, especially Conneri .. has one of the best lines I've seen in movies, so the dialogue is pretty good in this .. He has one of the best scenes in movies ever, when Sean interviewed the character Ed Harris in prison is fantastic .. I enjoyed this and many can not recommend, really do not miss this one! Do not pay attention to negative reviews that say that the last 30 minutes of shit, it was intense as the rest of the movie, I really find Just Cause a very fun movie.
