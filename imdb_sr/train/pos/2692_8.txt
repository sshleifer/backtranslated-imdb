I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. It has an excellent direction, from the already famous Bigass Moon, born in Spain. And in Spain, in Spain, the film takes place, in Catalonia, to be more precise. The Moon is once again exploring the subject of the obsession, in this case the hang of a young man for a woman's milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story, such as the rejection complex that the older son feels with the birth of his brother. In the film, this is what leads to the obsession of a young man who suddenly sees that all the breast milk goes to a recently born son. It starts trying to find breasts that can feed it. He finds him in a recently styled wife, and from here the film is all about it. This film is much alive in pictures, more than just a story, the espectator records certain moments (unforgettable moments). and certain symbols (the movie deserves analysis of almost everything that happens because it usually means something ...). The surroundings, landscapes typical of the region, as well as the superficial behavior of the characters, also symbolic, and the excellent ambiguous soundtrack of Nicole Piovania, transfer us to another dimension, not parallel with the real world, but which is cut from time to time ... Worth living in this world, it's worth watching this movie, although we can eventually get tired and a bit sick of a bit of obsession, which may have been taken beyond the boundaries ... </ i> <i> I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist ... 8/10
