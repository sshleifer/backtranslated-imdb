Home Room was a great movie if you ever had a drama in your life. Keeps you looking to see more. You are wondering what secret Alicia hides. I think I've been watching this movie 6 times in a row and I've never lost interest. Plus, I do not usually cry about movies, but this one cried every time. I wish I could find more such films. All in all, I thought it was a great movie. The more you look at it, the more you become part of it. The very end is the part that really brought me when she cried when she got her diploma because she had her daughter's name. My heart was as if it just broke. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she had not yet got her. I loved him so much.
