It seems that this film on the surface is a small movie about children that parents with regret can look at with their mostly entertained children. The film appears and is mainly directed towards children, but it does not stop at that level. First I watched this movie as a little kid and found it funny, fun and touching and it was not seen for years. I recently watched him recently at the age of 18 and discovered that it's almost so funny, but just as heartbreaking and fun. This movie is underrated and contains many real-life messages. This film is an inspirational story for children, yet epic in itself. I recommend this film to anyone to anyone.
