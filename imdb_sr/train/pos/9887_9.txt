"Erendir" is a film from Mexico about which is rarely spoken. The film is only available in low quality VHS format. It's a shame that this movie has not released a DVD release. "Erendir" is stunning and lavish with its magically-realistic images. "Erendir" is based on a short story from the novel "100 Years of Solitude". Erendir constantly dreams and accidentally burns her grandmother's house. Her evil grandmother, played by Irene Papas, is forced to prostitute in order to pay her damages. The whole city gets a piece of Erendir, so to speak. Although the theme sounds raw, the film does not use sexuality. This is done in a mature artistic manner. The film also has some incredible costumes. Some of the surrealistic aspects of the film that are most distinguished are origami birds that turn into real birds and golden orange with a diamond in the center. Erendir is an incredible movie that even thrives on humor. This is definitely a movie that deserves a special DVD edition. As you would say in espanol, "Es mui mui bien !!! Ekcellente!"
