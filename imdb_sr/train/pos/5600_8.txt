This is my kind of movie. I'm delighted with the weird psychotic nightmares and this movie is exactly that. But it's also a dark comedy. While I'm generally seen as a horror / thriller, there will be others who could see it as a black dramatic comedy. But in any case, it's a fascinating descent into madness. The end has caught me unprepared, but what an end! Leaves the viewer a lot to think about. Powerful performance, complex and detailed action, an excellent scenario filled with fear and lines of humor, and a ghastly atmosphere make this movie worth watching. Personally, I think I will have to watch this a few more times to raise and understand all the subtleties that are in the frame. But it is such a movie that it will be a pleasure, not a job.
