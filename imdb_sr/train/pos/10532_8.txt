Let the world go away. Take it off my shoulders. Say what you are used to saying, and make the world disappear. Well, Dave (David Hevlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in cucumber, one for embezzlement, and the other for kissing a child. Neither was guilty, but they faced the accusations and their house that would collapse, but they ended up in, well, nothing. The whole world, except their home, has left. It's kinda weird, but also fun. What would you do to be completely alone in the world? Two friends simply enjoy the company of one another and do what they want. But it looks like it's quick. Then they start to improve their lives by hating their memories. The sound effects were great. Things in the end became strange. The film originated from a great imagination, and it was written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, with the help of two stars. It just has to be seen.
