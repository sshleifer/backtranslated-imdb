I am a big fan of cinema believe and I watched this movie because I heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say that this was really interesting. The two main actors are brilliant, the film is not boring, and the concept behind it (although apparently inspired by Columbine murders and home murder killers) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes that really diminish realism seen in the first hour, and the ending really does not make any sense. An unpleasant camera can sometimes be an obstacle, but in the cinema you believe it is. But I still think the film is very well made, and director Ben Coccio deserves little recognition.
