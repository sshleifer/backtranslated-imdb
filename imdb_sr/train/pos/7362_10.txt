What a fun, sexy movie! They certainly do not make it any more like this. 4 sexy in pairs come to London and have all kinds of sexual incidents. The tone is unusual innocence, since a significant nakedness evolves from the pharisaic situation, and not any open sexual desire by the characters. Only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes, male characters become boasting. Richard O 'Sullivan literally gets' Randi' (sic). The film certainly reveals the origin of the function of the softcore as if it lies in the offers of cuties and naturist films of the old school. My special interest in 'Au Pair Girls' is that I'm a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If any actress ever looked better naked (skinny but beautifully curved), or dressed, get to it (I loved it since the original UFO run - who else could take the purple wig!) My hat.
