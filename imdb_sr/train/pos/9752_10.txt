I strongly remember that I saw it when I was 3 years old and then my parents accidentally shot everything except a few seconds with another cartoon. Then I was about eight or nine when I discovered it again, and since I was able to figure things out better then I thought it was a good movie. Quickly forward until a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I re-discovered it thanks to some internet articles / video clips and it's not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with children, but 20-30 is definitely written "Cultural status". It is a pity that the original production went through a painful process; if Fok gave enough time, he would probably be more recognized today in public. Perhaps if you transformed it with a completely different story and the voice of the stars, it could be, but it is for Foxes to decide. I'm wandering around here, I know. I still think it's a great movie, but it could be better than the big one.
