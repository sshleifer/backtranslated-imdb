Illudere comes from the Latin verb "crazy" (for playing), so you are warned of a "spy game" as a cruel, yet elaborate and intelligent (!) Activity "from" the complex and how it seems absurd and futile personal history whatever it was; yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of betrayal and loyalty, the raw material of every relationship, from personal to social; After many years, I could finish the book, it was a revelation! At first I was bored if not for the surprising style of writing (I started LOVE Le Carre after that novel). The main character does not shake at all: he made the choice to redeem his weakness next time of faith in friendship and love, or is he not? After this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of Green's "Our Man in Havana" written by LeCarre with "The Dresser of Panama"; there is no play, there ends either in a tragedy or grotesque comedy, or both. There is no Smiley here that would support decent human qualities in the 'service', or at least there is no reason to present it in this case. The BBC has done excellent work with these series from LeCarre's novel: actors are great, as well as locations and sets; Of course the scenario here is brilliantly adjusted. However, be warned, even if it's funny to someone, after the taste is bitter.
