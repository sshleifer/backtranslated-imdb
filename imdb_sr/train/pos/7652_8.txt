Gluma- fantastic. The story - incredible. Scenario - divan. Only a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it's slow and generally speaking, but the whole story of all their lives and how it's told with flashbacks and exits makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this damn and tragic story. Me, I read the book from which the film is based and it has shown me even more light in this story and answers some questions that have remained unanswered in the film. I will also read the song Ekectioner, which is the "second" half of Gilmore's story. This film has made me think so much about the term "rebounding to the other side of the glass". You hear a song in a movie called Gary Gilmore's Eies, written by a punk band who wrote a song about how to have Gary Gilmore's eyes (which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) and while listening , and that's after Mikal has ever seen Gary, you're looking at the whole situation a little differently if you were here just on the song itself. This film opened my eyes to so many others. I recommend this movie (and the book) very much.
