I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of "Death Trap" into the top 5 list of the best adaptations ever, Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who has never got the chance to do more than nasty romances and "Superman") play very well here. Even Dian Cannon - for whom I do not normally care - is perfectly thrown into a role that exploits her disadvantage as an actress. I'm not sure that the comparison "Deathtrap" with "Sleuth" - once again a brilliant stage adaptation with Michael Caine - is valid, or even fair. Yes, the two stories have a lot in common. about class warfare as a battle for wits, and the house in "Sleuth" is at least the same figure in the movie as two actors - the house does not actually have the equivalent of "Deathtrap". "is not so much a battle of minds as the vignette is emphasized about how people are not damn good (and they are never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they get. I will only say that both films are excellent examples of this genre and worth your time and money.And, this is America.You do not have to choose it! I will not give the bandages, but I think it does not matter anyway.I watched the DVD eight or nine times in a dozen years, and I still enjoy in chemistry and time and medium, terrible moments when things go "everything in the shape of a pear." Everything was done so well and driving becomes more important than the real destination. Anyone who loves black-haired comedy and uncertainty in Hitchcock's style of shooting will probably enjoy the "Deathtrap".
