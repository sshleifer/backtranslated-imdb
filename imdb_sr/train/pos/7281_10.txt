The first time I saw this movie at the local station in a Sunday afternoon horror concert around 1969 or 1970. At that time, I was just a little kid, but I liked it and it was not so scared. I thought he had such a cool and very original story. Thinking, I'm still surprised that during the day it was shown on uncut TV. Since then, I've been looking for this movie, I've been watching it over and over again and I loved it. Someone would have thought that John Vaters would idolize this film. It must be not only an intimidating movie, but one of the saddest, most ardent films ever made at the time. And, surprisingly, you do not hear about the fact that this cult had for itself films such as "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eies" gained over the years. It has a cult approach, but it was supposed to become a cult classic, in my opinion. As far as I know, this came out just before the Blood Feast came out, which is probably one of the first real "up" movies. In fact, this film features the elements of Hershell Gordon Levis and Little Russ Meier who was thrown to a great extent. in the early 60's (I think the date was eventually read in 1960).
