Cuban blood is one of those sleeping movies that have much to say about life in a very traditional way. I actually watched him while I was sailing around Cuba on a Western Caribbean cruise. It describes in detail the life of a 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the Revolution. The revolution does not take much time to the very end, when the socialist regime came in and took over the property of a boy's father. The bulk of the film is the age of boys and relationships that occur in a small town where everyone else knows each other. There are some powerful scenes that anyone can relate to. Film class A with fine acting and directing. This is a film that tells the story without any special effects or big schemes or real turns. It's a movie about people and their lives, their mistakes and their triumphs. A good movie is worth watching a few times a year.
