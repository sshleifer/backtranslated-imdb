Editor Edward Sedgvick, an old man in visual comedy, successfully runs this Hal Roach road shov that offers a quick and advanced script and excellent casting, employing a large number of Roach's trusted performers. Although the film was originally drawn as a Patsy Kelly vehicle, sunny Jack Haley starred Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his car repairs and trips to Hollywood, where he tries to launch the role of the screen for a girl she loves, the star Cecilia (Rosina Lavrence). Sedgvick, who more likes to use the entire MGM studio as her set, does it here, while Cecilia, always ready for audition, treats potential lover, star of the movie Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), for action behind the scenes of course, music comedy, with the main Broadway's Linda Roberts. Laurel and Hardy provide some pleasant interludes, including their famous skate including a small accordion, and we're looking at fine twists such as Joice Compton, Russell Hicks and Valter Long. All in all, Misha Auer must surrender, which clearly steals the image as an emotional movie star, the role he largely creates, and the director for his smart final homage to the film spectacles of Busby Berkeley.
