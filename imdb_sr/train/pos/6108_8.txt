I enjoyed this movie. Many Koreans will feel familiar with this film because many of them have teachers when they go to school. Cinema was average. The film would have been better if the angel or motion of the camera was more irregular. The editing, however, was very neat and unusual. The performance was also very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent, bad girl in Korean soap operas. But this time the sweet guy plays very well. Kwon Sang Voo also plays its role very likely. What I love most about in this movie is that the characters' emotions are not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romantic films that the characters cry in front of the audience, and I always thought it was very stagnant. There was not such a shit in this movie. Very funny and well done.
