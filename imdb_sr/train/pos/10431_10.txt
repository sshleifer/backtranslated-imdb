I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. it's one of only a few movies ever made to be romantic. to try to talk about the plot or performance or the technical details of this film would be the words of frank zappa "like dance on architecture". it absolutely affects the nail right on the head in the way that those passive moments in the life that drives us are caught, then escapes from us and never ceases to be experienced. This looks like a movie Charlie Kaufman wanted to write in the Adaptation movie. the end is left open and ambiguous, there is no happy end here, just a mystery. There are no deep life lessons, only a couple of angry and intelligent kids who explore the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feeling ... romantic love. 10 out of 10 watches with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger ................
