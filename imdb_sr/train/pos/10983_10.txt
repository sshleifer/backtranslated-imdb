'Grey Gardens' (1975) is the bizarre documentary of the Maisles 'Jackie Bouvier's Kennedy Onassiscentric aunt and the first cousin who live as pigs in a series of 28 rooms in East Hampton, Long Island.' Big Edie 'Bouvier Beale 78, witty and dry, and her daughter,' Little Edie Beale, 56, (emotionally about 13) still a beautiful woman who once had a promising future, lives in isolation from the rest of the world, except for many cats and raccoons in the attic. They entertain quarrels all day, listening to the radio or singing to each other (They do not even have television). One of the best documentary films ever made and still cult classic today.
