Dr. Feinstone is a dentist. She has a beautiful woman and a big house with a pool. Suddenly he finds out that his wife is making up with a pool manager - he realizes that there is a clean one behind everything, there is a decay. ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as a disturbed dentist - he is completely faithful. It has surprisingly little blood, but the scene of dental torture is pretty nasty and grotesque. Highly recommended. "Dentist 2" is also worth checking out!
