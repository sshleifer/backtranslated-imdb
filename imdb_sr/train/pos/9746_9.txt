Okay, let's face it. This is a horrible movie. The action (like that) is terrible, acting is worse. But the film was made for one reason and only for one reason, as well as all those horrible films of the Lance ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti at its peak. Okay, maybe Lanzini's films were also an excuse for him to hit women, but this film talks about Lucian. It's just worth watching the movie. A big opera star stuck to himself faces her fears, finds humility and love along the way, and highlights a number of hit numbers, too. . I'm Italian. I am a great fan of the Pavarotti (is there anything about Pavarotti that is not great, including its base of fans?). And when I first saw this film I went out alone, watching the height and depth of life opportunities and falling in love for the first time. As awesome as this film, the wonderful voice and memories are enough to breathe again the depth of life and love. Yes, it's scratched and horrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it is about. That's why I gave this film a high score in the hope that someone who never heard Pavarotti listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially because he's gone now. As Italian food you have never tried before, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised, like a Luciana fan or a promising Pavarotti.
