I was so surprised when I saw such an underrated movie ... I understand why some of you do not like this movie. Its speed is slow, the characteristic of Japanese films. However, if you are preoccupied with a movie like me, this will not be a problem for you. I must say that this is the best comedy I've ever seen. "Do we want Dans?" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is very different from Hollywood, e.g. Austin Povers or Scari Movies, in which it is guaranteed every few minutes. Instead, it's a bright heart, a movie that makes you feel good. I love the movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is clear but pleasant. I was so excited when I saw Sugiama (the lead role) finding the meaning of life in the dance. Before I watched the movie, I was a little depressed about the hard work of the school. I felt lost. However, this film made me think of the light of the side of life. I believed that I was in the same boat Sugiama; if he finds himself in a hobby, why should not I? It reminded me of "exploring my future" and discovering happiness in my everyday life. It is important to note that actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may feel that dance scenes are not as perfect as you would expect, I kind of like it, because it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive", they learn to play how the movie goes on. > First of all, this film is encouraging and cordial. As a comedy, she does her job perfectly. Definitely deserves 10 stars. Yes, Aoki is funny: -D
