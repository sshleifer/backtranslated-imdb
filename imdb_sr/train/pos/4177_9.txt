Wonderful cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way. The cinema is still a visual medium and Igor has used his full potential. A young restless man embarks on a train without a destination. In one of the compartments he encounters a girl. The words are not exchanged, but the laundry is laundered and from there we start with other distinctive characters and situations. The two traces are perfectly thrown away because their unique properties tell a story that does not require a word.
