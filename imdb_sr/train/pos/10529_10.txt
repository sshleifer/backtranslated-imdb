No matter what my favorite I have left a novel, and Paltrow is by no means my favorite actress, but the film was almost completely beautiful. Paltrow is doing a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays 'Miss Bates' are absolutely brilliant. Details about the period are not alienated; In fact, the feeling of a movie is right. But the real 'invention' is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. There could be no more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr. K in the novel, but he found him in the film wonderfully human and humane. Northam's good looks and smiling eyes are not an obstacle to enjoy! Recommended. AnaR
