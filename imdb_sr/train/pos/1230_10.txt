after I looked at this movie for the third time now I think it's almost Adam's worst movie PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR compared to this I must say at the end when Dickie is thrown out of the boat it's so funny (hair is different from his This movie should be made only if your real Adam Sandler fan. Characters are poor compared to his funny movies like Waterbury, who has the same people in him (Peter Dante) who is one of the killers who is trying to to kill an Australian bird. </ br>> This movie has no depth and decent story u≈æuje to be at the bottom of 100
