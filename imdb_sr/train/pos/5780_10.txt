Makk is a deep psychological introspective that is mildly camouflaged as a strange superhero story. Julie Vinters is a "free social worker" in an unnamed dirty city, burdened with crime, and she and everyone she knows has many problems to work with. Makk is her friend and client, a street bug that thinks it's a costume superhero - or is it the other way around? Makk should not miss the artwork, the story itself, or the excellent loud work - especially delicate urban, the captain of the slanderous voice of the late Barry Stigler on the main villain, Mr. Gone. If you have the opportunity to see this, do not miss it.
