It's all very simple. Jake goes to jail, and spent five years with cheaters and chess master. they are sympathetic to his history of loss and failure, and the utter misery he lives for his faith in his mastery in small tricks and control of the rules of the small thieves. they decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom: from his deepest fears, from what he believes he is himself. for that they take him on a journey where he must release all fear, all pride, all hope - to be born again as a true master of his will. It's a smart movie about the illumination path, the endless cubes and games we work with and within ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.
