My rating refers to the first 4 seasons of the Stargate SG-1 that are beautifully fresh, creative and addictive. When the actors walked through the gate, you never knew what lay on the other side! Starting from Season 5, the show had a different focus - still good, but different. The series follows the adventures of a team of people (and one foreigner) who regularly go into a planetary transport device called "Stargate". The supporting series is based on the characters and events of the "Stargate" movie in which the device was discovered during the archaeological excavations in Egypt. Episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. Many inventive stories could easily be turned into big science fiction films. What was going on was always unpredictable. The characters in which the performances continue are also well defined and greatly performed. Their tone is serious, but the dialogue flourished with incredible humor and humor. They are simply fun to watch. Starting sometime around the 5th season, the series began to evolve into a continuous story based on the fight against one enemy (Goa'ulda, then Oriya). Plots become more complex (much more politically / strategically oriented) and dependent on one another. The characters were still large, but the show was different in nature. One thing to note is watching the episodes that marked the 100th and 200th episodes. They just can not miss the show. They show a creative and wild witty genius who wore the series for 10 seasons. If you are a Sci-Fi fan, take a look at several episodes of the first 4 seasons and you'll probably be hooked. If you like new lines of story between the two opposite sides, you have 10 seasons of rejoicing.
