Those who are not familiar with the alter ego Cassandra Peterson Elvira, then this is a good place to start. "Elvira, the Mistress of the Dark" begins with our heroin with boobs that are defying gravity and receiving a message. Her big aunt seems to have died and she should be present for reading the will. Wanting to raise money for the show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decided to leave in hopes of getting a lot and a lot of money. Unfortunately, the place to go is the city of Fallvell, Massachusetts. After spell remained because of her car being broken, she learned that her great aunt left her three things: a house, a dog, and a cook. The inhabitants of the city have different reactions: teenagers like her, women hate, and men crave for her (although they are trying to stay moral pillars of the community). Her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle Vincent (V. Morgan Sheppard) because she wants her cook. It seems that the cook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful wizard. The film is actually quite funny, with Peterson or Elvira who uses his "endowments" and sexiness as a joke ("And do not forget, tomorrow we'll show you a head with two things ... I mean a thing with two heads ") Especially fun as Edie McClurg as Chastiti Pariah, the woman who hardly works to keep her city in order, but she looks funny at the end (Picnic Scene is the perfect example). She deserves to hug (Movie, not her tits, of course).
