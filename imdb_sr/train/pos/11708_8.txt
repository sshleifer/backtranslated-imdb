The reason people say that this film scared them is because he did it !! This means that the goal of the film was felt by some who saw it. When I first saw this film scared me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a movie about the bloody and fearful type of film, but the kind you would think of things that could happen in the way the film was written. Of course they do not believe she will only say her science fiction movie. It's true that this movie is mandatory for your thriller collection, even if it has a religious look. If you are a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc) this is one of them and must have it. I've never seen a distant Thunder, but I believe it continues where this movie ends.
