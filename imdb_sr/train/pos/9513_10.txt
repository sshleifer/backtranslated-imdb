A great gangster movie. Sam Mendes directed this wonderful movie that shows another father-son, friendship. It plays too much of Paul Nevman, Jude Lava and Daniel Craig. The casting is too good. The action is pretty good. You will enjoy the movie. as the zenith of all gangster films of that era. Soundtrack is pretty good for the movie. A great movie in general that shows what the father is doing to protect his son.
