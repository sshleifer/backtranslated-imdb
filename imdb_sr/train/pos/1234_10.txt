I grew up watching this movie, and I still love it the same today as when I was a kid. Do not listen critics criticism. They are not true in this movie. Eddie Murphy really shines in his role. You can sit down with your entire family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this film to everyone to see. It's a comedy with a dose of fantasy. With demons, dragons and a small bald child with God like power. beautiful view! So do the favor and grab this! You will not regret it!
