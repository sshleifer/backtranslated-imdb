I was and I was very funny with the movie. It was my favorite movie from 1976. I grew up in the 1970s, I was so in love with Chris Kristoffersons' appearance and behavior, of course not being a film critic, but at the time I think it was very good. I really like the combination of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked well together. I've seen a movie many times and I still love the two as Esther and John Norman. I'm a big fan of Chris and I see him at a concert when I can. What a talented singer writer songs, not to mention, an actor. I've seen it in many movies, but I still think it's Born Star.
