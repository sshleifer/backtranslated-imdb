This film fascinates with its beauty and creativity. The deep vision of the artist, his art that springs intuitively from his natural source, brings us an inspirational Hosana, merging his creations with trees, white water that fills with walls, fields and rain ... that we are all made of clay of this magnificent land. He does not spare us our occasional frustration, but in general, we see a miracle in joining art with nature. The loan, of course, also applies to the director, Thomas Riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited a movie with incredible sensibility and perfect timing. Do not miss this fantastic movie!
