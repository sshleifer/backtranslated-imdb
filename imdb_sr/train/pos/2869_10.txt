First of all, I want to say, "Thank you, Disney, that you finally released Cinderella on DVD, and now you have all Disney animated movies on DVD (including limited edition from 1999) What will you do next? You go to Disney World !!!!! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) In any case, Disney remains magical in his animated classic 1950 movie" Cinderella, "a film that put movies from fairy tale on the map. . We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, its steppes, date, glass slippers, pumpkins that turn into a carriage just because it says "Bippiti-boppiti-boo!", And of course, trying to get home back to midnight! What I like about this movie: It's a great old fairy tale that kids love, now in movie form (as well as on DVD) !!!!! "Cinderella" - thanks, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
