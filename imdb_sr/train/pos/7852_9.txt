The curiosity of Ladislas Starevicz with insects and cinema connects to a short film about the love triangle between the g. Beetle, an art guzzler and Mrs. Beetle. A fairly simple story about an adulterous couple of bugs who both seek out-of-wedlock stimulus is similar to biography or Vitagram that was short-lived. An old-fashioned reversal in the story is to use balsamed worms with wires that level the legs in the animation. The story is being built while Mr. Beetle unconsciously caught the jeweler with a vertebrate from a local nightclub by a jealous locust. When Mr. Beetle came home to find his wife in the arms of his art friend, he was angry, but ultimately forgiving and leading her to see the film. However, Mrs. Beetle soon finds out about her husband's unbelief, because the film they watch is a jealous skakavac video. Beetle and vertebrae together. Ms. Beetle Impact Mr. Beetlea with its umbrella, g. Beetle jumps through the screen, and both end up in jail after the projector that destroys burns. The insects are housed in humanized environments, such as a house or nightclub, and receive the human characteristics of jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. Insect characters carry briefcases, drive motorcycles, and even wear shoes, but also twitch their antennae and open and close their jaws just like the right insects do. Newspaper stories do not worsen, even after multiple views, but as current movements, the film slowly moves. The action takes place with tangible details, but the speed and faster pace of the recording is lost in the process. Despite its rhythm, the film is an excellent example of Starevic's early puppetry and is highly recommended.
