This movie caught me by the incredible opening sequence that deceived me into a complete reversal of perspective, so I was hooked at the time when the title came. The theme of this film is that all actors try to re-invent themselves, but not in a cunning way, such as Identity or the Common Suspect, but in the way we all try to do whatever the banal life we ​​find in a bit more interesting. Scenes in chick ware are spectacular. At one point, Jorgen (who owns a chicken farm) attended a laughing seminar, where he is the worst student. His discomfort in this allows you to see the depth of his desire to change yourself. The film asked me about hidden secrets lying behind the surface of the most common people I see every day. There is not a lot of complications here. Guessing the secret of an old man is quite easy, but fascination lies in an attempt to guess what all other characters will do when they understand it. I liked this film the same way Sidewis did, although the characters could not be different.
