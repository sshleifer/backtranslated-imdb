I was so glad that I came across this short film. I'm always so disappointed that it's hard to find short films, so when I saw it and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action short film at the Oscars, I was so pleased that I actually had a movie that I was a part of was a fairly simple director, writer and star Nacho Vigalondo tried to make sense of why people would suddenly start singing and dancing as in movie musicals. The result is extremely fun and the song is actually really appealing. It is a well-made short film, well-edited and all actors do a great job. And the last shot of the movie is perfect. I recommend this film.
