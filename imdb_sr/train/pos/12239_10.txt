Excellent farce! What, of course, was all that was supposed to be. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, nor is there the slightest attempt in this direction. Can a plot really be taken or happened at any particular time or place? It's unlikely because, after all, this is simple, it's just a movie, and movies come from imagination, not reality. The only goal of this film is to entertain, certainly not to educate and entertain, and the reality is beautifully and carelessly thrown into the winds. I think that the majority would agree that from the documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity. But for fun I want what is described today as "non-smart", which is the Game Mating in every way. For a few smiles and open laughter now and then, this is a nice fantasy.
