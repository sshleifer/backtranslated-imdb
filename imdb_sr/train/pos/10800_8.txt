This film is far better than the original Jerk. I would highly recommend it to everyone who loves strange humor. We've included almost as many lines from this movie into our daily discourse as we got from Monti Pithon. Scene at the table and its contempt for the turtle soup. Original The Jerk was too choreographed and set. Although Steve Martin likes me, it seemed like she was trying. Jerok Too is a spoof and everyone will enjoy. Jerk Too is suitable for the family, unlike the original The Jerk.
