For several years now, I read modesty Blaise, collecting numbers. After the film about the fiasco made many years ago based on the first book "Modesti Blaise", I was surprised that this result got this good. The director focused on history and psychology. Since Modesty was created on the basis of one's own story and the parts of her life influenced by her non-childhood. I think these thoughts will give a better understanding to the next (I hope) the film. I just loved old-fashioned movies. However, everything was not so good, gambling was not so good. almost boring and unreal. And acting could improve. I do not think that the bad guy in this movie felt real, the only reason he was there was that Modesti had someone to tell his story. They could also expand the film, showing more about building a "Network", but I suppose it will be for the next film.
