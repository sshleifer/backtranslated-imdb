John Vater's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've ever watched. The viewer is given a surreal picture of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), using color Varhola, excessive movements and emotions. Pecker becomes bigger than his city can endure, and he is separated from his beloved (including sexy Ricci) by his artist who loves people. The picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth - somehow like fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although this taste was quite flat and simplified, it just made the whole thing deeper and more critical. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to carry weapons ... and everything else that this country represents. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidvell.edu)
