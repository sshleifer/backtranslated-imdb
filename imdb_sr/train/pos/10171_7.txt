Once I was in college and when we had an international fair, the Russian section had a poster from the Soviet era "Do not hurt!", Which means "Do not bother!". "I've translated" for the "generation" of television viewers like "Do not be Gladis Kravitz!" (compared to the curious neighbor to "Bevitched"). However, when you see the result of the ribbons in Pvt. Snafu short "Rumors", you see that it's not a funny thing. In this case, an incalculable soldier is hearing something about the bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis forces attacked the United States. So he tells this to someone who speaks to someone else who speaks to someone else and continues. As in the "Russians are coming, the Russians are coming," the story becomes more and more proportional, so when he returns to Snaf ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, it's mostly propaganda in World War II - along with a terrible expression for the Japanese - but I must say that Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually quite funny. Of course, since Dr. Seuss and Mel Blanc made voices, it's not surprising that they came out pretty cool. Worth watching.
