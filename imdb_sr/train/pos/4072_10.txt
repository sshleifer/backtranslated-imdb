The name Haiao Miiazaki became prominent with Spitied Avai, but what is often overlooked is the director's first film effort. Who remembers Spielberg directed by Duel or George Lucas who directed the THKS 1138? I remember seeing the fragments of this film - almost certainly for the last 45 minutes in the late 80's and what I was stuck with was the visual luminosity of design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well-known store for Â£ 9, I could not resist, but to buy it. It's weird that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not match with my recollection of it (memory is so funny). Watching this movie now with all the knowledge gained about the artist's portfolio is very similar to Jean 'Moebius' Giraud some of the artwork. I can only assume some influence here. When Pazu catches the falling girl (Sheeta), his adventure really begins - a search for Laput - a reference to the part of Guliver's trip overlooked by Jonathan Svift. With healthy references to Jules Verne, it's a basic good movie against a bad chuck, and the final part has heroes that end up on Laputa. The ecological aspect of Lapute has returned to nature - a lot of robots covered with moss under the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the peak of the film - a view of the surface of Lapute, in contrast to the mechanized underground. Although this is the dichotomy of this film - to show that even technology can not overcome nature - the irony of the last robot that takes care of the garden and animals. The ending of the Silent Running movie is almost exactly the same. It's incredibly stylish, I would not say "slick" - a very beautiful and organic and vast amount of detail in buildings, airships and design and the look of everything. Miazaki is a true master of this kind of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and watch it.
