Fantastic documentary from 1924. The geography of today's Iraq was strong. Watch this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not make notes before he wrote the Ten Commandments. Merian C. Cooper, a photographer, later created Cinerama, an idea that probably came out while filming extraordinary landscapes in this film. Fans of Verner Herzog will find this film as mild, and heartbreaking stories of struggle, complemented by the land around them, were never so obvious. The fact that this was done when it showed not only the will of the subjects, but also the filmmakers themselves.
