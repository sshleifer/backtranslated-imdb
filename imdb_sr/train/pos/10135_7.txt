What starts out as a very predictable and somewhat suspicious affair is in the end pretty funny and fun. "Right to die" is not quite uncertain, but it more than compensates for it with some strange pieces and above the upper part. go to the dead performance of Martin Donovan as one of the weakest characters ever to show the screen. Playing a character in a great "distant" mode, you almost feel bad about the guy in the end when his big plan eventually fails. Corbin Bernsen also plays a cheerful landscape playing not a very good guy who gets his real desserts. End of Spoiler. As a revenge-dead kick, "Right to Die" has great benefits from his performers and is more of a OK way to spend less than an hour.
