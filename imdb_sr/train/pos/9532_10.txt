I loved this film so much ... how long it takes to develop characters, attention to detail, top performances, stunning lighting and cinema, wonderful sound record ... It has combined intensity and ease of touch who will not work for anyone who wants a typical quick action kick. To live in Elizabethan days, I would say that this film is somewhat like a shakespearean tragedy. But since we do not do it, let's say it's more like a movie about Drama-Suspense. The action is simple, but the story is complex. The film is intelligent in the way in which relationships and questions are explored. Much of the story is portrayed, and not said, which makes it more subtle and moving - which also works well for story-based story (or graphic novel). Sometimes I felt that I was the thirties of the last century, part of this story - there was such a realistic, but similar dream in the style of his story. I do not like often the books on which they were based, but in this case. (Although I also enjoyed the book.) I bought a DVD, which is great because it has some beautifully deleted scenes and an insightful comment. (I also took a little cousin, who is a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see him after I first saw him, because he has problems at home and I wanted to use it as a way to I start discussing the problems of my father and son with him - and the discussion.)
