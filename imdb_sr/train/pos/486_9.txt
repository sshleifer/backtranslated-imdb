'The Luzhin Defense' is a movie worthwhile for somebody's time. It's a dark, intense film, which kept my attention all the time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrait of a delicate, eccentric chess grandmaster, and Emili Vatson is bound to spell like a gentle but rebellious daughter of highly respected Russian families. Chemistry between Vatson and Turturur on the screen is evident from the moment when their characters meet in the story. All in all, this film is one of the best deep-seated views of the life of the chess grandmaster, and Turturro and Vatson add to the film a non-mainstream, non-clich√©s feel. Most people will come out of the theater thinking and feel a little touched by this brilliant look at the most unbelievable love stories.
