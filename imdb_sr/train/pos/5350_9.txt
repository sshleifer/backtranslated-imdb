I saw The Running Man several times while I'm a fan of Stephen King and I have all his films, but now it's even better because I did not know about this site two days ago and I did not know that Paul Michael Glaser was involved in this film was the same as Paul Michael Glaser that I grew up watching the television show Starsky and Hutch. For me this is a pleasant surprise, because I can not tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch was injured. In an episode in which Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died, I cried so hard. My dad had to turn from the show. What do you expect from a child at age 12? Now I'm deliberately looking for films and programs that include Paul or David Soul and everything Stephen King has on my hands so I'm there !!!!!!!! I just have to say Happy Birthday Paul !!!!!
