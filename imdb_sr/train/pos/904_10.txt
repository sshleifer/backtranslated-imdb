Suraj Barjatia is best in movies about marriage. And here it is; back to its basics about Vivaah. How the story goes, it's a story from engagement to marriage. A movie that you can watch with your entire family around you. A movie you'll hate watching alone. The story is simple, but the music is good, the cinema is great, the direction is the best, everything about the movie has its own class. There are many scenes that will make you cry and you are sure that if you watch a movie with your soul, both of you will definitely hold your hands to the end of the movie. Shahid Amrita has given us earlier hit movies such as Ishk Vishk, & Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good movie, the audience did not accept it well. True Shahid & Amrita movie.
