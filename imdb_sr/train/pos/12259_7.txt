"Family affair" returns us to a less complicated time in America. It's hard to see how different it was then. It was an innocent era in our country and we are looking at a 'functional' family dealing with things together. The film also marks the beginning of the series with the Hardy family. The film directed by George Seitz is based on a successful performance. Judge James Hardy and his wife, Emmyl, face a domestic crisis that has to be resolved. Married daughter Joan comes home after committing a social mistake and her husband considers her responsible. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings home one barefoot, which is clear, will clash with her father. Happy teenager Andy, it seems to be the only one without problems until his mother follows Polly on a dance, something she does not want. It's superfluous to say that Judge Hardy will prove why he knows best because he puts a plan in action to bring it back together again. After all, he is a man who understands, not just a law, but how to deal with those external forces that threaten his position in the community and what will make his family happy. Lionel Barrimore plays Judge Hardy with conviction. He's a glue that holds everything together. Spring Biington is seen as Emily, mother. Mickey Rooney has a small part in this movie, but he's as always fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haidon appeared as daughters, Marion and Joan. Sara Haiden and Margaret Markuis are also shown in the film as Aunt Milli and Polly, a girl who surprises Andy with her beauty. "Family affair" is a good way to observe our past through a positive image painted by an American family.
