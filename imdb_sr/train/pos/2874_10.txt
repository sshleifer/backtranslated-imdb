Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is brutally treated by her evil stepmother and shepherdess. One day, the ball will be held in honor of the prince, but the Cinderella does not have the chance to leave because her stepmother and shepherds do not allow her. With the help of her fairy-tale godfather and her animal friends, she is on the ball, with a warning to return home by midnight. He sees a nice prince on the ball. When the clock peaks midnight, it runs home, leaving behind one of its glass slippers. With the help of her animal friends, her true identity is revealed. She and the prince marry later and live happily ever after. Cinderella, published 56 years ago, has been a huge success in the office and continues to charm the audience today. He has a well-written letter. The characters are remembered. The songs, including "A Dream is A Vish Iour Heart", "So This is Love", and a great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" help to talk the story. This was my favorite movie that grew up and did not lose any charm. Right Disney's masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 ะ.ะก. A recent DVD release is the best way to appreciate this movie, including features, deleted scenes, music videos, vintage radio programs, and a revamped movie!
