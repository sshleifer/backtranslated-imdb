Like a tram of the named desire (also directed by Gadg on the screen and on the screen) Panic In The Streets shows Nev Orleans in which his main claim for fame - the birthplace of Jazz - does not cite even a memorial. It was the seventh movie of Richard Vidmarck, and he probably went a long way from establishing him as a fine actor who really was, and not just as a psychotic killer. Sam Gad appears in an ungrateful little role, but the film is rich in talent, starting with Jack Palance (which is still charged as Valter Jack Palance) as a local gentleman. Emile Meier, Tommy Rettig plus rock-solid ever trusted Paul Douglas as a policeman coming to the point of view of Doc Vidmarka. It is a film that is very rewarded and no longer seen. Get him if you can.
