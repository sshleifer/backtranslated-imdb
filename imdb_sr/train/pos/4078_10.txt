This is one of my favorite films, PERIOD. I can not imagine another movie that combines so many good movie quality like this one. This movie has everything: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad, and even romantic (even innocent "peck" on the face between Paz and Sheet). Perhaps the best of all, you do not have to be in Mensa to get "get" and enjoy the movie like you are working with some other Miyazaki movies (I do not know about you, but I watch movies to rest from thinking). This is just a nice movie that everyone likes, so do yourself a favor and buy it. The only acid note is the American Dubbing. I discovered that Vander-Geek was simply boring. But everything is not lost, the original Japanese version is on a two-tiered set and it's stones! Who cares if you do not understand Japanese? If you can read the second level, then look at the original Japanese subtitles with English subtitles. You will not regret it.
