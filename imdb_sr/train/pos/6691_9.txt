This movie is fun. What makes it so great is two things: one is a clear way in which characters accept stereotypes, discussions about their costumes and supersilas. There is a parochia that is very attractive; the other is the basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves a special note as the object of g. There's a talent talent here. I realize that some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this film is very fun and sweet.
