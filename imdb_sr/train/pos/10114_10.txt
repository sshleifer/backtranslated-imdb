"Haunted Vorld of Edvard D. Vood, Jr." is a definitive documentary about the life of a man who brought us movies like "Glen or Glenda," "The Bride of the Monster," and, of course, Plan 9 from the Universe. This extraordinary film is far outperformed by other documentaries, such as "Look Back in Angora" and "The Plan 9 Companion", which failed. He rounds off the surviving environment, many of whom have died from shooting, and sincerely examines Ed Vood and his work. Nostalgically in the fact that he looks back at the darker corner of the past Hollywood, sentimental in his treatment of the director (all the way to crazy music), this documentary is absolutely compulsory for anyone who loves a director who failed so in his day. The whole two hours of a movie with love and retrospective pieces together Ed's life and premature death for the viewer. Best looking at 3 in the morning while wearing an angora sweater.
