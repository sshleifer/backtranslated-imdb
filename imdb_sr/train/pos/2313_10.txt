This film about "adult life" deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, while they learn about life and love one fateful year. Director: Robert Mulligan, famous for his extraordinary work "To Kill a Bird Mist", the film never gets a fake note. All the acting is great. As Dani, Reese Vitherspoon makes a great film debut. Looking at this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited movie, I felt like I was looking through the window into reality, and I did not watch the movie. I watched this movie at least 5 times, and I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies ever recorded about youth, falling in love and experiencing feelings, challenges and changes in youth. Families with children between 10 and 15 years should look together, and use it as a discussion, as it raises a series of questions about fraternal rivalry, how to deal with love, responsibilities of parents, etc.
