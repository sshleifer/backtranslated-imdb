Melvin Douglas and Joan Blondell star in "The Amazing Mr. Villiams", a mystery / comedy from 1939, which is pretty good, though forgotten, probably due to the number of amazing films that came out in 1939. Douglas plays a talented police detective in a marriage with his job, while his girlfriend is waiting for a wedding that is constantly delayed. What is happening in this movie is no exception, it is called on the scene of the murder just as it is preparing to pass through the passage again. Both stars were great in comedy, they worked well (and often), and help make this battle polish fun. Edward Brophi and Donald McBride are available for excellent support. As you can read in other reviews, Melvin Douglas does not do much women. Fun is a little on the long side. One of the comments here was destroyed by Melvin Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally floated through dozens of films as the second man and best friend before he became an old man in the movies. He was not a lazy, but very working actor (who made him easier) who had a Broadway career along with his film career. He simply was not an actor in films and had very challenging roles in the studio system. I challenge everyone to see his devastating performances in "The Hood" and "I Never Sang for My Father" and I call him lazy or look at his smile.
