When my fourteen-year-old daughter and her friends gather for a movie evening, there's one movie that insists on constantly watching again: you hit, the K-911, the third war in a very successful K-9 franchise in which everyone is playing the favorite TV dad, Jim Belushi. People, I knew it was possible to carry VHS tape, but DVD?! This is played so often that it starts jumping; no joke! Of course, you will have this when you own a movie that is so charming, so brilliant. Of course, we have to thank the only Tom Hanks who introduced us to the favorite Cop-Dog genre. with Turner and Hooch; however, even this film can not match the perfection that is presented in all three K-9 films. Some nai-saiers say that Belushi is left with no money with the third film in the series. Poppicock, I say. Although you might suspect that the third sequel - directly to the video, may not look like something worth watching, you would prove that you made a mistake after watching this quality movie. I will not give a plot, but I will say that Belushi and his partner with panting give the best performance - the one that HOVLING will make you laugh! It's a shame that John Belushi is not alive to see what his big brother's big steps have done in the acting world. I recommend that your teenage daughter present this film to her BFFs at her next party. Do not forget the puppy!
