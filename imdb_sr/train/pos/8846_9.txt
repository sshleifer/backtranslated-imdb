I really enjoyed this drama from Sidney Lumet. The best word I can come to describe is crazy. He casts the viewer an hour and fifty minutes and does not allow you to breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end. Believe me, this movie will keep you guessing all the way. The story is very well made and almost brilliant. It's almost like a complicated story of the Tarantino type. The acting is amazing from all tracks, even from tiny parts, great acting. I also liked cinema, gave her the real feeling as if she were an independent film. Everything was great. This film is excited, exhausting and heartbreaking. It's hard to watch, but you'll be glad you did it.
