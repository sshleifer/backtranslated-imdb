Spirits who are still walking are one of those movies that grab you and do not let them all end up, especially when you see him as a child. If you watch a movie as an adult, you must admit that this is not so scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains great mysterious scenes (especially those with a creepy mummy). One of the best scenes in the film is without doubt the scenes with grandfather and grandmother in their new RV; the scene with the walls is very exciting and quite scary. Also, scenes where the main character reveals the secret of their mother is quite scary. Good, acting in the movie is not so great and the movie sometimes seems a bit boring, but generally the Spirits who are still walking is fun. Too bad that only a few people saw this movie, this movie really deserves better. I just want to say: Mr. Flocker, you have done a good job! And for all of you Hollywood producers there; If you want to remake a movie, remake this!
