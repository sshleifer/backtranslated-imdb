Emma from Jane Austen is a very pleasant story at a worst moment and this production of the story is the best I've ever seen. Emma Kake Beckinsale is flawless. Gvineth Paltrow, (with the help of good scenarios and excellent cinema) is able to efficiently carry out a comedy, does not manage to make Emma sympathetic. Paltrow is not supported by the fact that her hairstyles are simply 'wrong' for the part (and I believe in the era) and she looks positively sick in the dresses of the empire line. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy without effort and is still able to show what Mr. Knightley (the most romantic heroine Jane Austen) actually sees in her. Mark Strong is a wonderful Mr. Knightley with a true combination of handsome looks, appropriate ages, chivalry, compassion and gentlemen's behavior. Emma and Mr. Knightley support actors of good actors, and production as a whole is very pleasant.
