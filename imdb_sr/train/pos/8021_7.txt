The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most widespread and pleasant, and the gang takes its modest musical to the brilliant (but non-existent) lights on Broadway filled with typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt failed, and Kermit (leader of the group and the author of the show) fell; so that everyone else goes their separate ways so that they do not have to feel responsible for them. Sam Kermit is engaging with young designers who make up food in her father's restaurant (the old man, therefore, has a line in particularly curvy non-secularists!). We got the usual coming performances of various stars: Art Carnei (as producer), James Coco (as an overweight dog owner), Dabnei Coleman (as a trustee), Elliott Gould (also in MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines , Lisa Minnelli (as well as she has her portrait in a top-notch restaurant replaced by Kermit's sporty fake mustache as an apparently celebrated entrepreneur in the scam to attract publicity to Muppet's show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (perhaps on the funniest film scene as producer on the Broadvaiu, before which Kermit appeared playing street and friendly and harsh nuances and afro wigs!). The other Muppetts are more or less going through their typical steps, with (unfortunately) less space given to Gonzoo this time; while Miss Piggy with me has something to taste, the scene in which this spies what takes Kermit's romance with a waitress? and especially her violent reaction to this? are undoubtedly ridiculous. What disappoints, however, is the very phenomenon (after a fairly excessive cross-section in which Kermit gets amnesia and eventually launches advertising on Madison Avenue), which, instead of expected split routines, acquires nothing more original than Kermit's wedding ceremony and its eternal flame Miss Piggie!
