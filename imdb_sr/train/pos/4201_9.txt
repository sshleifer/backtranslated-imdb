Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by actor Samuel Fuller, contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication. Candi Undertaker (Susan Peters) collides with pocket Skip McCoiem (Richard Vidmark dipped in the Sinatra cool). She is not aware she is carrying a precious microfilm; McCoi is not aware that he caught him. They both do not know that they are respected by two federal agents. In this way, the movement moves the level of knowledge. Candi is double-sighted (Skip and Police) and therefore double naive; Skip, a self-satisfied little thief, is unconsciously aware of, pursued by federal agents; The Feds, everyone knows, are ultimately helpless. They can not stop the "passage" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
