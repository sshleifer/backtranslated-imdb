There are movies, and there are also movies. Films are usually only film "sweets", while films are real works of art. Fraulein Doctor is definitely in a good position. Like most viewers, I was very impressed with the battle scenes, but the strength of the portrait of the central character is what I consider to be the highest quality film. After doing everything possible to serve his country as a true daughter of Deutschland, as long as it is morphically dependent, the death of Fraulein is very stingy by the German High Command despite all its efforts. The scene in which the Doctor is transmitted in the back seat of the Mercedes Benz brand, alone, devastated, and lust maybe one of the saddest, but true details of a "spy" party in life. The emotional pain that Richard Burton introduced in Spi Vho Came in the Cold is approaching. Fraulein Doctor is a far deeper film than one that can be understood after one look. I just want its producers to see that they are ready to publish it on DVD, so those who never experienced it can, and those who see it can again (maybe again and again) enjoy this extraordinary movie.
