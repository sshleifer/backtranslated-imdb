Completely brilliant. Powerful and challenging. The most interesting documentary series ever recorded about the war. His tone gives a sharp contrast to the often gong-ho attitude towards the Second World War that the media exposes. Instead of deciding to scream about the horror of the war, Sir Laurence Olivier's peaceful voice to take the last seat with real war images: corpses, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes costing thousands of lives, the suffering of the innocent . Most of all, it really brings home that mankind is capable when all normal rules of "courtesy" are removed. Something extremely hobbiesian about a man in the right state of nature, he will return to a religious form capable of crimes that will continue to shock and fascinate for 60 years. Perhaps a series called "Century in War" for the twentieth century might be a century of horror. I feel that irony is enormous in size that an event that caused the death of 50 million people is needed to produce such a striking and excellent sequence as this one.
