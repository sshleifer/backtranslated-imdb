Powerful pilot, this two-hour episode works perfectly with the placing of characters and wallpapers for "Enterprise", "bored" in the original Star Trek series. Several times it stumbles into the Trek convention, and the clich√© - it seems that candy striped strippers never come out of style, and I can already foresee hidden references to T'pol as "the seven volcanoes" - but the ensemble looks like Jaki, the characters are well drawn, and there are already indications that this crew will have to be more resourceful, in different ways than those of the earlier (later?) series. Scott Bakula guessed the real note as captain with Kirk's daring and boldness, but without his confidence and whispering, and I look forward to the ways in which the series will have engineers, weapons masters and communication officers (not just a celebrated phone operator)!) As supportive toys. It seems that writers picked up a big mistake made in Star Trek: The Nekt Generation, Deep Space 9, and "Voiager": Instead of starting with a big ensemble and giving a short character, it begins with a smaller core of characters that you later can add a bit more variety - I hope it will happen, because about half a dozen episodes will need more diversity.
