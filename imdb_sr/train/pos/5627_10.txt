This move actually pushed me out of the chair in anticipation of what the actors will do! The acting was the best, Farrah was supposed to get an Oscar for this, she was phenomenal. James Russo was so good that I hated him that he was a criminal and played wonderful. There are not many movies that have attracted me like this. The actor was an excellent Alfie who looked shocked by those big eyes that Farrah looked like a victim, and you survived her horror as she passed through it. Farrah made you feel like you were there and feel the same anger that you felt you wanted to hurt him, but you also knew it was the wrong thing. The movie took you on a ride with a toboggan and you went up and down with each scene.
