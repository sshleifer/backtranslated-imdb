Do not be fooled by stupid actors, this is one sweet ride! The real successor to Tetsuo Iron Man and Ichi Killer, this jewel starts with a scratch and lays it up whilst no credits appear. It seems that aliens take over human bodies and modify them into war machines, which are then used to fight each other in a remote game of their own kind. The winner of the battle eats the loser alive. This is mainly due to complications, but who cares when this is good? I have no idea how many mugs are served, but it's disgusting to watch. There is an interesting and effective use of stop-motion when downloads are in progress, and caring care is abundant for all creatures and effects of makeup. CGI is a bit limited, but it does not actually reduce the overall quality, at least for me. This was indeed a fun movie that turns into a stomach and deserves a lot of praise, and it really has earned its place in a bunch of Cult Classics. Find it and watch, you will not be disappointed!
