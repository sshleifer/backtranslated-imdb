I think this film was probably much more powerful when it debuted in 1943, although it seems a bit superfluous and static today to raise it to size. The film was set in 1940 - just before the US entered the war. Paul Lukas plays the very serious and decent head of his family. He is a German who fought against the Nazis for seven years and avoided capture. Bette Davis is his very understandable and long-time wandering woman who from time to time managed to educate and raise children without him. As the film begins, crossing the border from Mexico to the United States and for the first time in years, they will relax and stop running. The problem was that the family was too perfect and too decent - making them an obvious positive propaganda instead of real family suffering through real problems. Although at that time it had a very noble goal, today it seems to be just a lie. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely scripted dialogue used by children simply did not ring. It sounded more like an antifascist speech than the voice of real children. They were, therefore, extremely embarrassing - especially the smallest one who sometimes came out as a brat. The only people who sounded like real were Bette Davis and her extended American family, as well as the Romanian slaves who lived with them (although he did not have any visible accent). famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue because it just does not sound true. The story is based on the performance of her mistresses, Lillian Hellman. And the basic idea of ​​the story and the action is good, but the dialogue is sometimes bad. All in all, an interesting movie and a movie with great moments ... but that's really all.
