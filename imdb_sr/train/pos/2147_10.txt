I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the reality of long-distance trains, cycling from the train station, soup stands and other typical scenes that are so well presented, they certainly added to my own gratitude for this movie that I really liked. In this film, the aspects of Japanese life are colored in vibrant colors, but you do not need to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. Suo's co-writers were mostly subtle; I discovered that a character called Tamako Tamura with a soft filter, making it sublime, a little fictional, but most of the director's tricks were so gentle that I was completely drawn and danced with his characters. Or cried. Or he laughed loudly. Wonderful. A +.
