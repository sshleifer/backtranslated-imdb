Zenith two brilliant careers. David Linch, better known for his less accessible material, makes a delicate and extraordinary story about the most incredible premise. A man travels to see his alienated brother. Since there are no other means of transport, his journey leads him for six weeks at the mower. Richard Farnsworth, in his latest film, brings a stunningly layered and tinted performance in the lead. Unbelievably beautiful in her enjoyment of small things, Straight Story is a classic film experience that must not be missed. Sissi Spacek stands out as Farnsvorth's daughter, a damaged middle-aged woman living with the loss of her children.
