This is so hysterical! Why are not American comedians writing this way? For anyone who thinks that comedy has to be stupid - six episodes of this series have more wit and intelligence than on the novel's book! Hugh Laurie is a complete noise. I could not believe it was the same guy as House! In this series there are so many brilliant lines and alloys that you can watch dozens of times and still pick up new things each time. Rovan Atkinson is hilarious as a verbose and put on Edmund's butler. This is my favorite of all the Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is as diverse as ever as the dull heart of the series, "the crushed mass" of Baldrick. Some of my favorite rows: "When someone screws up with Vellington, he really puts his foot on it," and Baldrick explains how he got his name and relative Macadder's "top sculptor seller" and the killer from Scotland.
