"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial arts films I had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung shows a Chinese farmer who comes to visit his friends from the city. Just like Tang Lung from the "Road of the Dragon". Wherever Sammo goes, trouble begins, so he has to rely on his martial arts skills to solve the differences. Fortunately, Samm's character teaches martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. Even glue his nose with his thumb exactly as Bruce Lee does, and free his screaming. He also uses nuns in the scene. It was as if I was looking at the fat Bruce Lee. There is a great deal about the end of a movie that consists of foreign fighters. Sammo must meet each opponent one at a time. Something like "The Game of Death", where each fighter has a different discipline of martial arts. This is one of the movies I really enjoyed watching and the first Sammo Hung movie I've seen. Great fighting scenes and lots of laughter. A rare classic Sammo Hung film that I recommend to all fans of martial arts. 8.5 / 10!
