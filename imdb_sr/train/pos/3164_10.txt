I can not believe we do not have that show anymore. I have all 8 seasons and 70's !! I absolutely love that !! Every night I lay in bed and watched several episodes before I went to bed. At the end of a long, stressful day, it's nice to kick back and laugh before you go to bed. I was so sad that they took the air ... at least we still have a repeat! I hope and pray that he will come back with at least a gathering ... As if Donna graduates from college and finally we see that she and Erik are getting married !!!! Would not that be great !!! It would be even better if they continued it for a few years !!
