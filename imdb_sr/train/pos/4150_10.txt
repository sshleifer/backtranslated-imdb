I'm looking at the Cold Case because of the real-life experiences. This one was very close to me and touched me deeply, so handsome, thank you, Merideth. All the characters are well developed 3D special Coop. The material is still difficult to access, the US is far behind the developed countries of the world. only such a sincere, real, imaginative picture and treatment affect the population. Of course, they do not see all the things the same way, but I'm glad that 3/4 men in the group under the age of 30 voted the same as me 10. You reach hard - I will forever reserve the best episode "place for this episode." Please continue with your chances and accept my sincere gratitude.
