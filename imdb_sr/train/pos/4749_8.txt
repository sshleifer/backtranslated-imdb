I really enjoyed this movie and it was a bit harder when your brother made a stupid comment in 30 seconds. But I enjoyed this film, mostly because I was accustomed to the usual HK action movies. Most movies like this one do not look for a story, watch it for a foolish action. A foolish action is right. You can see Jet Li Jump, spin, hit, hit, shoot, make impossible jumps and escape countless bullets. The truth is that this film was released to the wider audience after Li was in Lethal Veaphone 4. This is one of the reasons why the ratings of this film fell. Most people probably expected to watch a movie that was so smooth as a North American movie. But you have to remember that most of the HK movie's budget is not nearly as high as a North American film, and the style in the HK action movie is usually very different and usually requires that in a large number of them they work in a wire. If you want to see a good action movie, you should see this just try to ignore the sync. My rating was 8.
