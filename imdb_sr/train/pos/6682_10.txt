I saw it in theaters and I absolutely loved it. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super-criminal I've ever seen from Gene Hackman as Lek Luther. Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens were a servant in the sky. This film also introduced me to Villiam H. Maciem, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was excellent as Blue Raja, and I was especially glad that the character was not British. A scene with him and his mother that the superhero almost caused me tears. I liked the fact that Bowler spoke to the ball. Some of the funniest things related to Stiller and his false anger. Furious, and the fact that his threats and liners were meaningless and that they never made any sense. I was barely able to stop from applause when he said "frakulater, Freinken-puss," it was said. But one of the things that I enjoyed most is that Captain Amazing dies in the movie. I HIGHLY recommend this film for every occasion, and I give it my personal two thumbs up.
