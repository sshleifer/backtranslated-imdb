I rented this film because of my interest in American history, and especially a bit strange stories about mormons. This film is trying to make sense that Joseph Smith could transform the "vision" into the main world religion. First, it focuses on the problems that the Mormons had in their settlement in Navuu, Illinois. Shows the trial of Joseph Smith. During this trial, Brigham Young rose to speak of his addressing to Mormonism and his faith in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith was murdered, and Young people have to face their own doubts whether he was chosen to lead the Mormons into a new country. Despite serious doubts, he persists and finally has a vision (that Yuta is a place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the correctness of his leadership. Later, as the crops are destroyed by crocodiles, he doubters that he is really chosen - however, there is a miracle, which craves its place in history. the story is convincing and interesting. I would like to know if the Mormons believe this is an accurate display. Polygamy is part of the story, but the reasons why this central place in the LDS is not set up. The question was not emphasized. I'm sure people keep away from this movie because of its religious theme, but it has a great role and will keep your interest.
