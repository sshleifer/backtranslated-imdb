I actually love this movie, although I do not like James Belushi. In this movie you can see several great names, Linda Hamilton and Courtenei Cock; Caine was already big. The action in this movie is simple; It's just like the sliding door movie. However, it is said in a rude way and I like the comedy in it. It made me re-live my important moments in my life, e.g. What if I took that girl to the movie, not to the other, and so on? Small details have changed. It also reminds us to be careful about what we want. Life is not always so good on the other side as we think; Perhaps, what we now have is best for us, all in consideration.
