I completely disagree with other reviews. Everything is fundamentally negative. I took a chance on this film and I was glad to do it. everything is nice and convincing. Smartee reminded me of Marcy Brady from Brady Bunch. But this girl can really act. I saw this film twice in less than 24 hours. I'll probably look at him again. That's so interesting. It makes one think. It was also out of this time. Back Of Beiond is nice. A well-photographed movie. I could not find anything wrong with that. Check it out! My first review!
