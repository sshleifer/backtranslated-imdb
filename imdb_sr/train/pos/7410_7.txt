I went to "Shower" in the foreign movie section of my local video store and uploaded it several times, because from its cover page it looked like a farce or a comedy. Then I embarked on a copy for the purchase at an economical price and I am happy for my happiness. "Shower" is a story of three (3) men, a father, and two (2) grown sons, each of whom faces life's changes as the world around them continues to change in modern China. As with many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting aspects of this film. Apart from the fascinating features of a local, Chinese color that gives ambience to this story, the difficult but touching relationships between men and the only woman involved in the story, all set on the back of a rural bath. these people. The main story is added to numerous small characters, bathroom buyers and their individual conflicts and friendships. "Shower" is a film that is moving away from laughter and touching its warmth and humanity.
