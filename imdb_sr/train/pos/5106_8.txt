I guess every time I see one of these old 80s movies, it returns me to a simpler time, regardless of how much they look like nowadays. This movie is good. I remember seeing him as a little child and thought it was the best movie ever. It has all the heroic characteristics that a young cowboy wants to be. Now, as an adult, I can look back and laugh, and I still feel sad, but this time I actually know what's going on. I found a strange thing. How many people can move to Houston and connect with Sissy, marry, move into a trailer, fall out, deceive, die uncle, and then come back together, all for a month? Only in America.
