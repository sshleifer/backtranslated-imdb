I do not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why they think it's so bad, etc. It's not worse than anything else. Personally I think that "Soldier" is an excellent movie, much better than most other films in the same genre. Reasons that I like "Soldier": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, script (David Vebb Peoples), excellent visual effects and directing (Paul Anderson). Even I think this is the best job I've seen from director Paul Anderson, who previously directed the "Mortal Kombat" party and not the funny "Event Horizon".
