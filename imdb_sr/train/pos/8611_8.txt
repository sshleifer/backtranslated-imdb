I enjoyed watching this movie. I photographed him as I watched so I could look at him later. In fact, I enjoyed the second look since I was able to absorb more than a smart dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the 2 main character. I thought the way this story evolved was very thoughtful. I was interested in how Natalie would communicate with her daughter's friends; at first I thought it would throw out a lot of hostility, but when she started to communicate more pleasant, I had to see how these visits would take place. I was not disappointed. Gradually the secrets Sara kept from her mother began to reveal a daughter who was not such a perfect, wrong human being as most of us who wanted her freedom from the dominating mother who thought she knew her daughter, but unfortunately she had to learn in a very painful way Sometimes I really love someone to give them freedom. The viewers who remained on this film have seen the very touching performance of Diana Keaton (which is always beautiful, even in some of her less well-accepted films - I mean Tovn and Countri). The final scene of Diane Keaton traveling home was worth waiting, revealing that anyone who loves another human being must learn that we have to live our own lives, we love others, but we do not own them and in the end we have to let go. It's a tough lesson, but it's worth considering now and then. Thank you CBS for this broadcast, it was worth a long wait.
