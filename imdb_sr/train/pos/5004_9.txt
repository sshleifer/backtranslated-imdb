but just as fun and casual! Love it or hate it, but do not expect a sophisticated action or a nail blade. Think of it as Seinfeld, but without continuing and repeating stupid characters (so ... so far, I have the feeling that I will develop favorites while the season continues). Creature "Comfort" is not for a humorous humor - it meant having the least effort on your brain. That's why this show embodies everything I need in the program when I return home from work in the evening : a superficial conversation in the background with the right amount of "sweet" characters for me to enjoy when I finally look down from the computer to see what I miss. </ p> <BR> <BR>> Funny than most of today's comedy, calmer than the evening in NASCAR. Only the right combination of the dead and the returns. I can not wait for the next one.
