With some hesitation, I watch romantic comedies, because romantic comedies have old clich√©s that make the movie unattractive. Typically in a romantic comedy, there's a girl there, and there's a guy, they both fall in love, then they have problems, and then they win the trouble for marriage or anything else. But this film is another story, it's really different from the romantic comedies I've seen lately. There is a widow (Dan), there is a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie at the bookstore and sometimes talks, after Marie has to leave. Day develops something for her, and when something starts to turn into meaningful, we get a turn. Marie is his brother's girlfriend. Regardless of the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes he loves, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not be possible. As far as possible, it forms the rest of the story. Steve Carell works well, Juliette Binoche is as good as Marie. And every other thing is done well. It's a good movie, watch it.
