For a low-budget project, the film was a success. The story is interesting, and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, who now plays on the TV show "Dragnet", is sexy than ever. The locations were ideal for the ganster store, and the director shows his talent taking on many roles for his project. Of course, this budget with a low budget could use better editing editions and more special effects for pistol scenes, but music keeps this scenario moving. Although this film has a part of the problem, such as continuity, I must say that I would rent the next director's film. If you are a student of a movie, you could learn a few things from the editorial comment.
