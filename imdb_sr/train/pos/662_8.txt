An excellent second part that manages to be as good as the first one. Once again, casting is wonderful. I like that the first and second episodes have nothing in common except for wit and wit. The second episode is very funny, very stupid and very pleasant. It's the first Christmas episode about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa Claus after killing her husband. Just like the first episode; Karma. The funniest scene is the connection between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first by deceiving her fear until it becomes a reality.
