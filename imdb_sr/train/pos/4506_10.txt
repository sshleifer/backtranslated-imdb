I want to add praise for the production of this film, especially the brilliant cinema. The light of the fire that shines from the smooth and muscular skin creates stunningly beautiful images. The film was nominated for (and won) an Oscar - the first one awarded for the assembling. A small performance is cumbersome, prodigious and powerful.
