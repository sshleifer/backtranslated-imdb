Vov. A truly fantastic trip movie with tons of super-surrealistic images, dark intentions and black, rather strange feelings about how cartoon-like animals have to see the world. It is filled with a very sweet crowd of characters who fold and stumble across distorted backgrounds. death, dive, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs that scatter. I've never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of the surreal work of the pencil of the American cartoonist; Bill Plimpton. It's a crazy excitement for lovers of strange, beautiful things and it stuck to me for the screen because of the fear that I will not miss something incredible. Simply put, it's 'Hello Kitti' without 'o'.
