A great and precise movie ... McGovern is trying to research and document his writing and pay off. She is not afraid to speak the truth, although she may cause unfavorable criticism and comments from some who like the stories to be clean and sweet and brilliant. Once again, McGovern brings Christopher Ecclestone, though not in a high profile role as he played in Hillsborough. I thought this film was accurate, well-played and well presented, as Hillsborough and I applaud McGovern for his sharp writing. Well done and my hat is for the writer, the actors, the production team. Excellent movie!
