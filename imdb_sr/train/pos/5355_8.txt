A man who runs wickedly scams the modern American media complex and hits his target center. It can be an easy target, but it is still pulling. RM takes effortlessly (including some professional wrestlers as hunters), network television, Nielsen ratings, the US government (suggesting it's already fun), crime and punishment, and six other things. It's far from the original novel by Stephen King, and neither Arnold is Ben Richards. But who cares? It's essentially Arnie Flick, with all well-choreographed action sequences and single lines that such an undertaking requires.
