I picked up this title accidentally with Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of clean Euro-trash films. But this film has a good seal of approval and should get a better transfer than it is there. Nonsense is not ... pleasure! Looking at this movie I could not help but wonder ... how come Sergio Martino did not make this movie? This has his signature on it and interrupted by Edvedge Fenech (unfortunately not so well known as it should be, but she got a nice hint at Hostel II). Double crosses and triple crosses fundamentally cement this film from start to finish with Lee Van Cleef, which cools under the pressure of 1 second. Did this guy have to go to Italy to finally reach his potential, or did the studio system let this guy pass? In addition to Lee's more recognizable films, filmmakers should try this for the sake of greatness and see how Sergio Leone cut his epic scale on one in America for half a time (and 1/4 of the budget). This would turn out to be that. So refreshing, you should take it during the day at home and make it for the couch
