Director Otto Preminger reunited with his Lauren stars Dana Andrevs and Gene Tiernei in this rough and ready to awaken the film noir: Vhere The Sidevalk Ends. This film is completed with a well-written criminal story with interesting characters, unexpected turns, and smart dialogue and a pleasant look with great camera movements and dark and rugged night vision. Dana Andrevs plays Detective Mark Dikon, part of a mobster and part of a policeman, who has a reputation that he is too physically tough with criminals. After one case sees Dicon in search of suspects and answers, it becomes far more involved than he wanted. Dana Andrevs is brilliant in her role - firm and nervous, Andrew's Dikon is ready to overthrow any and all of her if he climbs to his bad side. He's a perfect film anti-hero - not very nice of all time, but we're still working for him. Gene Tiernei does a solid job in her role, no matter how sweet she is to Dickon. Tierney's role may not be too much, but it certainly goes beyond and beyond what others can do with that role, tearing each member of the audience with her kindly smile, gentle manner, and glimmering in her eye. No supporting actors are not bad - Karl Malden is the most impressive, entering and giving good support as lieutenant Thomas. Where the pavement ends is not Laura, but the big noir film is filled with great characters, story and picture.
