A modern, original, romantic story. Very good acting and Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. Ben Chaplin is also as good as a shy, boring clerk. For men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks fantastic and very compassionate. I forgot about what a beautiful woman is. It's not hard to imagine John falling in love with her. Some unexpected turns in the story are good for uncertainty. Although I hoped for a happy ending, the last part of the film for me was a surprise. Conclusion: Good movie. Les Pais-Bas: huit points.
