This film is an accurate copy of the TV series on the Indian television channel doordarshan that was broadcasted at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre" which means balloons. Each episode was a new short story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and "more convincing" Abhai Doel does a good job, but does not fit the role of "normal" and "third grade" (as I myself call it). In fact, Shaian Munshi with short hair and no designer clothes would be fitted with Abhais's role, but Shaian simply has no talent to pull him away. I suggest that I watch the series if it is available. It's the same story, besides running around with your friend's mother and introductory introduction. The acting of television actors was much better than these "stars". The only reason movies were unsuccessful is that the director tried to stretch half an hour (or 45 minutes) of stories at 2+ hours. So he has to come back. Even the nasal singing scenes could not be compensated. These movies are good for lazy Sunday afternoon and are really refreshing if you did not watch the original TV series. Scenario and end of the series were much better ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## ### ### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ############# SPOILERS AHEAD ######### Completion of the original serial bio is much stronger when the hero deprived the girl, even thinking that she was ready to marry him. He is conscious and tells her that he does not want to "repay" him and never helped in that intention. The editor or script writes somehow can not capture the original ending in this movie. The original place would have bought tears for girls and he would have to give his nods a nod. Delivery was wrong. But I personally feel this is a pathetic copy. The director / scriptwriter should not be given credit. The story is incredible and is one of the famous writers of the novel in the PRemchand munshi class. I'm not sure if this is a premchand munshi story, but many other short stories in the series feature several stories about premchand munshi and other great Hindi writers.
