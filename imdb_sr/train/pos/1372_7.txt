"Parti Girl" capitalizes on the huge charm of Parker Posey. In fact, it sometimes seems that the film is a vehicle in which Mrs. Posei allows to play, as it is otherwise in real life. The film directed by Daisy Von Scherler Maier is a treat for the fans of Mrs. Posei. Ms. Von Scherler Maier takes us on a wild trip to Lower Manhattan to show us this wild life whose life is dedicated to parties in various clubs that are constantly visiting. This is a time that was still naive to what the area and neighboring areas of the meat market have become. At least there are no pretensions in movies and we look at the ground people who deal with their lives in the normal way, if we can call it that way. Parker Posei makes an incredible Mary. This is because Parker Posei enjoys the movie more than if another actress played Marie. She's the whole picture. The rest of the actors are good.
