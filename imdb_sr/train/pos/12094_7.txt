Castle of Blood is a good example of quality work in the horror genre that appeared in Italy in the 1960s. The film contains all the right elements - the old dark house, the atmosphere, the decent story, and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most of the movies worth seeing. The story refers to the haunted castle. People have visited, but no one has returned. Our hero bet that he can spend the night in the castle and return to take his winnings. But the night he visits is a special night. It's the night of every year when the dead return to live again. The only flaw I see in the movie is the time of the performance. He almost feels lazy. There is a large part of the first part in which literally nothing happens. Our hero stumbles in the dark and finds nothing interesting. But once he finds something, the movie gets picked up and gets pretty cozy. Castle of Blood is definitely required for Steele's fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror.
