Perhaps I'm biased for handcuffs, stories of cuffs and everything, but I thought this was done wonderful. I'm not trying to ruin myself here too. I think it's important that children see and try to understand. After I read a few comments, I'm a little confused, one says that eventually it appears - the mother and her son, while she talked to her son about her story. The film I saw did not have a mother or a son in the end, just a picture of a girl with a fox. Can someone enlighten me about it? In any case, I really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes may be a bit slow, which might be difficult for children of high energy to sit. It's still worth it if I can sit quietly.
