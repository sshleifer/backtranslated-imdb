I wanted to watch this film with a lot of anxiety and a little hope. I did not think it would have been possible for this film to realize its content. But that was absolutely, and then some. First of all, I have to say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job like John Lennon. Sometimes Harris seemed to channel Lennon. Similarity was often strange, and he clearly studied Lennon's mannerisms and vocal changes. Aiden Kuinn was pretty good as McCartney, who also had a striking similarity with Maccom, although he occasionally traveled through his Scouse accent. It was a pure fantasy, of course, but at times I felt like a voyeur that swooped through the keyhole at this gathering. The scene on the roof was particularly touching, as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard of as a child - that he was worthy and important, and that his parents would never be guilty of leaving him. I also enjoyed the scene in the park where the two danced with the absolute abandonment of the reggae band! shown in the film at this stage of his life. He settled pretty well in his home situation, and he knew he was pretty friendly when he turned to the fans. Only a few years later, he was very friendly when his first killer approached his autograph on the day he was killed. John lived a little longer. I'm sure the Beatles would come back together at some stage. And I'm quite sure that Lennon and McCartney were friends today. Very well, VH1. I'll watch it again and again. <br /> <br />
