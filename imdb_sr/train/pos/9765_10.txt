I saw this cheerful little movie at the age of 10/11 in 1979, when it was broadcast on CBS. I did not know he was in the theater at all. To judge him from the child's point of view, I would give her 4 out of 5 stars, because as a boy at the time I looked a little "girlish". The tingling of daylight from all was a little disturbing at that time, but you are overtaking such things. When I rediscovered the Blockbuster Video in 1995, I had to look it over again! I still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit "old". I do not know where the other reviewer came to the idea that he was not on VHS. It is there. Maybe it was already on DVD, at least I hope it is. I want to share it with my children one day! There's 10 stars here, it's still an excellent movie for kids.
