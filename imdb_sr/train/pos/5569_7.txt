Cheech & Chong's Nekt Movie (1980) was the second movie to be played by Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. Likable smokers are now roommates. They live in a convicted building in search of ways to get more smoke and just lie all day long. But Cheech is "responsible." She has a job and a permanent girlfriend. One day, Cheech wants to find his freak trying to get Chong out of the house. Another problem appears, Cheech's brother "Red" (Cheech's second role) is in town and wants to hang with him. The fact that he could kill two birds with one stone, Cheech pies Chong off and Red. What are the adventures of Chong and Red to enter? Will Cheech get his freaks? How long will Chong be left without smoke? Just watch CHEECH & CHONG NEXT FILM to find out! He gained some experience when he did some unpublished works on UP IN SMOKE. Funny, but not as good as the first movie. But Cheech and Chong fans will enjoy it. Followed by NICE DREAMS. Recommended.
