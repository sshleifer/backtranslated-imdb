When I saw the trailer, I just had to look at the movie. And when I did, I felt that I felt as dissatisfied. It was a great movie, do not misunderstand me, but I think the big parts are already in the trailers, if you catch me. It was very fast and it worked, so it was never boring, and I enjoyed watching it. Humor was absolutely great. My first contact with the slaves (.. and something similar).
