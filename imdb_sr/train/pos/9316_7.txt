Valter Pidgeon is Bralei Mason, a state attorney who takes up the crime in "The Unknown Man," a 1951 film starring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson. A great believer in justice, Pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man, Rudi Valchek (Braselle) charged with murder and frees him. Shortly thereafter, he realizes that the man is guilty and extorted the money to protect his victim as well as other neighborhood sellers. He was informed by the prosecutor (Sullivan) that Rudi was a small change, in order to erase organized crime, the main man must be found. Mason finds a top-notch man and faces a dilemma. The "Unknown Man" is a small, black-and-white film that manages to retain the interest of viewers with its various complications, although the plot is somewhat fictitious. This is actually a story of a good man who is seeking his God, justice, and what he is willing to do to achieve it. And that's the most unusual part of everything. I suppose there was a time before O.J., Menendez brothers, etc., etc., when people believed in the justice and integrity of a lawyer. In any case, these days have passed. Valter Pidgeon works great - his handsome, elegant appearance and declamatory voice shows us a successful, confident man, but also deeply caring. Pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years, but never grew into a superstard. He was a solid actor who could play anything and did. It may be because when he came to lead, he was in the thirties and missed to be a Matinean idol; Or maybe he misses it for sure; or that it was early typed as the second time to a big female star like Greer Garson. It's hard to say. Here he gives a fair and touching performance. Very good movie with good performance.
