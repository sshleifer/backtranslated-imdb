I waited for a long time to watch this movie and finally I managed to see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Perhaps because I expected too much from this film and that's why I was a bit disappointed. I was not the best film from Korea, but it's worth watching. The theme was beautiful and the movie makes you look without you being bored even though it's long. But there are gaps in the movie, and you cross from one point to another. However, the act of Jeon Do-Ieon is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in early cinema history and I do not think this film would be so beautiful that it was not a leading role.
