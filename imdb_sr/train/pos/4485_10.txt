This is my favorite older Tom & Jerry cartoon from the early 40's. The original version with Mamma Tvo Shoes is on the Tom & Jerri Spotlight collection 2, on the disc, and shows a beautiful detailed animation of early cartoons. The gags in this are not all cunning Avery style, but more subtle and directed towards anyone who has ever stayed up late watching scary movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to a creepy radio show, and Jerry decides to play a few tricks to scare him. The nine-year-old gag here is well made, and I do not know how many times I tried to create a vacuum and a leaf that was awesome when I was little. When Tom's owner woke up a mess - Mom was not a maid, it was her house - she was given a big surprise, with a big laugh. Save the break button, it's worth it!
