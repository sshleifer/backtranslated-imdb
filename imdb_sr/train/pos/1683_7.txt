I saw this film because it was the second movie on the disc containing the previously forbidden Video Nostri 'Blood Rites'. As Blood Rites were totally horrible, I really did not expect much from this movie; but in fact, Andi Milligan's garbage manager seems to have surpassed himself this time, for Seeds of Grief are in the style of blood rituals and stand out as more than an adequate piece of sick sixty-one sexploitation. The plot is actually quite similar to blood rituals, as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and of course; It's inheritance. The film was shot in black and white, and the look and impression reminded me of the classic 'The Curious Dr Humpp'. The screen was barely worse, and the director seems sharper to focus on sex, through topics that permeate incest and hatred. The acting is typically rude, but most women appear naked at a certain moment and despite a bad reputation, director Andy Milligan actually seems to have an eye for such things, as many sequences in this movie are actually quite beautiful. The plot is slim, and most of the film is full; but the music is attractive, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes, just as the majority is somewhat erotic. All in all, this is not a great movie; but will probably like the cult fan and gets a much better recommendation from the more famous and less quality 'Blood Rites'.
