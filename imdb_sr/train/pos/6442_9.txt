It's a great Swedish movie .. it was the first Swedish movie I've ever seen .. it's easy and deep .. what a great combination! Michael Nikvist has made an excellent performance as a renowned conductor seeking peace in his hometown. Frida Hallgren was as great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him continue and never give up. The struggle between a conductor and a hypocrite priest who loses a battle with Michael when his wife opposes him and defends Michael's noble goal to help people in his hometown find their peace in music. The only thing I did not like was the end ... it was not so good but it has some deep meaning.
