How can one not love this movie? I think it's a hilarious affair of all the old gangsters; if you have never seen them, look at this instead. Michael Keaton has the ball to be awarded this position. One man every time he speaks English, and Griffin Dunn plays clueless D.A., but my favorite role must be Joe Piscopo. It has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Rai Valston, are in this movie with stars playing the gangsters much more fun than the "mafia" did for the criminal underworld.
