Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. This less-known movie is the place where Cage gives one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low-budget, almost unknown film, but it's one of my favorite films of all time. I discovered that I was walking through the video store and I wanted to see that Cage and Hopper (also great in the movie) appear together. Go on this, and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
