This is a great movie. Reading other reviews, I see that I am not the only one who sheds tears. Tomita's Tamil acted with such skill and conviction, she made her extremely sincere and unforgettable. In the hands of a smaller actress, her last scene would be banal and banal. One would never have thought that this film was made in a limited, limited budget. Cinema is beautiful and there are many actors. The scenario is so beautiful, I see why everyone wanted to be in it. If you are looking at a long and long list of points at the end, you will see that half of Hawaii has gone in for this film to happen, for good reason. Soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood during the whole movie. My only "complaint" is that I almost did not want the film to end.
