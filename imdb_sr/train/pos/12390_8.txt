The bizarre horror film filled with familiar faces, or stolen by Cristina Raines (later TV "Flamingo Road") as pretty but somewhat unstable model with rubber smile who should pay for suicide attempts preserving Gateway to Hell! Scene with Raines modeling are well captured, the music mood is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming Kity as a friend, but when Raines moves in a creepy Brooklin Heights brown stone (blind priest resides on the top floor), things really start to cook. . Neighbors, including Burgess Meredith fantastic vicious and kinky couple Silvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, the devilish lot, and Eli Vallacha is fun as a cunning police detective. The film is certainly cross-examine "Rosemarine Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on the bestselling novel Jeffree Konvitz, "The Sentinel" is a fun spooky, full of shocks that is well-executed film director Michael Winner, who thoughtfully rejected the completion of the skill. *** 1/2 from ****
