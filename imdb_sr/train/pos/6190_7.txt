Fai Grim is a continuation of the story started ten years earlier with Hartley's Henry Fool. I did not see the previous film and I do not know if it's good or not. I can only watch current movies on my own merits. For most people, Hal Halley's style is something you either love or not. His combination of action, drama, absurdity, and dry, ironic humor really responds with me, and Fai Grim is no exception. It broadcasts a sharply-written intelligent parody, which laughs loudly to itself and many at the Melbourne International Film Festival. For the first half of the film he was merciless and delivered without delay. It's a style of humor that is missing in cinemas and a welcome relief for the foolish teen comedy that Hollywood pumps like pancakes. in the international espionage thriller. Whether it was Hartley's intention or whether his idea was out of order is not clear, but I think a bit of editing or rewriting for fifteen minutes without film would keep the original moment of the film. The performances were mostly good, especially Parker Posei and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most time on the screen. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina Lovensohn all played good support. The films were fine (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul), and music (also Hartley) was good without imposing. The film is well written and I enjoyed it. If you like Hartley's earlier work, you will probably like this.
