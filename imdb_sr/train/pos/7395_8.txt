Almost the entire film takes place in a public bath in China. There are no fancy sets, explosions or glamorous people - just fine writing, acting and direction (Hollywood, consider!). The alienated son returns home when he believes his father is dying. He is surprised to see that Dad looks good and will run a family business as usual. In fact, he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really established a close and caring relationship and soon it becomes obvious that he is out of the loop! Dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from a big city and does not see the real value of the old bathroom. How their relationship changes and where the action takes place is extremely and convincing. I was delighted to see that not every Chinese movie action picture (like those in which Jet Li played or the Cute Tiger, hidden) Dragon, because I do not particularly care for these frenetic films. Shower and spring in a small town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese films about PEOPLE!
