Blob is a classic B-film film from the 1950s. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McKueen & Aneta Corsaut) see the meteor hit the ground, and when they go to look for it, you come across an old man with some strange ... stains related to his hand. They take him to the clinic, then go to find out what happened. From there the stain expands, eating everything on its way. Special effects are raw entertainment, as well as a story. There are many great contacts, such as a policeman who plays chess over a radio with a policeman in another district. It's not a masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McKueen is very good. 8/10.
