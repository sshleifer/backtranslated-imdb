Being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies, feeling that they focus only on boxing, and not on the characters themselves, this movie really kicked me. I loved to see the protagonist Diane (Michelle Rodriguez) through so many things in such a short time, which was incredible for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did such a wonderful job playing Diana, especially since she was her first acting experience, she showed real emotions and beautifully portrayed Diana. All actors had chemistry on the screen and made this film even more amazing. I recommend this film even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies. 10/10
