Sixteen years have elapsed since his original performance, I would hope so far that some "marketing sorcerer" has so far promoted the version of this classic live, or at least tried to reissue 65 original episodes. I can not figure out why the sci-fi or cartoon network did not spoil it. Galaki Rangers actually had well-designed plots, and even better scenarios. The animation was above the average quality of the time and is excellent compared to the Japanese animations of today. There was a heavy tie on the market, which may have sealed the ruin. I would like to spend cash on the DVD of GR if possible.
