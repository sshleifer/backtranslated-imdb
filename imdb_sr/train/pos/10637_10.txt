Harem Suare is the best film I saw in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Oops. Sensively captured and stunningly portrayed, Harem Suare is a brave film dealing with an interracial romantic, which is in Hollywood such a taboo. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors populate the film. Cut off from the outside world, women interact with each other by telling stories of intrigues, rivalries and jealousy in their ranks.
