One of the funniest Johns, Eugene Levi is also excellent in this, I just want the studio to realize that this should be on DVD, I have it on a video cassette, but I feel that this movie deserves a DVD (and the additions will be great) Kung Fu Uuniversiti (Kung Fu U) skit is so funny, as the entire movie, and the scene that she has with her girlfriend and her family are great, this movie is never on TV, but losing it most is the joy when it's broadcasting TV, if you can find a video I would suggest you buy it (ebai is a good place to find a copy) I will hold you my VHS until one day we get to see it on DVD. there are so many great movies that have not yet been released on DVD, and this is one of them.
