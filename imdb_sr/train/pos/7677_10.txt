Vov, this film had a huge impact on me. It's an incredible story about a Cambodian girl who is selling sex shop. I can not stop thinking about the fate of a girl named Holly. The film's setting is realistic, the film was an eye opener, I can not imagine anyone's distance from him, wanting to help change this terrible problem that exists. The content of the movie was very mobile. It was one of the best movies I saw this year. The girl who plays Holly is doing a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The movie brought me to tears, telling an important message to be heard around the world. Everyone should see this movie. I think this film will make a difference, I liked it!
