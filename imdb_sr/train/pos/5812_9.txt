Moonwalker is probably not a movie to watch if you're not a fan of Michael Jackson. I'm a big fan and I enjoyed most of the movie, the ending was not fantastic, but the first 50 minutes was - if you're a fan. I personally believe that the first 50 minutes can be viewed multiple times. Dance in every video takes breathtaking, music is fantastic for listening and entertaining dialogue. It includes many of the best Bad Bad Videos and clips from his earlier videos. It also includes some live recordings of the concert. If you are a great fan of Michael Jackson, this is a must, if you are not a fan / do not like Michael Jackson, hold on well. 9/10
