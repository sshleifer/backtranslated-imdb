Have you ever read Jim Thompson? He is a hard-boiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and the misanthropy I've ever encountered. There are rarely private detectives in his work - only losers, psychotics, and little ones. This film is Thompson's handwritten - "If God made real mistakes in this world, it was that she gave us the will to live when we have no excuse for it." Every character in the film balances on the edge of the razor between superficial and creepy realities. There is a slimy, unexpected Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and spooked by the well-known Doc Goldman who plays George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives a wonderful, often heartbreaking performance like Kid Colins, who is not too bright, shy ex-fighter who is more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fai, a sexy femme fatale that we can not quite grasp ... It's not your standard movie noir, nor is it the intention to be. After Dark Mi Sveet, along with The Grifters, there are two great adaptations of the novel by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
