In fact, I like the original, and this film has its ups and downs. Here are just a few: UPS: Most original voice is returned. I know she had a voice in Simpsons, but this performance is simply stupid. Oops: We see Simba as a "teenager." Uphys: Rafiki told Timon about "Hakuna Matata." Songs again. (some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music.) (Timon's solo.) All in all, this is a pretty good movie. I would recommend it to the original fans. But if you do not like the original, chances are you will not like this one. My score: 7/10
