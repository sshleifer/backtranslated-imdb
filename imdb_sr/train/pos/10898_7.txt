This movie is not as bad as I've heard. It was pleasant, fun and I love what's going on around the holiday. It completely loves me for the Christmas store and I'm listening to music for the holidays. When this film comes out on DVD, it will take the place of Christmas holidays in my collection. It will be a movie that will be watched every year after Thanksgiving to bring me to the mood for the best of the year. I heard Ben's character was a bit crazy, but I think that's just adding to the movie and why it's so serious. Take it for what it is, a Christmas comedy with a love twist. I have enjoyed. No, it's not Titanic and it will not make your heart bang with anticipation, but it will lead to a laugh or two. That's why laugh and have fun :)
