My girlfriend and I have something for Robot. I'm trying to look for movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. A large. They beat the whip and struck one another, with the fate of nations that hung in balance. It's really cool. You must forgive this film of its numerous shortcomings and just try to see what the director and his team of technicians were able to put on the screen as they worked with what was obviously a small budget. It's very difficult to refuse this film. Because of those big robots. They looked like Transformers and fought as professional wrestlers! That's why my girl smiled. And that's good enough for me. Special mention must be made of art actor veteran Paul Koslo: as a maniacal Russian criminal, whether he ruthlessly trampled his helpless opponents after they surrendered or complained that their closeness to him in the bar caused his vodka to taste "like blood" (line which he delivers with the accent on a tasty camp), obviously has a ball, and the movie has huge benefits whenever on the screen. This is a wonderful little movie that deserves its cult reputation.
