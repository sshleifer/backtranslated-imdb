At the time in our culture, in which reality is portrayed as narration, outperforms the fiction we know on the small and large screen, "Apart From That" is a movie that exposes the real moments of life that feel more honest, fresh and innovative in those presentations than I've never been video. Common buckwheat conventions do not exist in this film, leaving the audience with the content to sit and watch those moments of real life on the screen. As you watch the film, and even after post-contemplation, it's hard to believe that these incredible performances where they actually do, performances. Every moment with the great actors of the actors felt as if the truth was exposed in their daily everyday lives. Even so, "besides" does not feel like a documentary or as a real television, but rather goes into its category, with its unique cinema and direction. I look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continues with other films by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. This film must be seen.
