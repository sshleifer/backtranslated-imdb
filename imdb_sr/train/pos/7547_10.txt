The cat soup at first glance looks like a very random animated film. The best way to explain is that it's pretty sour. Although this is not entirely accidental. The story is about Niatti, the young boy's cat and his sister Niaako. He is very ill and dies, however, Niatta sees that her soul has been taken away from her soul and that she can recover half. The story is about their quest for Niaako to return completely to life. Although many of the content in this movie seems quite accidental, it's not. Most are the symbolism of life, death and rebirth. You can also see references from other stories, such as Hansel and Gretal. This strange sweet short film has an interesting story full of deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen.
