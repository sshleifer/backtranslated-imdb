George and Kim travel with their young son, Miles, to a remote cabin in the north of New York, when their car strikes a deer and stumbles into a ditch. But what looks like a mere occurrence of an accident marks the start of a frightening journey, where the myth becomes a reality and a spirit that eats meat, half animals and half a man Vendigo, a small city is haunted ... "Vendigo" Larry Fessenden is a film that causes fears that often penetrate in a dark family drama. The characters are well developed and there are some moments that are cold bones. Subtle views of Vendigo are effectively handled and it is never clear what is real and what is conceived, or even if the story takes place entirely in Miles's head. , "Vendigo" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and certainly will not be the last. Give this movie a chance, if you do not mind looking at something unconventional8 of 10.
