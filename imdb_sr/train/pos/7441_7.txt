Personally, I despise Jerry Springer Shov, however, I found that "Ringmaster" is the most amusing film I have seen this year. The endless satira of "guests" Jerry Springer, which begins at the beginning of the scene, keeps you laughing throughout the film. Despite the short scene in which Jerry Springer is trying to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this film for pure entertainment.
