I thought this film was really great, because today in India, everything you see is skin, music and bad acting ... in this movie, you can see some tradition, ethnicity and at least some jurisdiction ... some parts are were a bit dramatic, guess what? That's what the Indian cinema is doing! after watching this movie, at least you do not get the headache of the louder overestimated music, or any kind of violence, it's just the truth, it teaches about love, and of course it cares about the person you love throughout your life ... I think it was an incredible movie ... Children can watch it without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that was once the safe depth of India ... until all these hit hits, mink and leather did not become part of it.
