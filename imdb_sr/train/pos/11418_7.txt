I first watched this film during and on the International Film Studies Study. I am a 'non-traditional' student and, perhaps for reasons that are long or wise, I appreciated the slow, reflective pace of the narration of the film. Tied to the heat and dust of the dry climate, the story is deeply psychological, packed with multilayered symbolism, and an articulated inversion of the theme "The Other" in a country that we do not understand. the understanding that comes is full of unresolved memories and the subjectivity of the outsider. Made almost 20 years ago, it is also the forerunner in the genre of numerous other international films that explore colonial themes in colonized spaces, not knowing the nuances of the cultures they entered. Much richer shots --- and heavily funded - works that have been made since then reflect the same topics: Indochina, Nigde in Africa are not two that in comparison may make Chocolate pale and boring. There is no action of adrenaline or extreme violence. The struggles are mental, emotional and subtle. But, if it is said, it's a fine movie worth watching.
