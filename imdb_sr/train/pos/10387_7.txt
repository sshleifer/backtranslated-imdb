After reading some other comments, I expected something really terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITI CHECK: The original series was not that good. I think that some people remember this with more affection than they deserved, but apart from searching for cars and legs Daisy Duke, the scripts were bad and behaved badly. The guys from Duke were too intelligent and handsome for backwood hicks, the assembled Boss Hog was too jerk to be evil and Rosco was just a hyper through every moment of the screen. It's astonishing that the series lasted for as long as it lasted, because the series was running out of the story line in the first series. Back to the movie. If you watch this movie in its own right, and not as a direct comparison with how you remember TV series, then it's not at all bad. The real star is, of course, General Lee. Auto hunters and acrobats are great and it's really what D.O.H. It's all about. Johnny Knoxville is a common eccentric personality and, along with Sean Willyam Scott as a cousin Bo, this film makes this movie really funny in a hilarious Dumb-And-Dumb form. Wonderful Jessica Simpson like Miss Daisi, Burt Reinolds makes a lot better Boss Hog and M.C. Gainei makes a convincingly unpleasant Rosco P. Coltrane, the way he should have always been. If you do not like jokes and crazy car cassettes, you would not watch this movie anyway because you need to know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want a fun auto-action movie with a few good laughs that are not over-burdened with the brain then go to see this pleasure with an open mind.
