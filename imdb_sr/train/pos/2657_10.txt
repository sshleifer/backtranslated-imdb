"Nothing, there is nothing" in Room 237. But you do not have a job at all "in. So, stay out, you understand? Stay there." There has never been such a venture of psychological horror as this film. This is the most viewed horror film of all, and that's right. Jack Nicholson is an excellent actor and this is one of the biggest performances in the cinema. About the family that moves into an isolated and abandoned hotel for 5 months during the winter. Then Father (Jack) becomes almost obsessed with the horrors at the hotel. Kubrick's direction is nothing but perfect. Tense recordings for tracking, troubled music, mystical messages and a confusing plot make this the best horror movie ever made. Red is used in EVERY scene. Has Kubrick deliberately put it red? Of course !. This is the definitive Kubrick classic and this is his third film that I gave 10/10. He's a perfectionist in his direction and you can see him in all his films. He likes to confuse his observers in each of his films. I'm talking about this film for months to come. It has infinite depth. In conclusion, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. Remek-de terora 10/10
