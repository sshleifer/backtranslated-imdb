It seems that even the director does not like this movie, but for me, I think he's a bit rude to himself. It's certainly not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good enough to interest you. It was photographed in a pretty beautiful village that contributes to the atmosphere. If you like horror movies recorded in England. I just saw the latest movie "The Devil's Chair" that looks amazing. There are not enough English horror movies for me, so everyone who comes deserve our attention, and this is not as bad as you think
