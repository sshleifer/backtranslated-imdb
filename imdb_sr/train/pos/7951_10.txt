This is a really nice and cute movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and cats that were taken to live with someone else, but the animals do not understand and flee and leave to find their own family. Cat is called Sassi and lives by name. Chance is a younger dog who knows a lot about life inside the pound. Shadow is an older and wiser dog that feels things. Put them three together on the adventure and make it a happy and fun time. There are no special effects that move your mouth, so it's not cheerful at all. It's the best animal movie I've ever seen. It's a really good family movie.
