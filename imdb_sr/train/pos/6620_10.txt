If the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this great movie. I just saw him here a few hours ago here in Paris (where the action of the film takes place) and I can still feel the huge trauma I got in my eyes ... What a visual shock! I've never seen such a beautiful black-and-white photo and a drastic change in the way animated films are made. I firmly believe that it will be before and after the "Renaissance," similar to what we saw with Picard films or Akira and GhostInTheShell experiences. This is a real breakthrough in the little world of animated films and I hope that this French initiative (a small unknown French studio with several young people who had a dream called "Renaissance" ...) will receive the success and recognition he deserves. Vive la France!
