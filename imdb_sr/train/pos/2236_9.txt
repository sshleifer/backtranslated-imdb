What I recall most in this film is that it was broadcast on local KTLA television (Ch. 5) during each Christmas season from mid to late 1970s, mainly due to the fact that the true story was played on Christmas Eve. It was always a bit disturbing to see the hell through which this girl passes, like a lone survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this young girl who extracts leeches from the infected leg has left the impression on this young spectator. Not exactly like the Christmas mood I used to see at the time. It's definitely not a Rankin-Bass production.
