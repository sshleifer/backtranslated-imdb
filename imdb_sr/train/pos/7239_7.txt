What a gem of a movie, so good they made a sequel. The film starts very well with a nasty monster eating a few people and having fun at which the two main characters first look Bendan Hughes plays an eccentric Government, a little hint about who this character is , who moved into the city and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house. Damn, we've all seen movies about vampires, we know the format. The movie is visible, but the acting performances are very wooden and they look like I do not want to be in this movie, but maybe it's just part of the decadent ambience. I did not like to finish, but there is a continuation, I must follow it. /> When I watched the movie, I thought Brendan Hughes did not exactly fit that part. Later, I could not stop thinking about him, he somehow exudes a sensational sensuality, so he might have been right for that role. BRANDAN HUGHES Last seen in 'Hitler - the rise of evil' as Lieutenant Guffman. Where is he now?
