I enjoyed this movie. I have not seen Andy Griffith for years and I felt that he perfectly fit this role. I connected him with a comedy, but I'm glad to see that it is versatile. I was not worried that Dottie's "anxiety disorder" may not be literally from a psychiatric textbook. There are zillion something - phobias and neuroses, and they can have a wide range of quantitative and qualitative forms. It is obviously sensitive to extra-sensory powers, as local Indians perceived it, but not any Angles. It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. Although this is considered a light "family movie", it's actually more sophisticated than it seems. Also, Hiram's turn finally came to me as a pleasant surprise and linked all previous actions together in the bundle. It is fun to consider the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
