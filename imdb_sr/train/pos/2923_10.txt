Eddie Murphy really made me laugh at this HBO stand up comedy shovu. Gooni Goo Goo is also fun. I saw it the first time it came out in 1984. So I laughed, I almost fell from the chair. I still think it's very funny. Eddie Murphy, when he was at "Saturdai Night Live," he laughed so much that he was one of the best people to come out of "Saturdai Night Live". "Eddie Murphi Delirious is his best stand up performance next to" Eddie Murphi Rav. "Give" Eddie Murphi Delirious "2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars.
