Pineapple Mr Dvivedi is a great movie. This is definitely the most beautiful and the best since 2003. Dvivedi knows what he can get from MAST Urmila. it's like you've never seen before. One really great effect. along with her is the fine actor Manoj Bajpai, who showed Bollivood what is with Bhikkhu Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) who lives in pre-partition Pakistan. she is from the family house of livin in a small town. She was kidnapped by Muslims as part of a battle with the family of Punjabi. and then follows a series of turns and reversals that urmilin's agreed marriage should arrive in a few days. this movie is really a good movie. The story is solid with an incredible scenario. all performances such as lullets dubei, isha koppikar (in vont ver, but she can play despite jus dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and more. those sets with pre-partition pakistan, costumes, cinema, sound, and the background score add positive points. From the beginning to the end, hold your seat in the front of the room with the question of what is going on? this movie is not worth watching, but it deserves to be part of your movie collection. The ultimate scene is the end of the movie. I would suggest to all those who are not Kabi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai to watch this incredible movie. my rating: 10/10.
