This film is not a slogan, despite its production and its relationship with Trom production. A dark adult story. Exploitation is the subject of sugar cookies, and you are wondering whether the actors did not fall on that topic. A strange movie with tempting visions: Shadows and contrast are prominent. It's definitely worth a look, especially from Warhol fans and stylish decadence. Through all cruelty and corruption, morally, though distorted, can be glittering.
