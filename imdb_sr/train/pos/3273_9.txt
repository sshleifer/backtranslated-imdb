I give her only 9 out of 10, because I have to look at it again, in the current frame of mind in order to have a new perspective. What I recall is an incredible psychological thriller that blinded my brain and my eyes when I watched it. I would watch him every time he appeared on HBO (probably in the 1990s). Maybe I even recorded it, but this video has long since disappeared, I'm sure. I wrote to GreenCine to try to get this title, they are not currently wearing it. I hope to find him in a local video. I recommend you try it if you find it somewhere. That's interesting. If you've enjoyed movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or anything weird and along these lines, try this.
