"Citizen X" witnesses the story of the "Messenger from Rostov", a nickname for the disgusting and perverted Russian serial killer who had lived 52 lives since 1978-92. The film focuses on the detective of the novice (Rea) who has persistently sought for the killer against all the disparities in relation to the non-cooperative bureaucracy in self-condemning and appropriate denial. The HBO product for the so-called, the film offers a solid role, good performances, saves the audience a lot of horrible details, but appears as docudrama without the style of a similar Hollywood menu. The equal and straightforward dramatization of a serious and relatively lesser-known story is more interesting than "Jack Ripper". (B)
