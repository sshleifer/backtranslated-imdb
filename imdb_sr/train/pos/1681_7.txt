"Scorpio tail" has all the elements necessary to make an effective giallo movie. The story is a standard giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) collects a life insurance policy of $ 1 million. The widow goes to Greece for payment, but a series of terrible murders follows. There are many suspects, including a persistent investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and widows. Director Martino holds the story at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also remembered in "Your deputy is a closed room and I only have the key" and "Who saw her died?") Is a stunning heroine. That's one of Martin's best films.
