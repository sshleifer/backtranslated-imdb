I saw this film for the first time as a boy, and recently I bought it on a DVD. His life at the Bureau is related to his family life, which is not all pink. His wife (a great image of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his work, and they even separate for a while; Chip's best friend and fellow agent, Credal (Murrai Hamilton), was killed in a shootout; The son of Chip, Mike, enters the marines during the Second World War. In this, the family continues with courage and dignity. Action sequences are very exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works efficiently. And the music of Mac Steiner speaks all over; loyalty, courage and integrity. This country owes great gratitude to the men and women of the FBI and, also, J. Edgar Hoover. If we look at the kind of alertness of Mr. Hoover, we may have been spared on September 11, the rise of crimes against children and many political politicians that we had to suffer since his death.
