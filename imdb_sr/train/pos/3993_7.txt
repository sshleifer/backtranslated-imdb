"Mother" is a weird, low-budget film that touches at least two unpleasant topics that are not usually explored in cinema: denial of mother's love for her own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third age. The characters are terrible: Mai is a disgusting old lady and I believe it's impossible to feel any sympathy or sadness behind her. She admits she did not like her son and daughter. She twice deceived her husband with an intellectual. She steals the beloved man of her daughter, not to protect her from a man without morals, who does not love him, but only because he feels hurt with him. She tries to organize her life after losing her husband in the worst possible way, destroying her daughter's illusions. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser, who accepts her life as she is. Her brother Bobbi is a man who lost his savings for his wife, who insists on having his shop, is a really terrible job. Darren is an amateur dependent jerk who does not like anyone, not even himself. Playing and heading are great: actors and actors have outstanding performance and the direction is very accurate. I like this film, but I recognize that it is recommended for a very specific audience. My voice is seven. Address (Brazil): "Recomecar" ("Re-Start")
