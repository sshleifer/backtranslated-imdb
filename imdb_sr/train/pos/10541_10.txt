I thought this was a great movie. The theme of the song is sweet! :) In any case, the only thing that bothered me was initially, when everything was supposed to be normal. It was very strange and unrealistic. A big cable company is mostly what I'm talking about. In addition, the film was very creative. I think that all the acting is well done, the actors perfectly resembled the personality of their characters. Everything fits well. It's really a shame that their music is not a sound background. That would be great! Because this is a Canadian movie, and because it's one of my favorite movies, I give this film 10 out of 10!
