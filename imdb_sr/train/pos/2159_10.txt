First, there is NO way of remake can be so good, because Japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such an important role in this film, as explained in the introductory narration. It adds humor to the warmth of this film. There are many different support / personality characters. Each of them has a role in making this film beautiful. This film is full of comedy that is not vulgar anyway as most of today's "brutal comedies". Still, you can still laugh loudly. The reality is, in real life, that you do not have a choice with whom you work or go to school with ... etc. This film truly highlights and shows that natural good in humans can overcome small differences. Not to mention, it's a great backdrop and a lot of humor. This is a story about a dance that actually has a story, and that's a good story. There are several reverse stories that are not unreasonable, but they actually support the main story. A really well-written movie. And the dance is great. I am accidentally a fan of any kind of dance of any kind, for this aspect. However, this film surpasses anyone else with a dance, in the fact that it is a story First and incidentally it is written about dancing in Japanese society. Very recommended. 10 of 10.
