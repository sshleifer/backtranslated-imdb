The weather was not kind to this movie. Once a controversial adaptation of bestseller Jeffrey Convits, now this movie looks like a regular version of your typical spooky-shot. A terrible touch (especially that crazy, above the finale), it's basically a great horror movie for those people who do not care much about that genre. He has an exceptional role in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Vallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Valken, and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive role to convince the audience that this was not your average film filmmakers from the 1970s had a similar idea). I loved to see famous faces, but the story is very stupid, and no matter how high-class film is, it works at the level of your average exploiting film from the '70s (though it's not a bad thing). Still, it's a nice movie, especially for those spectators who enjoy the stars. As usual, Albert Vhitlock's matte job is remarkable. All in all, pretty fun.
