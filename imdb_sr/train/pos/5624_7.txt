I've never been a fan Farrah Favcett ... So far. She was really amazing in this movie. Emotions that she had to go through after taking a shot does not think about it. This was a very difficult movie to watch, the theme is definitely embarrassing and you feel so helpless to just sit and watch that a woman is abused for what seems like eternity. In fact, I felt that the whole thing was blowing out a bit when her friends returned to the house and I did not even understand the conclusion. The director seemed very interested in using the heights in his recordings and liked to use mirrors, I believe he should have paid more attention to the pace in the second half of this work. I'm sure this is a powerful piece of the theater, this film for me, although it was merit, was just short.
