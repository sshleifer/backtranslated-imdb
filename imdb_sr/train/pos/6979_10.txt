This is a true character and drama story at a level that shames most of what we see on TV in a moment. I was impressed from the very beginning. Do not delay if you do not sci-fi (like me ...) This can happen on earth, the fact that in another galaxy, it just makes the show more interesting. no space ships or laser pistols (none yet) So far I've seen it until the e01 e04 and I grabbed myself and wondered what would happen as there are so many options. Actors play roles with passion. Eric stoltz is particularly strong. This show really stands well, it does not matter if you are watching BSG or not, in fact they are quite different. I read some negative reviews from the sci-fi guys who were expecting less drama and more aliens and air guns, etc. But I'd say you ignore them. We hope that they will not succeed after 1 or 2 seasons as they usually work with good performances these days.
