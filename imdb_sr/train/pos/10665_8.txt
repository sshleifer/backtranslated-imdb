As a waiver, I saw a film 5-6 times over the past 15 years, and I just watched a musical this week. It allowed me to judge the film without being crippled by what was or was not in the musical (however, it ruined me when I watched a musical :)) In fact, I believe that Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, together with Kasei. I think her 'Let Me Dance for You' is one of the best parts of the movie, a valuable addition to the musical. The dancers and singers in the film are much superior to the musical, as well as the acting team that is at least 10 times bigger (of course, of course in the movie). Girls, lighting, dance and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected and really delivered. The songs that were in common with the music are better in the film, the new ones are pretty good, and the entire film only gives more than a musical, in my opinion, especially in comparison with a musical with several decorations. One bad thing on the film is obvious cuts between actors who speak, and called singers singing parts for some of the characters, but their dance is flawless, and the ultimate product was more fun than musical.
