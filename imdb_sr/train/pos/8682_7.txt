It's sad to say I disagree with other people in this columbo episode. Death gives me a hand is boring Columbo. After a few times I was bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Rai Milland in their roles, but the story was weaker in this episode than in others. First, Robert Culp plays the character's character Rai Millanda. He hires him to investigate his young beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, to see if she has an affair. In return, Culp's character blackmails his cheating wife, who plans to expose his plan to her husband who destroys his career. From anger, Kulp kills himself by hitting her in the face and putting her body somewhere else. I do not know. Maybe I did not care about this at all. Of course, Columbo brought him in the end. It's just a matter of how.
