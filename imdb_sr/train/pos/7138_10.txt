If John Thav never played "Morse", "Kavanagh", or acted in "The Sweeney" and other productions, he would have been remembered for this wonderful unforgettable performance at Goodnight Mr Tom. Superior supported by the equally enormous performance of his actress (young Nick Robinson in his first role), and unobtrusive performance, this adaptation of the charming novel Michelle Magorian is a convenient monument to his art. When I read this story about an old Norfolk farmer who had to hire a young boy from London before and during Blitz, I found a pretty obvious mistake in the timeline and the merit of the creator of this film to correct this problem error. They must also be praised for not overly sentimentalizing the story, and preventing what can easily be turned into a messy mess. If you save a CD or video library, then this good mood made for TV movie is absolutely mandatory inclusion.
