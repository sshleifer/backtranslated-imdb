This film is moving without sentimentality - meaningless without pretentiousness. It speaks of a simple story about a family in which there is a risk of decay, because the battering of technology and the advancing society make family business all the more unsustainable. The act is wonderful - although none of us Westerners probably heard about these actors, it has long been - they play their characters with sincerity and respect - these are defective characters, each with the main weaknesses, but with so complete humanity and kindness that it is impossible not to deal with the story. We need more of these films - it takes more Western filmmakers to create such films.
