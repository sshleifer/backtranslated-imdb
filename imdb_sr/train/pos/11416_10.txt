A great family movie ... gives a lot to think ... There's nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is perfect. The scenario is excellent - it's so ... really ... such things can happen in everyone's life. And do not forget the acting - that's just great! Just look at Frenki and you'll know what I meant ... This picture is right not to miss !!!
