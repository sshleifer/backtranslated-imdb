I can not understand what the fans of this genre did not like this movie. It was really fun. Special effects were wonderful. I mostly agree with reviews and with IMDB voters, but not this time. I waited for a home video that I thought was another reason I would not enjoy the movie. I think movies with special effects should be viewed on the big screen, but this was not the case again. For me, the movie parses two films that were released at the same time. Blair Vitch and The Mummi. Both films that I thought were terrible. Blair is probably the most prized horror film of all time. Mom was the rules of a bunch of money and it was pure shit. People liked it because of special effects. Movies like Mummy and Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like fun rides. With this analogy, the mummy was the B card for Haunting's E-card.
