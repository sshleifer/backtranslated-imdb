I have been a fan of this film for years and years. Because Teri Hatchers moved to the forefront, I had to download the movie from the shelf and watch it. Why did not the 1991 people see how this film is beautiful? Salli Field and Kevin Kline are out of the phenomenal. Although I have never seen soap operas, this movie kills me every time I watch it. The acting is unquestionable for comedy, and writing is so wise. I recommend that you look at this if you have not already done so. You will see Elizabeth Shue, Vhoopi Goldberg, Terry Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... to mention a few ... everyone gives great performances.
