Hidden Frontier is known for the longest running Star Trek. Although the quality of production is not equal to the production of fans such as Starship Eketer, or Nev Voiages, the hidden boundary is mostly concentrated on the story, and in that sense it really works well. Hidden boundary has no physical sets; Instead, actors are recorded on the green screen, and the backgrounds are entered digitally. One of the greatest achievements of Hidden Borders is the volume of work they have produced. One of the ways this is achieved is the insertion of virtual sets at the time of recording, rather than postproduction. Although this saves a lot of time, it is worth noting that the quality of the recorded material is not as high as it was produced in postproduction, although it still serves its purpose. Although it may not be everyone's tea, the hidden boundary is worth trying, although it might be best if you start watching the third season, because here the manufacturers are really starting to hit the stride.
