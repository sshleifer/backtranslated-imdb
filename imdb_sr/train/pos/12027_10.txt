I've seen it and I like Melissa playing a good role. It was actually convincing. My son-in-law saw him with my sister, and when I mentioned my sister, I forgot that it was based on a true story (I saw it a few years ago). My sister and I were as if it were so, I wondered if anyone knew what was a murder or who was really involved because I wanted to prove it to him. I love life movies, especially those that are true, or only those who teach a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I can not remember where any help would be welcome.
