VIRGIN 40 YEARS (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romney Malco, Set Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Linch, Gerri Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterically funny comedy of the high concept of Andy Stitzer's titular (beautifully playing a long-standing second banana Carell in a truly remarkable comedy show that will surely take him to the A-list), a representative of technology services at the electronics store in Southern California learned of his secret identity by three well-intentioned, but totally untrained colleagues from colleagues (Rudd, Malco and Rogen, each step more fun than the other) who decided to reject their friend regardless of price. What follows is an unexpected but very cordial romance with a lively mother (the amazing Keener who has been having fun here) that led to additional fuel for the fire in Andi. Amazingly good humorous and irresistible romantic comedy; the funniest of "There Something About Mari" with the insightful scripts of the filmmakers Judd Apatov and Carell, which contains some stunning gut-sequences including David Caruso's modestly accurate, homophobic rib cleavage, sending up-a-a-paloosas and demystifying pole war with rampant self-confidence . A true winner and instant classic; the funniest movie of the year.
