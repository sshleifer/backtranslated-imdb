"Slaughter High" is a totally ridiculous twitch on the high school puppy Marty, who is constantly engaged in some jokes. The joke goes wrong and in the end it becomes savagely burned. Five years later, his torturers attend a reunion. Only ten of them, of course, are low, and Marty kills them one by one. British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") leads actors like a heroine (who still dies!). The act is completely terrible, there is no Tension on all grotesque death scenes to satisfy freaks: a male stomach explodes, another woman's victim literally gets an acid bath, a couple having sex in bed, hit by a tractor, one girl is killed Killed wears a decent and pretty creepy a crazy mask, and the environment (a beautiful old castle in England) is really nice. Still, the finale of dreams is extremely pathetic. that "Slaughter High" is a piece of garbage, but I enjoyed it myself. Only for lovers of really bad movements.
