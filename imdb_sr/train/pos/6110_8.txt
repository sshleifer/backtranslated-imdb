Like "Mi Sassi Girl", this film is based on a true story published on the Internet, but it's where the similarities end. The story is mostly about that rebellious guy named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Voo) who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents are hiring a tutor named Su-Van (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes from poor backgrounds, but happened that they were the same year as he did. Add to it some obstacles, martial arts (robbers are always for Ji-Hoone for revenge), a despised, violent girl who loves and follows him, his tendency to drop the lessons, and you can even guess the whole story. Did I mention it's a romantic comedy? This film has some good fighting scenes, excellent visual humor and a lot of courage, thanks to good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Voo, which bring a lot of energy into the story. Romantic elements also work for that. And, I must say, I would want a girl more like Kim Ha Nuel than that girl from "My Sassi Girl" (Personality Bar). He has a little courage, but he is more on a sweet, sweet, good-natured way. The characters are mostly pretty cute (it could be said that he had fewer hills to climb from "Mi Sassi Girl" - the obstacle that the movie deserves), and the film is pretty smart and interesting. . The story, however, failed quite a bit, but about 2/3 times (where somehow moves on a familiar, standard transport, where nothing really happens), but at the end, it raises a little again. All in all, a funny movie. 8/10
