This film is difficult to watch in our fast-paced culture of the 21st century, but it pays for the messages it conveys, mainly the consequences and consequences of technology on society, especially when this technology is used for warfare. /> This film represents a full circle of dehumanization and rehumanization under the influence of the emergence of technology and later the deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a warning against the abuse of technology, but as the circle ends, familiar themes and feelings reappear in order to present self-serving, and not self-destructive ways in which humanity can use technology. Great for the time, picture and sound quality can be a challenge for some, but as a landmark in the history, development and evolution of the sci-fi genre, this is a must. In the end, free will and free choice are restored to mankind as a means of controlling our own destiny, not that we are served by someone else or even just society, which is shaped by world events. Those who are oppressed by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain such, but there is still a gleam of hope and continuity that remains, as this film sets. As for science fiction, one of the greatest common demoninators of this genre is its speculative nature. He asks us questions, what if these events happened in this way and what effect would that have on the society or individuals in it? How would we react? As for the impact, this film projects those speculative sciences that make science fiction unique as they are and prevent us from asking these important questions.
