As far as I know, the real actor who plays the actor has seen his performance and said that this is an outstanding portrait, I would agree with him. This is a fantastic film about a very gifted boy / man with a special part of the body that helps him. Oscar and BAFTA winners, and Golden Globe nominee Daniel Dai-Levis plays Christi Brovna a crippled person with cerebral palsy who spent most of his life on the floor, in wheelchairs and carried by his family. Although she has a special left foot, she can write with her, paint her and keep things with her. He learns to speak later in the film, it's very good for a guy like him. The main role of the Oscars is Oscar 2, and the Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Ms. Brovn and BAFTA as the winner of Raio McAnallia as Mr. Brovna. He was nominated for the Oscar for best director for Jim Sheridan, best writing, screenplay based on material from another medium and best picture, nominated for BAFTA for best film, best make up artist and best-adapted scenario. Daniel Dai-Levis was number 85 on the 100 biggest movie stars, he was number 20 on the 50 greatest British actors, was number 9 on the British Finest Actors, and he was number 15 on the world's greatest actor, and the film was a number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Outstanding!
