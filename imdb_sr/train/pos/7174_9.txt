I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this premier of the film - and I was really glad I did it. As a great film admirer and a lifelong North Californian, I was surprised how many films won by Oscar made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the bay, unlike going to Los Angeles, George Lucas's comments on persistence, community and vision have really echoed me. Hey, if he and all other filmmakers can do it in SF, other artists can. I would recommend this film
