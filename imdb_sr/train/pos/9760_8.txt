I really like memories of this film, as I saw it with two younger sisters when it was theatrally shown in 1977 and I was eight years old. Apparently, it was considered a failure - and is now virtually forgotten (a pan-and-scan videocassette - which has never corrected the image or the ambitious compositions of Panavision is now imprinted). SUBMARINE) and, nevertheless, uneven. Some characters and sequences are exceptional, while others are a bit juvenile and inexperienced. The sadly discarded blue camel (Eeiore) and its blue song are really touchy. The songs of Joe Rapos are mostly beautiful. Definitely worth the curiosity that will probably (unfortunately) fall into complete uncertainty.
