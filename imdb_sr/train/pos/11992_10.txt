Since I remember, I liked planes and flying. Now I'm in a private pilot license and wanting to become a commercial. I can never remember why I was so obsessed with the topic until I came across my old cage's tail in my basement at home and it hit me. My parents bought each tape they had and it was the only show I would watch as a child. I remembered this while I was growing up and I can still quote it today. It's absolutely incredible and I plan to buy DVD soon! It's really great for kids and adults and it's absolutely timeless. I can not get enough from this show.
