I thought Baseketball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! The humorous humor made me laugh to the end, and the fact that Treya and Matt surpassed so much, intensified the comedy of the film. I just bought Baseketball on DVD and it's just one of those movies in which I would never get tired of watching. I have a very short range of attention and I think this movie has so many funny parts to entertain me. Funny quotes are unforgettable and can make me smile for hours if I remember them later. So basically I think Baseketball is a brilliant movie that everyone should see, especially if you are younger I will smile for a long time. Ps Does anyone think it's weird for me to love them both? hehe
