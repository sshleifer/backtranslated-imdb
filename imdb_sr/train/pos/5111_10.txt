Does anyone know the type of truck John T was driving? I look like Ford from the middle to the end of the 70's. This movie is my favorite as my wife. It was the first unforgettable movie we saw as a couple. It got interesting because it is similar to the first truck I drove and I recently found another such. I'd like to get it back, which I have to reminisce about in the movie. And the music was awesome, and the acting was great. Where and who is the lady who showed John's aunt? Also, did John have a duplicate for the scene on the tower when he nearly fell? Also, in which Year Mustang's Debra V drove in this show. It looked like a model from the '60s. Thank you,
