Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy films have very little complications. Instead, they give them a fairly secular situation and just let them be ridiculous! Movies like HELP MATES and BUSI BODIES are the most fun when you see guys working or cleaning the house. Here in DIRTY VORK, most of the films are similar to these other films - Stan and Ollie are chimneys and spend most of the film trying (completely unsuccessfully) to clean the crazy professor. Seeing that Ollie falls through the chimney, the guys make up the house with total disarray and crazy Stanley's behavior all working together to make a very pleasant movie. a really weird backdrop that starts and ends the movie. The professor seems to be a really crazy scientist and works on a formula that will make everything younger. Late in the movie, you see him making a duck duck, and even duckling in an egg! Since he then leaves the guys alone in the room, is it surprise what's going on? Although this backbone was unnecessary, it worked well enough. What was really good was the middle part. Give your boys nothing exciting and you will be amazed by the hilarious results. One of the best movies in the team and almost earning 9.
