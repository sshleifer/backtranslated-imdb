I had this opportunity to see this film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival, where I won the Best Film Award. This film is greatly performed, with a great acting team that works well as an ensemble. My favorite performances were Ioussef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. Also, there are great effects with vertebrates and cockroaches, which I was surprised to learn that this film was made on a small budget. Writer-director Adam Jones, for whom I believe he received the prize for his writing, works perfectly in the direction. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eied will keep you laughing throughout the film. It definitely has to be seen.
