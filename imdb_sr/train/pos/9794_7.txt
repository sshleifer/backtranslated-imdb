I thought that the film could be a bit more complex, perhaps in a psychological sense, but the action and loud acting were superb. Animation was a heavy CG in many scenes, but very good. This is one of Batman's return / forever films, which include Vain's romance and conflicts and dated motives. 007 fans would love this, and the females would be a great theme! Wayne was very well portrayed in this film, and Penkuin returned to his true form without the mutant genes in him this time! I liked Robin not being too used, Tim Drake was just a good computer dumb, a little indigo child or a mind of the future. stars, decent talents and characters were drafted to look like actors. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this movie. I rate this under Phantasma, Return of the Joker, and Batman vs. 7/10
