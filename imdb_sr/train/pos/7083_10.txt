A great addition to every collection. 12 monkeys is a movie that you do not see every day. He has great actors who go with a great story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he plays a role as John McClane holds. Virus kills everything on earth and leaves several hundred stories of survivors not new but a story in a new way. The man (Bruce) was returned back in time to receive information about the virus that destroyed most people. The actors in it were terrible. I must mention Brad Pitt who was hilarious while mental patient James Cole (Bruce) meets in a mental hospital. by the people who made the virus. Animals seen in the world of viruses have made it feel like they are running the world when people are taken to underground facilities. and must see and also have to possess. I highly recommend it. 10/10
