Blade Runner (Deckard is a replicant!), The City of Lost Children (expanded senses or anything that is used and abused and mostly only gives us far less than what we could dream of), and Dark Citi: < br /> This really needs to be added. For some time I've been waiting for an animated film that could affect the film as much as Miyazaki's things have. This is the first. Hmm, scratch the "animated" part of it. I have an intense relationship of love and hate with film-freak, and, hey, if he does not go away, he must be mostly love, is not he? But there are so many sci-fi and noir topics in the movie that are completely immersed that it's just a miracle to watch. These people have done an amazing job!
