A slow or nice story about the American Revolution. Griffith's narratives work much harder than in his earlier historical epics, and his work is fully integrated into action. Lionel Barrimore is a total pig, Neil Hamilton is bad, but it's summery and Carol Dempster is ... well, Carol Dempster is most of what's wrong with Griffith in this period, but does not appear often enough to slow down the pace and drama. Note that trivia for this movie says it originally came in just over 2 hours when it was first published, but that there is no cut that lasts more than 90 minutes. However, the DVD release is presented at slower speeds in seconds, which increases the voltage and returns it to just over two hours. Much better in terms of narration than sound versions, such as THE PATRIOT. Although not exactly in the best Griffith league, such as VAI DOVN EAST and BROKEN BLOSS, it's a great way to spend a few hours.
