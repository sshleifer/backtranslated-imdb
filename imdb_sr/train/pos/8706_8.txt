What happens when average Joe finds out that he has supernatural powers? The premise may sound familiar. The Vatchmen? Unbreakable? However, the Russian sci-fi accent, the Bearer of the Sword, is far from the standard fund. The story revolves around a man named Sasha who, as a boy, was avoided by society, his peers, and his family due to the supernormal power he possesses. When he wants or gives him an anger, the sword comes out of his hand, piercing his own skin. Veri volverinish? Maybe ... but that's not an interesting part of this movie. By avoiding all of his life and driven by rage (and the temperament he has), our "hero" returns to his hometown to turn his life or find the reason for it. The only thing he's encountering here is trouble when he encounters him with the new boyfriend's old flame with blood on the ground. There is revenge and anger. This is the man you do not want to cross, and from this moment the mob and the police are on his tail. She meets a girlfriend and immediately falls in love with her, and she is what it is actually about in the film. The film is very impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones with short but extreme action sequences. This is an art house in its core, nicely captured with such attention to detail in every scene, through terrible sci-fi action. It's that weird porridge that's so interesting to me in this movie. The director's approach to this genre is refreshing by focusing on Sasha's emotional journey, not just an action movie. Do not worry, the action is a lot. However, many of these sequences show only implicit violence with images of terrible consequences. This does not mean that no action is shown. These scenes are here and fantastic (especially the end where we see Sasin's full power freed from despair). The director decides to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on emotional character struggles. This is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre.
