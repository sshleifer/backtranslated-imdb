This film has a strong philosophical ending. But that end makes sense only if you watch a movie from the beginning. The alienation of young people in the late 1960s, from the viewpoint of young men and young women, is obviously the topic of the "Zabriskie point". Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin did not have much acting experience, a fact that actually intensifies the message of the film. Having uninformed actors conveys a sense of realism, as both players are emotionally separated from the turmoil around them. This is not a movie that runs the script. Except for the first ten minutes, it's mostly visual, with stunning cinema. Beautiful naturalistic images look different and perfect in synchronization with the emotional distancing from Mark and Daria. I would replace the thematically weak Pink Floyd music with the more convincing The Doors music. Many scenes scream for "Riders On The Storm". However, this film I like. It's different; this is unique; She is artistic and imaginative. And deserts are wonderful. As the years pass, "Zabriskie Point" looks more and more attractive. It transmits the mood of the late 1960s in America. It's incredibly artistic, in some ways bohemian. And the last eight minutes of the film are philosophically enchanting.
