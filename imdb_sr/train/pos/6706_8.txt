I remember these shows as it became regular watching on Saturday night. Sabrina is a young girl who moves with her aunts who, as it turns out, are witches and she is one of them. So, Sabrina must learn how to control her strength and to use them efficiently. She also has to deal with the school of the evil rival named Libby, her best friend and boy Harvey Kinkle ... The show was fun and fun. She kept Saturday night entertaining for a 10-year-old boy .. and she laughed loudly ... And flirting with "Libi" ....
