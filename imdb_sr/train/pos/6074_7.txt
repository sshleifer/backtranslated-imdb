Laurence Fishburne is a good actor and deserves respect for this, but he is not in the class with the great Shakespeareans such as Olivier and Velles; He's still suffering from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, steals the show completely. Olivia recognized this potential in his production and threw Yaga with someone he knew could play. I did not quite understand the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare's most profound character, but Branagh shows us the depths. It's nice to see the view of Venice.
