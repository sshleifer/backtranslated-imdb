We recorded it when it was broadcast on TV in 1995 and we waited for this year to publish it, because it soon became one of our family favorites. The children are now teenagers and they probably saw her a few thousand times, but they still look at them faithfully with their friends. It is a timeless attraction that extends across all age groups - similar to "Grease". Vanessa Villiams is spectacular. Jason Alexander is a beautiful and beautiful light on his feet. I noticed that other commentators on this site are pretty rough towards him, but our family gives him the best grades. (We loved his 'Giant Step' number.) Marc Kudisch (like Conrad) supplies us with comic relief and wonderful music numbers. And Brigitte Dau (like Ursula) just steals the show. Probably our favorite character in the whole movie. The only disappointment was Chinna Philip's performance Kim. Part of this has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. By complicating this, Philip's delivery is straight, inconceivable, incredible and simply terrible. The director was supposed to see and correct it. Or she never leaves. All in all, the picture is beautiful and I recommend it to families of all ages.
