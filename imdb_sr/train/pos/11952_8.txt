Scoop *** van **** Voodi Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I enjoyed the Match Point. It was an excellent dark, romantic thriller that did not happily play Voodie Allen. It was also beautiful Scarlett Johansson. "Scoop" is the latest film by Voody Allen and although it appears in this, it's okay. Also, Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfectly together. Joe heard a spoon while he was on a ship with a fierce reappear and a bunch of other souls that Zetelac took. One of these souls is Secretary Peter Liman (Hugh Jackman). She tells Joe that Peter may be a serial killer wandering in the streets of England. Joe, with a spoon of life, returns to the living and gives this information to Sondra, during a magic act. Sondra is on some magic show with magician Sid Vaterman (Voody Allen). She becomes a volunteer to go to a box that disappears and while in the box, she gets Joe's visit. Not knowing what to do, she seeks help from Sid Votheren to help her resolve the case. This film has a nice feeling compared to "Match Point" and still everything works. Johansson and Allen work perfectly together. Allen's humor is perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is as good as Peter Laiman, the "suspect" serial killer. This is a fun little movie to see if you ever look for someone to watch. The ensemble of actors works well together and the story runs and sometimes forget that your viewing of Voody Allen is alone. I say, give him a chance because you may like that.
