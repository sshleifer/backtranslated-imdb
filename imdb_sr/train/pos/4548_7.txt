At that time, "My Left Foot" was a small movie that he could. He was very popular, and everyone welcomed the fact that such a small, independent film could reach the Oscars. Since then, movies like "We Left Foot" are dozens, so in retrospect it can be difficult to figure out what it is about. This is certainly a well-made and competent film, but it is clear that most of his success lies on the shoulders of Daniele Dai-Levis, who plunges into the role of Cristi Brovn, a man who lives with cerebral palsy. Dai-Levis extracts the same nonsense that Dustin Hoffman won a year earlier for playing a man with autism in the Rain Man, and the Academy followed by giving Dai-Levis the same honor. > The only thing that separates this movie from a large budget Hollywood production is precisely that - its budget. In each other, it is the same as any standard product. That does not mean it's not a good movie, but it's not a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating:
