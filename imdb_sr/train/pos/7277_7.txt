This is a strange film about an archaeologist who studies the culture of ancient Hohokam Indians. She pulls out a mummy (really fake) from the cave for a funeral and brings her home to study. She starts behaving strangely soon and talks to this mummy. Soon after, her son becomes obsessed with the spirit of the mummy. Even strange events are happening as the spirit tries to destroy the family of a woman. This is actually REAL BORING, in general, and it will make you fall asleep the first few times when you try to watch it. But if you stick to that, you can come to an end. Ahah! What is the mummy secret? Is the spirit of the mummy angry that it is removed from the cave? You may not be able to determine what is the motivation of the spirit, but if you love spooky wanderers in low-budget (and 70's hairstyles!) This will have a certain consolation appeal. The way I described the story is much clearer than the cramped, boring way the film exposes to the story. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well ... somehow it does. Maybe this is a good movie in the heart, but done in a pretty awkward way. I do not know. What I know is that I enjoyed it, despite her drowsiness. The fans of "Spider Babes" will be interested to know that in this movie, several music characters from that movie are used. (including an instrumental version of the theme song). With one scary and pretty well made sequence that shows the possessed stone boulders and stones rolling around and eventually attacking some people in the campsite. Other scenes in the film are just scary or weird; but this scene is actually pretty scary. Take this! It's weird and worth your time. Maybe you even want one on the shelf.
