This is one of the most watched gems Hollivood has ever produced. - Young British fighter from II. For some reason, a man who should surely be dead leaves the wreck and eventually finds out that he was supposed to come to heaven. When a messenger is sent to ask the pilot to follow him in the sky, a man refuses and demands that the "day in the courtroom" be quarreled. The man claims that his situation changed during the last moments of his earthly life, that he fell in love, and therefore became a different person, the one who deserved the chance to live. "Heaven's Court" is a movie pleasure! "Announcement of the peer jury" is definitely highlighted. The story, no matter how fantastic it looks, is attractive and will keep you in the eye for almost 2 hours of playing. The final scene is simply beautiful and for most viewers will require "treatment for Kleenek". This movie is in my personal top 10 favorite direction, it has my biggest recommendation!
