This is one of the best comedy ever! Writing this parody of soap is brilliant and acting, so just look at the names of the actors and you'll understand why it's so great. If you are a fan of Kevin Kline, he (as always) is a fantastic show, and Robert Dovnei Jr is perfect. If you do not laugh while watching this movie, you have no sense of humor.
