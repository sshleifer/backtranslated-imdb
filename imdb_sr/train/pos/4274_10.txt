I love this movie very much, but the fact is that you can not understand it, unless you are from the former Yugoslavia. Most actors are now dead and they were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this film is now on Divko and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. All of this was former Yugoslavia, a pot of Balkan peoples. It could be a dream land, if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists would not poison the minds of their nation with their sick ideas.
