Ok, basically this is a cinema movie cinema movie, but from the very beginning it's obvious that it was focused with a lot of intelligence. You can list about 10 clich√©s to which the movie comes, but only three of them, and a couple of them have a turn that allows them to know once again that the director did not assume you are an idiot. The acting of Kurt Russell is truly wonderful and brings the depth of the character who is surprising and rewarded. It's recommended if you just saw something really stupid, and you want to restore your faith!
