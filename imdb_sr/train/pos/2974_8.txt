This film is a great pace, you never have to wait for laughter in the stomach to appear for more than one minute and that much more is happening than the initial premise of the film. In all this, there are mockery of the traditional genre of local boys-good-overcoming-disagreements, which parodies this. Do not let someone tell you to try to cheat cheaply with the help of deceit - I'm sure there is a lot of things, but it's all contextual and not unnecessary. I loved this film and it cost me only 2.99 pounds on DVD, so in terms of fun value for money it was the best movie I saw this year.
