As each of us sufficiently knows, South Africa has long suffered from the vicious racist oppression of apartheid, which has completely subjugated the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was killed in jail. After the murder, reporter Donald Voods tried to send a message to Bika in the world. accusations. When Voods tries to expand Biko's word, he and his family begin to live under threat of attack, and are finally forced to leave the country. The last scene shows that the police shoot at the demonstrators. As one of the two films (along with A World Apart) that helped launch an anti-apartheid movement, "Cri Freedom" stands out as perhaps the best for everyone involved.
