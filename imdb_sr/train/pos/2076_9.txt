Good Earth is a great movie !!! Everyone has to see ... It's a tear and a strong heart. It encourages the formation of values ​​of persistence, humility and love for the family ... The story can be linked to our present life, especially as poverty is at the doorstep. The way we respond to such a problem is very important, and if a person is not strong enough to face such a problem, it can be left helpless and useless. I am very pleased that the characters justified their roles even to young actors ... Their emotions were fascinated by the audience. The film may have been made in black and white, but the story is so fascinating that you do not want to finish. That's really great! A new movie for this very beautiful film should be made.
