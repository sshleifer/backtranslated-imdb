My name is Heather and I'm a girl whose story is based on this movie. I want to thank all of you who saw this film and enjoyed it. as rough and rude as some of the things that were shown in this movie, it did not even approach the description of how bad things were. not to mention everything that affected my mother and my little sister. thank you once again for the great comments that everyone had, I really appreciate them. Hello everyone! This is Heather's Mom. It's hard to believe that many years have passed since this film was made. It's even harder to believe that people watched him a year ago. For each of you who went through the same or similar situation, please know that there are people here in the cyberspace who fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each of you.
