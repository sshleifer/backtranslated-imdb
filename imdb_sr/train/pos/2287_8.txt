This film surprised me pleasantly. It has a touching, slightly extra-central approach that never loses its attention. This is a movie I have not heard, but if you want a "sleeper", that's it. Excellent writing, production and acting. I recommend it to an audience that wants something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Sheril Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why is not this movie made?
