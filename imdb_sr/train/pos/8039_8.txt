Sniper gives a new meaning to war movies. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II, many shots, everyone dying, bam bam. "Sniper" leads the war to a new level or sophistication. The film certainly transmits all the emotions that aim - the helplessness of people in the jungle, hatred and possibly trust between Beckett and Miller and the haste of the moment when they pull the trigger. The seemingly low-budget film compensates for every defect with action, uncertainty and excitement, because when it comes to it, it's just one shot, one murder.
