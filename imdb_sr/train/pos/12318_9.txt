Although I am not the fan of martial arts movies, when the film is right for fantasy, not for fighting, I get much more fun and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastic planning and crazy flying shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has created an enchanting treat with fine performance and many ethereal beauty. The great, tragic Leslie Cheung plays the hero of a tax collector who stays in the night in a fake temple and intertwines with the stunning spirit of the fox and the tantalizing taoist. The Cheungs performance is full of naive but dignified charm, and Vu Ma is pleased on the wall as a Taoist monk, who shows some fencing and even gets a musical number. Perhaps it's best that Joei Wang is a fascinating ghost, it's really a pleasure to watch with every movement and gesture that entrancingly seductive. The movie takes on elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all mixing it into a constant entertainment package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and handling choreography gives some great pleasures in the wire, and the film fills fogs, shadows and creepy fascinating forest colors, giving each forest scene a wonderfully enchanting atmosphere. Significant and elaborate hairstyles and gorgeous dresses of female characters, with, if I'm not mistaken, Joei Wang's sporty hair that sometimes acts like a cuff, is a wonderful touch. Although the film has a relatively small action, and some maybe badly advised dog songs from time to time, this is a wonderful piece of fun, with great characters and complications, even an unusual neat character, almost constant supply of visual delights and an abundant dreamy atmosphere. . Essential gentle, highly recommended.
