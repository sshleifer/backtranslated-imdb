I watch the series as fast as possible. I'm trying to watch all Star Trek. This is the third month and now I'm on the third season of the TNG and I've already gone through the DS9 as a whole. Star Trek is the biggest television phenomenon ever achieved. "Gray" is the first episode of the series of TNGs. After watching the shows, these clips were fresh, but I noticed that several of them were re-recorded because the film looked better. The first season always seemed really dark and ugly - the actors looked stupid, as if they did not fit into their own skin. and the saddest moments in Riker's life on the Enterprise to this point. The Scene Data and Riker in the Holo Deck is a classic moment of a new friendship. My second favorite is when another officer on the Klingon boat disputes Riker's authority while the first officer and Riker won the CRAP live from that Klingon. Then the admiral hit his $ a but good. The whole episode of this episode is a reminder that many crazy, great things happened in only 2 seasons with 5 more and a few more films! At this point in the series, they are really starting to develop emotions that link Riker with Dean Troy as Imzadi. Until that moment they mentioned the fact, but they still did not use it. Let the records show that ST Viki - Memori Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and signifies that she had intimate relationships with Riker and that she remains deeply near emotional. This episode further proves that a romantic interest will be strained for each other for a long time. Here's an article: http: //memori-alpha.org/en/viki/Imzadi Bi This point in the series, the value of production is up to speed and Star Trek LPG has found itself in the science-fiction behemoth that is destined to become. Looking back on this as an adult, now I see the great actors of the Star Trek Universe. It really needs to make a new ST shov after all the current shows. The DS9 would also be good.
