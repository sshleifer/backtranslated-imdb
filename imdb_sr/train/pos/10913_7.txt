Villiam Povell is a doctor dealing with the murder and former husband at Ek-Mrs Bradford, also starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. Povell seems to have had chemistry that led him to any woman he was with. Although he and Mirna Loi were the perfect couple for the film, the actor made several other films such as "Thin Man", one with Ginger Rogers and one with Arthur, very well. Somewhere never tired of seeing Paul as a witty professional who is unscathed and "former Mrs. Bradford" is no exception. The former lady. B, Mr. B served with a court order for the return of alimony, and then returned to help him solve the mystery that he was entangled in. And this is not the first time that she did it! It almost seems like there was a "Bradford" film before this film, or that it should have been the first in a series of films - Mr. B complains that the former secretary-writer constantly brings him to the cases. This time, a jockey that drives a favorite horse in a raise, mysteriously falls off a horse and dies right before the target. The solution of the case is somehow unusual, but it does not matter. The point is a joke between the pair and the interference of the former lady. B. Jean Arthur is pretty glamorous in his role and very funny. However, with an actor as smart as Arthur, humor seems to be deliberate rather than perom. I suppose the writer had something else in mind - for example, the crippled side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur hears that the police arrived, she says, "Ah, that's probably because of my alimony. I waited for the police to take her hand in it," that is more a reper to Povell than a serious statement. She still works well, and she shows how a good actress can do her part. It's definitely worth watching, like Villiam Povell and Jean Arthur have always been.
