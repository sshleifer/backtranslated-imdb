In this story there is not much that is happening - only two men who use very different ways of remembering Vietnam. But what is lacking in the premise, it more than compensates for acting and realism. It's a quiet film about the relationship of friendship and common experience. We even get romantic (not unreasonable - just another very real part of this story). Good to see.
