It seems that an ultra-modern house in a rich neighborhood causes each of its inhabitants bizarre (and deadly) behavior. Or at least that's what Lara Flinn Boile, Col. Kennedy claims. After a series of deadly events in a huge neighborhood house, Cole knows he has something to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also plays a mysterious architect. My opinion: The House Nekt Door works because of Lara Flinn Boile and the location (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boile is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention absolutely stunning. It brings credibility to its character and makes the film intriguing. Without it, it would not work. "It's so alive" promises a potential buyer in relation to the house. Yes, he's alive. But the story itself is not so much. If Boile does not appear, there is not much, as a huge amount of film is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect the current owners. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway. Cinema gives the film a polished look. 8/10 due to Boyle, premise of an evil ultra-modern house, location and cinema, and set up decorations and wardrobes.
