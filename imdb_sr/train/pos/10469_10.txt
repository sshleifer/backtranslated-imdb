I remember seeing promotions for this show before it appeared in 1993. At that time I was 8 years old, and now, at the age of 22, I feel strange to see the beginning and the end of this cult performance and to look back at it. suddenly it seems so far, what a big decade. In any case, I have constantly watched MonsterVision, because I am a big fan of monsters and horror films. It was like the version of the 90's Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get DVDs, why not Joe Bob's shov, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Many Joe Bob's comments and movie information were just hilarious. Most of the movies that were featured on the show were B or C grade, but they showed many A home movies as well as Hammer films from England that are top-notch, as well as many with stop motion superstition Rai Harrihausen. Many were marvelous moves that you would not see anywhere else, such as Japanese science fiction films, of course, of course Godzille, which is known to almost all independent films such as Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new Decade of Preserving Film and Independent Directors, I think MonsterVision would be a good show for the IFC, as they already have a hit with the IFC Grind House show. I'm sure this shov will be re-buried for nostalgic reasons, I guess they will have to wait and see. Until then, "Great Television"!
