Since I've been a father since the time of Robotech, I can still say Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time. Taking into account when it's made, the animation is of the highest quality. There are no loops and sequences in which art decreases in quality. Although the final episode is in black and white, it does not diminish the pleasure of watching the movie. Although described as "dull", it should be kept in mind that women do not react in the same way as men do. Since the main character is female, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily resort to a "macho-tactical" tactic to gain respect for her peers. Seiriuu for Noriko, by chance, also plays Akane at Ranma 1/2. Noriko is a three-dimensional cartoon that can get; her personality depicts the essence of a witty girl who at first glance seems completely helpless, but ultimately thrives through the power of her will. The only complaint I have is that the soft looks like bears. Even Gunbuster uses a pretty suspicious "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than wrapping the machine with a huge velvet dress around itself in the true Dracula style). I doubt that this scene should have been funny, but it broke me. All in all, I would rank Gunbusters in the top 20 anime of all time.
