I recently started watching this show, and I must say that it really made me laugh. You must appreciate the unrealistic aspects, like everything else. Some other people said that this show should have a more realistic reaction to the dead, among other things. If you accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept that others are completely crazy parts of the show. I could not calm down after every episode I watched. I really think it's great to have a show that can take a very weird topic and it's really great to watch. I absolutely love the narration, I think it adds a little more wonders to the whole show. You can not always compare old writer's ideas with his new one, you must take it all as your own entity. Definitely give him a chance, and just enjoy the funny things they are.
