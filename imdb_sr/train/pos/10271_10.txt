This film should not be compared to the film "The Sting" or other films about the game caper / heist / con. What makes him so great film experience is what he has to say about connections, deceit, and trust. It's also a pretty slashing criticism of psychiatry, since the female protagonist is a psychiatrist who is so easily deceived and then works in such a primitive way in the final. Is it a g. Mamet had an unhappy experience in therapy? Very recommended!
