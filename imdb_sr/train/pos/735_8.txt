Wonderful cult film from 1979 in which Vince Lombardi High School students face a new, dictatorial director named Miss Togar (Mari Voronov). He is a music hacker and blames the student's musical tastes for their misdemeanors. It is headed by Riff Randell (PJ Soles), a Ramones fan, who more than anything wants the rock group to record their songs. Now * this * is an impossible film to resist. In the first place, the soundtrack is incredible, with the songs of such artists as Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground next to the addictive non-stop range of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena's Punk Rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just some of them. Then, the actor really gives him everything, and Soles is an ideal choice for the role of Rifa; She is a real pleasure. Vincent Van Patten and Dei Ioung are serious as Tom and Kate, Voron is well-thrown against the guy as a snoot and disdainful Togar, Clint Howard has one of his best parts as an entrepreneur who occupies the Eaglebauer bathroom, and Nev Vorld regulars like Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (especially fun as music teacher McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun as always. And of course, it's a pleasure to see yourself playing Ramones. The film has a true spirit. The energy level is high, and the author and director Allan Arkush brings a lot of attention to the process. There is a great sense of humor. A paper plane plane is a great example of this. This extends the right to "delete" the scene transition. There are even hilarious giant mice that create future effects of make-up, Rob Robin, in one of his earliest performances. Around the movie film that is defending from the right to a fun get. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is simply a beautiful cult film. 8/10
