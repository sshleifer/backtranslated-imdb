This film is one of those familiar to him. It's earthy, grounded and a movie that will tell you to think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey that you will not forget. Soundtrack is beautifully diverse and fitted; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. It certainly deserves recognition for both film and actors! Finally, the artwork deviates from the obvious love story and the frequent special effects seen today. I've never come out of a movie with such a deep warmth and a sense of reflection in my heart; because it felt as if somebody had just wrapped it in a soft flea. To see this movie is to find the real treasure and enjoyment in it.
