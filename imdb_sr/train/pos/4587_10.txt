Although John Voo claims Boiled is my number one favorite movie. But I must say that the police story is my favorite movie. I say this because the stunts, fighting and action are my favorite part of the movie when Jackie Chan jumps from the fence at the top of the escort in the shopping center, grabs the pillar surrounded by Chrismas lights and slides down the slope through the shaft and finally land on the back on the hard marble floor. OUCH! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something at $ 14.) VHS a new line of home video. For any questions or comments, feel free to respond. (I'm only 14, but I know where you can find any movie ever made.) If you are looking for everywhere for a movie and you can not find it, please respond to me. Thank you and good night!
