Can I be simple and primitive in my estimation to simply say "I loved"? It's reasonably funny, it has great stars and it's great to watch. The songs (there are about two that are then repeated) are forgetful, but they receive a healthy ironic treatment (as the scaryly handsome Mr. Fairbanks exploded into the frenzied Vagnerian version of the tender ballade just brought by Mrs. Grable); there is not much dance with all the crinolines in 1861 around Miss Grable, and the comedy may be a little heavy, but the result is still very exciting. The photo (including true open-air shots that are exciting) is incredible, playing with different shades of lush gold. Miss Grable has gone a bit on a plumpish side, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental "olde-vorld" comedy. It's pretty wide along the line "Down to Earth" with Rita Haivorth, which is that many do not like it anymore. I suppose a few people would consider that "This Lady in Ermin" is outdated and choked. But it's a fairy tale, and they are, in any case, moving in a certain trap. My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, the costumes, the witty scenario and everything that this movie has to offer, and stop complaining. The film was released on DVD in Germany, along with German and English soundtrack.
