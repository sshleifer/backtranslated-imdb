It's a great thriller from Turkey that can make sense. An excellent job from Brothers Gokbakar. First of all, I want to show the game on the screen. but GEN has the best shots to say "perfect." And also transitional parts are really great. On the other hand, "Gen" has a great theme that affects everything. who wants to be a psychiatrist in a sanatorium, has a mother who is a common craze. The main causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing you need to do is combine all indications. Doga Rutkai and Sahan Gokbakar played an impressive aggression. This performance can be more realistic than "Irreversible (Monica Bellucci)". you will be confused "
