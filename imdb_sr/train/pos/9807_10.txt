I remember this series so well. She was great - so powerful and striking characters, stylish and sexy ... and so different from anything else at that time - and now ... I'm sure she inspired the excellent Canadian drama "Traders". Season 1 and Season 2 are available on DVD Region 2 in the UK. This is a treat to look at the series again. Season 1 is 13 episodes, and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes. Unfortunately, it seems to have ended after 2 seasons. This series was very fun. Sometimes you can get it on the special site Amazon.co.uk
