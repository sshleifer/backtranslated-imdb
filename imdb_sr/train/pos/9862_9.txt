I finally had to see the infamous "Ice Age". Except that he may not be as funny as I had hoped, after seeing a brilliant teaser, I can not say a bad word about it. Of course, it's not as glamorous as Disney's production (in addition, it's Fok's first attempt at CG film at full length), but it has a huge heart in some cases (like a look in Manfred's eyes after seeing a sad look at his past) I found myself on the verge of tears. But when they reconnected the baby with her father, I could no longer keep them. A movie that does not have a problem with walking on a thin line of skis and clich√©s and manages to perform more than the best of it; The ultimate result is one of the most moving animated creations I've ever seen. The great characters of the funny looks that are growing fast on you (and excellent voice talents, as well) and many funny unforgettable scenes, especially from Scrat's name, make the movie more than sufficient reason to launch it. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my favorite funny scene from 2002. Honestly, I do not understand, but for some reason it seems that CG animation will take advantage of the future. But if that just means there will be more films like this (and who can forget Picard creations), then I do not mind, at least for now. 9/10
