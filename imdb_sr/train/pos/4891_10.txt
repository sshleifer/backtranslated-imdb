A great concept, great actor, and what a shame it was that there was no more time to tell the story. I loved it and I wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, now there are some real women! However, only Dench and her character had enough substances to carry the script at some of her smaller moments. I have it on the tape and I will continue to watch it, hoping that in the end there is a trace that suggests there will be a continuation. The highest drawer! - Do not question! - No arguments! <br /> <br />
