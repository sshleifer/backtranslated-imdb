The title of this movie almost did not look at me. Not like the Manchester United fan, the mere mention of Beckham was a bit unusual, but I put my prejudices behind and I'm glad that I did it. , but I was pleasantly surprised. The film accelerated along with me, and I never watched the clock and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you like the East is East, then you will like this movie. OK, so the story is nothing new, and classic stories are contained in the movie, but everything is done very fun and with the breath of fresh air. The movie moves very fast and holds the party. Occasional funny moments are a good laugh, not a bad attempt at humor, and best of all, it's a good British comedy.
