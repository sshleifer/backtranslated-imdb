I was the Star Trek fan until I remember. When they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series, I was very excited. The Enterprise Premiere was worth the wait. This was done well with the perfect environment and the excellent acting of all the characters. NKS-01, Enterprise is the perfect container for showing the beginnings of what many people have loved. Jolene Blalock gave a command performance like Subcommander T'Pol. These are just two people of this wonderful new team that bravely leads us in the great history of the Starfleet. . Watch.
