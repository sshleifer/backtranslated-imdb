This film is, in short, a film masterpiece. The movie is brilliantly powered by intense images that deeply trigger a sensitive viewer. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War while a group of children seeks revenge on another child. In fact, they act in their world version of what they saw in the adult world around them. Later, we meet again with three children as adults in the sanatorium. Here we see what life has done on each of them. One is a closed sexually suppressed patient. The other man is a cheater who got sick. The third child, a young lady, became a nun and served in a sanatorium. This film is an allegory of the effect of violence on the psyche. This film has a climax which is definitely not for the stinging members of the audience, but it is logical and deep. The game is great and the script is well written. There is a music score that provides an underrated fear in this movie. This is not a movie for excitement seekers, but a movie for a cautious audience.
