everything that was done in the first season was really incredible. the first look you get from Mac and Zach is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or as if I call them minis. Minis works best acting I've ever seen. main actors and actresses, i.e. Jessica Alba Michael Veatherli, etc., make you forget to watch the fictitious so-called. show that this show seems to be reviving. All in all, this is the best shov I've ever seen
