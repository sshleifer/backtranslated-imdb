This early Sirk melodrama, shot in black and white, is a smaller film, but still shows the spirit of the German director in improving tired stories in something similar to art. Built in the 1910s, Barbara Stanvick is a woman who has sinned leaving her husband and family from a small town for bait in Chicago's stage. She never fulfilled her ambitions and was returned to the city that left her daughter eager to write that she liked the theater (that is, high school). In her old town she faces a small mind again, and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter, a confused (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and a former lover. The action is nothing new, but Sirk stands out, creating meaningful compositions, with every shot carefully captured, and he is immensely assisted by Stanvick becoming his main lady. It starts a sharp 76 minutes, and that's just as good, because the material does not have much leg to go on.
