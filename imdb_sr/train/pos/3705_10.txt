I do not understand the low 5.7 score on this movie. It is a pleasure for people who love strong uncertainty and a dark atmosphere. The tone reminds of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, to the site (Savannah). The acting is strong, and I was amazed at the credibility of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is effective in a small part, and Embeth Davitz is BOMB. Great and absolutely hopes for her scene. The plot is quite standard but effectively implemented.
