That's great! In Story Mode, you go from punk to pro. You must fulfill goals that include sliding, driving, and walking. Create your own slider and give it a name, and you can make it stupid or realistic. You are with your friend Eric during the whole game until you are betrayed and you are prompted to kick out of the skateboard team (you can select the team that will be on) and then run your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan, and even School II (although not part of the story), from Tony Havk Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret sliders like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another slider. You can create your goals such as SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and more. You can create a pedestrian and write what they say. If you're bored to do it, you can make too many goals in parks. The only thing I did not like in this game was that it was sometimes difficult to drive cars. 9/10.
