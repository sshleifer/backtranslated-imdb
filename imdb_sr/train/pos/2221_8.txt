One night I came across this at the Bravo satellite station. Initially, out of curiosity, I decided to watch her. To be honest, I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful and her body is well displayed. he would be wasted like a executioner, but obviously not after watching the whole movie! The only real offense is the acting of auxiliary actors, especially the actor playing Melnik. Christ is bad! Prison Guard Hank is also poor. they get drunk and try to pass with their guard Vanda, but fortunately for us, the viewer and for Hank he descends and clings to Vanda at the end. The music used is quite tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for executions. This film was looking good for a pretty, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
