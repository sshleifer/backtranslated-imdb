I really love this movie. I remember when I was in the second grade, the teacher showed us this on a 16mm film. This film, however, may be a bit daunting for second-class students, such as the scene Bill kills Nancy and first sees Fagin's face on the screen. One of my cousins ​​is sick of watching this movie because she learned about it in the class of music. If I were a teacher and if I could evaluate the people who produced this wonderful movie, I would give them A +.
