I have to start saying that it's been a long time since I saw it, but I've seen it 5 or more times; a beautiful little romp that is obviously inspired by the music / comedy pairs of new or faded stars with prominent music groups. Kai Kisera's mysteries would be a good example. When Spike Jones released, the best part of the show, as he and his band play many tunes and are part of the action, are well performing job support. Hugh O'Brien plays his face, Buddy Hackett, rumors of a piece offered to Lou Costell, and Abbott and Costello replace tracks. I do not know if that's true. All in all, a nice movie, but it's important to have so much Spike Jones and his band in a movie for history. I would like it to be published, because in two decades I have not seen or heard of him. I hope it's not lost
