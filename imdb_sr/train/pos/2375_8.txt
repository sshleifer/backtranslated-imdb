I honestly think that was the best version of the war of the world that I saw. It was funny, but it was also educational, I learned the whole movie and if I could take it. My favorite part was when the soldiers died on the robot, and the other came right behind him. in the last film war in the world, I think it should have been more like the first and that it would be better. but in any way I give this movie 2 thumbs up. And if they where to make another movie like this, I'll definitely watch it. Thank you
