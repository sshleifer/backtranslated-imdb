Lost has something interesting for everyone. You can say terribly much about this series, and much has been said, so I will no longer be the one who will print you all. Just read the people who loved it and you will know why you want to watch it. The nice thing about this series is that it's completely new. There are not many movies - and even less - series based on the subject of only uncertainty, but the Lost live with a theme with pride. All this is inexplicable and if you combine it with an exotic location, beautiful turns, a great acting team and a good format (the present and the past combined in one episode) you will have a series in which each episode of the story is part of a larger speech. You want to have all the insights into the characters, you want to see the whole picture and want to know where your writers are. The result is that it is a series that does not let you go. On a more skeptical figure, the series went just below the season 2, probably because of their own success. It is known that Lost was originally written only for one season and when great success followed, and the writers were overwhelmed. In my opinion, they made a mistake to add even more mysteries at a higher pace in season 2, and then to solve those (or at least partially) that season 1. At the end of season 2 you ended up with a big fog. secrets, complications and inexplicable phenomena, but only so many viewers can take. The difference between season 2 and 3 was huge. The third season shared many insights, partly replaced them with new issues. And that's exactly how they should write; You want to rotate from one plot to another, that you do not get the tsunami that spread all over you, then pick up some who will explain to the viewers. They got it in the third season and bring us a promising series of the future for season 4. It's good to see that such a different format of the series can be so popular.
