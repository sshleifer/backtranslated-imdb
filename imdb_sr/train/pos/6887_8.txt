This is a unique and brave movie. He is energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performance. I like directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think ... Bret Carr dares look at himself, ask questions and dig under the surface. By virtue of the film, it practically requires the viewer to look inside. It takes a little courage to do this. I see how some close people might consider it to be quite disturbing. However, I discovered that this is a challenge of thinking, much more than fun. Bret Carr is a truly original director, with a vision. I wonder what's next to do. Take care of him.
