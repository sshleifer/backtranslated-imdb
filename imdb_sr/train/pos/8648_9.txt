California is a film about lost ideals. Traveling the darkest way ever. Road without return. The plot is about a couple who went to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovich in his best role so far) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have taken place in America, and his girlfriend - who is a photographer - will take pictures. So they started to trace famous murders, not knowing what was on their way. To share travel expenses, they decided to find another pair and put an ad. But the couple who answered was not just any couple. It's one of the strangest couples ever. The girl is an naive, fragile creature that dreams a lot and loves cacti. The man is just the opposite. A cruel, merciless killer. We learned this early in the film and followed him in a trip to California (not with C as usual, but with K, probably symbolizing the word killer), on his way of betrayal, murder and finally defeat. All tracks, Duchovna, Pitt, Levis and Forbes give you really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed, none of them was a star. The photo is incredible, the darkness covers the largest parts of the film, and the music corresponds to the dark character of the film. Basically, this is a really good movie. Do not miss. You'll think again before putting a foreigner in the car to divide the gas!
