This is Arnold's film. Now that you knew, I saved a lot of the time it would take to read this review. If you do not like Arnold, then you will not like this movie. If the case is the second, then you will probably like it. It's simple. Now, if you're still reading this, I expect you like Arnold. Good for you! He's pretty good, is not he? Running Man is a very typical Arnold feature. There is a common retro-future that we all know from the 80's B-Sci Fi, has a lot of horrible liners, lots of violence and explosions, and a handsome heroin and a happy ending. In this case, the evil opponent is the controlling government in 1984, which uses television as an effective control of the crowd with games of gladiator games. Arnold, of course, ends up in one of these shows and turns it all aside, with the help of his two confederates and handsome Amber. film, but nevertheless managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future, with some nice matte pictures and sets to help him. It's hopeless in the '80s, but I think it's charming. The acting is different, Arnold performs his usual things with the help of stones. Heroin Amber is to say, a bit stereotyped, but the subtle name Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man. In spite of all the faults, the film very clearly shows its message; Television is an opiate mass, a good way to control people. It also has some futuristic digital video editing at that time, allowing bad guys to change faces in a video to deceive their audience. Today it does not seem futuristic at all, which is a little worrying. If you've seen Arnold's films before, then you know when to watch this movie. Enjoy.
