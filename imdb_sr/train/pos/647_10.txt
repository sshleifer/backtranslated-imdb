Well, women are, on average, overly sensitive and needy, which is interestingly shown from mother to whore, although it is not pseudo-artistic, extravagant, or obvious. Unlike many of you, I've seen La Maman et La Putain twice. Like many good films, I noticed that my opinion about it improved after another view. All I know is what I've seen and I have not yet embarked on further ventures until I get a DVD. I still do not understand why I enjoy this film so much, but really, what do I care about why? Although I'm sure I could also create some wonderful explanation. Okay, maybe you disagree, maybe it's a bit boring, sometimes I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of the wonderful Grushenka.
