It's not a serious film, but a big movie. Definitely not just a piece of hair. The acting, IMO, is great. One of those movies that you would not get out of sight, but it brings a smile every time you find it on the cable. Like an old friend. It's definitely worth seeing if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
