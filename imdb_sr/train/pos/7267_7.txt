Curli Sue is a 6-year-old with lots of hair and life as a stroller. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), are trying to survive on the streets by being small conductors. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump ahead of the car in an expensive parking garage, and Curley will scream about lawsuits and retirement to the victim. It happens that this is a very persistent lawyer named Grai (Kelli Linch) who is appropriately amazed by what she has done. Not only do the fraudsters make money but spend the night in Grey's flatbed apartment. Even then, Gray thinks he owes them more, so the three of them hang together for a spell. Grays only know for a lucrative job and nothing about life. Who better to learn from Bill and Curlia, those clever experts on life's realities? But all good things have to be done and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of people. Or is it? This is a cute and funny movie about the unexpected. Curley is definitely fun as Shirlei Temple, but much harder, of course. Belushi gives a rare touching performance, as is the case with his luck, and Linch is brilliant as a sleek but soft lawyer. John Hughes, as a writer and director, shows us again his magic note, because the script is alive and unpredictable. Just look at Curley and Bill pulling Grey into the night, without money, and seeing witty results. Would you like happy endings, long promised and finally delivered, with a few uncertain moments between? This is your movie made to order.
