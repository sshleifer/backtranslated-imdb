Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted it. He also just did it. Not only for his goal, but also for making a beautiful film, especially visually. He knows how to use tave, slowed sequences, tracking images, crankshafts, etc. This gives the movie a very relaxing feeling for him. The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: the entertainment everyone sees, which is also a milestone for this movie. The beauty of this painting does not lie with the characters affecting others (compared to a similar, certainly better film like Magnolia). I just do not think it was Barman's idea. The beauty lies in the various details of the experiences through which people pass by, creating or interrupting their lives. Barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences. He knows people ... and Antwerp. Soundtrack is also a great, but not a surprise, because we know that Barman is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his band dEUS. Music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing, which contributes to the sunny, smooth feeling of the film. The second time we hear funky pop / rock-tunes that give some scenes the power they need. There is only one flaw, and this is the last half hour. Was it the time that broke me? Or were not the last scenes that were fresh and accurate from the scene until then? I can not figure out ... </ i> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> All in all, a beautiful sunny film that raises Belgian cinema. 8 of 10! It's a breeze that runs through the girl's hair in the afternoon, making it even more beautiful: it's a fresh breeze that relaxes you when you are in a crowded party when someone opens the door; it's a breeze perfume from that beautiful girl who sitting next to you in the park and you just met a week ago, it's a breeze .....) <br /> <br />
