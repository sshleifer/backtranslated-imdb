The previous reviewer said that exactly. I saw him once, he was fascinated, I saw him the second time he was broadcast again within a week or two after the first broadcast. I still remember some scenes. The setting is the beginning of the 20th century, the war mentioned in the title is mentioned in the First World War. One of the scenes was set in the female part of the public place, which was interesting historical note. The moment one of the women touches the other first is one of my top movie moments. I do not think of this as a "gai film", it is an interesting and gentle period of a love story, in which there are two principles of a woman. I would like to see this movie again; I'd buy this if it ever came out on a DVD.
