I am a great fan of Jane Austen, and despite being a feature film (the real fan wants to see as little as possible, and this can be achieved only in the mini-series), it was really great. Gwinneth Paltrow really takes a little clueless but a good-looking rich girl, and Jeremi Northam IS Mr. I was not thrilled with Evan McGregor even though I loved him as an actor, but I did not feel he had broken the film at all. As I said, as a fan, Jane Austin, there were things I would like to see, including those that were not, but it would have done much longer than it was allowed for a feature film, and as I felt they really attached the story well. I've seen every adaptation of this book and found this to be the best!
