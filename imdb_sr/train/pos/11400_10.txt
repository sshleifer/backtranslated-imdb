I felt that it was necessary to respond to the comments posted on the cover page of this film because something was wrong. Originally I published quotes from the original poster, but I was not sure if it was correct given that it was an index of "comments" and not a notice board (although we used it so far before than the IMDb added movie-based bulletin boards), so I will arrange this to make it unnecessary. Well, first of all, you may not be aware of that, but Gene Kelly became the first to become famous for playing "Pal Joei" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincent Minnelli decided to make Gershwin's "panoramic" film, he wanted Kellie's character to be more sophisticated than the role of "good two shoe" that he played in most of his films (except for "For Me and Mi Gal"). Alan Jai Lerner was ordered to make a new story in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joei". This gave Kellie a chance to play her famous role with Broadway, although Varners surpassed MGM for rights to "Pal Joey". In my opinion, the World Bank "Pal Joei" is a wreck, although Sinatra was suitable for the role, but other problems are the snapper (change scenarios and a bad direction. ============== = ==================================== <br /> <br /> You complain that they are Kelly It's not well done, even cites your artistic education to prove the point, but you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad, and that it is necessary for the story / characters that Kelly is not ready for the show. Even he knows that, although Milo drowned him somehow to the extent that Mr But it's important that the audience does not sit and says: "But he is a great artist. You want the audience to be fully aware of their shortcomings. Then complain that he sabotages your interest in the show, again You do not understand the structure He refuses because he does not want to feel like a gigolo, and because he knows he is not ready for the show. His enthusiasm for the show is certainly not as great as Joei's enthusiasm to "kick the night club". But it serves the same function in complication. Remember, it is essential to "Pal Joei" (present) that Joei gives up on his night club after he realizes he does not deserve it. Same with an artistic show. If Kell's paintings were really good, that would undermine all this. ================================================== = <br /> Then complain that Caron and Kelly have no "chemistry". I guess that's in the eye of the observer. I agree, chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was okay. Compare this with even worse "forced" romances like the one between Cari Grant and Sophia Loren in "Pride and Passion". ================================================== == When you say that a big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this movie, it just shows that you did not dig under the surface of the film in its symbolism. Many elements of the dance series relate to the story and characters, and through dance, the action is resolved through images and symbolism. It is about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks around and his love is gone). The movements of the symphony are constructed so that the part of each dance scene reflects a special phase of Parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationship. If you have not seen it, it's not a film mistake. This is certainly not a "load of shit". ==================================================
