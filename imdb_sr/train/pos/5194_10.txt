This is one of my favorite films from Hong Kong. It is one of the earliest films of John Woo and one of only a few traditional martial arts films he directed. You see his influence on working with Chang Cheh in this movie. The action is good, the choreography of the fight is led by Fong Hak On, who appears as one of the bad guys in the film. It features Vei Pei from "Five Venoms" fame and a number of faces of famous fans of Golden Harvest and Shav Brothers production. The story is interesting, there are several decent complications, and the construction of characters and their mutual relations is wisely performed. This film had only VHS releases in the UK. Media Asia has released 3 DVD regions and there are versions on DVD from the USA. The movie is great for watching in the original language or in the English version. I recommend this film.
