Who would have thought such a dark film could have been so obsessive and touching? I'm really impressed. It's a shame that more people did not see it. I loved, as always, the assessment of Hans Zimmer. And what was the director's debut by Bernard Rose! Still, I wonder if I should call this horror movie. It can easily be claimed that it is fantasy or drama. Well, no matter, I like the interpretative potential that it has. Everybody and everyone in Anna's dreams (Charlotte Burke play) are the real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, the Mark, the lighthouse, etc. for repeated viewing. I hope to come across another little movie that is full of emotions and psychological meanings like this one soon.
