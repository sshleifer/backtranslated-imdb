While I loved this movie, the stories that circulated the Internet for a year before it came to the cinema, set my expectations a bit more. I am the owner of the DVD, so do not misunderstand me, I do not say do not look at it and do not buy it! Only I still think the first scene was the best, and nothing in the whole movie was at the top.
