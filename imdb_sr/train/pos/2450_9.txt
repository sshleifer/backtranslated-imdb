I've been watching this show since I was fourteen, and since then I've loved it. I love this play because it's just funny! You will enjoy this show because it shows something new and fun everyday, and my favorite part is when Benni always has his last comments on George after every stroke of his thick head. With my friends at home, it would be like we were watching a movie, but short. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, spectacular. This is a cool funny-famed comedy that enjoys everyone and you will surely enjoy - I am! And if you have not seen it yet, I suggest you start watching because you do not want to stop watching it. Although there are no new episodes yet, I still enjoy re-broadcasts. Still funny. It never separates. 9/10
