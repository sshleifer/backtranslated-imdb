In Manhattan, American middle class Jim Blandings (Cari Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Mirna Loi) and two daughters of a teenage daughter in a four-room and one bathroom just rented out. Jim works in an advertising agency and gathers $ 15,000 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When he sees the advertisement of a large house for sale in Connecticut country at an affordable price, he rides with his wife and real estate agent and decides to buy an old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer, Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas), sends an acquaintance's engineer to inspect the house, and the man says he should drop the house and build another one. Jim checks information with other engineers and they all condemn the site even before he finds out that he has bought a "cash pit" instead of a dream home. "Mr. Blandings builds his house" is an extremely funny comedy, with witty lines and top-notch scenarios. Cari Grant is hilarious in the role of a man who is driven by the impulse of realizing the American dream of owning a huge house that finds a bad choice, while losing touch in his business and feeling jealous of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very funny movie that obviously inspired this beautiful classic "The Monei Pit". My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Mood")
