Rachel Griffiths writes and directs this award-winning short film. A nice story about dealing with sadness and nurturing memories of those we loved and lost. Although, only 15 minutes, Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth on the film in a short time. Bud Tingvell gives a touching performance like Vill, a widower who is struggling to cope with his wife's death. Will faces the cruel reality of loneliness and helplessness while taking care of Ruth's cow, Tulipa. The film shows the pain and responsibility we feel towards those whom they loved and lost. Good cinema, excellent direction and superb acting. He will bring tears to all those who have lost a beloved person and survived.
