Meril Streep is great in her tangled and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain, who is charged and charged with the alleged murder of her baby, Azeri Chamberlain, and using her alibi of hungry dingoes as her defense. Based on the book "The Evil Angels" and named so in the Australian edition, ROCKY IN TAMA is an ugly movie for watching. It represents a scenario that is too real for us in America: hunt for a witch against a person who is considered a light target. Linda Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did not play a card with sympathies, and someone who was tough enough to continue with his life despite his terrible temptation, was labeled suspicious and hated out of understanding even when it was clear that he did not kill his child. The media began to tighten a loop and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon pierced the whole nation for their sets as they took out this family. And through all this, Lindy remained stoic as always, even when her husband Michael broke up. This attitude, of course, is the strength of power, as it is as inconsistent as it may seem, and people react strongly to it. They want to see an upset mother crying and crying, and occasionally being foggy at each step, not sitting there and looking empty. People do not understand that everyone does not grieve the same way, and when someone decides to stay strong, speculation begins. Mary Streep moves this broken woman up to the balls and in this way creates a cold but not a senseless woman who stood behind her convictions, even if they cost her freedom. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to slow down his character to despair - someone has to, or Chamberlains will be too much apart, and nobody wants to see it. In addition to being a monster that has become a news media at the time of writing. They will always eat trains and destroy stolen manure for untrained people.
