I could not find anyone to watch DiG! with me because no one I knew was a fan of any band. Of course, everyone assumed that you can enjoy this movie only if you love music or Dandi Varhols or Brian Jonestown Massacre, but this is far from true. The only condition is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way the parallel career of these two groups is parallel is a perfect overview of the ways the band can take over, and watching the public eating and spitting Dandi Varhols is fascinating. I agree with other reviews that mention that it would be nice to get the last word from Anton himself, because he is clearly portrayed as his worst enemy and the baffle for the band's ability to stay. The most interesting for me is Dandee's respect for BJM (despite their lack or return) and Anton (despite his unusual behavior). Dandi Varhols respects the art that the group produces, even if the group hates everything Dandi Varholi is now (though it is controversial). The best line is when a drummer for Dandiev says: "I will not have any more new ones anymore," and the guitarist unconsciously smears. For me, this only shows how powerful good music is. Definitely take a look at this movie, even if you do not know anything about any of the bands. More about rock music topics and how they evolve make this movie so interesting. It's rare for so long to follow the group so closely.
