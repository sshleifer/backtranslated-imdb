This is for viewing a few times. Excellent writing shows that they had to live this story or know someone they did because they pinned it. Freebird made me come back to life and smile at my youth. The title was a Great Choice. Excellent movie, setting, story, soundtrack and characters. It's a biker movement, but it would be a shame to break it like that. Funny to the bone, somehow like Trailer Park Bois in the UK. If you have never seen TPB, make a point if you like this movie. Thank you. I hope to see more of these characters in other films. Sekul? It can be done. There are many more worlds I would like to see through their eyes.
