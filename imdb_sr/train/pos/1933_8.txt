This indie movie looks at the lives of a group of people attending an adult swimming class in Connecticut. The plot is pretty thin. What triggers the film are characters, which are greatly played by mostly unknown actors. Featured actors are Brevster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and Veikler as a casino salesman who wanders like a stripper. Two actresses give natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive debut of the feature film for writer Schechter and director Setton. This last keeps the story moving fast. The title of the film and the poster suggest something rude, but this is a wonderful comedy-drama.
