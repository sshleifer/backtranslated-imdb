This movie is stupid like hell! I think it was written as a serious film, but when it's time to shoot, Michael Coonei said: "Hey, let's throw some humor and spice it up!" The characters are actually little developed. Oh, and death sequences are the best. One thing I hate is a hair weapon. What was that?
