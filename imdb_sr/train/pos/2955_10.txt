There is a certain attraction I've always found in discovering a big (semi) unknown movie. These discoveries were almost always dramatic films - in my experience, unknown science fiction, action and horror are unknown for very, very good reasons. I found "High Tide" on a video in the garbage store, embedded among countless dozens of tape of different quality. Of course, it's the only place I would find it, because it's not on DVD yet. As I watched Judy Davis (as Lillie) during the entire film, I was somehow sure I was watching a big undisclosed show. Yes, I previously saw Davis in a few smaller parts - and one of the main roles in the "Road to India". But, although she was brilliant in the film, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Recently, looking at the later film Gillian Armstrong, "Charlotte Grey", I was very aware of the type of actress who impressed him. Davis attracts much more than a passing similarity with Kate Blanchett - both in both ways and on sensitivity. The performance of Judy Davis is astounding, I can not say enough good things about it. She shares an incredible connection on the screen with young Claudio Carvan (like Allie), another great actress of this film. There are many drama and silent humanity that share together, details that I will not refrain from discovering here (see for yourself!). In "High Tide" there are too many good things to appear in one review. Indeed, it would be hard to worry - the film speaks well enough for itself. In the end, I would like to praise scriptwriter Laurent Jones for her stunning dialogue, directed by Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of the actors, and the great Russell Boid for his great, underestimated cinema (see his work in "Tender Mercies").
