This amazing documentary gives us an insight into the lives of brave women in the Cameroon judicial system - police, lawyers and judges. In spite of the enormous difficulties - the lack of resources, the desperate poverty of people, multiple languages ​​and multiple legal precedents, depending on the region of the country and the religious / ethnicity of prosecutors and defendants - these brave, strong women of the difference. This is a rare thing - a truly inspirational film that returns little faith to humanity. Despite the atrocities we see in the film, justice is obtained thanks to these passionate, diligent women. I just hope this film will get a wide release in the United States. The more people see this movie, the better.
