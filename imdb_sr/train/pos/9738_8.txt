Oh, dear, we do not like when our interest in a superhero develops the brain, right? story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed loudly at least five times and I'm not ashamed to say I had a tear in the eye several times too. The acting, acting and script are great, I watch lots of movies across the street and I have not seen any of this genre that has been so successful. Those who disagree please tell me where I can find them! I'm sure the book is good, but I think you have to judge it based on your merits.
