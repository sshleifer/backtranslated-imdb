Some war films thrive where others do not, and this can be estimated from different angles. Humanistic angle, in which you can feel the raw emotions (terror that you are attacked, friendship among soldiers, difficult trials people face in combat, etc.) are always films that I find attractive. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies that you feel connected with the characters in the movie. This film also works on this level. He talks about "Highest Honor" and this honor is the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they had the honor and it was recognized in a way that is completely incompatible with the Western idea, but it is, to the very end, a true story of honor. Unforgettable movie. Based on the true story.
