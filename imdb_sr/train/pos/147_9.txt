Stories in this video are very fun, and it's definitely worth a look! The first refers to a young couple who is upset in the woods with two peasants, with a large but unexplained swing in the end. Watching - A man is attacked by a dog, fearful of being angry - has shelter in what appears to be a hospital, but finds out that employees do not exist just as it seems ... rotate in the end, and this episode itself brings 10/10! If the others were in touch with this, this would have 10/10! The third is the weakest of the crowd - the girl meets with some guys and has wild sex! There seems to be no sense in the story to the end, with a good little twist, but it spoiled the terrible first part! Still, this is a great movie that will not fail wrong! It's worth hiring!
