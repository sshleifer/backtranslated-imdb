This is not a bad movie. Follow the new conventions of modern horror, it's a movie in the movie, a famous actress who deals with his life in the first scene. This film takes away the old psycho-killer convention and manages to do something new and interesting. It's also always nice to see Molly Ringwald for the attack. So this can be an example of what the genre has become. The cut hit all the marks and it's actually scary in some parts. I liked that I gave him eight.
