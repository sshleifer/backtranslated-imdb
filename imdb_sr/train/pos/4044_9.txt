I discovered that this film is very timely. The premise is quite imaginative, and as a viewer I was withdrawn while the characters developed. Pacing works very well for those who like to think - it is enough to be watched by the audience early, and the questions continue to appear, which they later reply, creating a well-designed and very satisfying movie, both cerebral and action Stance. It looks like some people were looking for an unstoppable ride on the slide with this movie - one of those coming from the entrance. This would be more analogous to one of those padlocks that first slowly lift you up to the hill - creating a wonderful feeling of anticipation - and finally, in my mind, more fillings for the foundation that was originally laid. Excellent film.
