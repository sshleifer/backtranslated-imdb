The concept that Laurel & Hardi this time in the role of chimney cleaner looks surprisingly hilarious. This guarantees some funny situations and stupid foolishness, especially from Stan Lorel, of course, as usual. It really does not sound like a logical combination of stories and inconsistent lines, but both lines fit perfectly into the unforgettable end. It's still a little weird, but funny, so it works for the movie. Supported film movie is surprisingly good. Sam Adams himself is as brilliant as the stereo-shaped butler and Lucien Littlefield passionately pass as a top professor. they become hilarious to watch, however, thanks to the way in which they are all executed. All this helps "Dirty Job" to become one of the better Laurel & Hardy Shorts. 8/10
