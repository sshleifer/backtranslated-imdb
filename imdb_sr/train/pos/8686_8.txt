The second official episode of the "Columbo" ("Murder in the Book") series, recorded later, was the first to hit the radios. Robert Culp, who, with several detectives Peter Falk, would answer questions in several future wars, is as good as a shortsighted head of a sophisticated private detective agency that kills a client's wife when he refuses to enter his blackmailing programs. These two stars are well paired in this clever exercise of the cat and mouse, which is one of the best in the series.
