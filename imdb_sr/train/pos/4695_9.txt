What happened to Michael Keaton? What a great actor he proves in this film. This movie is actually FUNNY! And the reason why this movie is ridiculous is for two reasons: an excellent script and Michael Keaton. This film is one of the most entertaining comedies in Hollywood's history. This film is the ultimate gangster gangster movie. In this film, Hollivood is actually having fun in himself using the genre of gangster movie as the basis for a truly original comedy. And the rest of the actors are ridiculous, especially support. If you like to laugh and want to watch a movie that contains nonstop humor, then this movie is for you.
