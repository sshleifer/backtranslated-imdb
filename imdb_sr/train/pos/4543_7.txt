Well, no, I'm lying, this is not really the best film of all time, but it's a really nice movie that nobody I've ever seen. It is a police officer cop starring Jai Leno and Pat Morita (Miyagi) with a story about a missing prototype of a car engine or something, but that does not matter. The reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two traces, which at first do not like and do not trust each other, but in a shocking turn of destiny they become friends. The whole difference in culture has been done quite well, because it's fun to watch, it's completely funny, but in a way that is cute and pleasant. Soundtrack is cool, once again in the cheese mode of 80, suits the movie, I'm trying to find one of the songs for years, but how do I remember from what I think a few words seemed to me I could not find it. Another thing that this movie has is the most fantastic reward for any movie ever, but I will not give it away, oh no! In conclusion, I would take this film over 48 hours of most of Eddie Murphy's productions, including Beverly Hills police officer, and any friendly junk Jackie Chan or Martin Lavrence in his name. If you're looking for a cop policeman movie and feed yourself "a real white cop meeting a black cop with streets," show this footage. You may be pleasantly surprised as this turns the entire formula upside down with a "flat Japanese policeman who meets the street of a street white cop". I make honesty 7. To be honest, I love more than that. I'd rather watch this than a lot of things I'd give 8. But I guess I know deeply that it's some kind of madness that makes me like this movie.
