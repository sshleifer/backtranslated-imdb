This is a good movie for 99% of the duration. I feel that the end ended this film from a higher recognition. It was filmed in a pretty naive way. This has obviously been done to create a feeling for a film that is even cooler - the feeling of isolation becomes apparent very quickly due to this shooting technique. The terrible characters are very well presented and presented especially as a madman. It was called Joe. However, healthy (normal) characters are a bit pathetic for my affection - approved, they should be found as pathetic, but this is done a little OTT. The film starts slowly (and naive camera work is lethal to the movie 'B' to start) and very normal, but soon you'll get the sense of the upcoming brutality that will happen. This is one of the most perfect films in relation to cold-blooded violence. After a sudden and incredibly lazy ending, I remained disappointed. I would give to film 9 that the end is in line with the rest of the film, but as it looks, it gets only 7 in the power of 'sabotage' and the nail scene that was previously in the movie. /> Give him a watch and an excuse for the end!
