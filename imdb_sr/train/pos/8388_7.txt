Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman who is presented in a completely and very credible manner, despite being so bluntly bordering on the incredible. She will do everything to her marital work, including shameful opportunism and sexual manipulation. And so, under the exterior exterior, it reveals a fairly sweet system of values. The film suffers from a sudden and unexpected ending that later feels completely inadequate, with the practicality known from the end of your writing exercise of creative writing with 'and then I woke up.' At the other end of the book is a book with the most unusual sequence of titles I've ever seen, but do not let it turn you away.
