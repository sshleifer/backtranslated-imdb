he is an essential narcissus and manipulator; in this case, portraying Tom Kapan's lawyer (and killer). Kathrin Morris sympathized with the victim, Anne Marie Fahei, but she was initially too victim. We are sorry about the situation, but at the same time we were horrified when we saw his victimization and several other women (including Rachel Vard). and Capano actually killed his psychologist. It's hard to believe, but this was based on a true story. There is a kameya with Olimpija Dukakis (excellent) as Capan's mother. All in all, an interesting story because it is based on a real murder, and you will want to read the Ann Rule book to get the exact details. 8/10.
