I'll start by saying that it's unheard of everything! The fact is, this is not what someone expected, especially from Guia Ritchie. What everyone expected was a cocktail of geezers and a good liner. etc., but this is much more mature than his previous works. I agree that it is confusing, but all the facts are there for us, we just have to see and listen, this film requires all your attention! Take a look at the past of the cool and brilliant look of the movie, try to listen to the dialogue, not to admire the performances, and I think that we will all get a fuller understanding of the whole film. Yes this has its influences of modern classics (combat club, pulp fiction, etc.), but it is in its entirety original in both directions and singing with the musical partner without bother. I feel that if everyone would watch this movie again and again, they would understand it much more, and maybe we would appreciate it for a fine piece of modern cinema that I hope Ritchie will continue in this vain because I prefer this film "masterpiece ".
