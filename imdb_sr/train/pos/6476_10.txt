Numerous posters commented on an unsatisfactory conclusion. This is always a problem with long, complex drama. Crime is basically banal, so payment is always anti-climate, while detailed exposure diminishes human drama. The writer used a number of smart devices to try to bypass this, but he was not completely successful. Respond to exactly what happened and why they were delivered, but if so, they are well buried. The viewer inevitably feels a bit cheated. But in some sense this is irrelevant. Drama never referred to crime or even to investigation, but to the impact of events on the lives of those involved; family, investigators, witnesses, the press. And as such, it was great. Writing was a significant cut above the running of the mill for the drama at the hitting point, and the performances were equally good. In one piece of the ensemble, it's unusual to focus on individuals, but Penelope Vilton deserves a special mention for an extraordinary tour as a mother-wife-daughter, and Janet McTeer was in the form of a shooting as a stubborn policeman. > One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is handling the race, like an elephant in a room that no one is ready to mention. Subtle, powerful things.
