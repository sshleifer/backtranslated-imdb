Mark Frechette plays Mark, the radical leftist of the college. Mark is accused of killing a policeman during a riot at the campus, and escaping to the desert. He does so by stealing a small plane at a local airport and flying him alone. When flying over the desert, Mark saw a car out of the air. A young woman named Daria comes out and sees Marco circling on a plane. Mark pulls the plane very low a few times, causing Daria to bend or hit. When he landed, he met Darius, who was unusually fascinated by Mark's airborne heads. After having talked to the soul for hours, Mark and Daria are naked and are in love with the sand. But, as Mark avoided the law, they realize that he should continue to run. Thus, Mark and Daria's short performance is rather sharp, because it can not develop into a full romance. Zabriski Point was Eraserhead in the early 70's. Both films have an unclear, unclear quality, along with complicated meanings and characters. Frechette was personally unscrupulous, because his character was in this film. A few years after the creation of Zabriski Point, Frechette robbed the bank in real life. While serving a prison sentence, Mark died a deadly death. He was killed with a weight of 150 lb, which fell on him when he lifted weights. The best thing about this movie was great cinema and special visual effects. The incredible scenes of slow-motion shooting of debris that floated in the air after the explosion were genius. Although not as a pioneering movie like Easi Rider, Zabriski Point still resonated with the counter-culture of the early seventies. I recommend it, for those who love avant-garde films that show reversal, youth rebellions in the early 70's.
