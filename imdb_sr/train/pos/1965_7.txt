I think this film is very good in all areas. The acting was great of all the characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morisssey. Tramell's figure becomes smarter and psychologically distorted from the moment. The action is interesting even though this film is more about the mind that plays between the main characters and how Katarina continues her writing with new ways and turns for her novels. The setting was also phenomenal and the whole atmosphere of the film was that mysterious, thriller as a masterpiece. Take a look at this movie now, it deserves better than what it got from the audience, which was misled by some inaccurate scary reviews of the movie (Before it even started) ..... You will not regret, if you look at it ...
