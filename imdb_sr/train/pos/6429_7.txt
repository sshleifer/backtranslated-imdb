If it is believed in movies, Chinese ghosts are much nicer and more miserable than their Western counterparts. Stories from the three films of the "Chinese spirit" are mostly identical, but the direction is excellent, and the details and colors are such that this is not a big problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, followed, of course, by large looting. For those who have not yet come across the 'GhostStory' trilogy, this film offers an interesting departure from the Western horror / ghost genre; for those who have, another pleasure in the Chinese world of ghosts.
