a bit slow and boring, the story of an old man and his wife living in a ruined building and interacting with fixed figures like a postman, brothers sitting on a porch, a rich man smoking cigars. The photo of the river is amazing, as is the interior decoration. If you like the Banana Republic store decoration, this is mandatory.
