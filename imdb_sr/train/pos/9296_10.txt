I love this movie. It's crazy, funny, violent, surreal, played in the head of a lunatic, and it's definitely not a common comedy. If you do not find a fun movie then I think it's not just for your taste, so it's hard to write a review for. For reference, some of the other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride and Zoolander (it only helped me the second time). There are others, but my taste is definitely unusual, and I am ready to accept that most people simply do not like such things. I do not apologize for the unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. The scenes and characters of this film are well-formed, verbal humor is hilarious, the situations are intriguing, the acting is very good (as would be expected of actors), although the acting demands made by the acting performance in the script are not particularly high. The complete package makes fun, entertaining, and violent entertainment.
