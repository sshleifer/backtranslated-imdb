It's rare to sit in front of the TV to watch a particular program. It's even less when I finally enjoyed the program, but Last of the Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I think I saw. Ian Holm, and an excellent, witty and sharp script in combination to truly reward him. I can not really express how well I thought, so I will not try, I'll just say, if you get a chance, please look! I just hope it will appear on the video.
