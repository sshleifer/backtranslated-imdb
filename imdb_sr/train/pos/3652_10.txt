I began to watch the reprise of this TV movie on Sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another stupid plane crash. I was wrong. "Pandora's Clock" is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most TV films. He could also easily debut on the big screen. The actors are excellent, including veterans Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga turns into one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA, and Frasier's Jane Leeves is also very good. The dialogue is well written and the story is tempting. In fact, the last hour is so full of complications and uncertainty that you can not leave your place for a second. If you get a chance to watch this movie, invest time - almost four hours. You will be richly rewarded!
