Reading various external reviews by Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics, I reluctant to admit how much I love this film, although I have only one version in Japanese. It is obvious that many critics see this as a minus space for the story used earlier, best known in the great "It's a wonderful life". For me, the big premise is a big premise no matter how many times it is used, and I would love to see more movies using this particular premise - an unhappy man who gets an opportunity to gain a new perspective on his life through a little "divine magic." I suppose that people and critics of more intellectual bending are not so drawn into the story, but I do not go to movies to criticize them with a notebook in my hand - I go to the movies to throw myself in them and let them take me where it wants. If you are a sentimental species like me, you will be well rewarded by watching this picture. The performances were excellent throughout the whole period, and the film was very good. And a wonderful selection of music. Michael Caine is great as a nice bartender. Jim Belushi works great like the type of "average Joe" who is wondering if his life went the way he should. Linda Hamilton, always great, is here again targeted here as a beloved woman. Jon Lovitz is having fun as usual, and even has some surprising moving moments in Mr Destiny. No, Mr. Destiny is not "It's a wonderful life," but who says he must be? Filmed on his own terms, "Mr. Destini" is a nice, well-made, fun and moving movie. I've seen my video in Japanese more than once, and I'm sure I'll see him a few more times. If it kind of makes me "low", let it be so! I'm just glad I did not read Mr Destiny's reviews before I saw them. I guess I should have the courage of my beliefs and give a movie to nine or ten stars, but I could not but doubt myself after I read all the critical critiques!
