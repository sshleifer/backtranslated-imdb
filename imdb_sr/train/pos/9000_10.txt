The first time I saw KRV SAMURAI at the premiere at the International Film Festival in Hawaii. VOV! Blood just delighted us with its pure fervor, blood, vitality, bloody blood, excitement, bloodyness, complete punishment, and even more, and all this in EXCELLENT ENTERTAINMENT! Especially for those of you who enjoy all these Japanese samurai and ninja movies, YOU definitely need to see the KRV!
