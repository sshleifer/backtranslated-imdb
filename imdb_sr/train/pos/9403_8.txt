"The Man in a White Suit" is another pen in the hands of expert Scottish director Alexander Makendrik (Vhiskei Galore !, Sveet Smell of Success). The star of the film is Alec Guinness (whose comedy includes Kind Hearts and Coronets and Mob Lavender Hill). Ginis brings his usual class to the film, and makes him much more than a typical comedy. In fact, the comedy is not quite open. By the end of the painting, it almost became a complete drama. It's the kind of Ealing studio comedy that was calculated not to produce laughter, but a sense of general entertainment, like the best British comedy of the time. , but the way it is executed is. The film is very original and is recommended to every fan of Guinness or Britsh comedy. 7.6 from 10
