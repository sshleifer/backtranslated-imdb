I did not expect much, and to be honest, this film I did not like for the first time, but I'm watching it again and I realized it was cool. Of course, this is a joke about a joke, but that's ridiculous. Someone has announced that it could be better written and could be. I think this film had the potential to be over-the-top My cousin Winnie. But with a horror host instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately, this is a failed opportunity. Just a little more writing could be a classic. Children are underutilized, there is no reason to catch Elvira. Except for obvious reasons. It would be great to see their relationship flourish. I know it's a comedy, but these are small differences that separate good movies from the brilliant. Elvira herself is always fun and interesting. Not to mention flirt. Every time she laughs, you will. It's hard to knock a movie when the main character is so charming. And it's really her charm, do not let your look make you think she's some kind of whore. Well, yes. But she's good. The person you let go of your children. I would not let her cook for them, although ... I'd recommend doing this. Just do not expect too much. She is more than a large set of suckers. She's also an incredible pair of legs.
