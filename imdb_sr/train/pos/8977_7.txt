As a movie that scarcely estimates 4, but for movie lovers from the 1940s, it's almost imperative to watch and evaluate 9 as a variant! I was attracted to watching this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) the Web site of the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the amazing performance of Doris Dai. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her better than she is here. Randolph Scott is also unforgettable, even if he does not see much time on the screen. It's been a long time since I saw the movie, but I was almost sure that Humphrei Bogart appeared. With so many known faces, it's hard to follow. If it ever appears on a television station near you, be sure to catch the Doris Dai series, if nothing else! <br /> <br />
