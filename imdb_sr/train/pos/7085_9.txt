I just bought a DVD and I have to say, (after seeing Brazil and Fear in Las Vegas), Terry does it again. Apart from being a fan of Monti Pithon movies, Terri Gilliam's genius follows in this fantastic thriller, whom Bruce Villis plays a great role as James Cole, and also (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played madness. Jefferei Goines. It must have sci fi fans, or movie fans of any type, because it includes tension, drama, action, etc. In any case, the plot, in the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease aimed at destroying the human race, which was liberated in the past by an "army of twelve monkeys". James Coles (Bruce Villis) was sent in 1996 (when the virus was released) to find out about the disease, so scientists can find a cure in his time. Before I move on, James Cole lives in an underground society, and animals rule the world on the surface due to a disease that will kill people. in any case, when he returns back in time, he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution for his stories to people about the virus. During his stay, he met Jefferei Goins (Brad Pitt), who was later largely responsible for erasing the human race. He met his psychiatrist (Madeleine Stove), who ultimately teamed up with Bruce to save the world (seeing that he was right in his stories), he was sent back and forth from his time in the past and eventually sent in 1996. then he reassesses his own reason, but later breaks through and reveals an uncertain fourth quarter of the film, and later upgrades to a shocking climax, where he tries to prevent a man carrying a virus (not really Brad Pitt) and instead fires the police until the killer escapes.
