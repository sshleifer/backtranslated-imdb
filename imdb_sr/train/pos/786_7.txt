Andie MacDovell is the face of the face again in this film. When you enter 40 and you are unmarried for some time (or your entire life), you may feel that you are wasting your time. The movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found anywhere, if your antenna is active. I loved a quick sexual encounter, which must be beyond the character of a normally reserved teacher (MacDovell). Her former student is cute enough, and she's still so in love with her teacher. However, there are some parts that I thought were rather unrealistic or impractical. For example, in the place where the jealousy of another woman overcame the scene and made the scene that Andy MacDovell toss out a young man, would a mature policeman (another friend of MacDovell) allow his friend to do such a crime? Was it so easy for anyone not to stop in front of the car? Of course, the accidents happen all the time, but I was hoping that the heroine would be happily married to the first man she dealt with (that was the hardest part to believe !! That such a beautiful woman would stay alone for so long?) ... < Maybe the film producers are aware of the fact that many romantics between an older woman and a younger man do not last long. In addition, they know that a happy ending would not attract the public, especially women of jealousy over 40 years, waiting for some miracles to happen. A sad ending with an insight into the hope of a sad woman who lost true love is sweet, but if a man continues to live, would it take time? How long? Nobody knows. Still, it's a movie that will make you look at it again later ... maybe a year later.
