When I hired this movie to watch it, I knew it would not be a film that caused the mind. Instead, I thought of it as an unbelief in reality in which someone would get serious beating. And you know what worked. Kurt Russel did what I thought was an extraordinary role to show the emotional soldier that he was. I recommend this movie if you are with boys and want to watch a good action movie.
