Looking for something that is far from deliberately rude things usually done by John Waters (happy birthday, John!) He made this parody for the world of glory / art. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a teenager from a working class in Baltimore who likes to photograph things. When an agent from New York (Lily Tailor) discovers his work, he offers him a great break he accepts. But when he hits him, he must reconsider everything. In essence, "Pecker" sees losing friends and their normal life when it becomes a celebrity. What we could expect, of course, with Waters' guidance, there are always a few things that will shock us (you will know them when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also featured are Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patti Hearst.
