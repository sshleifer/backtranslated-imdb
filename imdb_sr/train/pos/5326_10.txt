"The birth of Beatles," because he was an American television film, was released in the fall of 1979, has been the best film ever to tell the story of four Liverpool boys who have revolutionized the music industry and the world. As stated from the perspective of the former Beatle Pete Best. Performance from the whole band is great, but especially the appearance of Stephen Mackenne as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by a legend about the era of rock and roll, g. Dick Clark. One year earlier in 1978, he produced another TV film, which spent the test of time playing "Kurt Rusell" in the main role of another musical legend; "ELVIS". The film was directed by an unknown director named "John Carpenter" who directed other successful films such as; "Halloween," "Escape From New York," and "The Thing." The same can be said of the Director of the Birth of the Beatles, Mr. Richard Markuanda. Among many he continued to direct other theater blockbusters such as "Star Vars Return of the Jedi", "Eie of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge". The only other film that tells the story of Fab Fouro I know is Back Beat, who had theatrical release in 1994. However, the critics did not care about it, nor did the public, because they did not have a long lifetime in the theater. The birth of Beatles is a very charming and simplified film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the struggles and difficulties that have passed and ends at the height of success when they arrive in New York and appear in the Ed Sullivan show in 1964. I recommend this film.
