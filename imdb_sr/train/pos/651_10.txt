** Possible spoilers ** I love this film and I have no problem staying awake because of that. It reminds me of me at 20, except that this is even better. As Veronica says, two chickens at once. It makes me stiff, an optional conversation, and two real women, not whores who tease us at every step. And I'm entering into conversations. Even if they are completely b. Sometimes, so what? Every fish I've ever talked with and who is high on myself is usually full of the same unreasonable meaningless, unsuspecting suicide. philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and just as reasonable as other b. Philosophical chickens are often in astrological charts. The only thing that deals with this film is that the guy is almost as feminine as a woman, he is in the same bs. and craving. The black chick is actually the most influential person there. I think it's kinda funny that Brineta got so obviously that she involved Veronica. She would like to drag a little blonde from Alexander, but Veronica is playing. She's brilliant. Makes a brunette think that there is something between them, and then steals a boy-child / man, which is convenient just because they appear to be from the same age group. The black woman knows that she had an end to the end, when she put her face in her hands while Marlene Deitrich sang in the background, which, paraphrasing, has a million pairs in Paris tonight, but I only have that refrain. /> But is it true that Alec and Veronica are eventually married? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-turbulent relationship that ends with a breakup before marriage. They are too selfish to be anything interconnected, not stones. The film still likes me. She entertained me, she had a nice look, and she was sexy.
