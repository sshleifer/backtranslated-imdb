"Mouse in the House" is a very classic cartoon Tom and Jerry, faithful to their tradition, but with their own jokes. It's hysterical, hilarious, very fun and pretty fun. Artwork is also of good quality. This short is not just that Tom is trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and tries to capture the mouse as "only one cat will be in this house - this is a cat that catches the mouse." If you ask me, in this cartoon there are many funny gags. The funniest thing for me is, for example, when Mummy Two Shoes sees two lazy cats sleeping and sarcastically saying "I'm glad to enjoy the siesta" and hope they are satisfied because she did not have two cats sigh. Another fun joke is when Tom disguises himself in Mamma Tvo Shoes and bangs Butch by ticking, and then Butch makes the same trick to Tom. Of course it is, even more ridiculous than that, when the real mummy appears two shoes and both (stupid!) Cats think they are seen dressed up in mum, and then they both attack the "back" - lol. It's natural for her to get angry and when she gets angry, she's not someone she screws up with. But even Jerry did not win this time, because he was also excluded.
