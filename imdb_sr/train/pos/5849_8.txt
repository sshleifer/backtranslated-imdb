Damn right ... ... this show was thrilled in the day and still continues to outstrip the cartoons today. I can not wait to find some DVDs to share with my little guy and see the same spark in his eyes. I already met him with Voltron (5 lions, not 15 vehicles), and I laughed when he told me one day "Dad ... you surely watched some great cartoon movies when you were a kid!" How is that cool. Come on, Hollywood, dip this and run it live. It can not be worse than Spiderman 3 ... Man ... man ... 2007 was pretty sloppy so far for summer movies. OK, now I will draw out <br /> <. Br /> Cheers
