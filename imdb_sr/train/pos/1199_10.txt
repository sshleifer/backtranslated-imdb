This is the most powerful and exciting performance Robert Tailor has ever given. Even surpasses his beautiful performance as "Johnny Eager", which comes full 14 years after this film. His gaze is still a miracle to see, but now he has maturity that gives him an edge in this big, violent role. Charlie Gilson (Tailor) is the last of his breed, a bison hunter who kills not because of money, but because of pleasure. His wild killing is not only buffalo but human beings, it is stunning to watch. He is essentially a lonely person who needs people around him, but he does not like him because of his sociopathic behavior. His partner is Sandi McKenzie (Stevart Granger), who is sick of a hunt, and he just goes because it is a failure in anything else. On the way, Charlie kills an Indian family and grabs the beautiful Deborah Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her, but she sees Sandya interested in her. The grunge is sad to watch, and he's sorry for the hunt, eager to go with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as a drunken tan is beautiful with his wise cracks and accordion. Russ Tamblin plays half-racing trying to fit into the white world. The group is a weird mix of good and evil, young and old. In the end, Tailor was scared of the bison, as many hunters had, and escaped Sandi with a girlfriend. Upon returning, that night, Sandi went with her wife, setting Charlie on a rampage of killing in search of Sandi and having a girlfriend for herself. The final confrontation comes in a snowstorm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. It's Tailor's movie to the end, and he was really an underestimated actor at that time.
