Also known as "Water Lily", this film talks about two girls as they break into the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and it works well. It gives enough time and space to get to know different characters and to connect in some way to them. Using a small barrel, there is additional pressure on people who play because everyone else has a little more time than normal, but people who play in this movie are well tolerated. Everyone is completely convincing. The visual setting is great, especially underwater images in the pool give a good effect. Many films have been made on the same subject, and this does not really stand out above any one. She pulls out some "standard" pressure methods from a high hat and works on them. It's not bad, it's not at all, but it's certainly not good, and I think it might have been better to take some less explored angles. 7 of 10 synchronous swimmers
