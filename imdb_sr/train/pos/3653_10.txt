Why a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley plays in this common movie ??? !!! Actors give good performance (Elizabeth Berklei as a girl with Barbie, Elea Keats as a girl without a mother and Justin Vhalin, a guy forever reduced by her torment), but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original. I can not believe a movie like this is produced for a big screen! Julie Corman (Producer): Are You Crazy? !!!
