I really enjoyed this - I'm a big fan of films that mess with your mind and leave you with lots of questions and ideas for a debate, and this was a great example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at it (well, almost always. Let's forget about Jabberwocky and the Grim brothers, shall we?). and the avoidance of paradoxes - the way the events in the past and the future intertwined and added each other. It was and very well done aesthetically - the artistic direction was really great, and I want I could see it on the big screen. Future scenes have had similar feelings for Brazil in many ways, and even the current scenes were often really visually striking. I do not like much, Bruce Villis and Brad Pitt, and they both gave incredible performances here. Pitt specifically - I saw one or two films before I realized that he actually could act (contrary to what I initially thought), but this one really exceeded them. In fact, at one point I asked my friends: "Are you sure this is Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most striking success in his career (though certainly not too much).
