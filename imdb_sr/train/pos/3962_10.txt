Wonderful James Stevart, Vera Miles. What makes this historic film dealing with the FBI is such a good family element involved in a 35-year career, as Stevart showed in the film. The film shows the history of a large investigative agency. He deals with plots of air bombs, killing Indians in Oklahoma for real estate, fighting organized crime, the Nazis and communists in that order. The human element never fails, while Stevart cheats Vera Miles. They raise three children until Miles's heart disappears every time Stevart goes on a mission. Look for a short but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton. Years later, he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967, "The Graduate." The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He must have brought the FBI to a couple. True, this can be seen as a right-wing propaganda, especially with Stuart's realistic views, but this is well done, historically informative, and the family's view is so well displayed.
