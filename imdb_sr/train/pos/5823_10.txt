The Micro Phonies are there the best. In this short film, trio are masters working in a recording studio. In the end, they get a glimpse of Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintire) who sings the voice of spring. The voice is incredible. Curly and Drags are heard by Mrs. Bikbi (Simona Boniface). My name is Curli Senior Cucaracha. The three puppets eventually go to a party where Curley will be dressed. They play the voices of spring and everything goes well until Moe breaks the record on Curley's head. In the end, they use a seal of light until the baritone recognizes and turns them off. Alice Van Doren catches the boy screaming and hides behind the curtain to help them. Everything is fine while the Baritone does not ask how Curley sings without the help of a phonograph that reveals Alice behind the curtain. Three puppets were found to be fraudulent, but Alisa's father discovers the talent of his daughter and agrees that she should become a singer. They strayed from the room. Perfect.
