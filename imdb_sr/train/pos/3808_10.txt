I voted for 10 out of 10 simply because it's the best animated story I've ever seen for some time. The animation is stunning. The art behind each and every landscape was beautiful. From color to light to standard art. I was stunned. Moving beyond the beauty of the screen, you are immersed in a story that is both timeless and at the same time fresh. Character development is short, but these moments are exactly what the viewer needs to refer to what and why and how the character came to where they stand. I'm impressed with the whole affair and I think this is definitely for the whole family.
