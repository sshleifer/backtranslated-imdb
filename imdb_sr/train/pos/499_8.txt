Pilot Enterprise has one thing that was missing from the original Star Trek: A dose of real, flawed personality. The next generation's utopian characters were murdered, they were so noble that they were incredible. I also like the underworld that people are bitter about Vulkans. It's funny to see them as pretentious snobs. That's why I'm looking forward to seeing people become the dominant race between them, although I do not think it would work within the timing of the show. The only negative ones that popped up were "a quick end to the end in 2 hours" of the feelings of the end, which is common among many Trek shows. The second was shameless digging for a rating by a few pointless sexy scene. It was unreasonable, a good science-fantasy show should be able to stand alone, without attempting to insert a pre-teen audience into a skin. But it's not my job to make the show profitable, so oh well. Let's see how the next episode will be.
