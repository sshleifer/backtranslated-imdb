First I'd like to say how great this is. It is astounding and sometimes shocking. At least 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely endure a boring movie, but this is just not bored. It's like a way through humankind. His sharp realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is a story of two forces (VOIGHT and Hoffman) that build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) is a naive Texas kid who comes to New York to enrich him with fun women. Soon she meets Rica 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), a poor man who can barely pay the rent. Ratso becomes Joe's "manager", but soon two men can not find Joe's job that results in theft of food. As they try to survive on the streets of New York, we realize how difficult it is. They can not bring Joe to the girl until they meet the lady at the party. Joe earns some money and soon Joe takes Ratso to Ratso's place for a dream, Florida. The last five minutes are the heart of breaking some of the greatest moments in the film. From COVBOIA MIDNIGHT we get a sharp and sometimes disturbing urban look at life.
