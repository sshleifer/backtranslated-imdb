OK, first of all, ignore the last person's review. They admit they have fallen asleep through it, so it's no wonder they did not understand what's going on !!! As the thriller / horror go, this film is not so bad, it's certainly very watchable. It is from the introductory scenes that you get the general idea exactly what will be the cause of all the folly that follows, and come to an end while you are right when everything clearly clarifies. film, it was pretty spooky, and as the old films went, it was transient. It's great to watch late at night! I give him a generous 7 out of 10.
