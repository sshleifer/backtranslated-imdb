Watching Before the Devil is considered one of the best experiences in the cinema. I am interested in my mixed response to the film - and for me, the extreme opinion suggests that the film touched something that was accepted or rejected by the general public. It's one of those movies that stayed with me, and I keep thinking and thinking about it. Is it sure that the DVD will brighten up some other topics and elements of film creation? Which includes: the return of Sidnei Lumet's film, a time-changing technique, a narrative, an extraordinary combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well, a masterly direction, a relatively rare focus of Hollywood films that give male characters and their condemned fight to become an open check a book for his wife, the insufficiently presented but still resonant performance of Marisa Tomei, and, of course, the top Hofmann with a central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the film. Phev! Surely a masterpiece movie. Imagine my disappointment with an impatiently anticipated DVD - just to find no comment, not behind the scenes, without interviews, without add-ons. Hey - Distributors - fix it!
