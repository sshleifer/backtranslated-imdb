I just want to say that this may be biased, because I am a film producer. Still, I will maintain the sense of dignity. The star of the movie, Oscar Ovies, gives a great performance like Jeff Grinderlin, a nebbish hypochondar that spends more time on care than on life. It brings a certain touch to its character that really allows the audience to connect with it, citing its mind often and with the feeling of sharp comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is a permanent carrier, who, without him, would collapse on himself. His friends also provide a hand in Jeff's life, often making choices for him, instead of letting him use his free will ... which has often neglected both here and there. Writing is great, and conversations run like scenes from Kevin Smith's film, and half Ben Affleck boo-hoo fest. The camera's operation is low in some points are poor, and the sound could also encourage, but the shows swayed less detail. It is also supported by a beautiful sound record with local talents and an exceptional composer. All in all, this was a delicacy. A rare jewel, among many jewelers.
