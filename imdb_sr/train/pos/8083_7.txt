If you read the books, forget the characters that Tolkien built in your head. Representation of hobbits, dwarfs, etc. She had a 'disnei' treatment. Dark riders are great, and as I have always imagined from books. Cinema is a great movie, mixing live and animation movements to produce incredible effects for the year. I would just like that he (Bakshi) got the money to complete his ep. Worthy is to have a video, because they will be worth a bit after 2001 Lord of the Rings !!
