Villiam Viler was due to direct this adaptation of the Mossu Hart game hits with the music / recruitment of the poster-vivant, but his internal military duties intervened, and the most unusual helper: George Cukor. The "Women's Director" has a secure touch in many of the documentary training aviation corps training, and invests them with more irreversible human beings than the genre is generally permitted, especially during the war. Surely, the gee-wizard (and completely white, except one unpaid Sino-American recruit), a bunch of newcomers is more beautiful and better than in real life, and the speech about home and mom and the wife and child becomes quite dense, but it's an effective propaganda and undoubtedly exciting. It is also significant for all male military actors, some of whom did not appear for several years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in love, like Andrevs Sister), Peter Lind Haies, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb and Don Tailor. Also, for a very early look at Judy Holliday, who does not appear for an hour and a half in the picture, but has some good small sequences like O'Brien's worried-sick wife Brooklyn. It is a shame that his rights are complicated and the only press he knows is 16mm; Obviously, after the Tventieth Century Fox issued it (to significant success), the rights returned to the army, and if there is a good 35mm print, it probably lies somewhere in the Pentagon's womb. It is dishonest and dashing in places, but it also notes the rigor of military training and the vivid horror of war, and deserves to be seen wider.
