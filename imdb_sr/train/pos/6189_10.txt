Who could imagine - Hal Hartlei creates a film effect for Sirian, retaining his distinctive idiosyncratic style. Fusion is very fun. After ten years I did not see Hall Hartley movie, but I cautiously addressed this film. His great productions in the 1990s impressed critics and the audience with their unique style and dialogue. Previous directing films featured colorful characters and offered close-to-life observations - often in Long Island, New York or in New York - which were unusual and discerning. from the description of this film as a "spy thriller". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley is able to fulfill her well-established style and focus to produce a very original drama of international intrigue. It works in a number of ways than you can imagine. Hartley's film retains the dialogue and focus of characters that are his trademarks along with a unique cinematic style. Moreover, it is very convenient considering the current situation in the world and the state of war triggered by dark elements from all sides. Hartley brought all his skills to something new - a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as the Syrian. He really comes to his own. The actors perform well the interpretation of Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey fans will see her in full flower, still with us and even more mature and beautiful than before.
