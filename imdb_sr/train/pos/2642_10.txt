Indeed, this is a film that "heats the heart". He won the George Peabody Award, winning the "Roots" award, so he can tell you something about the essence of this film. I'm looking at the Internet how to order this film since my ex-eugen Eugene Logan, the co-writer of this film, has died for several years, so I no longer have the opportunity to get information from him. I wish his only grand-daughters saw this film, and they would give this wonderful story to their great-grandchildren. My eldest daughter was seven years old at the time she was broadcast on television and since then I'm looking forward to seeing her again. One of my friends said it was her favorite movie. I will not "spoil" this movie.
