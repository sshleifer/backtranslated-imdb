I'm definitely not in the target audience of this movie. I am a man almost 50 years old who only recently came into the world of an independent film. It happened quite by accident, I discovered a movie called Clerks late in the evening on television. The first two things I noticed about this movie were: 1) technically amateur and 2) brilliantly written. When I read the interview with the director in the local newspaper and said that one of his influences was officials, I started to be interesting. When he said that his main influence was the agent of the station, the movie I saw on DVD a week earlier, I decided that I had to go and check. The result can be described in the same way as the clerks, although the two films are nothing like content. Both films suffer from technical ghafs that overcome the stunning writing. While the clerks are given in the life of a man who has nothing at all in his life and is afraid to pose difficult questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is about a man who seems to be forced to be permanently employed, he is always running to one or the other way, filling his life with small things so he will never have to deal with the big one. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and touchy. I can say from watching that not much has changed since my growing up, young men still have the same problems as always. The writer dresses these problems and topics in modern speech, he treats miraculously sincere characters and makes them totally convincing. As far as indie cinema is concerned, it may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but from the artistic, it's very close.
