Residents of apartments in Manhattan have to deal with all kinds of inconveniences. The worst is the lack of space in the closet! Some people who eat all the time use their chains and dishwashers as places for disposal, because the cabinets have already been filled! Roman Erica Hodgins, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can not stand a cramped apartment in which he and his wife Muriel must share and two daughters. Jim Blandings, Madison Ave. executive, he had it! When he sees an ad for living in Connecticut, he decides to look. Apparently, the first owner, Jim was deceived by the real estate to buy a stationary house that he took to inspect him by an unscrupulous agent. This is just the beginning of his problems. Whatever it is wrong, it is wrong. The architect is asked to come up with a plan that does not work for the new house after it was first destroyed. As one problem leads to another, more money is needed, and everything that is going to be the original cost ends up in the inflated price Jim could not afford. The film is fun because of the three principals in it. Cari Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character that plays and most benefits from Jim Blandings. Mirna Loi, she was a wonderful actress who was always effective and played against the g. Grantu. The third character, Bill Cole, the old guy Mirna, who became a lawyer for Blandings, is mild and ungodly, as Melvin Douglas showed him. One of the girls Blandings, Joan, plays Sharin Moffett, who had an unusual resemblance to Eva Marie Saint. Big Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but there is not much work to do. The film was kindly photographed by James Vong Hove, who clearly knew what he was supposed to do to make this movie much better. Direction H.C. Potter is light and he has succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies.
