I watched this film only once 25 years ago, and to this day I've always told people that this is probably the best movie I've ever seen. Given that there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue, I found that the film was enchanting and I even found breath to make no sound. I would highly recommend this film, I would like it to be available on DVD.
