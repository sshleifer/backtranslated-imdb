For the viewer who comes to him long after his recording, "Vinchester '73" has something in common with "Casablanca". As you watch it, you get the feeling that you watch a series of clichés that are so often encountered in the genre; then you realize that the clichés became clichés only after you copied them from this movie, and that they were so widely copied because this movie was so big. In other words, this is a fundamental work. Vinchester '73 'is a joy to watch. Broad lines of action are somewhat predictable, but mainly because you've seen them so many times in later movies, but still contain a series of surprises that surprise you. Dialogue, pacing and Man's direction are great. Stewart is especially glowing, and if you're a fan, this is "obligatory to watch," but he is not alone in delivering good performance. It is interesting that many of the most thoughtful and / or witty lines go to lesser characters. Since this makes these characters (much more) than cartons, he has provided additional realism to the film. This is an incredibly underrated movie, and it's worth keeping an eye on. On the DVD there is an interview with Stewart, which gives the background of the film.
