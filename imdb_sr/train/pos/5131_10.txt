Jammin 'Blues has been nominated for the Oscars since 1944, which is basically 10 minutes of improvisational jazz in one long jam. Marie Briant sings "The Sunni Side of the Street" at one point for the movie climax, and then with Archie Savage, he raises jitterbugs to bring this fun "jam session" to an exciting end. The director Goyn Mili was a photographer and this experience shows in some of the double exposure scenes of some musicians who make this one of the most innovative angles of the 40's. According to some notes, I read one of the musicians who was white and had to be filmed in silhouette in response to the social attitudes of that time. What a shame. However, this most unusual movie from that time is available on YouTube, so if you like jazz, I suggest you search it there.
