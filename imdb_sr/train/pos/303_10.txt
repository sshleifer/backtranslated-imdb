Since the day I saw this movie when it came out in 1981, it was one of my 3 best favorites. The purchase I wrote for Amazon is below, and I am only delighted to finally come out on DVD 10/17/06 - the 25th anniversary of the film. The latest credit in this movie explains the appeal - "Thank you to the people in Manhattan on whose island this is being filmed." A charming and humorous romantic comedy, this is a love story written by the New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is original) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, Ansonia, the old FAO Schwarz, Plaza, Rocky, Chez Brigitte, and Citi Limits that was country and western клуб). The impression is that the entire acting team is thrown on the screen as well as on the screen, and this intimacy is clearly transmitted. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. She not only left Dorothy Stratten, but also Audrey Hepburn's last performance (she had a kamaja after this film) and her inner beauty pierced from the screen. Buy it, make a big bathtub with popcorn and skirt with someone you love.
