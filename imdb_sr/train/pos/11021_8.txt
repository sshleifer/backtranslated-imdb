After the success of Die Hard and his sequels, it's no wonder that in the nineties of the last century, the film "Die Hard on ....." was caught on the wrong man, the wrong place, the wrong time concept. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on the mountain just to save Sli 'Stop or My Mom will shoot Stallone's career. Cliffhanger is one great dream for collectors, especially those who are experts in hiking, jumping in the base, aviation, facial expressions, acting abilities. All in all, it is full of excuse that the film be cast as an over-pile of garbage. Stallone even managed to get out of the horse! However, if you forget all the nonsense, it is actually a very nice and indescribably fun romp that brings a lot of excitement, and inadvertently, a lot of laughter. You need to love John Lithgovs of Sneer Evil, his beating every box of bad, and best of all, a permanently troubled and unfortunate agent of "exile", Rek Linn as Travers. Maybe Henry was in the "serial killer portrait." "But Michael Rooker is worthy of attention because of bold performance like Hal, he insists on constant screaming in the painful disbelief of his conquerors" that no one hurts anyone " And while he certainly can not be, it really looks like Ralph Vaite's Frank character is rubbing while a girl falls to her death. Also, one should mention the former actor in London, Craig Fairbrass, as a bad British, who comes from a breeder while using Hal as a human football, Yes, you can not help with that enjoyment, H But it took a good kick. So forget about better judgment, who care that 'it would never happen', lower your acting expectations, increase the volume and enjoy! And if you are looking for Kaulen, he is the one carrying a helicopter.
