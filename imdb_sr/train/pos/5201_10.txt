The Human Tornado is a campus blakploitation film from the '70s starring comedy from the night club Rudi Rai Moore in his perhaps most elusive role so far. The film talks about the story of Dolemite, a bad asshole who entered the wrong side of a white, racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife. Dolemite barely managed to escape, a trip to sunny California to visit an old friend, nightclub owner (and Mrs. Dolemite 'ladies') called the Queen Bee. However, it seems that the rival owner of the nightclub with the Mob connection tried to fit on her racket, so Dolemite takes things into their own hands. Rudi Rai Moore shows many different talents in this important film, including a strong dramatic skills, mastery of kung fu, impressive singing voice (giving two songs on the soundtrack), touching, compassionate way with the ladies and overall charisma and sharp comic sense of time. This film has everything, people: deep conspiracy, fierce action, comedy laughter-minute, beautiful women in trouble, the ending of jokes ... what more can you ask from the movie?
