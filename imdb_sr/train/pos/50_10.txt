My children accidentally stopped in this movie for an evening and how things started to play, it really caused my interest. I had to go into the bowl so I recorded them on dvr, so I could later watch the rest. I just finished watching him, and the front of my shirt must be soaked after the buckets cry. It was a great movie, although I could almost feel the pain and suffering that these girls experienced. And never for a million years I would not have guessed the reason why Alissia went from this beautiful girl to the anti-social gothic. It was probably WHY my shirt was soaked because I experienced the same pain that Alissia felt. I would not ask for this film, but I'm happy to see it. Very touching, very touching. Great for those who like good drama or tear.
