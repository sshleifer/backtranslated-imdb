This film documents the circle of Harlem circles in the mid-eighties. Much more fun than Palazzo Volpi, although he's sick, this movie is a real jewel of misery. A man can not help but sympathize with characters for their freak. The only goal of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of garbage and gloves. Here the biggest garbage genius is extremely well documented and neatly glamorized. The predisposition of the characters to the idolatry of everything that glamorously inspires even more worship of the characters themselves, creating the effect of the "phenomena of the phenomenon" that this film makes to the artwork.
