I saw this film once or near its edition 36 years ago (1969). Although now I can only remember a portion of it, I am looking forward to seeing it again. Parts I remember, rightly or wrongly, include a mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering some sexual services to men in the background of a closed truck in order to receive military information from him. The music was especially impressive and the emotions that aroused in the Gone Vith The Vind and I would like to hear it again. There must be some commercial reason or reason why this film is unavailable. Anyone know why? I doubt it has anything to do with the lack of quality or interest.
