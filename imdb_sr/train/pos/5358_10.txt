This is one of the great films of the 80's in my collection that I'm constantly thinking about. Running man is one of the best and most diverse Arnold movies today, and when I first saw the man running, I was so excited to see this kind of movie. I'm just admiring all the fights and this is a really special movie. There are also Jesse Ventura, legendary professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Marie Conchita Alonso, Iaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Davson and Thomas Rosales Jr. He was killed in films such as Universal Solder, The Lost War, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2, and among others. All Arnold fans should love this film from start to finish because his action is full, the star is filled, and one of them is Arnold's best so far!
