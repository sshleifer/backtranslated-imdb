"Days" is a typical family drama with a small catch - you have to refer to the emotions of character in every way possible so you can really appreciate the show. Possible connections for those who are not familiar with the show] The story, obviously, for all the people who watched the show, is the world of Day Cooper, a middle child of the family. She records her days with her family and hopes to one day become a rich and famous writer for her observations. His family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister, and a genius-a little brother. The first episode, which will sound a little stupid after John Scott Shepard created this situation - and the sister and mother get pregnant. This is the first situation the writer strikes. Then his father leaves the job at a law firm. The youngest son gets a panic attack. A middle child is fighting with a nurse boy. This is all in one day. / / Spoilers] I admire this show. I do not know. He's a bit shitty, but I like him. First I thought that the work on the camera was tremendous, but then I used it and I started to like it. I enjoyed quiet conversations under the dark light. I liked the intimate emotion of the show. I liked the low-budget style. I like acting. I admire it. Then I find myself wanting the second season of the Day. I slowly became a fan, while the 6-episode broadcast on ABC ended. It's a really good show and it's nothing like OC. The two of them have nothing in common. I hope that fans will stop comparing them. And if you can call Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you will love this show. Much.
