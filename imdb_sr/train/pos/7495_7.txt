Dvight Frie steals a performance in this as a stupid young man (who seems to be mentally handicapped) blamed for vampire killings, especially after discovering his love for bats that he likes to hit and gives to friends who do not doubt. gifts'!. In addition to all this, there is a fun mysterious story that includes the above-mentioned murders. Underrated.
