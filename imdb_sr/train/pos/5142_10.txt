It's easy to make really general comments about this movie. The fact that this is one of the remaining remaining Japanese films from that era causes people to say that he "started Japanese cinema" and that "unlike anything the West has ever done." The latter of these two comments is particularly inaccurate because Kinugasa himself acknowledged that "Kaligari" ripped many times. But the style was supposed to be muted, and it does not take away the significance of this film. What we have here are experimental themes and compositions built on already established visual styles, opening the door for a really brilliant application of narrative and reality. For this purpose, the madman is an ideal environment and the writers knew it. This is a significant film, and we need to make every effort to follow it. 5 of 5 - Basic
