Anyone who finds this movie is boring is a hopeless nonsense that should keep movies about automotive and romantic comedies. This film is curly and there is no boring moment. Why? Because it consists mainly of intelligent dialogue between real people at the time of the crisis and describes in detail their efforts to survive the crisis. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! This is what characterizes almost all Rohmer's films and that's why many do not like them. They prefer action. Well, let them spend the rest of their lives watching movies about the action, while they will continue to look for such films with taste and discrimination. Rohmer has always been accused of being "talc". Well, yes, it's a compliment to me, not criticism. Shakespeare was a conversation. Is there more difficult game than Hamlet? Whenever the subject or theme of an artwork is made up of ideas and conflicts about value, a necessity must be a discussion of these ideas and values, and that is mainly what it is about. Aristocracy and noble generation of egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends who have undergone the final test when that friend takes what we believe is the wrong way; the value of human life and the responsibility to save this life, even if the person who owns this life is not so beautiful, or even despised. (Everyone has ever heard of Dostoyevsky, or "Crime and Punishment?") This is what this film is about. The two tracks in this movie are flawless, as if they were born to play these roles. Luke Russell, who is English and speaks French as a second language, is particularly brilliant. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Perhaps this is the last film of this master.
