Frankly, I do not understand why this movie was so big a flop in publicity. Sharon Stone certainly did not lose any of her charisma and "touch" from the "Basic Instinct". I voted for this movie 10 and I'm telling you why: The game opens in London this time. London is a city in which Catherine Tramell moved from the BI1 event. It again proved to be a manipulation of its class - challenged. She's "fucking your brain" like Catherine with such skills that in the end you're not quite sure who the real bad guy is. As for the technical part of the film: The only real obstacle is the B team of actors. Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the actors in relation to her and Michael Douglas, etc. In the first part. I also think BI2 would have been better that Sharon Stone was younger, but still quite astonishing in her appearance and only improved her charisma. Their "assistants" B-rates are not so bad, although I would like some bigger names for the actors. I think there are pretty good improvements in the basic story. I think this is a far better thriller than many of the Hollywood nonsense that has been deployed lightly these days. The action is great, it's easy to see it technically, you can not snore halfway through the film, and most importantly - health is on.
