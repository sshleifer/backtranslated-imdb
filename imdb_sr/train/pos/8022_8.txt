Muppet Jim Henson have been my favorite since childhood. This film makes me feel like a child again. Okay, the Muppetts came back with Miss Piggy and Frog Kermit and their friends. The assumption is that they try to get on Broadway in a music show, but not in New York. You will see the comedy of the then mayor of the city of New York Echo Koh. In any case, the film is 25 years old this year and I hope that today's children will learn to appreciate the carelessness of the Muppets band. The issue with the show is that Kermit is gone and the gang has to find it in New York. It's worth watching children, and even sentimental adults like me.
