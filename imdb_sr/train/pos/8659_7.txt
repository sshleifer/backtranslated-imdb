In a way, this film reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash". You remember Vhoopi Goldberg on the destruction machine? Vhoopi zoned off for tranquility? Vhoopi like Blind Lemon and imitating Mick Jagger? Great moments shot on the film for sure, but the movie is still bullshit, right? That's how I feel about "Rich In Love". A man sees his wife singing for the first time. Post-coital teens talk about the nature of love. Albert Finnei eats a spoon of ice cream, and in the second scene he has a wonderful moment of waking up with his absent wife. Alfre Voodard adds another colorful character to his wardrobe. But there is just a whisper of a plot and you can not wait to start it. Only when Ek-Go-Gos' Charlotte Caffei's The Graces restores a great pop song, the picture wakes ... and then it's over! This picture is equivalent to a lazy summer day deep South American.
