Somehow I liked the "lonely lady". Give Pia a break. It looks great and has nice eyes. What is there to love? The scene in which Rai Liotta was raped with a garden hose was crude and cruel. In fact, much of what is happening in this movie is cruel and cruel. But his film is ridiculous. Many films that are messy are not really bad. I liked this more from Dolina Doll, which was not only unpleasant but also boring. At least that was not boring. Pia is quite naked and seems to be wrong as a writer. Looking at how she talks about Pushkin and Bajron with a boy three times older, it's just incredible. I'm sure Pia is a good person in real life, she does not project a vibe of a writer. She looked much happier when she worked as a hostess for that guy from Saturdai Night Fever and wore a great disco dress. Several scenes are funny. The one he tells the actor that he is pregnant, and he turns his eyes and snaps at her to "stop hanging around", while he's practically crazy about every bimbo who is refusing. Pine scene of the nervous breakdown is good. It was probably an error to go on with the supernova on it (a whirlwind of floating faces and a frozen screaming - wow!) And its later catatonic tumult is somehow exaggerated. Speech acceptance is rustling, though. I want to see somebody in that drama class. But again, this is the garbage we are talking about. Any movie of the week could be worse.
