A classic movie drawn in two directions. For his benefit, directed by Ves Craven. On the other hand, the budget for a TV movie shows what could have been much more with a larger budget. It starts while Susan Lucci draws Robert Urichfamily into his claws and tries to convince him of the secret of her health club. His latest invention, a spaceship that can analyze people or things, is unexpectedly useful in his new neighborhood. Anyone who sees this should pay attention to Susan Lucci. Her appearance and performance had unexpected consequences several years later. The actor, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is the fan of this film and wrote a review of this film. Lucci became the subject of a portrait that followed the work of a girl named Catherine. Portrait of Lucia and Barbara Steele in "Black Sunday" was used as a reference for portraits of Catherine, which Armourae immediately withdrew. Probably because of the personal nature between the artist and Catherine. Thus, watching both films, we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of an unknown woman who would make an interesting movie.
