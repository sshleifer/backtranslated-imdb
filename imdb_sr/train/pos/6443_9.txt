Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. She was recommended a few weeks ago. I have never seen before, nor did I notice it, because it falls (so typical) into the category "Swedish film", and those who have risen (like me) with Hollywood productions tend to be skeptical of foreign films. Hell what a paradigm shift! The film touches me because I just hope that humanity can be changed in a better way. The Swedish village is just a pattern for all areas of the country where people live together - they are controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, prediction, concealed brutality, but also the ability to have fun, meet, sing ... the trigger from the outside to undo the mask of everyone keeps it) and allow them to feel that we are all just human beings with the desire to live our lives. I can never stop watching such stories, because it keeps my hope as described above. Five minutes with a story about Gabriel's song, including her performance, is one of my film events that have ever been! Thank you Kai Pollak only in these 5 minutes, which made me happy!
