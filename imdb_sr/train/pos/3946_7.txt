I found one and only comment on this film completely informative and too sharp, so I decided to write my own. The first time I saw this movie when it came out and captured it several times more then. First of all, let me say that the things that this movie is getting in the right way is what it pays for. It does not matter that there are some bad budgets and other mistakes. It's worth watching. The idea of ​​a film about visiting Walt Whitman's restrictive, limited Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario and reviving people is a brilliant mis-en-scene. The film is about the kind of humanizing catalysis Vhitman inspired people. And in that sense, that's right. The acting - especially Rip Torn (Vhitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. The script and dialogue are strong and devote proper attention to the customs and revolutions of that time. All in all, what's wrong? In addition, call another film in which Vhitman is so alive in life?
