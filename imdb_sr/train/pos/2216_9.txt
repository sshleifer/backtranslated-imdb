A historical drama and a story of age that includes free people colors in a pre-war war in New Orleans. Starts slowly, but pick up a couple after you've learned about the main characters and the right action can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of the Negroes, because they were free people. They may not have all the true white people, but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their ancestral ancestors. Young men and women in this story have to make their own choices about how to live their lives, whether to give the system a distortion, or to live with optimism and contribute to their community. I enjoyed all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
