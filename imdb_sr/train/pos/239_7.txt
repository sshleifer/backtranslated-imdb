I watched this on movies with my girlfriend at the time, and I can say that I did not have the best time, mostly because I did not know about Ned Kelly or his story. But since this is a biography, it's important to at least know what to expect from the character. I do not know if the way the events are true is true, or if everything is fictitious. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me believe that everything is true. I do not think it's shown as a peasant or thief, but that's just my opinion. This is a solid Western-type film for everyone's taste. Heath Ledger is as good as ever and sexy Naomi Watts fascinates the screen. Give this movie a chance if it is broadcast on the cable. Otherwise, I do not think I could recommend it.
