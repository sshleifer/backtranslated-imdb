I saw this movie when I was a kid. It blew me away. It was before the television day, so a film of this size could send a young kid into orbit. So much impressed me that I went to watch this film for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at this time were far ahead of their time. Sabu was a real pleasure, as Rek Ingram as Genie. I found myself singing "I Want to Be a Sailor" for months after the film left the city. I would recommend this movie to everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was a negative figure you would ever want to know. Also, June Duprez was never more lovely than in this picture. The color was extraordinary. Give this AAA movie!
