So when I was a kid, I got this movie as a gift, and my sister and I loved her. we'd watch all the time. when our friends came, we would have to sleep and watch the mountains with great sweets and grandfather's magic toys. Now I'm 21 years old and I still love this movie, some old friends and I recently gathered and watched it, we knew all the songs and danced and talked about how much we hated Profsters when we were little. One friend bought this movie and grandfather's magic toys for his 2 year old daughter because he wants to convey our love for this movie. This is truly a movie that you can allow your children to watch and feel safe, without violence, no bad language, only with a great number of great songs and important lessons.
