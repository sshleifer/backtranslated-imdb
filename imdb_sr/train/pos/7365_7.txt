This was very touching to me, because Spike and Heaton stayed together until this film, not to say there are not a few editions on the way. I thought the pursuit was left aside, and I think the relationship between them is two. I already assumed that Heat's intentions were so gaiety. My favorite scene had to be a part in which Heaton and Spike were stuck in the swamp, and Spike escaped. I must say that, if it was not our film studio teacher who made us look at this, I would probably never see it. All in all, I thought this film was pretty good and I would recommend it to any person who is a fan of British films.
