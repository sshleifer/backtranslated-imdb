It is a story of Siberian villages from the beginning of the 20th century to the 60's. It's about passion and feeling, about Russian soul and very romantic. This film is NOT action packed, it runs slowly. In the second part you can find great songs - Russian romances. It's much better than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this film moved to America and made Runaway Train for example.
