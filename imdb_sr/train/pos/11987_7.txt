Since it's been several years since I reviewed this classic, I decided to go back and see more in the depot, but first of all the insider notes of the film critics. This animated series is one of the ones I grew up with, it made my childhood joyful, made it great, today I miss some of these things that we obviously do not see as much as we did in the days, up to review ... Talespin, or Luftens Helte in Denmark is a great animated series, it's a lot like Chip and Dale, Ducktales and many of those old ones, so it's got a strange feeling that surround it, I can not remember this series as much as I would like to remember it. But, in my opinion, it was very large, there was a kind of message, not so wild from the message, but it's one of the Old, so I can be forgiven. Now I do not want to sound old or anything, but I feel like my time popped out of these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddie or anything else so weird, we have all these new or almost new shows such as Hannah Montana or something similar, yet I feel like we do not have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows as we did in the early days. Now I may be wrong, but I feel like the weather has changed a lot, to conclude that I would be thrilled to see these series as Talespin was again released on the TV screen instead of the new ones to bring me my cartoons from childhood, give them the children I have the other day, give them again ...
