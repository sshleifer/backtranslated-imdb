I have to say that the events of September 11 did not hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to get caught up in the destruction. I am the one who changed the station on the radio and the channel on television, if it were talk about towers. It was a pain to hear about it. When it was broadcast on TV for a year, and a day later, I shouted my eyes. The first time I cried out of the attack. I recommend this documentary. I watch him now on TV, 5 years later, and I'm still crying over the tragedies. The fact that this contains one of the only videos of the first plane that hit the tower is incredible. It was an accident, and see where she got them. These two brothers make me be here to help.
