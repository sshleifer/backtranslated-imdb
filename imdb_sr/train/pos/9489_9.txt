I'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story unfolds in the fictional state, but obviously it deals with the murder of Kennedy. A true and honest district prosecutor (played by Ives Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by Daslov (= Osvald), and although all other officials want to close the case, he is constantly investigating with his team. Br /> The script is written firmly and quickly and holds the tension to the end. Only the part that deals with Milgram's experiment on the authorities is (albeit not uninteresting) somewhat unreasonable. Final Sequence - Explaining who Ikarus - partially recorded in a slow motion movie and enhanced by Morricone Soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
