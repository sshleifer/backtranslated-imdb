Far from my favorite cartoon films Spielberg, after the Animaniacs. Even if the reviews were low, so what, I still enjoyed and loved, she was so funny and I loved actors, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and they were fantastic, the whole acting was brilliant, especially legendary Frank Velker. I'd like to see this cartoon again, it was so terrible and jokes were brilliant. I also remember the hilarious moment in which Brain is in, you hear his voice and he played PATB with this instrumental, it was fantastic, I adore it in those cartoons when the cameos appeared. I loved them
