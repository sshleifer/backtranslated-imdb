Ladies Man is funny loud funny, with a great variety of acting, as well as with some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the most entertaining love song ever written). Tim Meadovs plays the idiot surprisingly well and wrote some of the funniest lines you will find in any comedy. It's definitely worth buying every 6 months or so you'll laugh as hard as you did for the first time. / 10 and I urge you to vote! And remember the kids - "There are more movements in the ocean"
