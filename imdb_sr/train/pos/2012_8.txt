This is one of my favorite favorites. Great music and some funny parts. I laugh every time with Millie, and the maid is pretending to be a deberette, holding her gentle handkerchief while chatting, and foolingly polishing the furniture with her while chatting. I can never pass her French accent and I never become a problem because they are trying to take her as my boss. Seeing teenage Mel Tormo and very young Frank Sinatra, it's such a treat. My mom saw Frank Sinatra in the theater at the same time as this film came out. She said that they can not clear "bobbi-sokers" between movies (at that time you did not have to go between projections). This film shows how young Frank was attractive and attractive and allows you to appreciate his early talent. Victor Borge gets a little bit of his routine, which is a bonus. This is a fun movie with a cute, simple story. Very pleasant.
