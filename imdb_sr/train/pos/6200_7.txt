Henri Fool is a better movie. But this is the perfect way to watch a movie like 'Henri Fool'. To seriously understand Henry, his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Even when Shawn began filming 'Henry Fool' in his ear while Henri comes to the hill, this is completely manifested through 'Fai Grim'. Jokes that are more or less meta-jokes (on film writing and a joke) are good, but the opening of the movie is saturated slightly in them. Also, Hartley's use of Dutch angles during the entire film is disturbing, that, it is intent, but is felt forcibly and excessively used, it goes further than harassment, of what I would like to call boring. It's a film with a mistake, but you have to see any Hartlei or 'Henri Fool' fan. And do not listen to stupid reviews, do not watch this unless you've seen the first movie. The intrigue, the satire and the humor of this film is completely lost if you have not seen Henry Fool. It's a sequel. That's stupid.
