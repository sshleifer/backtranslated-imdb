Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your standard problem of a ruthless policeman who earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he took (38 and counts), he never stops going for bad guys. > When a top US tank called "Thunderblast" crosses the border into Mexico, it is thrown by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enrique) and Libyan Colonel Cartier (Henri Silva), who has come to terms with Russian guilty. The military personnel involved are kept as prisoners, chief among them Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who is by chance McBain's ex-girlfriend. McBain was then recruited by the army for a rescue mission. Busei may not have a physical presence of the word, somebody like Schvarzenegger, which would be another suitable trace for a film of this kind, but he is an explosion of a self-confident guy who is fast with the sages. Fluegel is a great female leader; She not only looks incredibly sexy, she also makes a phenomenal action. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez and always welcome Villiam Smith (as a Russian major) are a disgusting scum in the classic tradition of action movie. The support is quite full of well-known and reliable actors: L.K. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Vatson, Luke Askev, Danny Trejo and Cari-Hiroiuki Tagava. T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman supplies a script based on the story of Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Raia. It is a type of letter in which you know that writers have a tongue in their faces: they know that their material is absurd and cheesy, and they only entertain and throw credibility out of the window. Director of the action veteran Steve Carver keeps him on the move and delivers a respectable amount of shootings, explosions and general disorder. "Bulletproof" is a good party for action lovers who do not mind turning their brains out there and enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor. 7/10
