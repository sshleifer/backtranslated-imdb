I loved this outgoing republican series! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even difficult, the picture quality was not the best, but OK. Fencing in this series is also a bit bad, but not terrible. It only took a little longer to train. As I said, the story is EXCELLENT! You're just sitting and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! Music is great! It's the same guy who listened to music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, who listened to the music of Fightin Legion. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and legionary! I recommend this series. Bui it! I like what Reed Hadlei plays Zorro! He's funny, smart and brave! Tag: 6.
