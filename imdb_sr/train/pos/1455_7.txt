Mardi Gras: Made in China is a great film that describes how the two cultures have a lot in common, but are not even aware of the influence of each society on each other. David Redmon opens your eyes and allows you to see how workers in China produce beads that cost little and nothing is sold in America for up to $ 20. When Redmon asked the Americans about where these beads came from, they had no idea and seemed unfounded. When they told them that they were made in China for less than nothing with a terrible salary and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans looked sad, hurt, and somewhat repulsive, but did not look like they would stop buying beads after they learned the truth. When Redmon questioned workers in China, they did not know that Americans were carrying them over the door and paid for so much for these beads. The workers laughed for the purpose behind the bead and could not believe it. This film is a great movie that gives us something to think about in other countries other than ours. M. M. Pitts
