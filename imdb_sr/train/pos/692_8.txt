The first time I saw this movie at the festival. There have been many good films, but little has kept me thinking about it long after that, and one Insomniac nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a talented film maker. Shots were great. Casting was perfect. Dominic shone in his role as she perfectly produced. There was not much about his character to know, but wrote the story in such a way that we care about him. And Elen ... I can not wait to see where she ends up! He shows a lot of talent and I hope he will make some more movies. With all the millions of dollars that are trying to get a cheap excitement, Tess shows that all this does not need as long as there is a good story and actors. Honor everyone involved in this movie. And thanks to Tess and co. for distribution to DVD!
