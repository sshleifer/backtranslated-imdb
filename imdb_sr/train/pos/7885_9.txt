First of all, I need to start this comment by saying that I am a huge Nightmare in the fan of Elm Street. I think it's the biggest horror series ever. For me, Freddy is crazy! Of course, Freddi's Dead, who then tried to be the last chapter, is a strange movie. There is not the same atmosphere from the previous films. Freddy has a lot of time on the screen. Some people think it makes it less frightening, which I also agree with. And that, in my opinion, is the point. This film exists so that we can get to know Freddy better, who is who he is, how he has become a man who is haunting our dreams. For some people, it's a bad thing; it's better never to know, because it's more scary to not know why evil is evil. It is obvious that these people will not like the Halloween Zombie remake. To really enjoy this, you have to see things differently. It's not about the strange guy who is hiding in the shade of your dream land and waiting to scare you. This was the first, and it was great. As the years passed, Freddie was killing more and more people, and no one could ever get rid of him forever. Now is the time to learn about the nature of this evil, about the psychological aspects of Freddie's terror field. In addition to the story of Freddie's past, I really liked the atmosphere of the film. There are no more kids in Springwood, only crazy adults. Night scenes are great. Soundtrack is a great, especially introductory song "I'm Avake Nov" in Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, the Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can not believe it's so underrated. It may be misunderstood, or I have different tastes! In any case, all fans of Freddy should be watching. There are a lot of scary moments, as well as fun moments, and many cameas! Get ready for something different and you may not be disappointed.
