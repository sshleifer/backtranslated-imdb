Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelli Tony (Arkin) is your average ordinary high school student. Preparing for a great game to return home, trouble girls and growing hair in strange places? But the hair in strange places becomes a little out of control when traveling to Transylvania with his father (DA! McMahon) leaves him with a bad case of furball. Now he's condemned to walk the world forever young as an inferno how will Adam get the girls? Full Moon High is often not talk about it, but it's stupid and funny horror. Larry Cohen (The Vinged Serpent, The Stuff) contains as many gags as he can think of as a writer / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows a nice time in the main role. If you're accidentally a fan of lies like "airplane" and "student body", I think you'll have fun with this funny fest.
