I did not know what to do. I guess that's all about it. I have never seen such a movie and I doubt that I will ever again. Glover merges something that is unique to him. I think that I appreciate that you must read some of his poetry, maybe you will see one of his slide shows. I really like this guy, he's so bizarre that I can not help it. Note: I saw this film before finishing with its final assembly, so maybe what I saw and what others saw differently. I know, I suppose, if I decide to look at the movie again. I think I will have to be under the influence of drugs ...
