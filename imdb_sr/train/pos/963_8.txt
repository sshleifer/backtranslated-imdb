Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about having worked for a movie for kids, because I would hate to get him out of the movies I loved: Visitor K, Gozu, Izo, Ichi, Killer and Black Socioti Trilogy. He seems to be exploring the new territory lately and I think he has succeeded. Nevertheless, this was the first of his films that I saw in that direction, so I was nervous. From the rough I bought it without seeing it and I was happy to do it. The great Iokai war is the perfect movie for children, and the adults would like it. The whole movie reminded me so much of the movies I loved as a child: Neverending story, Labirinth, Back to Oz, etc. I enjoyed these films because they did not treat children as if they were stupid, nor did they. Dark moral principles are here, but it's just as stupid as any other movie for children. I did not personally interfere with CGI and prosthetics. I feel like they fit well and do not think the kids will notice. If you are a fan of Takashi Miike, you may not like this one. But I suggest that this be done. It proves that Miike is so diverse and talented as I have assumed. She continues to make her films Miike beyond these, which is very encouraging. For those people who are new to Takashi Miike and want something bright heart or dramatically like this one, I propose these other Miike movies: 'Zebraman' Happy Katakuris' Sabua 'and' Bird In China' '. Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
