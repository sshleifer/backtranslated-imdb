Old horror films are interesting, abound with shouts, lots of jokes, and a lot of humor that agree with it. "Blob" is a classic in his work. Steve McKueen (1930-80) plays a teenager who is trying to be a hero in his city. Going for a meeting with his girlfriend is typical for all teenagers. But when an old man finds the same falling object from the sky, he becomes a victim, and Steve helps him with the best he can. When it comes to teenage forces, this film really provides. I know that most teenagers had difficulty behaving when they were in danger, they had to learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save mankind. When adults in the city learned the hard way about the "blown" running, they must learn to trust teenagers and not allow their behavior to be better than them. The excitement was pretty sweet in the day, and in my opinion I think it was JELL-O! When everyone tries to stop the danger, the city is safe again, thanks to good old cooperation. I'm still eating and watching this movie all the time, if you do not like Jello, TOUGH! RATING 5 STARS
