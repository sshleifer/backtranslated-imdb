A war drama that took place in Louisiana in 1971. She follows a group of recruits through basic training, and then Tigerland - the exact display of Vietnam on the American soil, before they are sent. She focuses on two men - Booza (Colin Farrell) and Pakton (Matthews Davis) ... they meet, become friends, and deal with the leader of the squadron (Clifton Collins Jr.) and the boundary psycho (Shea Vingham). Br /> Amazing non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. It uses a handheld camera for most of the movie and uses digital video for combat scenes. It works very well - the film looks rough (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic. Farrell successfully covers her Irish brog and adopts a pretty convincing southern accent. His performance is wonderful - he is a very talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not that good. He is tall, muscular, very handsome - and very mild. The rest of the actors are still excellent. This film was cast by his studio. There was no star in it, a famous story and was considered "just another war film". He played only a week in Boston! It's worth capturing to a video or DVD. Also, Farrell and Davis have a long naked scene.
