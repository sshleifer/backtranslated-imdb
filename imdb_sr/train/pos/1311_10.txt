This is one of the best movies out there and speaks a lot about it for television. I really would like it to be on d.v.d. She played the newest police officer thrown into the serial killer case. When he broke up because he killed another kid, it was incredible. She is so alone, and she comes to her. When she talks about her mother! VOV! Steven Weber as a serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. That was Oscar-worthy. When it comes to killing children, it's terrible! When she realizes who she is! What a scene! They really do not make them any more like that. It was a real thriller, without being bloody.
