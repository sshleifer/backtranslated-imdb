This is one of those films - such as Dave, American Dreamer, and Local Hero - who retain the interest of viewers over and over again. Lightweight films rarely receive Oscars, but the one who did the casting for Soapdish deserves one. Even after the movie has looked and knows what's coming, it's still nice to watch how different facets are developing. True, all drama is melodrama; but it's perfectly suited for a soap background film. My favorite line comes from Vhoopi Goldberg: "Now why can not I write this way?" I think it's sad that TV and web censors insist on all these unnecessary sanitation.
