This will be a different review. I watched this movie twice on TV and I would like to have a copy because it talks about the city of Panama and the beach in the winter, which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I saw by Ashlei Judd and she was great and I enjoyed everything I saw. directed and written several films about Florida. This film tells me and I did not see anything I would compare it to. The lesson tells me less than the environment. Well, I told you it would be a different review.
