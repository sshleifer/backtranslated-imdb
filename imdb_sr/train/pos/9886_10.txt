This is a great movie visually. Pictures of the Mexican desert, the old palace, the characters in their vivid costumes ... it's all a real work of art. The story looks a little relaxed, but that's because it was not said to be realistic. It is taken from a book called One Year of Solitude, and it should be the evocation of an isolated, extraterrestrial atmosphere in Latin America "so far from God, and so close to the United States." The huge debt owed by Erendir to his grandmother symbolizes the international burden of the debt of Latin America, although it has many layers of meaning. for you.
