In the voice that begins with the movie, Billy Connolly, actor of the big group of the 70's, Strange Fruit, said that the reason for the lightning at the rock festival was to stop the Strange Fruit Set that God was in the 70's. Indeed, it was popular to turn off this era of music, and see punk as a welcome antidote. Although I agree that the superfluous was exhausted (as well as the misogynistic instincts that emanated from him), and as a punk, I am still a fan of what is considered a classic rock or glam rock, and this film about the long, strange reunion of Strange Fruit- and one of the reasons why filmmaking concerns people behind the scenes. Brian Gibson directed what she loved to do with Tina, about Tina Turner (while I had problems with the dramatic parts of the film, the music was very well processed), writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais co-wrote OBLIGATIONS and were behind the British TV show "OVER THE RAINBOV" and the Strange Fruit song were written by Foreigner Mick Jones (not to be confused with Mick Jones), so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about. Also, two band members are musicians by themselves (Bill Nie does not know about it, although he deserves it with his singing, and he certainly looks like a singer of that time, while Jimmi Nail was in a different British style. A TV show that was oriented to music, although I forgot my name, and he was in EVITI), and the rest are convincing. And as long as I say, many of the 70 bands such as Strange Fruit behave badly towards women, the film does not make the same mistake (except for the woman who follows Timothy Spall); As a gathering manager, Juliet Aubrei is a fairly good game of a completely rounded character. Other actors are also good, with a special commendation by Stephen Rei, who well manages the dramatic role without sentimentality. There are several plots that do not work, but all in all this is pretty comfortable. Oh yes, and music is good.
