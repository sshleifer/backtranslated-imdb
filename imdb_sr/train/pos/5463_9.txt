Very smooth, very pre-Hais code, and still very nice. I recommend that you watch this movie, even if you are not a fan of Stinwick. She is funny, she is sexy, she is worth - and she loves to get her! Barbara Stinvick is fantastic as a doozie hairstyle that rises in the world, perfectly portrayed in the bank building. John Wayne (in the dress!) He plays one of his first conquests. The last three minutes are a disappointment, but the sets, lines, clothes and everything else are added to the film on the rise vertically in the horizontal position.
