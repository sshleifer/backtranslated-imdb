OH VOV. I saw this film on the Irish international film Fleadh at Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were present and were then available for questions. WHAT IS A GORGEOUS FILM! Although stationed in Ireland in the midst of Catholic / Protestant antagonism, the story could have happened anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other. The horror that people can quickly take away when they are given the opportunity to repel their hatred and anger is beautifully embedded in a moving love story that fills with humor and fun. If this one is not picked up in the US, it would be really unfortunate. As for the stars and players who support ... THE FIRST RACE. I heard Orla Brady Irish Meril Streep. My opinion is that BETTER is from Meril Streep. They should call Meril Americans Orle Brady! And, a permanent and powerful portrait of Liam Cunningham, a simple and private man drawn into a political war, was brilliant. VISIT THIS FILM.
