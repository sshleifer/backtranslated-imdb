Unlike Tinselt's version of HELLO, DOLLI!, The adaptation of Jaia Presson Allen's screen at Broadway's thriller Ira Levin could not wait for this scenic incarnation to close before it was put on the silver screen, so the producers wisely decided to maximize your longevity Take the Vai run! The opening and closing of the film's scenes are being recorded in the intimate Music Boock at Nev Iork, where DEATHTRAP has been playing for almost five years. Even the final recording of the film on the theater scene is a version of the famous logo of the theater performance. (Although the markers have decided to go with the funny Rubik's icon for the movie cube.) Now, on cheap DVD releases, DEATHTRAP looks fresh and inventive as always. The actors are right (better than their counterparts on the stage), and site scouts should seize for finding a suitable spy house for our "one space, two acting trillers" in which it will be held. Opens up in surprisingly simple and innovative ways, director Sidney Lumet wisely marks any "new" material at the beginning and end of the film and leaves Levin the evil twisted center himself. The last scene of the movie is a great Hollywood departure from the board, and slightly undermines one of Levin's actions pointing to the earlier film [Helga (about the dagger): "It will be used by another woman for the game."]. However, like Robert Altman, PLAIER, our new finale helps the movie re-engage and blur the lines between the stage, screen and (can it be?) Of Real Life!
