We are talking about a low-budget movie and it's understandable that there are some weaknesses (without spoilers: an expert for sudden explosions and an insignificant alcoholic); but in general, you are interested in the story, most characters are nice and there are some original situations. I really like movies that surprise you to some people who are not the ones you want to believe, then turn around and turn the plot ... I applaud this on it. If you know what I mean, try to see the movie "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Kueens) from Argentina.
