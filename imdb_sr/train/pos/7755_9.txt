"Written in the Wind" is an irresistible, beautiful film, as only Sirk's director could do it. The film was immersed in a cane full of Freudian symbols, strange melodramatic and colorful contrasts. The link between financial success and moral decay is the main topic of the film. It seems that Sirk suggests that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. Still, I prefer to watch the movie as a prime example of what Sirk could do with kitsch material. The color palette is particularly impressive. The acting in the movie is also great. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (deservedly won the Oscars for Best Supporting Actress), who manage to keep the film afloat. The honor of Frank Skinner's pulsating result, the brilliant work of Russell Metti's camera (every shot is just a masterpiece) and a design department. Also, the title melody is beauty. It's an unforgettable movie.
