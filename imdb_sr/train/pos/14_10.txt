This film has a special place in my heart, like when I first caught it, teaching adult literacy. That sounded very true to me, and even an extraordinary student who I had at that time. There are scenes that swallow you with sudden emotions, and those that even put you smile on your face through clear identification with the characters and their situation. The excellent performance of Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, ranked by their best work, excellent turning by the young Marthe Plimpton, the inspirational storyline, and the fun music party makes pleasure and satisfaction. .
