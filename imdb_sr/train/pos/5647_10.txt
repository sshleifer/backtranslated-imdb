I do not want to bother everyone by repeating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! It was a great disgrace when it was canceled, and I hope that somebody will have a good sense to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that OUT ON DVD !!!! I hurried to the store and took a copy and I'm happy to say that it's as good as I remembered it. Garry Cole was a beautifully dark and creepy character, and all the actors were very good. It's a shame that the network has not continued. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys a genre and does not see him has to do it. You will not be disappointed. My daughter who was too young to see her when she was on television (she's 20 years old) is becoming very interested and will soon be a fan. She thinks she is "very weird" and enjoyed the episodes she saw. I can not wait to see episodes that are not broadcast. This shov rocks !!!!
