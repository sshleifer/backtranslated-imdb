I have greatly voted for how the acting was, not for content. He still gives me wimps after I read the book, and then I watched the movie. Two former prisoners are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe who was found by a prisoner. During driving, the tension starts to grow, as the soundtrack in the movie contributes to the overall expectation. After the killers finish work at the farm, the next morning, the remains of the family find a friend of the daughter church. The screaming of blood, as the scene descends on the phone with a cutting wire, really made my blood cool and gave me the winter. If the killers met their true destinies, it's a little comfort for this convicted family. Robert Blake was excellent in his presentation of Perry Smith. The book was also written by Truman Kapote perfectly.
