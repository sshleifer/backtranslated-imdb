The year was 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stevart) does not like people. He has only one friend he has and he is Ben Tatum (Valter Brennan), an old cute man. In Skagvai, they are in trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) took over the cattle. Now Jeff must only return it and drive across the US border with Canada to Davson. Now they have a group of other people from them, like the ladies of Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). These two enter the golden work. Acting work is excellent. Valter Brennan makes a great assistant to Stevart. Ruth Roman is brilliant, and Corinne Calvet is gorgeous. Jai C. Flippen is very good as Davson Marshal Rube Morris. It's fantastic to see Jimmy Stevart overcome Troubles on his way. It's just a man and his rifle. But he is vulnerable.
