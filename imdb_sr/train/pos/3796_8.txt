Jim McKai made one of the best movies you'll see all year. Quiet simplicity of this movie attracts you from opening and never let go. There is not one fake note in the whole movie. The handheld camera never draws attention and always where it should be. The three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real. There is not a single rhythm where the audience is reminded to watch acting actors. only real girls are trying to find themselves. There is no political program, hidden or otherwise. Special hats to Hugh Hefner who gave money to filmmakers. I can not wait to see what Mr. McKay will do next.
