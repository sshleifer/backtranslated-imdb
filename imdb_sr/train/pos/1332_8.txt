In 1594 in Brazil, Tupinambini Indians are friends of Frenches, and their enemies are Tupinikini, friends of the Portuguese. The Frenchman (Arduino Colassanti) was captured by Tupinambas, and despite the trial to convince him that the Frenchman is believed to be a Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes their slave and lives marvelously with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhaes). Later, he uses powder in the cannon left by the Portuguese to beat Tupinikine in the fight.
