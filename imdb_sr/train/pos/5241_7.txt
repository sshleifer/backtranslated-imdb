A great movie by Thaddeus O'Sullivan with powerful performances by a large number of British and Irish actors. The film works well with tough topics and effectively records hopelessness and a gloomy atmosphere in Belfast in the 1970s. Surprisingly realistically, he does nothing to celebrate any side in this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father who tries to raise a family without getting involved in trouble. On the other hand, he deals with a loyal gang who intends to propagate violence. Very interesting and, fortunately, fun. Do not expect any laughter. 7 of 10
