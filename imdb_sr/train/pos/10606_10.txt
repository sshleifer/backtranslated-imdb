I just finished watching this movie and I thought it was very pleasant. It's a quiet, small movie that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" performances. It simply leads you to the lives of people living in a small hamlet in the forest of North Carolina. Henry Thomas gives a good performance like Raymond Toker, a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods. Toker's search for baby's parents leads him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a slippery cone with a hidden motive. And David plays a bad guy to perfection. This film has a lot more than the first time it meets with the eyes. Filmed at a location in North Carolina and with a beautiful soundtrack of traditional music, it's worth watching.
