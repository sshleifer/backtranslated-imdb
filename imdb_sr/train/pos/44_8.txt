When they told me about this film, I thought it would be another movie. I was wrong. This film sends a powerful message about judging others. I was deeply touched. Everybody I met, I recommended this film. Nobody came back saying it was bad. Busy, he also did a great job with his role in this movie. I do not know much about her acting career, but the way she took off the end of this filling is great. At the beginning it was a bit slow. But after she went to the hospital .... wow, the film picked up again. I have no idea why this film was not spoken in the film world. My wish would be to post this movie again and advertise more ... because it sends a strong message in just an hour and a half.
