This is by far the most unbelievable film I've seen for a long time. The actors gave great images of characters in the film. The story is accurately shown. The story starts with a young woman from the British Isles and her father who travel with a steamboat in Nauvoo, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church and did not. She thinks she's funny she traveled and discouraged. She encourages him to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Here begins the story of the prophet Joseph Smith. The film accurately depicts his life and history of the LDS Church history at the same time. It was sometimes graphic, but it was necessary. The emotional expression was very convincing, which caused my emotions to be exhausted. Shooting was great. The way the story was presented was touching. After the film was over, we sat there and we could not move. I was stunned. For people who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, I encourage you to see this. If nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I encourage you to see it. This will increase your testimony of this incredible man. This must be seen.
