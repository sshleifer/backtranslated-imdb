The story of ghosts, (New House) is a great horor story. This is from the horror and Ghost Story series of the early seventies. The beginning and end of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot. Do you remember him from the early family series, family affair of the sixties? This story is Barbara Parkins and David Birnei as the main actors, and as the main characters in the story. I've seen it recently, and I was so scared! If you are alone, I would not recommend you to watch this story. It's great, no worse or a curse, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played a young bride. David Birnei played his husband. And the actors were very good in their parts. If you love scary, fun, scary stories about ghosts, then you will like this little gem. I gave this high grade.
