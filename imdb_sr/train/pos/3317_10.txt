Bette Midler is Divine again! Rough humor. In love with Burlesque. Capable of bringing you to tears or old jokes with new dresses or just with old songs with more power and strokes than ever. All in all, he sings new ballads, singing good old / perennial, such as "Rose"; "Stay with me" and yes, even "The Wind Under My Wings". The best way to appreciate the Divine Misu M was always lying - since this is the next best thing for her, I strongly recommended that everyone with a blend of adult wide eyes and respect and childish desperate desire to move all boundaries!
