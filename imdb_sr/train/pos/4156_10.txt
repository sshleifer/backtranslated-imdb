I watched a series of episodes of a cold case from his premiere (especially now that Amazing Race is followed immediately, but this was one of the best examples of writing and acting I've seen from Bruckheimer's home.) Especially from younger officers, it was interesting scenario and montage, soundtrack and the acting made this episode a tour, if I were a producer, I would have submitted this episode to Emmy. The portrait was made by Coop and Jimmy within a 48-minute episode, which takes away a lot of talented people to try. There is a warning about when this episode repeats, because I'm sure I'll notice a lot of things I did not notice for the first time.
