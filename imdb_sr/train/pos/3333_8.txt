I had to see this in a NZ plane last week, and I wondered how it would be measured for the UK movie and the book. I must say that I was impressed. If nothing else, fanatic attachment to Red Sok during the lean years functions even better than the original commitment to FC Arsenal, which has been a success over the years. As a Brit, I was interested to see that you do not have to understand baseball to get what's going on. We have in mind one question - Is the script written in the use of Sok as a team even before they finally broke the Curse of the Bambino? Or was it another team in the frame? As a fan of Red Soka (I'm curious, the British who understands baseball) I have to say that this has contributed to the enjoyment.
