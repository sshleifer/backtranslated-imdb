Twelve monkeys are crazy for a trip, an action movie starring Bruce Willis, starring James Cole, a man who was sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that emerges in November 1996. by the year 1990, when everyone believes it is crazy. This film is exciting and has excellent acting performances by Bruce Villis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stove. Twelve Monkeys is one of the best movies that travel through time and I believe that everyone can enjoy it. Terri Gilliam created a real masterpiece 10/10
