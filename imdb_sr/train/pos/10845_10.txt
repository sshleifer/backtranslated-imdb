> Contrary to most reviews I read, I did not feel that this was followed by some of the other rock films ("Spinal Tap," etc.). The story was more unique, although I think most people want to see "sex, drugs and rock and roll" "the Sparrow, Connelli & Rea." It's surprising that "Brian" / Bruce Robinson was in Ziphardi's ("Sp?") Classics "Romeo & Juliet." I suppose I will have to rent it. </ Br> >> "FLAMMABLE ONE WAR" - My wife, who comes from Mexico she did not follow the English / British language correctly, missed some of the jokes (which I explained obediently) but she cried on the concert scene. She likes the song very much. It is interesting that Amazon.com has soundtrack for $ 30 + usd when I bought a DVD in the cheap stage in Val-Mart for $ 5.50. The price was not durable, I saw this for the first time on the cable night cabin and since then I've been dying.
