"Pecker" is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a great star in the public, media and local art scene with his paintings that show the dirty reality of day-to-day life as well as dirty clothes or human feces. It is a typical theme of independent comedies based on John Vaters Baltimore to show the strange sides of the American lifestyle between the fashion of political correctness and conservative repulsiveness exploring the background of the middle class society in their hometown. Edward Furlong of "Terminator 2" celebrates Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, Cindy Sherman's photographer, legendary Patricia Hearst and Vater's long-time actress Mink Stole. Although the pace of the action is sometimes a big drawback and can not compete with the fast and furious attacks of the brilliant "Serial Mummy" of the Water, there are still some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former girlfriend who has become a vegetarian by sniffing peanuts from vegetable dishes ... "Pecker" is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, media hyperpopulations, sexual assimilation of the middle class and strange ways to become a pop star without understanding it. Recommended!
