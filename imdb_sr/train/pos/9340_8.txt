** Possible Spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually included in Comedy, but in Reign, he gives a deep-moving performance. While there are people who have shown Courage to face after September 11, Sandler plays Fineman, a widow who is lonely Johnson (Cheadle), a dentist who practices, meets his old friend (Sandler) and wants to compensate for "Old Times". We see, like in Rain Manu (Dustin Hoffman), Fineman also gets emotional and retreats in stressful situations. Music mad, it seems that the comfort and "psychological" crutches for him to lean. He also feels unhappy and unhappy in his business. In the same instant, He also wants to make sure that his friend does not collapse through social "cracks." Compassion for grieving families.
