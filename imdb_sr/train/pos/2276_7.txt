If you read Mike's night and enjoyed it (as I did), you just have to watch the movie, realize that you have to understand the basic element of Vonngut's writing-that behind his story lies Vonnegut himself, and that you can not put the human mind on screen. His crunch and humor are simply not rewritten by the script or even the best acting performance. I believe this film goes beyond asking key questions Vonnegut puts in his book, but these frequent cynical moments of the satire found on the page are not found on the screen. Does that mean that the movie is missing? Of course not. In my opinion, the film succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading a book (this is not a medium for those who are too lazy to turn the page). It succeeds because it takes the basic elements of a story created by the true artistic treasures of America and represents it in a framework without pretensions. I also saw other versions of Vonnegut's books in which the director obviously tried to channel Vonnegut's genius and lose his grip on his craft. I would not put this film as one of the best I've seen, but it stands on my feet as one worthwhile look. By taking Vonnegut's "voice" from the narrative of the film or trying to insert it as much as it can, Mother Night brilliantly tells her story and preserves the basic lessons of the story without confusion, distraction or disappointment.
