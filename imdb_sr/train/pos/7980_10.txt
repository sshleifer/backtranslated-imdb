A man on the fire tells the story of a former member of the special forces with a drinking problem who accepts the job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in Mexico during a kidnapping wave due to redemption. At first, he is not friendly to a friend, but then he cares about a friend, he decides to stop drinking, etc. ... then one day she will be kidnapped ... and murdered ... </ i> And He will not stop for anything to be avenged. It's basically the story of Man On Fire, but expect some big turns at least a couple of times, including the ending that's pretty and probably will do you It's also due great music composed by Harri-Gregson Villiams with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator). But the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... The thing is, everything is perfect here. First - acting. Denzel Washington is at his best, Mickei Rourke and Christopher Valken as always, excellent Radha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... Then the cinema that is brilliant and with the superb editing certainly earned the Oscars. The story is not ... just a movie about revenge. The story is intelligent, the story makes you think ... and the pure is wonderful. Really. This is one of those movies you need to see in life, at least once!
