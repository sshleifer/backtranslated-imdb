Great acting Gretchen Mol. This film is one of the best biographies that will appear on the screen. Although she covers most of Betty's young life, she also succeeds in staying on a largely focussed path, which is something most biographies are missing. In the dialogue and acting there is some wonderful and alarmingly funny subtext. This film is a great break from Dir. "American Psycho", and I think it will prove to be her best work so far. Oh, and as a cinematographer, I give this movie 100% to the cinema. It was incredible that they took advantage of the 50's look with modern film stocks. Awards D.O.P. Everywhere around is very comfortable. I recommend anyone interested to see it: 8/10.
