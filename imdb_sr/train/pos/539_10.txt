The first one was good and original. I was a bad bad horor movie. So I heard that the other was shot and I had to watch it. What really makes this film work is the character of Judda Nelson and sometimes a smart scenario. A pretty good scenario for the person who wrote the films about the final destination and the direction was fine. Sometimes there is a scene that looks like it was shot with a home-made video camera with a graceful look. Excellent movie for TV. It was worth renting and probably worth buying just to get that nice, ghostly feeling and watch Stanley Judd Nelson doing what works best. you'll have the idea of ​​Stanley getting a little history.
