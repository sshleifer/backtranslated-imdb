It can (or does not have to) be considered interesting that the only reason I really checked this movie was in the first place because I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 Role for the Oscar for Best Actor I would still give Oscar Godi, but Paul Lukas did an excellent job and earned a nomination, at least.) Well, I'm glad to have seen this movie, because I enjoyed it. I think the film was a little preached, but not only to me bother, I enjoyed the speeches and they never were bored. <br /> <br /> <br / > The show was remarkable in this film, Lucile Vatson (rightly nominated for the Oscars), Bette Davis (unjustly nominated), George Coulouris and, unusually, Eric Roberts, who plays the middle child. He just attacked me, even the name of the characters (Bodo) is ridiculous. The end of the g, in which Lukas's character was forced to do something he considered wrong, although he did it for the right reasons, he worked for me too. I agreed with that why he thought he had what he did, and I realized why he could not explain it. The message that this film makes is good and noble, the landscape (which means the house) is beautiful, and the performance is great. Watch this movie if you ever get a chance. 9/10
