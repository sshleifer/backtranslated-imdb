I had the privilege to watch Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and shocking story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese who prostitutes from her family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (the American) comes to Holly's life and decides to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick is desperately looking. We follow them through a difficult journey through Cambodia and hope for their reunion. The film shows this difficult question without crossing the line. I went to find out more about the problem of child trafficking and ask how can I help? This film should be seen by everyone, because it is a wonderful story and it is a question that should no longer be ignored.
