Very interesting. The big turn was not such a big shock as they could hope and it was very obsolete, but my mind worked. It really made me think of a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world in which I live much more. Charlton Haston does a good job, like all supporting characters, and it was a very realistic movie that was surprising. He missed his time, and many adjustments and backgrounds required more explanation, but that was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main mistake I could find was that I did not want the film to end when it did, I would like to see what happened next. 7/10
