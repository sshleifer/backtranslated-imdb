If you love cars you will love this movie! In the film there are some great actors, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical absurd attitude and hard look. . There are only two small disadvantages of this film. First, a bad deal, however, people do not watch this film for a plot. Secondly, the glorification of the great theft of cars (automobile crime). However, if people really believe they can steal Ferrari and get away with it then they look good, I hope you spend well in prison! When I first read that Nicolas Cage was the main role, I first thought "... everything is sweet." But then I thought "... naaaa ti sranje!" but then finally after watching the movie, I realized "... that he is bullshit!" Just joking he plays very well. I will end this peculiar review by saying: "If the premature death of the criminal in some way enlightened the audience in general cinema, while the gloomy end beneath the brilliant letters of criminal life, and inspired them to change their ways, then this The death brings with it innate nobility. You can say "poor criminal." I say: "We are poor." PS - Angelina Jolie Voight looks pretty nice!
