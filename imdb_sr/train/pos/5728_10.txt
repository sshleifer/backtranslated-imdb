I went to this film waiting for an artistic scary movie. What I got was frightening. It's a horror movie in its core. It's not as boring as other horror movies where the haunted house has only ghosts and upstairs. This film does not even show you the majority of deaths that show fear of characters. I think it's one of the best things about a concept that is not just a house that has persecuted the one who entered the house. They are persecuted no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading some external reviews, I'm really surprised that the film does not like critics. I'll see him again this week and I'm excited about that. I gave this film the 10 stars because it did what the movie horor should have done. That scared me.
