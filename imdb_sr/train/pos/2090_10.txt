From there comes the term "classic film". This is a wonderful story about women's courage, courage and extreme loyalty. Poor Olan is sold to his unwed companion, who has learned over the years to appreciate it. (Ieah right, A PEARL !!) Luise Rainer was a beautiful star who won Oscars for Best Actress a year earlier for her small role (and what kind of oscillation loss) in "The Great Zigfield" . She really did not show what, if at all, she had, a talent she had except for exotic beauty. But in "Good Earth" she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she did not have great costumes. People say that she did not show any real emotions in this movie. Like in hell. Her character Olan is a shy and shy woman, with inner strength. She is silent during parts of the film only with her own eyes and body to convey her emotions. For example: these scenes during the fall of the city and when they shot at the robbers. If people say that they do not behave well in this movie, they're NOT looking for! Paul Muni shows that he can act as well. His character is not nice to me. She never sees her because of what she is, to the very end of the story. Cute, kind and dedicated woman and mother, with their special beauty. The biggest of all, the beauty of the inside, as a pearl. If you get the chance to see this movie, watch it. You will see one of the best films that the Hollywood star has created.
