I could not agree with the comments of Nomad 7 and I A HVR. Perfect relaxed weekly movie. Humor is subtle (as opposed to "slapstick", as one wrong commentator has noticed). But what always stops me from wondering is how often I feel I'm coming back to this movie over and over again. I originally copied this movie on VHS about 12 years ago, when it's premiered on one of those free weekends (HBO maybe?). I've never heard of it before. I do not know why it's not well sold. ?? When the DVDs were released into the crowd, it was one of the first films I had replaced. A great combination of actors and writers. In addition, the tail cap of the wilderness in Montana does not damage things (beautiful). Probably not the type of comedy for everyone, but what is it? If Adam Sandler goes to your street, it's probably not your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. Humor is mainly in dialogue. I believe that my next review will probably be my 12th time. But I still know that when it comes to scenes such as the one where the hoods of police cars start blowing, I will lose it (Ed O'Neill's face is PRECELESS!). Recommended 110%.
