This is a cult thing. My friends and I come together once a year to enjoy this movie. It's very funny and very dry. I've seen this move a dozen times and I have not enjoyed it yet. Actors are fun and get better with every look! If you enjoy the "Morons from the Universe", you'll love this. A great idea of ​​the war of the worlds. I like Red-neck savvy to bring aliens, bubble hood, DOD, heat search for Populous Annihilator, Minsko polje, Red Camo, break speed limit of 1800Mph! "I'll take the bucket!" Very funny. I wish this was on DVD! Forget about negative reviews and take a look at it yourself!
