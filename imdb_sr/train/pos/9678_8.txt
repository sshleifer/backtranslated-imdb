He made me wish that my lucky birds could talk. By printing to the reviewer who canceled the movie. A sweet story to be enjoyed by people of all ages. Paulie is a bit of a treasure. There are many intelligent lines that really made me laugh. I especially liked the dance sequences during its duration. You can forgive the obvious clich√©s as you cheer him up in his quest for reunification with Marie. A charming film with two powerful characters who sincerely interact with a parrot that is separate from its young owner. He would like to see more women who become blind and have to give up on a joint journey. I loved her artistic and poetic inspiration, the damage she could not share Paulie's return. Blessed Pauli in his new home, finally with Marie, may have joined a fine young man who helped him win the antagonists to finish his journey.
