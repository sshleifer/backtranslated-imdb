Costumes and makeup were magnificent, there were some extremely fun lines, and the role was made for Jim Carrei. Carrei did such a good job as he could have been done due to the rather disappointing writing of the script. Of course, this was mainly a movie for children, but if you spend so much money on filming, you should at least be able to give enough body to go further than Dr Seuss. I expected more than Ron Howard. Worth to see, but it lacks the necessary quality to become the main classics, by whatever measure.
