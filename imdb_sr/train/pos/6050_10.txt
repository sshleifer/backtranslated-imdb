At last! A competent British comedy that is not focused on some bank robbers or separated from the TV series. The film Ivana Ivaia is a psychoactive story about the discovery, dressed in bicycle equipment. The three protagonists are gentle fools with a propensity for failure and each on the turning point in their life, giving a sensitive, emotional trio of sub-plot to trample together a restless comedy. Chemistry between the three amigos is tangible and makes a moving conversation with hilarious dialogue and some classical comical moments. She feels part of Vithnail and I, part of American Verevolf in London, and part of the Kuadraphenia (but only because of bicycle gangs, and Phil Daniels). In fact, Phil Daniels's love roommate reminds you of Danny's dealer in Vithnail and myself, with his scientific approach and scientific dedication to drugs. This is a great movie, especially for those who have dealt with psychoactive substances in the past, which will relate to many moments in the film. A personal favorite is a brilliant scene in a wolf corner, buying munchies as we stumble upon 'shrooms'. This gentle comedy will warm the heart of your heart and laugh out loud. And you do not have to ride a bike or even love to enjoy. But it will add it if you do it. Brilliant.
