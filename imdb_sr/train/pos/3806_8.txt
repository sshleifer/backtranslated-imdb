This movie took away my breath in some places, I just liked it! I admit that dialogues and character stories could have been done a little better, but hey, this is just a simple (short) story about a couple of guys trying to kill a dragon, there is nothing more <br /> <br /> Overall design, atmosphere, beautiful landscapes ... it's all just magical! They have a lot of love in this movie. Character design was great and fun. A little Tim Burton-ish, if you want. I can recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a great design, shown in a simple little but wonderful story.
