Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a funny parody of Indiana Jones and other adventurous films that were popular during the eighties. Vaine Cravford plays Jake Speeda, an adventurer who always fights criminals wherever she goes. With their assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) they are looking for action (and some decent stories). The duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Copins), who was abducted by an evil slave trader (John Hurt). Can she find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her save her brother or sister? A sane and cheesy movie that does not turn out to be something that is not. I have to give one recommendation. This is if you enjoy movies that like to have fun and for those who do not take everything at nominal value. Recommended.
