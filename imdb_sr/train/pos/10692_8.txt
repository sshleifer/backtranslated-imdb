Good, fun, clear story, great Nicole Kidman (I almost always love movies in which she is). This was a good "vehicle" for someone who was skilled in comedy and drama, because there are elements of both. A romantic comedy wrapped around two stories about crimes, excellent closing lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good at another, but unpopular romantic comedy ("The truth about cats and dogs"). They may be too unbelievable. Ebert has not even published a review for this. Obviously, the big jokes of the comedy were incredible ("Bringing Babies," etc.). If you saw an incredible comedy, did you see them all? Or people are ready to continue working in the 1930s. Weird. Birthday is a movie that I enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman can be a "killer application" for home video.
