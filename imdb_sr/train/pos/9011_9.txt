I found this film quite by chance, but I'm happy to do it. Kenneth Branagh's performance was close to theft of this film by Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry together made for a much more pleasant film. This film reminded of the great films Branag made with Emma Thompson. Carter's star here turns out to be a disabled girl who wants to complete, which was a good performance as I've been looking at for a long time from the women's leadership. Painting a person with disabilities is difficult to pull, but with her eyes only to show her the pain of her life situation, she made it so convincing. If this film came out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women who were "warmed up" for the roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I fell sure that Carter would have serious thought for the Oscar. If you go through this movie on the cable late at night, like me, believe me, it's worth the lost dream.
