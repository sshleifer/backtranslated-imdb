Oh, man, why? "Six degrees" is the notion of this so-called theory that we are all connected. If you focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. When I first heard about this show, it did not attract me at all. It seemed too common. Then I saw some episodes ... and I loved it! First of all, characters. They are all well written and differ from one another. There is an alcohol addict, a woman whose bridegroom cheats on her, a woman who just lost her husband, a driver who has a brother in problems, and so on ... Unlike what we are accustomed to, most characters interact with each other in victims, as in our daily routines. Great! My favorites are Mae, Carlos and Vhitnei. Then, the actors. Everyone is great. Jai Hernandez, from "Hostels", here shows his acting skills in more than 3d characters than his previous work as Pakton. Others give great performances, especially Campbell Scott, played by Steven and Bridget Moinahan, who plays Vhitnei. got fired. Seriously, I can not understand the low grades. It's a pity that there is no more than one season. It really would be a good show!
