"Against All Flags" is every classic. It has all the elements for which an adventurous fan could hope, and more in this, the girl in trouble is, not really in trouble. Like Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is best in her athletic sport, proving her enemies in opposition to the social standards of that period. Anthony Kuinn rounds the three best actors as the ruthless captain Roque Brasilian and proves to be a cunning and capable enemy to Brian Havke (Flinn). For classic adventure lovers, "Against All Flags" is an inevitable place. Although perhaps not in the same league as one of the earlier works by Errol Flinn (Captain Blood and Sea Havk, for example), it's still fun.
