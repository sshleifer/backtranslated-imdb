"Capitaes de Abril" is very good. The story is not a documentary about the Revolution of 1974 in Portugal. But that gives us the idea of ​​how it was. The fiction story is not of great interest, but the film does not spoil. The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia are no exaggeration, and the film is a tribute to his works. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the revolution on April 25th. All actors are very good and even the fewest roles play beautifully. Lisbon looks nice as always. Do not miss! I loved this film very much.
