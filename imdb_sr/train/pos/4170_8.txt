I've seen this movie many times. It was paired with many spooky things that were then shown in television films. The only problem I had was with the title for obvious reasons ... One immediately think of the famous cake from Drake's! Leaving the first part, "Hound of Hell" would be enough. Richard Crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does, whether the plot is good or bad. But this was a fun night dinner offered by the CBS network. I loved the part in which Crenna went to some obscure country to find mysticism that would help him win the evil beast. He asks the taxi driver how to find this guy. Excellent dialogue between autochthon taxi drivers and Crenna in terms of taxis disposing of their ethnic beliefs of people. "Mr. Barry, I left those things behind me when I came down from the mountains ..." - thinking of a mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and no one knows how to really contact him. As for the supernatural price, this film is still pleasant.
