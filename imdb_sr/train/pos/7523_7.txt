I saw this film at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it's a movie, not a movie, because it was obviously shot by HBO to show up on their cable network this year. This film presents the site as a slave and disciplined fetish pinup and a B & D film actress who has enough talent to become a real actress. The page was slightly more than that and the film touches on some of its other role in modeling, but it's not enough to balance the career of the 50th pinup icon. The film is allegedly based on the book The Real Bettie Page by Richard Foster. It was shot in black and white for nostalgia from the 1950s. I have a book titled "Bettie Page Life of the Pinup Legend" that has many great photographs about the career of Page and I have to say that this movie is being reproduced on the movie, with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of these famous photos are true. The Mol Molt with Bettie Page black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. Not only does she have the look of Bettie Page, but she also has the smile and characteristics of her personality that went through the perfect camera. And her body is as close as possible to the copy of the page. Great throw. The story was a bit skinny and tabloid and could certainly have been much better. But this is a pretty good TV movie. I would rate it at 7.0 on a scale of 10 and I recommend watching it when it appears on the TV.
