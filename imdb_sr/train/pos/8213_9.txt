Anyone who is the witness of our judicial system - or its disadvantage - will find this film really satisfying. There were not too many shades of gray in relation to characters or plot. Practically every character in this film represents what is the best and the worst in our society. The popularity of this film is probably a consequence of the fact that most of us at one time or another had to deal with stinkers along with namibirnim, lili-lively, crowded bureaucrats who empower them in the name of "political" correctness. <Br /> Performances I was sympathetic to the victim of the rape - while at the same time I was happy to see that she was erasing the complacent, vicious arrogance from the face of her former attackers. I especially found that she was one of the most rugged characters in all of the films I saw, so it was nice to see that her former victim had closed her mouth forever.The lead-in rapist and psychopaths were equally ugly, so it was only appropriate for Dirty Harry to reject him in a loud way, this was the only continuation in the dirty Harri's saga that was equal first.
