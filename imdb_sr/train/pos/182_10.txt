If you are not familiar with the Gundam world, this is a good place to start. If you've burned down in Star Wars or Star Trek, here's an incredible, realistic science-fantasy series that you can immerse yourself in. Not a simple story about a boy who saves the world in a giant you could expect, but rather a complex, emotionally striking space war drama in which the line between "good" and "bad" guys is definitely less than different. Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruhi, a young, naive boy living in a neutral space colony. She spends her days dreaming about mobile clothes and playing with her friends. During this series, Al agrees with the "enemy" soldier, Bernie Viseman. In the end, Little Al learns some hard lessons about the reality of the war and the necessary suffering and sacrifices. I loved this OAV series, with its cool design, including story and nice characters. I recommend this series to anyone who loves real SF anime, or to those who think that anime is just silly or sexy fun.
