My favorite film about Jackie Chen will always be "Drunk Master" (1978), and then this 1985 movie, "Police Story". In it Chan plays a super-policeman from Hong Kong who breaks down the infamous master of crime and his gang, and then he is granted the protection of his girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) in order to present the state's evidence. As the story continues, the gangster sends his gooners to send Lin, but Chan takes things in his hands and feet while keeping the girl Maggie Cheung. Like the "drunken master", "Police Story" has many signatures and top martial arts / action choreographies in which Chan became famous, experiencing the climax of the royal struggle in a crowded marketplace. In her role as director, Chan surpasses excellence, giving a charismatic and entertaining performance that emphasizes action. While the light of the overall humorous humor of the "Drunk Master," in the heart of the "Police Story", that's precisely the police story, a brave cop-thriller that will often be copied in the years to come. 10/10
