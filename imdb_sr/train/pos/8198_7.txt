Dirty Harry has to find a rape victim who pulls out revenge by killing attackers in pigeons before he kills them. It would probably be a better punishment for them to be allowed to live after the initial recording and to suffer them forever as she and her sister have ... In any case ... ... the story of the action was re-established in San Francisco and Santa Cruz . The main rapist, played by Andy Drake, is appropriately corrupt and gets the punishment at the end (of course!). It's not a classic movie, it's better than the original Dirti Harry.
