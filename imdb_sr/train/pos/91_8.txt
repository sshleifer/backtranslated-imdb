Mostly it was a good movie with an ideal ending; The acting was spectacular and the characters did not wander from their own people. I especially liked the shop, although you knew what would happen, but it surprised the element through the whole movie. However, I think that the arrival could be a bit longer (perhaps extended) - it seemed to me a bit too early; as if the writer was trying to take down linens from the lines before it rained. For example ... What happened to Tristan's brother, Haiden? We know he died in the hospital. Perhaps he is the one who has arranged it all! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Maybe? If there is ... I can not wait to see him.
