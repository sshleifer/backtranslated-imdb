I liked this movie as if it reminded me of my marriage. It's very clean, you can see it with your family. Very nice. And the songs are fine. I think the director of the screenwriter is great. The film shows how marriages progress through time. They have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their lives. Some of the dialogues are pretty good. The film describes complex human emotions very nicely, and not with excessive dramatization. It also shows that the perfect is not so perfect. It shows very well the dynamics of a well-arranged marriage when it is new. The film is very well written and directed.
