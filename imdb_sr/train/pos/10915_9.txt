RKO students decided to borrow from Villyama Povella of MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia for one of their major budget efforts to capture the popularity of Thin Man. Many have forgotten that besides Paul and Charles, Bill Povell also played in several Philo Vance films in the main role. So at that time he was pretty well placed in the role. Dr. Bradford is not doing so many lunches as Nick Charles, but Nick's basic blight is still there. One difference is that, while Nick Charles married his heir, Dr. Bradford is working for life as a doctor. It helps in his interest in the detective and actually in this movie. There are two killings to be solved. Jockey falls from a horse that enters the room of a great race and dies without any reason. The coach doubts something, but he moved away from the more conventional bullet method. This is after he came to Bill Povella for help. Mirna Loi had a more stable influence on Bill Povella than Jean Arthur. Arthur plays him more than dizzy than Loi. But here she works, both she and Povell have good chemistry. James Gleason is always a trusted police inspector in the role of Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. Only Asta, and perhaps Eric Blore, were here, while Povell's batler wrote that part. If Povell and Arthur signed in this studio, maybe we've seen a whole lot of Bradford's films.
