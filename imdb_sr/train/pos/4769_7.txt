I'm sure this is a show that nobody is familiar with and may not think well about; after all, it's almost close to Baivatch Hawaii. With actors, location, style of directing and its publicity ?? shows women walking on the beach and all that. It's no wonder people have a misconception and decide not to watch it. It was wrong for them to do it. Because after I decided to watch the show, there is actually something more, a true juicy story and a conflict, it turns out that it's really exciting to watch and quite a lot? infectious. The story of hotel clerks, manager, owner and their complicated love life. Enter a problematic hotel visitor and a powerful man who is trying to steal the hotel. It's actually more exciting than it sounds like here. I will not deny that stupid shit, but it is not so bad that you will look away. The story is not so consistent, but good enough. Soundtrack fits pretty well with the script and the action is all the time. I took a few episodes before something really happened, so I'll be patient. Recommendation: I really enjoy watching this. Zillion times Better Than Expected. Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Score: B) <br /> <br /> Please read my comment after reading, thanks.
