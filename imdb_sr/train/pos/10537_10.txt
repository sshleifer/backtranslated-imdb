This film was very funny, I could not stop laughing when I was watching this and I already watched it twice in a 2 day period! The movie is distinctly unique in its humor and visual effects, both great and parallel with Natal's other (more serious) movie jewels Cube and Cipher. I became a great fan of Vincenzo Natali since I watched Cipher and everything he did was very interesting. Very cute in this film are characters and characters "loser" Dave and Andrev, presented by David Hevlett Andrew Miller (co-writer of stories), actors that I both love very much. They are also cool Ks-Bok Dead or Alive fighting (you can even see Dave playing Halo at one point) and Andriy's incredible solo guitar, among many other things. All in all, a great movie that feels good. about friendship. You have to see this!
