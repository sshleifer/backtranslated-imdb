I thought this LOL movie is funny. It's funny, not to be taken seriously, a film about perverted views of life, love and ... well, ladies "from bus station scandal, to high class ... bus station". The meadow is played by the boy (Leon Phelps), raised in a Plaiboia-style castle by Hugh Hefner's father, constantly surrounded by beautiful porn models and actresses. When his "father" throws him out on the street, he must learn to take care of himself only with a chauvinistic view of the life his youth learned ... and on an inexplicable, almost mystical level of charm and stupidity. And that's how it starts! If you have not seen this movie and enjoy a carefree, semi-senseless, comedy / love, then I recommend you rent a "woman man".
