I accidentally got involved in an independent movie channel and I was trapped. I am a professional actor and I was stunned with performances. They felt completely improvisational, absolutely without influence. I did not know whether it was shot or recorded, and waited until the end to see credits and then spent half an hour on the IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss. I see that the writer-director also worked on a very nice movie called Daily Everyday People that I enjoyed very much. The shame of the film business is that the projects of this excellent do not get distribution and commercials that deserve and live under the radar. This film deserves to be exalted and proud. I call people to look for him and look at him.
