in one of the best Neil Simon. The screaming, mournful eco-Vaudeville stars played by Valter Matthau and George Burns are joining a TV comedy. The problem is that they have not even been seen for more than a decade. Full of humorous liners and a show business show, this story flies with a constant stream of humor. Good work and Richard Benjamin as a distressed nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as a nurse and Howard Hesseman as a TV commercial director. Steve Allen and Phillis Diller appear themselves. Note: The opening of the installation contains recordings from a 1929 Hollywood show and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and singing Brok.
