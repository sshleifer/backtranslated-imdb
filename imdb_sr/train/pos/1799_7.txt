I'm 14 and I love this caricature. Burt Reinolds and Dom Deluise make a big pair. This movie is really funny and I love songs. My favorite songs are "You Can not Keep a Good Dog" and this song about sharing, I think it's called "What's My". This was the last film with Judith Barsi, who played Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie, but I think Itchi's voice is so fun to listen to. Although some of the scenes I actually found scary, it's still difficult for me to watch the scene with Charlie's dream, and Carface scares me. Other characters like King Gator were very entertaining. The end was wonderful and he was actually sad, made me cry a little. I'm giving this movie 7/10.
