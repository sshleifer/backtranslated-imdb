This is a fairy tale symbol! Zlikovci are completely evil and heroes are refreshingly clean. Danzi, Deniro and Pfieffer are wonderful as well as a new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Extraordinary performances, wonderful magic, fun and dramatic, as well as the perfect ending of fairy tales make this movie absolutely fantastic! I'm not sure that all the content is suitable for younger children, but for the older audience, there are many hilarious subtleties! Reviews do not work this movie of justice! My fianc√© and I were quite skeptical, but we were so enthusiastic about getting into the film in a chance to hope that I will convince everyone on the fence to try it!
