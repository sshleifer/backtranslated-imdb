I swear I could watch this movie every weekend in my life and I never get to him! Every aspect of human emotion is so magically captured by the actors, scenarios, direction and general feeling of this film. It's been a long time since I saw a movie that actually made me laugh out of laughter, I reflect from sadness, and I feel every intentional feeling that comes through this great job! We need more of these games !!! Mike Binder: Are You Listening?
