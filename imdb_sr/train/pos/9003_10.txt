I assume this is not the best movie ever made, but I voted it on 10 stars anyway. Mostly because of my feelings at the end. Me and all the people around me are just touching. This is something that often does not feel. We all become cynical and full of sentimentality, laziness and preaching in modern films. The story of a movie around Jane is a young woman in the last stages of the MND and a friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the brink of collapse. It could easily have been a boring and decent work, but it's so humorous, humane and lacking sentimentality to completely overwhelm you and a good movie against it. The acting of Branagh and Bonham-Carter is wonderful, especially the one that is always convincing and powerful in its role. Chemistry between them also raises the film. The title comes from Richards's masterpiece, a garbage-made aircraft and his old paintings. Flying here is a symbol for both Richards and Janes living in full swing, so that it can continue and others face the end. Beautiful and fun movie that I would recommend to everyone. Do not let the object drop you.
