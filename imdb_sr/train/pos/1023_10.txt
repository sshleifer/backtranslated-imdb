This performance is my escape from reality for the last ten years. I'll grieve it sadly. Although Atlantis filled the hole a bit. The latest episode of SG1 (on TV anyway) is nicely made. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. As if trying to explain how it is on the set of the show. (All who work together for so long are related to ups and downs, but over the years they have turned into a family). I thought this was a great way to end, despite any criticism. SG1 was something special, and again and again, it led me beyond the bounds of disbelief and wonder. Wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. I was hooked from one episode. The mixture of action, science, drama, and especially comedy, worked so well that I continued to want more. There are no real words in which to express fully what this show meant to me. I can only thank those who for so many years held the show so fresh and fun. It inspired me to do many things that I thought was impossible. I look forward to movies next year and I really hope there will be many. I never want the show to die. Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
