This film captured my heart from the very beginning, when I heard the first notes of Quintus Jones or saw a beautiful color of violet flowers in meadows. This is really a movie for crying and dying for ...! The whole actor gives the best performance in a movie I've seen for years, and Spielberg really surprised me! Vhoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Vinfrei (oh lord!), Danny Glover, and others give us all the best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her that insecurity and the sense of inferiority that is needed in character, and we grow with it, we strengthen it together with it, through the film, and triumph with it. Margaret Avery is as beautiful as Shug Avery, even when she is at her worst, and shows us that "sinners" really "have souls" too. Always cute, charming Danny Glover does a wonderful job in hating people with magnificent music (I would say, sir) Kuinci Jones adds even more beautiful to this great movie! Photography, music, directors and music make this beautiful, soulful film in the experience of life. You do not want to miss it! "Sista" ... remember my name ... "
