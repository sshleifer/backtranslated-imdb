This tough, often violent western in Peckinpah / Leone tradition was surprisingly directed by Andrew V. McLagland, whose previous Western (especially those who played John Vaine), were mostly in John Ford mode. It's also surprisingly traditional (good guys / bad guys) and incredibly up-to-date. Heston displays a former retired Captain of Arizona Territory Police, who retired for a year, handed over to the Michael Parks Reform Police and found the way laws would be applied in cars, telegraphs, telephones and railways. the first years of the 20th century. But soon he faces a threat from his past - a half-busted rebel (Coburn), who left him more than a decade ago for the robbery of a train that killed four guards. In a later shootout, Coburn's wife was killed; so Coburn is ready for the worst kind of revenge. This includes abduction and, finally, the rape of Heston's daughter (Hershei) from him and his gang. The result is a tense and violent search across the mountains and deserts in southern Arizona. LAST WITCHES, based on the Bride Garfield novel "Gun Dawn", are violent in many places, including a clash between Heston and Coburn, as well as a rape scene involving Hershei and two members of the Coburn band (Kuade, Paull) is probably equally questionable as well as similar scenes in STRAV DOGS and DELIVERANCE. But this does not diminish too much fear from the psychological approach to the film to the Western genre. McLaglen was able to deal with a bloody story with a significant defeat, and Heston's performance as an older lawyer was probably the best he had ever given in any 1970s movie. Coburn seems to be particularly cold-blooded, and Parks and Chris Mitchum (like Hershey's imaginary husband) also turn well. Music is here quoted from Jerry Goldsmith to 100 RIFLES and remake of STAGECOACH from 1966, but still works here. LAST HARD MEN will soon be released by Fox on VHS and / or DVD. It's Western that deserves nothing less.
