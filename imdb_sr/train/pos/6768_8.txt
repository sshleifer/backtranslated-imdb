One of my favorite shows of the 80's. After the first season, it started to go downhill when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott into the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun to watch her character and Ernest Borgna go together. The last episode she appeared was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately, those black people did not last long on television shows. Some of the episodes in the second season in which it was good, but the third season were more about the Airwolf characters and it was not shown almost at the end of the show. When he went to the US, it was disgusting !!!
