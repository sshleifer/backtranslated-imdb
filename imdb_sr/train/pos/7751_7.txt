I really liked AVTVB Tom Barman. You just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts, and do not expect anything. It's like sitting in a coffee-table with a beer in the summer sun and watching people walking. It will definitely not keep you in mind after that, that's true, but that's not a prerequisite for a good movie. It's just an experience during a movie that's great. I felt that there were several threads that could have been worked out a little more, but since Linch's fan did not care anymore I also liked the style or style of this film. It's smooth, but fresh, and the soundtrack is beauty. Every music lover will get his shots from AVTVB, I assure you. I will give him 8 out of 10. <br /> (musical 10 out of 10)
