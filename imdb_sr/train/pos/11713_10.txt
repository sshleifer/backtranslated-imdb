I think she needed a lot of courage to come up this way. It's sad that when a famous person suffers, it helps most people. But in her case, what she did was extraordinary. For five years I am in the field of mental health and I think it is great that mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I believe that she helped. I always thought it was great and it would always be. I'm glad she wrote this book and that the film was filmed. She's an extraordinary lady and I hope she will continue to work. It went through many things and faced it. I really would like to see that he works more with children, especially with children's actors. Her temptation did not have to happen and I think she would be wonderful as a mentor to young people. The movie approached me so much that I was very touched. Starting from the TBI that led to the onset of my disorder and having PTSD, it's good to know that someone has enough courage to show his life as he did. I believe this has helped this nation and people generally understand that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you, Ms. Duke, or Anna, who you like.
