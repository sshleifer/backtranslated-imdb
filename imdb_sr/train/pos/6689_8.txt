As a comic book reader, who still watches me as a total kid in my heart, I admit I may have been a bit biased towards this movie. I mean, for a long time there was not a good superhero (NOTE: Batman Forever was not a good superhero movie). I really wanted this film to be good, and unlike most of my recent travels to the cinema (I read the Blair Vitch Project), I was not disappointed. The mystery of men was definitely not a high effect, a tension filled with action, it was a comedy. And on that basis, that was a success. Everyone laughed in a small theater, and applause and laughs through the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo together, as always, are hilarious, and Azaria adds a real touch of insanity. Villiam H. Maci plays a great real man, while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens are added only to make the kids happy. Although sets are bizarre (and sometimes look like ripoffs) and Batman and Blade Runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, it's still just funny. There are some lines that will capture even the most endangered spectator outside the guards, and bring tears of abdominal laughter among us. I definitely recommend this film. Although not a classic classic, it's twice as funnier than Austin Poversh's latest recovery. Writing is good, and the actor is EXCELLENT. If you are worried, plan on the matinee and pay less, but in any case you will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who does not catch losers among us?
