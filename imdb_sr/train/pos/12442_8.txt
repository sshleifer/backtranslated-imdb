Filmed in an impossible schedule and without the budget being discussed, the film turned out to be much better than you would expect, certainly more loyal Peter O'Donnell's books and comics than the two previous films. You can read the tape currently in the Titan Books reprint or in Comics Revue per month. It's one of the greatest adventurous comics of all time. The film is not great, but unlike most low-budget films, it uses most of what it has received, and it keeps you in the interest of it. On DVD accessories, an interview with Kuentin Tarentin, which is obviously stoned, is a gas. Some people blame Tarentino for linking his name to the film, but without it it would never have been. He is the admirer of Modesty Blaise and has chosen a good writer and director. All in all, it is worth 8 stars.
