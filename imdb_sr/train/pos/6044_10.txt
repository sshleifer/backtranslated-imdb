Great British Indie movie! Fantastic chemistry between the three main characters makes some harsh kits that are used on drugs and Cheech and Chong will be proud of. It's great to see Phil Daniels on the big screen (even if he switched sides from Kuadrophenia!) And Gari Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! I loved the last scene of the fight with my nod to Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brovn after he set himself on Top of the Pops! !!! You do not need to be a biker to enjoy this and that's right in my Friday night post-pub repetition of watching the collection. Leave this movie and you will not be disappointed.
