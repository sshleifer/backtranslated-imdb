VIVAH is in my book THE BEST MOVIE OF 2006! PERIOD !!. In my book, this is one of the top 100 EVER MADE IN Bollivood films. It's sad that this movie does not have so many reviews and there is not so much popularity. VIVAH is again the true achievement of the director who is doing it again. After HAHK and Maine Piar Kiia Sooraj again pulled out a great VIVAH. These are the easiest and easiest movies I've seen this year. After seeing Don 2, who was CRAP, and later Dhoom 2 who even won Don in that sense, I finally saw a movie that is so close to my heart and my culture. I do not know why Bollivood is moving away from the beautiful culture we have and making Hollywood movies like Dhoom 2 and Don. The story is beautiful and much refers to the Indian marriage contract system that I want to be part of. Our system that teaches us to listen to the elders, follow them and of course listen to their thoughts, so it's greatly shown in this movie! Of course, there is no force in the choice of your life partner and this should be a short meeting between the couple and it is on them to decide how brilliantly displayed in this film. Going back to the movie ... VIVAH is a story about a journey between a wonderful period of engagement and marriage. The stage where a boy gets to know a girl! .... They both understand each other .. And they try to estimate whether they can love one in seven generations (as our system says) and the various that happen during marriages. Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ....... Shahid is fine ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are brilliant !! The songs are BRILLIANT. ! I especially like HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GIE CHAAR and Do Anjaana Einabi ...... ALL IN ALL MUST SEE FOR ANYONE who still believes in Indian culture and tradition and I certainly! Go look at this movie ...... I just have to say one word ....... BLISS!.
