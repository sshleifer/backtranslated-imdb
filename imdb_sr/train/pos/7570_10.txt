I recently bought a very underrated Dreamcast and went to town to find some games to use. I bought Soul Calibur (Classic) and then I went through the Resident Evil Code Veronica domain. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2, and I played Res Evil 3 on a number of occasions, and I was impressed with all of them, especially 1 who must enter the history of the classic. But none of them comes even close to trying to dream Brilliant Gori Gameplaia. If it's just for buying a dreamcast game for this game, it's worth it every moment of your time and effort, I've never been so enchanted with a computer game in the way that it enthuses me. , the story continues from another story in which Claire Redfield searches for his brother (Chris - from the first story), which is presumed to have disappeared under the plot of a scary umbrella corporation. Little is known of this corporation, apart from the fact that you have destroyed them 3 times in previous stories. Your brother. The second CD allows you to control Chris, that's if you manage to get so far without fear. The control is very smooth and the movement of the characters is a magnificently realistic character noticing the danger, facing the direction from where it comes from. PURE GENIUS !! All in all, I gave this game 10/10, because it is a game of the year, a game of decade and the best game in the world, stop stop! Please buy this game as soon as possible.
