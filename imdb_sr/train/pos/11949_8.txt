The second film by Voody Allen set in London. The killer of Tarot cards kills prostitutes in London. The wish of journalist Sondra Pranski (Scarlett Johansson) gets a note that could be Lord Peter Liman (Hugh Jackman). He begins to love him, but he falls in love. Helped by magician Sid Vaterman (Voody Allen), who does not like what she sees. This is more like me than last year's Match Point. She was shorter and moved much faster. The action is old, but I was having fun and it hit me all the way to the end. It's not a comedy, but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines (all of Alen's of course). It's not one of the best Alen, but it's far better than his worst. The performance is, to a great extent, very good. Allen is bad, but he played this character a million times before and became tired. But Johansson and Jackman are great - they look fantastic and give two very attractive compelling performances. Also, Allen (surprisingly) works on their sexual attraction - there is a sequence in which both of them in their swimsuits show their beautiful bodies. The only real task is that Allen still looks unsure about the way London was shot. Although he is not at Match Point, he may be better off as he goes on. Worth to see. I'm giving him 8.
