I bought this a year ago or more for $ 2 (iep, $ 2), I left it on the shelf for years, now I watch DVDs while hiding with cold. Brilliant performances by all involved, especially boyfriend 6 (about only the smiles you get in this movie). As a psychologist, clinical and forensic psychologist, my trembling began to spin when the identity of a new contract was discovered. Scari stuff! Great job. Pete
