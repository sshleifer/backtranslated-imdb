My brothers and sisters came across Champs when our local station broadcasted commercials in the 1970s. We absolutely adored him. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially compared to the usual American re-movements (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get an idea). He had a similar feeling to The Avengers (not too surprising, since he was also British in the spy / adventure genre). holding. I mentioned this show to others, and nobody heard about it, so I began to wonder if I had imagined its entire existence. But the wonder that the web enabled me to track information about it. We hope to find a new generation of fans.
