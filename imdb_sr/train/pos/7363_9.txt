This is not a love song. The summary of my words on this movie would be "Excellent". Probably will not like a mass film that looks at the public? It is a movie that forces you to participate. You look, think and ask questions. Comparisons can be done with Deliverance (Theme / Theme) and perhaps with The Blair Vitch Project for the overall style of recording. > <br /> However, this film is unique against both. Cinematographic effects (solarization, frame freezing, blur, etc.) Have been seen before, but are mostly used effectively in this film to support the natural tension of the story. The act is crude, threatening and extremely convincing. The real theme of the film is about friendship; Title really gives the game. This is probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have experienced or would like. It is a love song.
