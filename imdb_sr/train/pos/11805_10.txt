Fragglerock is excellent in the way Schindler's list was excellent. Big clock for children and adults of all sexes. Large noses can be viewed as hinting of phallic symbols, in the same way as H. Puff N Stuff hints at smoking a marijuana. Your children will love this movie. I enjoyed it as a child. My father showed me this movie as a child. He also enjoyed and pointed out that excessive noses were symbolic symbols. Although at that time I had no idea what they were. The film is comedy and adventure. The story is crazy and bucky. Me and you will enjoy this together.
