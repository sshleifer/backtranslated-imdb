I think this series is screaming funny! Not for every taste, and I will not pick up or scratch people who do not understand it. I'm sure they're wonderful great people working on another wavelength. But if you like it, you really like it. Sara plays a self-lost loser called "Sarah Silverman," which is often found in Homeric Homerian Homerian Simpsons (Homerian Simpsonian). Saturdai Night Live in the early 90's. I immediately liked her, and I went out of my way to check everything she did. This show is fun-on-your-food-and-wet-your-pants. That's why I always watch and wear adult diapers. Take a look at!
