This film is NOT about the fight of cats and mice, as stated in the second comment. It's about a cat who spent 8 of 9 lives and now lives in fear of not losing the last one. The cat is nervous and scared all the time, hence the name 'fragile cat'. The previous lives of Fraidi Cat are haunted by him as ghosts who are from different periods of time and are constantly trying to kill him, but he is most afraid of the ninth life that is portrayed as a cloud in the form of number 9 and exhausts the light bolts. It's very old now, but it would still be fun for kids if you get a copy. <br /> I watched this movie almost as a child: o)
