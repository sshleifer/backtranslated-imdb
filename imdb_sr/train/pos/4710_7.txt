As far as parodies are concerned, there are few who are worth the time and energy. but with the recent revival of terrible parodies such as Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's a breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a truly funny Farce such as Johnny Dangerousli. After his mother has no end of medical problems, little Johnny goes to work for the mafia. What falls on the surface is a series of gauges, most of which work, however, there are occasional failures. But a foreign gangster who can not master American tongue (at least with a curse), a rival gangster with a tendency to drop his mouth (... once!), Younger brother with D.A. who is ready to bring John Dangerous, and a hot young starlet hot because of his feelings, Johnny is busy. And the viewer will be busy with laughter, mainly, like every cliche of a gangster movie punched by a talented actor and decent writing. It's not perfect for a long shot, but definitely good for a smile on a bad day.
