This movie is the first time for several people in the film. They are all experienced actors and play in several TV shows and drama. Sahan Gokbakar is a famous comedian in Turkey. It's kinda strange to see him in the thriller while he is at the peak of his career in Turkey. This film is the first feature film by Togan Gokbakar and the first experience as a director. But everyone did a good job. We are happy to see such an enthusiastic young actor. They look very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkai is a long-time dear Sahan Gokbakar, also a talented actress, who is known for her recent performance in theater play "Number 27" and several TV shows.
