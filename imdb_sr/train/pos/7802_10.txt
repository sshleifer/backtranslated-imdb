I was electrified when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko went halfway through the film, but the resonance of his courage and wisdom was not forgotten. I was not when I was finally in South Africa in 1993. This is largely a story of friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and listened to the audience at the dance recital in Natale, I sang Nkosi Sikelel 'iAfrika, my hair was standing at the ends. Much can be learned from this story for all nations.
