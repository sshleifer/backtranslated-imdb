"Batman: Mystery of the Batvoman" is fun as well as animated Batman movies. While still loyal to the feelings of comics, animation takes place more easily than in the animated series. Bruce Vaine looks the same as before, but now it seems somewhat less impressive. Dick Graison Robin was replaced by less severe Tim Drake Robin. Kevin Conroy, as usual, appeals to Batman's voice better than most live actors. /> Kelly Ripa made a much more decent voice acting than I expected. As in Batman's live films, the film lives or dies on the basis of the quality of the villains. My favorite favorite, Penguin, is here. His design is smoother than he appeared before, and he looked more closely at the portrait of Burgess Meredith in the 1960s than on the portrait of Danny DeVita "Batman's Return". David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the Penguin voice. The penguin is finally portrayed as a tricky sophisticated, just as it usually appears in the comic book. The voice of Hector Elizondo creates Banea, which is much more memorable than the unforgettable version of "Batman & Robin". And finally, Batman has a mystery to solve, putting "Detective" back into "Detective Comic" (that's what "DC" means, after all.)> The result adds to the mysterious ambience of the movie. It sounds like a mix between "Poirot" and the "Mission: Impossible" score. All in all, it's more fun than the average cartoon movie.
