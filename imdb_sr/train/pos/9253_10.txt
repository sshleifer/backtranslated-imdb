Well, the movie is not really "funny". Well, I admit, there are several HUMOR lines, but definitely nothing that is funny-loud funny. For example: Immediately before the sexual scene between Eleniac and one of her male bones, her fingers are tied up with cots and can not remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to get to the key, he tells her, "All right, do not go anywhere." You see, humorous, but not funny. The plot and the acting is pretty good. But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She is hot and sexy and with her is really full of scenes that can not go back and look again. lines. Overall, 5 stars. I would give her only three, if not Erika Eleniak.
