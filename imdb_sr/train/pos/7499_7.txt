But it's kind of hilarious, at least if you grew up on Veird Al, like me. It's the mock-book of his life and career, starting with superstars and returning to discover the origin. In places it is uneven, but some segments are still very entertaining, especially when it goes to Japan. Although not so emotionally structured as Lost in Translation, and he does not find love, although transient, he records an absolutely bizarre cultural melancholy that lives in Tokyo. Perhaps the weird Al is not recognized as an insightful cultural commentator who is; maybe the rose would have smelled just as sweet any other name. Still, this is a funny movie.
