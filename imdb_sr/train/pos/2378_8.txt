This film is much better than the version of asylum, mainly due to the war in the world. Tripods look pretty cool, but their walking and death could have been better. The action scenes were really cool. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking !!! God, stop walking, or I'll kill myself. The scene of a younger child was my favorite sequence mainly because the ship hit a bunch of tripods. Good movie I recommend it to people who read the book. Music is great and directors look pretty cool. Pros. Good sound background 99% of book Books on violence Stats and handling machines are cool to watch the counter. some bad stupid London
