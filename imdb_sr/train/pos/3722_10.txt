First of all, I saw this movie without knowing anything about it. I only knew that it was done by Joel Schumacher and that was enough for me. My friend and I went to see him at a Danish film festival called the Night Film Festival, which was shown after many hours, and the festival was mainly specialized for showing films that would not otherwise be shown in Danish theaters. In any case, my friend and I went to see him and we were amazed at how real it really looked and that it really affected our feelings, we really caught up with the plot without the ability to figure out which one a great plus in our book. The film was shot in a style that reminds me of the Danish dogma 95 initiative launched by 4 Danish directors, including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In The Dark). In conclusion, the movie is truly worth a look that gives a different perspective on how things were for US GI Joe coming out of school and is expected to serve his country in battles far from home. And Colin Farrell is remarkable in this film that I have not seen before, but I can not wait to see him more than him. <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
