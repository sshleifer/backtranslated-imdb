Saving Grace is a good movie with your heart in the right place. Grace is recently widowed and realizes that her late husband left her with a lot of debts. She could lose her beautiful house and see no other solution for her misery than to grow marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most viewers would like to live and the villagers are all the wonderful people that most viewers would like to have as neighbors. There is only one thing wrong with this image and it's the way portraying the effect marijuana has on the user. Obviously, none of the actors or writers of this film never lit this thing. The way people work after smoking their joints is ridiculous and just supposedly ridiculous. It is in these scenes that the mind is replaced by the English slapstick, and that is the damage in a movie that is still pleasant.
