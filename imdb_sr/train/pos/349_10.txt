Call me stupid, but I absolutely loved the film about the horror of 2001, Valentine. It was so well made, well written, well-played, well-directed, etc.! Everything was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lil's death), very funny (vvv.Bleed-Me-Dri.com), completely scary and creepy (Paige's death), and only ordinary hearts (first scene). I think the whole team has done a great job, especially three leading names: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (I both met, and got autographs, during the shooting of this movie - VERY lovely people!) And Marlee Shelton. Br /> I'm very sick of the people who call this movie "another clone". This movie is by no means a Scream clone. In fact, this film is performing rings around Scream. It actually does SENSE! Scream was not the only movie that had a masked killer inside. Sorry, but it seems that Scream was also a clone (hm ..., Friday, 13th, Halloween, and many other horrible films also contained masked killers). I also think that the killer's novelty is masked in the Cupid brilliant. It's so strange to see a sweet, hypocritical face that does all these horrible things. Another newspaper (nose bleeding) makes way for a fantastic ending! The finish line gives me wins every time I see it !!!!! So, even if you do not like the first time, look again at Valentine's Day and give him another chance! PS- Beware of My New Website (VVV.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon...
