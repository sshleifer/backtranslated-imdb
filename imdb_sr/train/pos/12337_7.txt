Poor Ivey: Although she was born, she had a bad fortune to marry a charming lunatic (Richard Nei). As the film was set in the 1920s or 1930s, when rigid Victorian ideas about the class began to argue on the edges, this unsafe status unnecessarily disturbs her. Gretorexs (because they call it) do not know where their next shilling comes from, but there are horseback riding parties and fancy-dress balls in gifted pleasunces that they can try. When Ian (Joan Fontaine) meets the rich elderly gentleman (Herbert Marshall, who had to be born in the middle ages), she sets him one of her extreme paws. Fortunately, one of the beauties she still carries (Patric Knovles) is a doctor whose consulting rooms provide a hideout of poison, with which she forgives her husband. The fact that she suggests Knovles does not seem to be a bit phenomenal, even as the hours go by until she is hanging on the neck until she dies. Turning the action depends on the police inspector Sir Cedric Hardvicke; Knovles' mother (striking Lucile Vatson); and Knights' loyal hostess (Una O'Connor). Sam Vood adds some subtle touches to this good average melodrama; Fontaine's brilliant face delivers the rest.
