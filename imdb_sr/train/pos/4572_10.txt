As someone who lives with a cerebral pallium for over forty years, I consider this film to be inspiring. If someone with such a tough CP case as Christie Brovn can do so much, then there's no reason I can not make my dreams come true. Daniel Dai-Levis and Brenda Fricker give great performance. <br /> <br />
