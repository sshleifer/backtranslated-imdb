First, I do not like almost all Neil Simon's films. But there is something in it that is unique, which attracts me, and I would say it's among the most entertaining comedies I've ever seen. The other time I looked at him, the connection was clear. When Neil Simon met my grandmother? Ah, they were scared to sue, so he changed them to men. And how boring it would be only housewives, the stars of the business show are more fun. This is a personal overview, and my still grandmother at the age of 97 (she even surpassed the magnificent mood of Valter Matthau!) Would deny it - but some of you must find resonance in these characters. > Secondly, I have a bit of tolerance towards George Burns, but somehow it has turned into one of the best supporting performances that I can remember (and my late grandmother even enjoyed, although she did not recognize the extraordinary similarity she shared with the movie character). Br /> Very Ethnic in taste, and over the top you will either laugh and laugh or exclude yourself. For me, satisfaction is retained.
