I ran through this movie on TV and I could not turn it off. Peter Sellers plays an unpleasant guy who falls on the extremely warm and sweet Goldie Havn (who does not?). The way Goldie's character is kept from the beginning of the film to the end is still non-traditional today. This film gave me a different angle in human relationships, and it was very funny to me. Peter Sellers' role was heavy sales, but I think he pulled well.
