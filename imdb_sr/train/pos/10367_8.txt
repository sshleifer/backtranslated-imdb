When I first saw the "Scream in the Dark", I had no idea what it was about. But when I saw it, I was shocked by what was shown. When I saw him the second time in the class of Australian cinema, I realized another question: communication issues. You see, when the dingo pulled out Lindy Chamberlain's baby (Meril Streep), she and her husband, Michael (Sam Neill), were affected by sorrow, but did not show it. As Adventists on the seventh day, they believed that God wanted this to happen, and that they could not mourn. But when people across Australia saw their lack of sorrow, everyone began to believe that Linda did it alone. The point is that the wrong message was transmitted to the public, and people turned against Linda. Although it was a pure misfortune, it still happened. This can be one of the biggest disasters created by the existence of mass media, regardless of the political attitudes of the media. As for the performance, Streep is doing a very good job with an Australian accent (not a surprise). there, and Sam Neill is just as good. You'll probably be delighted only by what you see here. Definitely one of the best films of Fred Schepisia ever.
