If you want to see a movie of different types, if you feel the Love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this film brings you to thinking. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, you can see the ultimate intelligence in the end, when love gives you instructions, not your brain. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel human. The film is as good as Forrest Gump. Foreign movies are sometimes more interesting, but there are not enough advertisements to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" Majid Majidija is another example of such foreign films, almost with similar taste.
