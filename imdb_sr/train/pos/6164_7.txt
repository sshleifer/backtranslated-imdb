Have we made 'video nasties' again? Under the large-screen 8 mm wide-screen digital widescreen, this is a pretty good ride. Unfortunately, there is little too much of a story, and sometimes it becomes like a travelogue because our heroine searches the sleek points in Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. I am, however, quite brave for the 'deviated' scenes, including everything from hot wax, cruel torture and rough sex to drowning, cutting off the head and some others. These scenes are flawless and the damage is that Bruno and his budget could not stretch to make all the significant creatures become more than free cartoons.
