In Kongwon-do's film he has a relatively intimate look at the meaning (as well as the general nonsense) in the lives of various Koreans; empty people are looking for ways to fill themselves, enjoying the escapism of nature. From the beginning to the end of the film we notice the mischief of different characters; we learn about their shortcomings and their desires, the overall complexity trapped in human life (and again the simplicity of humanity). Although the film is slow, it can be very contemplative. It does not impose any ideas, but allows the ideas to come by themselves, allow concepts to be discovered. loneliness, that love is often an act of selfishness and many mistakes we make. It's a look at everyday life, very good and beautifully made. If you are looking for action or an intense drama, it's not a movie for you. However, if you enjoy honest, original and meaningful movies that are not forced and glitzy, this is a great movie to watch.
