This is a powerful documentary about abuse in a house in Cameroon. The "Sisters" in the law are women lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted their husbands for abuse of spouse and won a divorce wife desperately seeking through the Muslim Council. This is quite a long time - about two hours - but fascinating in terms of both individual prosecutors and defendants and lawyers who successfully represented them in courtrooms presided over by women judges. It will leave you, as it has left me, with many questions about how this change happened. How and when did women come to power in Cameroon? Did several cases in this film have a significant impact on the treatment of women by spouses? Is the granting of divorce by a Muslim court against the explicit wishes of a husband a one-time event? I do not claim that the filmmakers were able to answer these questions. They shot the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the film they made deserves a wide audience.
