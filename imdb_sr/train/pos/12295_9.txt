"Hotel du Nord" is the only Carne film from the period from 1936 to 1946, with dialogues not written by Jackues Prevert, but by Henri Jeanson. Janson was much more interested in Jouvet / Arletti than for a couple of lover, Annabella / Aumont. The latter is pretty mild, and their story is strangely reminiscent of Edith Piaf's song "les amants d'un jour", except that the story of the songs is tragic. What is fascinating today is this popular little world, the Saint-Martin Settings channel. This film is expensive to lovers of French films for another special reason. Pimp Jouvet tells his protégé Raimonde that she wants a change of air because she does not understand the meaning of the vorld atmosphere, whore Raimonde (the wonderful Arletti) thinks this is an insult and she delivers this line, which is undoubtedly the most famous of the entire French cinema: /> In French: "Atmosphere? Atmosphere? Est-ce kue j'ai une gueule d'atmosphere? Trying to translate:" The Atmosphere? Atmosphere? Do I Have an Atmosphere? This is our French "Nobody is perfect."
