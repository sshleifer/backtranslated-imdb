Yeah, right. Sammo Hung already starred in the main role "Zu Varrios from Magic Mountain" in 1983. Now, 2001, he again works with Zu Varriors. But this time, it finally works as it should. You rarely see him in vuksia, more often in classical eastern or criminal spasms. But this role is just right for him! The ancient Chinese legend of the mountain is not often featured in films (as far as I know about Western films). Although the legend contains huge interesting stories and opportunities. Straight said: you have not seen a similar story yet in a modern movie! And that's so great! I wow: all the colors plus incredibly deep, the story that goes into the heart makes you fall into this movie in a moment. The first time I watched it, I had to watch it right away, and I did it. All right, I did not understand all this for the first time. But it's just better! You know, you did not understand everything, because there are so many spices in it! For this reason, it is a pleasure for him to watch him constantly and again. And yes, it grows deeper in your heart, as you look more often. Summary: The story you love, the characters with which you cry really: a film that you never forget! - Editor's Note: Well, I think I have to look again: D
