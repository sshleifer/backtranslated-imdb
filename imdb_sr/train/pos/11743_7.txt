Although it was not without disadvantage, this drama was suitable for showing around Easter time. He reminded us of our spiritual self and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences. There was so much to enjoy in the drama, not only because of dull teenagers who gave better musical accompaniment drama than a rather bad sound score in the background. The acting was great and Timothy Spall was once again great. The highlight was very satisfactory, though quite simplified. Timothy Spall "let go" suicide of his long dead woman and was convinced and reflected the feelings of despair that were present in a teenager who hurt herself. The resolution between the graphite and the Muslim was satisfactory, but less convincing. A beautiful drama that left me and my wife to remember that the evening was well spent. Congratulations!
