Kicked on the re-imagined series Battlestar Galactica, from the same creative team Ronald D. Moore and David Eicka, as well as the new serial creator Remy Aubuchon. Caprica is located in twelve colonies some 58 years before Battlestar Galactica. The new series, in addition to its human drama, is also recording key steps in the development of what will become the Cilone Race. Pilot and series should follow two families; Graystones, including Daniel Stoltz, a computer genius and corporate tycoon, and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter, Aloe (Tesson), while Adami includes Josip (Esai Morales) lawyer and his son Villyama of the future Admiral of Battlestar Galactica. Like the Battlestar Galactica, the series includes some great experienced actors in Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Valker, as well as some very talented relatively new actors, including Alessandro Toreson and Magu Apanovicz. For lovers of Battlestar Gallactice there are similarities and continuity with this series, but it is also very different. In the pilot, at least elements of science fiction are definitely present, but they are a minor part of this series. The scenes on Caprica, which reflect a technologically advanced society, also have a retro feel, this is achieved through some of the architectures, costumes and the way it's captured. While the look and feel of the two series have some significant differences, some of the themes will look very familiar, religion is again very important here, while the racial theme is rarely touched in BG is far more important. We also deal with terrorism about the existence of a soul and whether one machine can have, as well as issues related to crime and government. The pilot is released directly to DVD in an expanded and unrated version prior to broadcasting on TV, the series will start in 2010. As Battlestar Galactica, this series was filmed in Vancouver
