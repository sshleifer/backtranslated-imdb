Although not in the whole movie, Andy Griffith again plays his role in this CBS TV movie. The plot is easy-Griffith's character dies, and his last wish is that his wife and children scatter his ashes the place he called (Mountains somewhere). Although it will never be visible on TV and it will never be released on the video, if you get the chance to watch this - BACK.
