This is a terrible tale of ghosts. I showed it to some of my friends in my club, and they were admired all the way! Without blood or blood - just an old age. It starts from the beginning, builds and builds. Completion is a real craft that caught me unprepared. Well-focused and well behaved. It's also a "piece of time" - set in the 1920s - which added the atmosphere. I was so impressed that I got a book from Susan Hill from Amazon. The film follows the book very closely. It's a pity that is not easily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This, along with "Haunted", are probably two of the best Ghost Stories I've ever made. What just shows that a little creativity surpasses "your face" every day!
