Note that all those who did not like and enjoyed this movie commented that it was not as good as a book or that it was different from the book. I do not understand this kind of critique. Books and movies are different media. While books have watches and clocks for developing characters and stories, movies have about 120 minutes. However, the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, audio, and imagination. I do not care if the movie is good or actually has a similarity to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I judge for what it is. This film was charming. An old and often seen story, prone to cliches, it could easily have been unpleasant. However, Riffen and Reeves withdraw him. One reviewer found Riffen away. I would never have thought that she was 40 years old when she made this film. For her, she acted as an actress for acting in 23-24 years. I also think it's the best Reeves ever did. The story could be stronger, and I agree that the game on the screen could use "tug". Still, it's worth watching; apparently not a strong love story, but a charming romance that will leave you happy that love is strong emotions and goes well beyond evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without mandatory f # $% words, bare butts, or hours of spit-sharing kisses.
