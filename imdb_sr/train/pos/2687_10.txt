No other movie brought me to this ... and I do not feel bad. Like, I do not want the money to come back or the time I was waiting to watch this movie (9 months), nor do I feel bad about using two hours of summer sunny day to look at this ______. The reason I say "_____" is because, no matter how hard I break my brain, it seems that I can not find a word in ALL of the seven languages ​​in which the movie was summarized. I have no idea what happened all the time and halfway through a movie that I needed a break. None of the films did it before. I never wanted so much flowers, milk and baguet in my life. Thank you. - Ed Uh. * clean throat * No word. No thoughts. I do not know. I really do not know. - Cait
