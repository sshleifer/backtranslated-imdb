11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (first, for example), and sometimes they told Americans "we had more deaths than you and you supported the killers", sometimes it's really weird (but very symbolic and interesting). I really liked Claude Lelouch (personal life of a couple in New York, which shows that our everyday "problems" are irrelevant), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, powerful anti-wars in general), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny), typical African optimism despite terrible everyday suffering), and Ioussef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, who has moral difficulties in accepting American politics towards Arab countries). I am really glad to see that many Americans loved this film. This shows that we (or they? I am still a Belgian, but I live in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and that they can question the past and present procedures of our government, as we should in a democracy.
