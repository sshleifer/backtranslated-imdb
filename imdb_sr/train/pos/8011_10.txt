This was the best Muppet movie I ever saw! I accidentally know that Miss Piggy's fantasy about the encounter as a baby was the cause of Muppet Babies. The songs will remain forever in my head. Just because that stupid Nickelodeon show Hei Dude still stays in my head. I'm sorry, a little further away from the subject. But all the same, what I like is the animals after the loan that says "Bie Bie! Bie Bie! Bie Bie!" So I laughed so much. My absolute favorite is the game in the end. I was surprised that the characters in Sesame Street went to the wedding. I'm just glad that this movie was very funny I borrowed it from the library and now I bought it because I can not keep a copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I declare this is the best movie I've ever seen! is even better than Austin Povers in Goldmember, who was my favorite movie!
