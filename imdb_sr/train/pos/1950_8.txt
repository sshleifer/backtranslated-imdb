Diane Keaton has played several "heavy" parts in her long number of years on the big screen, but is mostly known for "light and soft" things with Voodie Allen, such as Annie Hall. She deserves the Oscar for the best actress in the drama for this effort and it does not matter which competition was the year when it was first shown. Try to find a scene in which it does not appear. And it was a heavy drama, exhausting in rhythm and repetition, action, all at full speed. Make-up made her as young as possible and she fit into the age category of the 30's even in close-ups, but she played half her age and very quickly. The movie, on the whole, was pretty well made, set up and recorded with strong support, but Keaton was carrying the burden.
