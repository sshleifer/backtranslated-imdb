Yes, this is one of the great music videos I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the small and famous voice Katherine Grayson. Music and dance are great. I understand that Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there's a Kelly dance with Jerry Mouse, which is pretty unique at the time. Betty Garrett plays a waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She's one of the great Hollywood stars. I saw it again on A & E TV and the same thing I had in my old VCR recordings. Never get tired of these old musicals. What happened to Hollivood?
