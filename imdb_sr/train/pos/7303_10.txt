I just managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. When I was made nearly 30 years ago, I thought that the terrible moments would be pretty brave. I made a mistake. There are some great moments that sent me trembling down the spine. Even the acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic, and Donald Pleasance was great. It does all copies, e.g. Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream looks very loud. I can not say that this is the best Carpenter because I did not see much of his, only I can remember his Starman (I think he succeeded). The night of the witch is the crowning achievement of the horror.
