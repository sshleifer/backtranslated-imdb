This is the hand of the biggest stand up ever. I've seen a lot of stand up shows, there were a lot of stand up shows, and I'm watching Bet's Comic View, but I've never seen anyone who could compare Murphy's skills in this show. The impressions are excellent, the sketches are great, and the timing is perfect. You can even say that a bunch really intertwines. When Rav did a few years later, it was also very good, but this is number one in my book. It also shows that at one point, especially in the early-mid-eighties, Murphy was funny. My favorite part of the show is when he recounts a family barbecue and "Ice cream! Mooommmm! Ice cream comes in!" Another major part is his mother, Clint Eastwood.
