People forget that there were several King Kong ripoffs - Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), all are mutually hacking, but IETI stands alone. It lends only one item from King Kong and this is the attraction of an animal with one female person. The IETI myth is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong), and archaeologists fascinated him, it used to exist, but there are no scientific data to prove it. This film is hard to find, but it's worth watching. For the first time I watched it on the "Elvira's Dark Empire Master" in the early 1980s. I sent a spine in the spine as a kid, especially when I WAS angry. I saw him again, around 1:00 AM on ABC 2 to 3 years ago. When I saw it again, it even more appreciated me, it has some good effects (for my time), and the story includes the dumb boy and his dog, and the evil businessman who wants to kill IETI for his needs. Also, music is pretty cool, just like IETI. :-) Gianfranco Parolini and Ietians create a great atmosphere of monsters. Vote 7 and a half from 10.
