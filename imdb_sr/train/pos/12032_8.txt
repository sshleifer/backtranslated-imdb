The film I will review is a small television movie made in 1996, featuring Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. The protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager who feels pressure to have such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets a former boss called Nick Rian (Jeremy Jordan "Never Kissed"), they immediately fall for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where to take over their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love', but she only took advantage of him to get rid of her parents so she could be with Brad (David Lascher, the future Sabrina friend for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart was really surprised by her role of the evil manipulator and she is well wearing a movie using her friends and Nick to literally get away with the murder. The rest of the auxiliary actors work well and each one has his own when he has time on the screen. I also wondered why this film was shot and released in the same year, Hart, he started to represent Sabrina, Teenage Vitch, and it shows that he can play in my genres of film and television. Although the Dalo film is something that still stands out as something of its best work involving drama or thriller and I'm looking forward to the "Nine Dead" that comes out in November as it shows that it can be seen as other people which are not called "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can watch this on the internet, so I suggest you look at it.
