Be careful with this. When you get your gloves on it, it will change the way you watch kung-fu shifts. Now you will be curious about all the kung-fu movies, you will be in the lack of depth and character development, craving for mystery and unpredictability, you will require dynamic work with cameras and incredible backgrounds. Unfortunately, you will not find all these aspects together in one kung-fu movie, EXCEPT for five deadly poisons! Easy to be the best kung-fu movie of all time, Venomi combines a rich story, full of images, with vivid (and developed) characters, along with some of the best cameras that will come out in the 70's. The success of someone who loves a movie depends on the ability of viewers to decipher which character is who, and who is specialized in that poison. One is Stonoga, two are Snakes, three are Scorpions, four are Guster, and five are Zabac. Each character has different characteristics, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. In this lies the hook, we learn together with the student's character, revealing who are different men. We are in his shoes (so to speak), and we have to choose who we believe, and who does not, just like him. We learn with him. Not only is the plot, characters and work with the camera great, it's also fun to watch, which in my book seems more valuable than any other movie of this kind. It's worth a lot of clocks to pick up everything that's going on. Venomi are a lesson about what kung fu really can do ... just do not expect that many other kung-fu movies will live up to it.
