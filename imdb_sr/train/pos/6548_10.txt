This is a great movie! I played all Nancy Drew games and I read books, and I never expected the movie to be so exciting and fun! If you have never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first of the Secret of the Old Clock so that you can somehow 'get used to the Nanci, then you can watch the movie, because in the movie they do not actually introduce characters' names. ;) My whole family enjoyed and the shop was extremely interesting. This is the ultimate return from the previous films of Nancy Drew, for which actor Nancy Drew did not respond. This film is like Alek Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so cool! Nancy Drew lovers, you have to watch this!
