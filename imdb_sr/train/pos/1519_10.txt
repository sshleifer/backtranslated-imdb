Bearing in mind how many of these movies have gone, you have to understand that they have had fun doing them. The film focuses on a house that unusually adapts to everyone who lives there. The inhabitants were: the author of Charles Hillier (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Who is pursuing one of his creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who is too close to the statue with wax; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's beauty is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertvee), on the verge of being transformed into a character. The "house that pours blood" is really worth a look (it's good, it's Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Other than just being tidy, there could be some ridicule: it could question the question of the real horror against the supposed horror. As in "The Shining", we can ask if the house / hotel itself has some memories of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (like Paul's co-star) is HOT HOT HOT! At the time this came out, she also performed in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Perhaps she - like Barbara Steele - will remain only known as the queen of screaming, but she will mark my words: THIS IS THE HORROR OF THE KING! I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele in something. I suppose the only strange scene (so to speak) where Denholm Elliott wears a pink shirt and a soft jacket. You read that right. What's the name "Denholm"? Oh well. Very cool movie.
