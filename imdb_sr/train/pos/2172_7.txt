"Mad Dog" Earle returned, along with his sad mom, Marie, and that unstable Velmo club. So are Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even cowardly ash Pard. The only thing missing is a good reason to transform Raoul Valshove High Sierra 14 years later, without rethinking the line or frame, with a talent that is clearly crossed or two down the ladder from the one in the original. (Instead of Valsha, we get Stuart Heisler, we get Jack Palance for Humphrea Bogart, Ida Lupino Shelley Vinters, and so on through credits.) The only change is that this time, instead of black and white, it's Varnercolor; Unfortunately, there are those who would consider this an improvement. I have died a thousand times, maybe it is not necessary? and inferior ?? but at least it is not travesty; the story is still working on its own tougher conditions. Earle (Palance), fresh from pens near Chicago, drives to the west to lead a great job designed by the sick king of Long Chen, younger? typing over a post-mountain resort. Along the way, he almost collided with the Oakies family when he was hit by their grandson; kicking takes place even when she finds her poor. Getting to the cabin where the rest of the gangs are found, he finds amateur hotheads in his throat as well as Vinters, which throws him (as well as a dog). While the call is in progress until they arrive at their hotel, Palance (on Winter's sadness) offers to pay for an operation that will cure the deformity of the girl, the gesture that bruises. Then, the surgical attack on the resort turns into bloodshed. On the lam, Palance moves more into the cold Sierras .... It's enough story that is persistent enough, competently derived, which has no particularity that Valsh and his actor brought in 1941, the year of Bogie , with this role and that of Sam Spade in the Maltese Hawk, he became a star. And the last, heretic remark: These mountains look beautiful in color. <br /> <br />
