Like his early masterpiece "The Ivy Man," Linch proves to his slanderers that he can tell a true, simple story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of an elderly retired man (skillfully acted by Richard Farnsvorth) who decides to drive a tractor across several states to complete a visit to his alienated brother who is now at the door of death. A beautiful Badalamenti rating, an extraordinary photo of a village life (loves those images from the aerial corn field) and a crafty director's hand that reveals the human basic humanity, this is a wonderful part of the life of the movie. Its extremely slow speed can slow some viewers to sleep, but those who stay together for the ride will in the end be well rewarded.
