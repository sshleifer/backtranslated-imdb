I think a large number of viewers have completely missed the fact that this is obviously a parody of Western films. It's not a bad movie - it's a smart language in cheekbone cheeks. I do not think this movie is serious for a moment. What makes this film even more unique is the fact that about four strong, beautiful women, of which two are black, one is black. Asian and Mexican / Hispanic figure. These are not your usual women in the west - they are tough - they can quickly draw and shoot. They are so hard that the barman shakes when he pours his whiskey. The action that drives this story is typical for Western - in the spirit "you shot at my brother - so am I" I'll get you! "Only in this Western, the female nurse is shot and she regrets the vengeance on the gang that did it. So she goes and rounds her old paws from her bank robbery days. </ Br> One of them, Mary, is not so much interested in the revenge of Rachel's sister, but she is motivated by the fact that gold and jewelry are hidden in the city they are moving. There are several scenes that do not have quite it makes sense, without mixing so much that they can be ignored, but I wondered why they were there. So, the movie might be a little tense, but Above all, this is a well-made movie that has failed to find an audience that has recognized what it is. My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the movie is a negativac - of "heroin", one is Obviously, other sexual orientations are never revealed. <br /> <br /> 7 Stars
