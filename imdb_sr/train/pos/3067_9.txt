What a surprising dessert comes through late television. If I had just read a short article on the television list, before I could watch a movie, I would pass. The idea of ​​a hit-man movie-watching-wants-leave-in-work-and-falling-in-love .... sounds banal. But the movie works. From the beginning of the film, it is clear that a man carries weight on his shoulders, before he says. The look and feel of the movie is perfect. dark, but not disgusting. Apart from the family aspect of "hit-man" that provides the touch of surrealism, Maci's character is tackled with his marriage and the control of his father. Macchi shows a squeezed sorrow, and his sleeping conversations with a little son are incredible. The boy shows acting skills beyond his age, and the interaction between father and son is so natural, personal and loved. This is one of the best movies I've seen for a while, and I can not believe I accidentally came across the television late at night.
