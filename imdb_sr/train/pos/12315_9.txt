There are 21 comments when I add my list to this list and there is hardly any criticism. This is because this movie is great fun and there's a little bit of everything in it. Perhaps it's a bit daunting for younger children, but my 15-year-old son thought it was fantastic in every way. action, humor and even beautiful music. I buy DVDs only when I know they will watch them regularly and now that is finally available in the United Kingdom, I will surely add it to my collection.
