This film is shockingly underestimated by IMDb. Like many films, this is not Shavshank. But it's pretty good, if you can predict, a dance competition / personal growth movie. If you want to spend an hour and a half looking at a kind of 8 mile for a female dancer, I think you'll like it. Judging by the IMDb rating, I guess this film was approaching the top 250, and "voted bombarded" with 1s, as it happens with so many non-mafia movies, no special effects, or involve non-white or uneven characters. It's an American movie, but it's not an American movie. Most of the Toronto characters are subtle, and some people may think that it is fully set up in the US just because it is a final competition in the border town of Detroit. I loved music. I liked the dance (but I'm not convinced it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what I know). The characters were easy for the eyes. I agree that the title is shit. I do not remember anyone in a movie that says these words, and I should have a "s". (No, it's not a foreign language). There is not much that would hate this movie (and let's be honest, voice 1 means you hated it) so I can only assume it is an expression of hatred for people in it, and that's sad .
