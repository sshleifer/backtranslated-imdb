OK, I really do not think Trailer Park Bois has bad stories, because they're kicking. They just ... clash with each other. For example: At the end of the film, Ricki and Julian are showing who say "Patrick Levis" to lower the dog and go. Then, in the end, it shows that Ricki and Julian said they were in jail for 2 years. In the pilot series, the first spot they are showing is the same clip of Ricky and Julian shouting at Patrick Levis. But in the TV series, they were allegedly in prison for 18 months. They also give us the impression that the story of the movie and the story of the TV series are linked (because of the scene of yelling between the guys). But some actors show completely different characters. Naturally, Patrick Roach plays in "Patrick Levis", but in the series, Randy plays. Sam Tarasko plays one of the guys who pay Ricky for extermination, and then plays Sam Losc in the series. In the movie, the guys mock the coke instead of smoking the hash. The point is, they never actually confirm that these two stories are in anyway related, except the scene scene. I'm sorry to continue to murmur.
