I loved this film because it's a true story in Amazon, a part of the world that has always intrigued me. I believe that the shortened form of the book was published in Reader's Digest shortly after the actual event. Because I'm a "babi boomer," the character and actress are my contemporaries, and for that reason I referred to the film. I also believe that the film is valuable for teaching the survival skills if the observer is watching the characters following the streams leading to the river and to the coastal settlements where they can get help, as well as other survival techniques. The most important was her willingness to survive and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope that viewers will learn something from it, except that they will see it for fun. I would like the film to be published in VHS and DVD as soon as I want to add it to my video collection. It should also be shown more often on satellite movie channels.
