This is the best Emma that exists in my opinion. Seeing the second version (1996), which is also good, and read the book, I think I can safely say that this is a true interpretation and that it is the most faithful masterpiece by Jane Austen. 1996 film with G. Paltrow is also good, except that it's almost a different story. It's very light and flamboyant, you do not see the darker edges of characters, and if you just want a nice movie, it would be perfectly fine, but the intricacies of some pitches, such as Churchill / Fairfak entanglement, have gone so far as to be practically nonexistent. But if you want the characters to develop a bit, more realistic and multi-dimensional, the 1996 TV version is superior. Emma is an extraordinary person, but she's wrong. Kate Beckinsale is a master in showing small characters. You see how she looked casually disgusted with some simpler conversations by Harriet Smith, but she does not show any remorse for destroying Harriet's proposal until this action destroys her marital happiness in the end. You see her narcissism and she tells Frank Churchill that they will harm others to achieve their goals. For Emma, ​​she played a conductor and had a new friend while she was absent with the time after she suffered the loss of her governess for marriage. For Frank Churchill, it is to secure the promise of a woman she loves while she treats her and others disgustingly to keep a secret. In the book, she sees all this in the ghostly awakening of all the mistakes she has made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gineth Paltrow are persuasive in their remorse, but Paltrow is childish and stagnating while Beckinsale's awakening is quite real and serious and you see a transition from childish, selfish behavior to a kind and thoughtful adult. Both versions are very good, but I prefer this one.
