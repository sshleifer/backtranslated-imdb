This place in England during 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) were sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansburi). She does not want them but reluctantly leads them. He seems to be studying like a witch through a letter of correspondence with a college witch. (OK - I understand this is a family movie, but - College of Vitchcraft ??? Come ON !!) Before he can complete the course even though the college is closed due to the war (???), Professor Tom Tominson (David Tomlinson). Both she and her children travel on the bed with the help of magic iron. This is the first time I saw when I was 9 years old and vaguely I remember I loved him. Certainly not as an adult! The story is stupid (even for fantasy), the kids are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly disgusting. Roddy McDowall is third on the list and only appears in two short scenes! There is also a trip to the island of Naboomb, led by animated animals. I thought it might be fun, but the animation is bad (for Disney) and has a very violent and too long football game between animals. There are some savings here: Lansburi and Tomlinson are great; songs (while they are forgotten) are pleasant; the long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy, and the special effects that have won the Oscars are still quite impressive at the end. But the bad story, bad animation and inconspicuous kids really pull this one. I heard that the expanded version is even worse! I can only give this 7.
