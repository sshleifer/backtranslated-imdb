The great trip of Bila and Teda is a continuation of the great adventures of Bill and Ted. Their false follower for traveling almost immediately after the first movie, and doing the same well for the job, if not better to entertain the viewer. Ted uses evil robots that look just like Bill and Ted. When robots kill Bill and Ted, they must compete with a deadly reappear (death) and return their lives to normal. Sometimes, especially Bill's and Ted's interview, it's a great movie. The Vannabe rockers have certainly made another great movie. Pick it up the next time you're in the blockbuster!
