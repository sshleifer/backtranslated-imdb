One afternoon I caught this movie on the cable. I must admit that I have never been a great baseball fan, but sometimes I can get into a good sports related film. What was more interesting to me was the introduction of a foster family system. As a therapist who saw both the good and the bad community of mental health and the foster care system, I thought it was pretty refreshing to see a movie that showed the climax and crashes of this system: people jumped from family to family, biological parents do not always take an active part, and transitions that can only be heart and heart. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchors of this film, both of which bring very convincing performances. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but I came across a tear at the end of the film.
