WHERE THE WALKER WANTED TO BE A BETTER KNOWLEDGE directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURI. And this time, he has the same co-stars: DANA ANDREVS and GENE TIERNEI. It must be said that Tiernei is not sufficiently utilized here in what is more a side effect while the reflector is intended for Andrevs. in a very powerful way until one night accidentally kills a man in the process of arrest. When suspicion falls on a taxi driver (TOM TULLI), he goes along with an investigation into the killing, but begins to feel guilty because he is in love with Taxi's daughter (GENE TIERNEI). Tiernei, by the way, looks a bit elegant for the girl he plays here and does not seem to fit into the dirty background of the story. The story lasts a dark reversal as the investigation went deeper and he discovered that the killed man had a silver plate in his head from the service as a war hero. In the end, it turns into a story of morality with Andrew, who develops conscience over his crime. It is fascinating as a film noir with capable performances of strong support. Good entry into the field of noir, strongly directed by Preminger and well played by Andrevs and Tierney, despite the mild misrepresentation of her character.
