Although it has one of the standard "Revenge Price Plots", this film is my favorite work by Vincent Price. Gallico has this quality that is missing in many characters of horror films. When you look at him, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustice against him, and you cheer him when he goes to revenge, although he scares you a little with his original rage. As the film continues, its character becomes tragic. He started the murder, but now he has to kill to conceal it. And I'll cover it again. And again ... your stomach sinks with his soul as he descends down the spiral - as if watching your beloved brother turning into a hood. Even if the story of revenge is old, the plotting devices are genuine - Gallico uses his tricks to kill in more inventive ways. Too bad this is not available for home use.
