This movie is one of my favorites. It's hard to explain why. Maybe it's the innocence of Corinne Nemec and his clumsiness in the courage with Cheril Pollak, but definitely has something to do with the soundtrack. Also, some characters have small lines or movements or moments that are fun in themselves. Finally, the story is the one that always pulls my heart, and the last scene is so bitter. All in all, I love this movie; It's perfect for a ravenous, sentimental girlfriend.
