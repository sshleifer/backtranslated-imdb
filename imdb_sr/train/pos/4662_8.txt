I just saw Hot Millions at TCM and I completely forgot this gem. Ustinov creates an intelligent and delicate plot that cleverly turns him from two important men to a genius ... And you will see. Maggie Smith is perfect as a messy secretary / neighborhood who has a hard time working but has a warm and lively personality that goes through this picture. She makes a fine picture of a warm, witty and real person who in the long run ... well ... Molden and Nevhart as top executives are taking the challenge of making what might be banal roles and making them go into their comical life. Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see and know at least in the case of the Romer, Ustinov provides a helping hand. This movie is intended to return to the era of computer comedy and this is a problem for the average person or man in that sense, but in fact, the characters are so involved and so much fun that watching the computer subgroup is almost lost ... I say almost. Lower the usual expectations of modern comedy and look for great performances and a friendly, forgiving and deeply complicated plot in this picture.
