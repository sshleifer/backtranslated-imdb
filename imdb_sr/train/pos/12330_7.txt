I just watched this benevolent parody of the Night of Living Dead, and I must say that it was so terrible and so scorched that it was great. This film included all the humorous and scenic recordings that the original had including a cemetery, an abandoned house, basement and lawn in front. What I especially like in this movie is the comical use of bread and all common household enemies against bread. Come on, we know that toasters, toasters and zippers have made bread a dozen times, and now we need to call their help to defeat a reanimated bread. Apart from cheap acting and voice, this short horror film is my favorite parody of the Night of Living Dead, even better than the Night of Living Dead in 1990. I think what makes this a movie worth watching is how writers and directors used all the dialogue from the original film and turned it around the bread, including the way the bread was revived and how it would be Avoid the remains because they are particularly dangerous. Another great reason why I love this movie is that there is no exception to what the bread is doing, they are evil, and even communities are evil, as you can see in the hilarious scene in which a journalist is rather monotonous. I think actors are especially funny, working on the fact that they are viscous attacked by bread crumbs (ie, the car scene). I think the end is very worth keeping. Although this is short and "Night of the dawn of a son of brides to return the revenge of terror from the attack of evil, mutant, alien, flesh, pack, zombificated living dead part 2: in a shocking 2-D" is debatable another great parody, is still recommended as a great parody of horror by what appears to be filmmakers. I recommend this film to anyone who is ridiculed by the Night of the Living Dead and continues to respect filmmakers. I would also like to recommend this film to anyone who loves D-movies and horror parodies, it's just a wonderful little short horror movie that is fun to watch and learn.
