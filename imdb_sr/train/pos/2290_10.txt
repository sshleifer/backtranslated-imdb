As Alan Rudolph's "Breakfast Champion" slides into the theater with a little fanfare and a lot of ridicule seems to me back in 1996 when Keith Gordon's "Mother's Night" came out. Now, for all the stories about Kurt Vonnegut being "incomprehensible", he is surprised to receive two top-notch film treatments (the other is "Slaughter house Five"). "Mothers Night" is certainly one of the most disadvantaged films of the decade and I do not understand why. It's great! She remains almost entirely faithful to Vonnegut's book (and is not too accentuated or over literary) and adds to her poetry which is purely filmmaking. How many film adaptations of any copyright work can this claim? Vonnegut himself even puts a movie about the kama at the end of the movie and can you seek better support from that? Not only is it a wonderful movie, but it's also a beautiful, colorful and directed movie, and it's among my first five or so American movies of the nineties. It is a sad, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. I would sincerely encourage everyone to see "Mother's Night" - he does not even know Vonnegut's work to fully understand him (as sometimes "Slaughter house five"). It's powerful, influencing cinema.
