The thing about my people is a wonderful movie about relations - above all, the grown son and his father, but also the son with his wife, sisters and mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is ridiculous, sharp and thoughtful. That led me to reassess my relationship with my now deceased father and my adult son. Peter Falk is as good as Paul's father - the role could not have been better. I hope that both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser will be recognizable in film awards next year for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his script.
