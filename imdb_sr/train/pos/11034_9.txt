Eric Valette is an apparently talented film maker, and also two guys who wrote the script. That's why Malefikue is a great movie, made with just a few bucks and tons of imagination. Well, I exaggerate a bit, but I'm honest. So, if you love dark, bloody movies, go and see this. It's really worth it.
