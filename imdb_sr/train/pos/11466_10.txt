I was lucky to see a zero day last night. It's a wonderful movie. Very disturbing. In a way, Zero Dai is very comparable to "The Blair Vitch Project". It's shot with handheld camcorders. It's about 2 kids. Only average children. Andre and Calvin. They are launching a campaign against high school called "Army 2". The whole story is written in the form of a Video Diary, of two children. This shows that there are relationships with parents, among other people, who show that they are just normal children, just like people we know or have encountered. We learned that the last mission of the Army 2 would have Zero Dai. They're planning to get a high school there. See how they gain access to weapons, how they plan, everything. They emphasize that the media did not influence them at all, and that there is no reason to do so. As I said, it's all in the form of a Video Diary, and then the cassettes are stored in the safe that will appear after the Zero Day. . Chilling realli. The film is very cold. Some of the things they say, how they plan, you'll just have to see them yourself. One quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is alone. He says: "Andre thinks he will simply go to a car on the run, doing it to numerous schools across the country. I do not know what he thinks, but the only way I go out of school is in a black plastic bag." Probably I will not even give you the real idea of ​​this movie. You really need to see it yourself. He is currently riding for festivals. A +.
