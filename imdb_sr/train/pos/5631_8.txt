Honor Favcetto took over the roles that were then considered controversial. As far as I remember, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980s, and the rights and emotions of women were rarely so deeply studied at that time. Russo. He is an adequate obsessed psychopath, but sometimes a little transparent. Diana Scarvid has a small role as well as Alfre Voodard as a home partner. Voodoo cares about the legal consequences when Favcett, a victim of rape, is avenging the culprit. The scene where she threw a hot oil on Rus is classic, and as a rapist she deserves it. Then he is held in bondage, and the consequences must be confronted. Very real story that reflects the emotions and rage of rape victims that were physically and mentally violated. Recommended. 8/10.
