Jim Carrei can do anything. I thought it would be some stupid childish movie, and it's not completely. It was so incredibly funny for ALL, adults and children. I once saw him because he was almost out of the theater, and now he finally came out on DVD on Tuesday, and I am the way to excitement, as you can see. You should definitely see it if you have not already done it, it was so great! Liz
