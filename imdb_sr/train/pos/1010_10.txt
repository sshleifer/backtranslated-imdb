I love this show! Every time I watch an episode I repeat that line and I recall how good this shov is. I am a great fan of science fiction and this performance aims to be the most important scientific (fiction?) Emission in the history of film / television. There are so many theories in this broadcast of the universe that can spark religion. His incredible season for the season is getting better and better. I was a fan of MacGiver because I had 5 (19) and I think it's so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows all the time star Richard Dean Anderson. Interestingly, each character is practically opposite from the others. When I first saw the Stargate movie, I immediately liked it and thought it was one of my favorite sci-fi shifts, and then listening to TV shows would turn away from it and I was really excited, but there was no time to run until the fifth season, it's almost over. Although, I was disappointed when I heard that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted the trilogy of the films, but the studio instead chose the series. I think it turned out well. Maybe even better. This show is incredible, and I hope you will never die. Atlantis is coming here!
