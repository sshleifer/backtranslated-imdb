Is it the future that awaits us? Overwhelmed, unbearable desert with hellish, unwanted existence? This film reminds us of a problem that is still bothering us, doubled since the film was released in 1973. Hopefully the world will not end like this ... Soilent Green is a wild movie that I enjoyed very much. He had cute characters, a semi-apocalyptic environment, an interesting and challenging story, and a macho-macho man: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant, dirty feeling. It's nearly scratched by the stench of the city and its dirty inhabitants. <br /> <br /> Characters are lovely. Charloton Heston, who became one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man created this role as a bad, yet cute guy. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something is wrong, but everyone around him or do not listen (they are more paid not to listen) or want him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his latest film, R.I.P.) plays the lovely old Sola, who is pretty much this nasty place. All the others are great, especially Leigh Tailor-Ioung like Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment in which he lives. Special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. factories, futuristic dwellings, and especially "blades" (bulldozers that are released by humans) were great. The polluted air from the outside looks disgusting and very nasty. Empty city streets filled with disgusting and ruined people are very disturbing. Another note is the ending, which still shocked me today. It's terrible, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea. Bottom Line: Excellent film of science fiction from the 70's which tells you to think and leave you feel very uneasy.
