"El Mar" directed by Catalan director Agusti Villaron, based on the novel by Blai Bonet, offers an insight into the Spanish history seen by the Balearic author, who returns the viewers back to the days of the civil war in that country. The film concentrates on three friends and follows them from those early days at the beginning of the war in Mallorca, up to a few years later, when two of these friends meet again when they are in a sanatorium, lost in the countryside. > First we meet three boys who play happy. Not everything that looks like. The tragic death of one of them indicates the cruelty of the one who is doing evil. The boys excluded a young girl, about their age, to participate in their games. When we meet again with adult Ramal, he is on his way to the sanatorium. Looks like he's suffering from tuberculosis. To his surprise, Manu Tur, one of his childhood friends is also treated, and a young girl who was not welcome to participate in their games is now one of the nurses overseeing health care. Obviously, Tur looks at Ramalla in a way that only means he is in love with a hard bully. Their relationship will have devastating consequences. Roger Casamayor works well with his older Ramal. Bruno Bergonzino gives the impression of Tur, a vulnerable youth. Antonia Torrens plays Sor Francisco with conviction. Angela Molina, looks like Carmen, the wife of the host institution. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. "El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows Agustia Villarone's talent in creating a novel for the viewer.
