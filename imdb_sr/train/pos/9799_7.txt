Pleasant Batman animated film. Not as much as "The Return of the Joker" or "Fantasy Mask," but still solid. I liked the way the movie kept speculation about who Batman was. It was nice. Nice action sequences. I've always thought Batman's cartoons were better than any poor Batman live film. The trend continues here. 7.5 from 10
