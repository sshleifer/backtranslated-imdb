I recently saw this movie in my class of International Business. I did not expect anything other than a boring documentary (not to say that I do not like a documentary that was just a bad luck with movies in that class) Imagine my surprise when this movie came, which is actually a movie. This film talks about all cultural differences in the workplace and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere. A cultural conflict shows how different the world is and how different we experience ourselves until someone comes and invites us to wake up. I would recommend this film to anyone in business or who just want to laugh, because it's ridiculous. Well, that's all! Cheers
