The key to joy and beauty, the pain and sorrow of life is our ability to accept that life is basically what it is, so that we do not constantly fight against this unique truth. In this way, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but so difficult for most of us to understand. In this film, the director shows us this truth, but allows us to discover it in our own way. This is a beautiful but simple story, more than a fable, which plays very well. Watching actors is more like being in a room with real people than just watching actors. I'm at a loss. The story is about men in the bathroom. Sounds like a real break, right? But nothing can be further from the truth. The American title for this film is The Shover, but it's almost antithetical to the main thematic element in this movie, which is the bath. I'm still at a loss. Talking about stories or characters will not do justice to them. So, I'll just tell you how much I enjoy watching this movie and how it's a moving and moving experience. I also had fun. I was very worried about the characters and I was deeply concerned about what happened to them. For each story, this is the highest form of praise. If you have launched movies like the King of Masks or no less, then make sure you see The Shover. Netflik has it, and DVD video and sound quality are great. I watched him in the original lancuage with well-designed and well-set English submarines. <br /> <br />
