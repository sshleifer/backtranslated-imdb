Not to mention the best performance of Pierce Brosnon. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when was it really bad? I think this film is incredibly underrated! The use of colors in this movie is something completely different in today's film world where every other movie has a Paiback blue filter. I also love the way they used a song from Asia. It proves that even what was once thought to be cheerful may be really cool set right. Since my movie was a hit movie, I had to check everything that was published in the genre. After I've seen it, I'm sure it had some effect on me through the process. It was pretty cool when my movie arrived at IMDb to recommend this movie if you like mine. As some of the others relate, I have no idea, making an even more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http: //vvv.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
