I'm looking at this page, and it seems to me that I do not approve that I have to listen to someone wandering and talking about the real classics. Of course, I agree that everyone has their own opinion, but here is mine: This movie should not be missed by any classical guard of horror, and should be seen by many unusual viewers around the world. Of course, he has lost some of his flirting and magnificence over the years, especially in the CGI world of today's world, but that's not why you would like it. , even for today's standards. His total craziness will accompany you as much as the original audience, so do not slam the classic if you have not given him a chance. Watch out, but not with a critical attitude. Watch how you're having fun, as originally planned.
