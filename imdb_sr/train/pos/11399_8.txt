Okay, the land is on terrible terrain. Yes, fine, so there are some randomly inserted songs and / or dance sequences (for example: Adam's concert and Henry's stage performance). And Leslie Caron can not really, um, you know ... act. But somehow, the "American in Paris" manages to go through all that as a sleek, first-rate musical ... mainly based on incredible dance talent and choreography by Gene Kelly and the charm truck that seems to be imported into every scene with Caron. (He must, because he seems to have ... a problem with emotions.) The most perfect and technically most impressive number in this musical is obviously a 16-minute ballet at the end of Film. It's great shot, and Kelly and Caron dance perfectly. But my favorite number would have to be Kellie's character who sings 'I Got Rhithm' with a pile of French schoolchildren, and then broke into a series of American dances. It just proves that you do not need special effects when you have some real talent. Not at the 'classics' level with' Singin 'In The Rain', but pretty high up there. It's worth the clock!
