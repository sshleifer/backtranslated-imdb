Eddie Murphi Delirious is undoubtedly the most fun thing I've ever seen in my life. When I first saw him 2 years ago, I was in the seams for weeks after that. To date, I have seen him 17 more times and still laugh every time. For those who do not know that Eddie Murphy was a genius comedy before becoming a Hollywood star. There is no bored place in this piece of genius unlike Eddie Murphy Rav who was released in 1987 and moving in the middle. If you are not a person who can not tolerate swearing, I would not advise you to see it, because you will probably hear the cursing of a form every 5-10 seconds. I gave this 10 out of 10 because it shows the best comedy genius of all of them at its best.
