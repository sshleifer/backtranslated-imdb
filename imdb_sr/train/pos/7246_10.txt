This movie is completely funny. Not only is the action terrible, but the acting is terrible. Special effects are gloomy and the whole film is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. Still, it's by far the most entertaining film ever to get a production license. It's 101 minutes of laughter because of the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in 3000 years, or any El Camino's. There are other aspects that I will not spoil, just because what makes movies so beautifully moronic. I highly recommend this film, only because of its complete idiocy. I have no idea who would look at it, expecting it to be a quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, watch the Exorcists of the year 3000!
