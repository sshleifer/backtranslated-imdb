So I'm going to go against the grain on this movie, so it looks like it. Since I am a fan of self-inflicted horror, I sat down on this, not knowing what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes, I was really scared (quite rarely). The film obviously has a small budget and is set up around the pedestrian crossing, but the lack of money from movies does not draw attention from the story. Yes, the story is somewhat embarrassing and does not explain very well, but THE CREEP is a class act and continues to cut and cut everything that comes in its own way. MESSAGE FOR LADIES !!! There are parts of a movie that you need to close your eyes or rent through your feet !! you will understand when you see it. All in all, a good movie and he makes a change to see a good movie that is scared and who is really scared
