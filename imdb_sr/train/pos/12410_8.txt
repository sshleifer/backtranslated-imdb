This is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie. The acting is excellent considering the script and the entire atmosphere of the film is very ominous. The mountain is well done and is used sturdy (watch for excellent death from barbed wire) and the action is strong when used. It's true that there are occasional lines in the script, but compared to other movies on the same (or larger!) Budget, that's barely noticeable. All in all, this is recommended. Believe me, it's better than it seems! 8/10
