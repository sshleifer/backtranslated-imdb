Only the name of this movie has led me to see what it is about, so I shot this movie in the early morning hours. If you ever wanted to see what miners had to pass in the early days and see a dramatic scene when the mine breaks down on men. This film obviously wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after the First World War and that the Germans came to the aid of French miners much in the unbelief of French citizens. The actors were remarkable, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a young boy who worked in the mine. There is an old old retired miner who descends down the mine when the elevator breaks down. If you are a true movie lover, this is a movie you do not want to miss.
