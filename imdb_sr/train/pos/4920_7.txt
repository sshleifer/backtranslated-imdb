No, not really, but this is a really good movie and unfortunately the gem is forgotten. The black and white corresponds to the film. The correct formula, the guy had the plague, and the authorities have to find everyone he's in contact before he dies. well-directed, and the acting is great. Richard Vidmark as a male lead is good, but is fully covered by Paul Douglas's acting role as captain of the police, Jack Palance (never better than this) and Zero Mostel as bad ones. Unfortunately, Palance continued to play similar characters in some really gangsters or war films.
