Pecker is hilariously funny, but a twisted film about a small town in Baltimore, whose daily routine routine is interrupted by Pecker, a young photographer who takes pictures of "real things". There are no beautiful models, no great men, it's just hard to live. This beautiful film is entertaining in the plasticity of the urban arts chain. There is one special scene when the homeless woman who buys at the Pecker Mama shop buys the same coat as one of the Vhitnei Art Addicts for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This just shows that no matter what money you have, you may not always have a taste. Nevertheless, John Vaters sends you in the endless spiral of laughter and the raw reality. You can have your main Hollywood movies with special effects and mountains of celebrities, but give me "Pecker" or "Hairsprai" (another great John Vaters movie) through "Titanic" or "Godzile" at any time !!
