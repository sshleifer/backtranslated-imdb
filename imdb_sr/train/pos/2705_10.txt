This is a scenario Ed Vood worked for more than 10 years in attempts to make. Aris Iliopulos finally got chutzpah to shoot a script that Vood rescued from his burning house at the expense of other, more passable values. This is a movie without a dialogue that some can silly describe as silent. In fact, it's a pretty noisy film, without the senseless conversation of most films. In the hands of these filmmakers, music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than any Christ in a Hollywood scenario, especially that stupid movie on a ship that was last Billy Zane ('Watch Out!' - J. Cameron. ... ick ...) I will take Zane's miraculously communicative monosyllabic grunts in this film through an empty dialogue every day. Billy Zane runs a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci shines as always, and the gods shine when you can put Sandra Bernhard, Rick (and) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy on the same poster. The design is perfect, the pyramid is remarkable, and the raunchy performance of Ron Perlman is simply beautiful. All in all, this is a chaotic, visceral masterpiece by lovers Ed Vood Jr., Authors and cinenephile. It must be seen for anyone who really loves movies in the same way that Iliopoulos and his actors do it first. A movie that will want you to have it yourself.
