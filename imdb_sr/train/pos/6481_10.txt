I saw this series when I was a kid and I liked the details it entered and I never forgot it. I finally bought a DVD collection and its memory mode. It's just a way to be docile, impartial and factual. The film footage is incredible and the interviews are fantastic. The only other series I found was the "Die Deutschen Panzer". I would just like Hollivood to sit down and look at this series, and then we could make some great war films. > <br /> Note. Band of Brothers, Saving Private Rian, Letters from Ivo Jima, Flags of our fathers and when the trumpets fade
