Dana Andrevs is one of those actors I've probably seen in dozens of films, but who is never really registered for me. Often stubborn, silent, playing the same types of roles and a bit like the underrated Glenn Ford, he is an actor who needs little effort to really appreciate; but when you hit a real movie .... And that's it. Preminger's curious look at New York's underground bone is just as dirty and stupid as any noir from the 50s, and Andrevs is in his element as too tough cop Mark Dikon who simply does not know how to play the game to progress: he hates criminals too to always play by the rules. Early in the film, he accidentally killed a murder witness that included an illegal game made by a mobster whom Dicon hates for personal reasons, and the rest of the film is being spent trying to conceal his participation and bring the mafioso to his kind of "justice". By the way he intertwines with the alienated husband of a man he killed (Gene Tiernei), and he also has to try to divert his father for murder. Stunningly photographed by Joseph LaShelle, with Ben Hecht's hard and sparkling dialogue and a really powerful end with elements of tragedy and found grace in just a minute or two, this is another noir for age and maybe it's my favorite Preminger the movie so far - it's certainly good as the more-announced Laura.
