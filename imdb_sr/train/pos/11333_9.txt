I'm just kidding about weight loss; Well, you can lose weight you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I love this movie. It has the same sense of youth and innocence as in movies such as Stand Bi Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet illustrates the beauty of simple living things and how often we overlook them. The film reminds us that it is to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic, mystery and horror they are experiencing. Jake's Closet is a story that is uniquely human in its empathy that anyone who has had a childhood can relate and fall in love. Watch him with your friends; watch him with loved ones; build a fort - wine optional.
