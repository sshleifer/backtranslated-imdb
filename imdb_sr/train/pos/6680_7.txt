It was different, that's for sure. Look at the actors! Talk about wonders. Villiam H. Maca and Ben Stiller were stars, although a bunch of actors almost shared the spotlights, in this farce about superheroes. The worst was Paul Reubens from the "Pee Vee Herman" glory. It has a lot of humor, colorful colors and no slack. It's a pretty fun, light comedy with just stupid characters, all of which want to be heroes a la Superman, Batman, Spiderman, what's your name? They have talents in strange areas, however, that the heroes do not (and do not want!). It's stupid, but you know it's happening. It is also a movie that you can watch in wars and does not miss any continuity. It's a long movie for one so busy, so pausing is here and there is fine. The language was loud and the children could enjoy this. In fact, I do not recall any cursing here, except for the guy in the theater next to me who constantly said: "What a stupid movie." I thought it was fun for two hours, but I'd rather watch the DVD and take a few breaks.
