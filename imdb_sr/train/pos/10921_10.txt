After reading a ton of good reviews about this film, I decided to take it for rotation (I purchased it on a DVD, so I'm "spin" punk ... I'm a jerk). The beginning was everything I had hoped for, the perfect setting (along with some quotes I heard on various Vu-Tang albums) on what was supposed to be a good movie. But the plot I heard was so big, so predictable. Every time I saw a character (except for Gutster), I assumed that Venom was. In addition, the only cool figure was killed in the middle of the movie. Okay, then the plot was not very good, but at least it was good kung-fu? Wrong. The fighting was very short and there were few. Different styles were allowed to be cool, but I want the fighting to last. I was hoping to see Lizzer running and doing some crazy clues on the walls, but that never happened. I was hoping to see Stonog to do something fast, but never happened. I was hoping to see Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 minutes, but that never happened. In short, there is not much going on. Fight is pretty routine. Do not be fooled just because this movie has a plot, that does not mean it's good.
