This film was incredible. I would recommend it to everyone, much better than I expected. It was definitely a spectacular movie in the heart. It's an incredible story, with incredible actors and creators. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (no one should be surprised) Derek Luke also did a great job.
