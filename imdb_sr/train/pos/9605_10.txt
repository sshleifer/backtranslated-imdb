so I was not sure how the movie would be like I only saw a small clip, but I thought it would be fine and I was right and I watched it twice a day when I got it and it's good It's I think Alison Lohan played the role of Beta very well, she is such a great actress and the writer must have entered many studies to find out about the bulimia, although the end is when the beth in the hospital has 2 observations of Horus after a meal, because I was told that 1 house is fine and that the hospitals do not help bulimics as it is said that it is probably the reason why I am still at home Even if my sister and mother wanted me to be hospitalized as if I had a bulimia, but this is a lattice film I recommend to anyone with or without eating disorders or for people who know someone with eating disorders because they can let them bulimia people and see the world how they work a little over the whole grid film and I recommend it to any and any type of person
