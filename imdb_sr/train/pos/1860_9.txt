I went to see Anton Fisher not knowing what to expect and I was most surprisingly surprised. Derek Luke's acting work was remarkable and the story was great. Of course, Denzel Washington has done his usual job acting and directing. This makes you realize that people with mental problems can help and that this film is a perfect example of this. Do not miss this.
