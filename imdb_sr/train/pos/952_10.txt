So this is made for TV movies only 7.6 on this site? Bah! Humbug! No doubt, this 1984 version of Dickens's classic story is the best ever made. And yes, Hound was a video version of 1951 that was also good, but not good enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest drawback of this version, although the acting was wonderful. George C. Scott is simply incredible as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this slum businessman pursuing the spirit of his dead partner, then three other spirits later that evening. Scott is right as Scrooge. Too hard for some critics who claim that he is not able to project a newly discovered joy that awakens on Christmas morning after ghosts teach him a valuable lesson. But hey, this is George C. Scott. He will never go dancing down the street in an attack of joy. He has too much dignity, and his Scrooge project his emotions in a realistic way. London's 19th century revives in the visionary style of Clive Donner. The film even borders with intimidation in several scenes involving ghosts. Nevertheless, an important moral story goes through every frame. You will not find this version more often on TV anymore, which is a disappointment. Version A Christmas Carol 1984 should be a compulsory part of the celebration of every household. When the decoration comes out of the cellar, this film should be found in the DVD player at least once during the season. 10 out of 10 stars. Hound.
