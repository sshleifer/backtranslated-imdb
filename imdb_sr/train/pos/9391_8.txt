Dennis Hopper and JT Valsh steal the show here. Cage and Boile are ok, but what gives this neo-noir juice is Hopper's creepy, violent character and JT Valsh's sneakiness. he got out of it, but he crossed his head. I found a strange paralel on the starting scene of this film, when Cage enters the trailer in Wyoming to get a drilling job, with the help of his friend ... and the scene in Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same thing! But this is another story. Dennis Hopper is here the best he can ... flirtatious, one step ahead of the evil, hot and explosive violent. JT Valsh (RIP) is also excellent as a man with a dark past, trying to live legitimate (well, almost). There are only 4 real characters here, with the exception of a hard character. Worker in Red Rock, Vioming. The first craft appears early, and from there it is a beautiful neo-noir adventure in a dormant little town. Satisfactory. 8 pts.
