Who would have thought that "Helen Crump" by Andy Griffith (Aneta Corsaut) had a film by Steve McKueen in his past? But this is just one of a few strange and wonderful things about the ultimate movie about teenagers-battles of the 1950s, which could best describe itself as a rebel without a relationship with God that knows from the universe. The rebel is Steven McKueen (who will soon decide that "Steve" sounded less frustrated), a good boy with wild enough to be interesting; A very healthy but understandable girl is mentioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their date was disturbed by teenage hot rodents, but they are much more confused when they find themselves in the gelatinous, human diet, what's going to land on their hot meteor - and start swallowing citizens. right and left. But will adults believe them? Of course not, what they know, they're just kids! The film is a tiny bopper on its little best bop. The actors take very seriously the pretty pretentious scenario, with a lot of mental eyesight, and the "adult" supporting the actor probably says "Children!" very third sentence. But the real satisfaction of the film is its creature, well-conceived, well-executed, and often manages to produce a surprising degree of uncertainty. And although it's clear on the cheap side (see these miniature sets, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a pretty well-made movie - and there's a striking little theme for a good measure. A crowd of 40 people (including me) will enjoy the movie as a nostalgia, but it will not stop them from climbing the right along with a younger set of sensitivities from the 1950s, and the movie would be a great choice for evening movies or for sophisticated "adults only ". Make lots of Jello movies for movies! Гари Ф. Tailor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviever
