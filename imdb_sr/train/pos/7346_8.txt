When I first saw this animation (I was probably 15 years old) I was really impressed! It has a completely different style compared to Japanese animation and I like it more. The whole impression about the film is more evil and darker ... The colors are not so ... color. The characters do not speak much, there are no long and boring conversations about this and that (as in Ghost in Shell). With its dark images, the looks of strange beasts and the sense of magic, it looks like one of those ancient Scandinavian stories, full of violence and horrible creatures, vicious forests and deep caves, inhabited by dragons, trolls, orcs ... and a mysterious hero to stop evil ...
