Forget about Neo and Bourne and all those half-assembled, modern heroes. They look only 12 years to satisfy a wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Since they can not be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollivood has allowed a bunch of fake non-bearded teenagers, yet they fill up with teenagers, looking to see something that looks very similar to the action movie. "campaign kits" are just sick to watch, and every girl can challenge her masculin without questions. This explains the return of old ones to our silver screens over the past several years. For the better (Rockie, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, prepare ... he did not have a beard!) I say it's time for a new hero and ending his reign . This movie "Largo Vinch" is far from perfect, and sometimes too predictable, but at least Tomer Sisley delivered very promising performance as an action hero. And the only time he's weakened when Melanie Thierri shaved his chin! I reschedule my case. I did not know when I entered the hall, but this could be a movie I'm waiting for a decade. For the first time in France, Belmondo, the film can be well-created and rooted in the B-genre, without redundancy over its performances. In the meantime, all we had to do was either a gigantic bunch of manure or something too limited to reach a wider audience ... In other words, it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Doberman" (I like Doberman, watch it). .. I believe that "Largo Vinch" has what it takes to be a popular and quality movie. I walked out of the hall very pleased and hungry over.
