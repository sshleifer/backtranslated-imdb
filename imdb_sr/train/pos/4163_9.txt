I saw it as a child at the end of the eighties and I have to say that Galaki Ekpress is one of those movies that have long been in your imagination. If you have never understood the attractiveness of anime, discovering this movie can be your golden card for the city of Otaku. The story is delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The cell animation, though traditional, has a vibrant style that explains the great talent of Leiji Matsumoto for design and visual narrative. This is one of those unique children's movies like Star Vars, the Dark Cristal Wizard of Oz, which completely overcomes the status of "family fun" and presents the classic movie on its own terms. I recommend this film.
