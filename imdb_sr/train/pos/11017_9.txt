This film was better than the average action movie and in that sense they succeeded. This film had a spectacular cinema with spectacular mountain snow and heights, a very suitable Stallone which also had good performance, exciting story and great movie. An extract from your main villain because he will really shock you with his evil ways. The movie does not rank all the time due to the poor game on the screen. It's a story and a story of pay for this movie to make Stallone a special human personality, such as The Rambo or Rocka or Bond movie characters. They have chosen to personalize Stalone's character in what's fine, but given the style of action, the weak factor of excitement. Also, the dialogue was cheerful and reckless from time to time. Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting of the scene. Film makers should have been more careful how they fired and missed the shooting. the quality of shooting scenes during an airborne abduction early in the film. Instead, they decided to give up a lot of shooting sequences (ala "A-Team" series) as soon as villains rolled on This movie had a lot of potential. Crisper action sequences, better dialogue and more emotions / determination of Rambo / Rocki's Stallone style would bring this film to a higher level. I know it was not Stalone's fault. He thought the movie director wanted to dismantle Stalone's character and try to steal the film by taking credit for his direction that was not so great if not for his cameraman.
