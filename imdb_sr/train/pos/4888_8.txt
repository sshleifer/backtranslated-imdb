This is just broadcast on the BBC and I'm thrilled to see it. As the credits turned, the actors themselves were sure that I would run it. After only five minutes, I was completely immersed in this beautiful film. Yes, it was formula and predictable, but it somehow added to its charm. Flashback by the forties were beautifully placed and had a feeling equal to several productions. Real movie that feels good, interrupted with extraordinary music. When released, I'll buy it!
