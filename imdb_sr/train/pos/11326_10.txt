I watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply incredible! I was not interested in the anime series from the Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on the h-game, which is not sure whether it was done before or not, I did not play the game, but from what I heard follows is very good. I give this series of 10/10. She has a great story, interesting characters and some of the best animations I've ever seen. It also has excellent Japanese music in it! If you have not seen this series yet, check it. On some anime sites you can find episodes of subbeds, that is directly from Japan.
