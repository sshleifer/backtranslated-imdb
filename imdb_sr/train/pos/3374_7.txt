"Soilent Green" is one of the best and most exciting films of science fiction in the 1970s and still very convincing, even according to today's standards. Though defective and a bit out of date, the apocalyptic touch and ecological premise (typically at that time) still feel very disturbing and thoughtful. The quality of this film outperforms most of the modern SF flickers due to the powerful acting and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place for life, with overcrowding, unemployment, unhealthy climate and the total shortage of every vital food product. The only form of available food is synthetic and distributed by Soilent. Charlton Heston (in a great form) plays a policeman who investigates the murder of one of the most prominent leaders of the Soilent, encounters scandals and dark secrets ... The scenario is sometimes overly sentimental, and the climax does not come to the fore. as a great surprise, however, the atmosphere is very tense and creepy. The sequence of disorder is really tiring and easy one of the most incredible moments in the 70s movie theater. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there is a big (but too modest) support for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). This is science-fantastic in my book: the night and the inevitable phenomenon for humanity! There is no fan of spaceships with hairy monsters that attack our planet.
