I hate long French films, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and most horrible French movie of all of them. I saw him twice in the mid-70s, and then he disappeared. But I finally saw him again in 1999 and I fell in love again. What is most striking is that it feels fresh today, as it was 25 years ago. If you have not seen it, do not miss your chance!
