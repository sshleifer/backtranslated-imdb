Since the Kum's saga was a glimpse of the mafia of the executive group, this series is a complex story about the mafia from the point of view of a working man. If you have never watched this show, an extended dessert is awaiting you. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but this is never unnecessary and it is necessary to confront Tony Soprano, the gangster of the thinking man, with the reality of life in which he was born and, frankly, he would never have gone even knowing that many of his associates had finished. Tony Sopran can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, and then beat a man to death with a sniff in the rampage, and while he broke down and put off his body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch TV while eating peanuts remove the butter from the bowl, and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage as if they just finished Sunday afternoon watching NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, when giving them a chance to go out, thinks that she really prefers life with Tony and the perks who go along with it and look else way to his indiscretions regarding life itself. If you've followed the whole thing, you know how it ends. If not, believe me you never saw a TV show like this one.
