I just read the summary of the action and that's the worst I've ever read. It does not justify this incredible movie. For a good summary, read the list in "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a little kid. My sister and I could not wait every April when we could see him at T.V. It's one of those great classics that the whole family can watch. The romance is pure and dear. The story is interesting and the songs are great. They no longer make such films. Good acting, not over the top. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best, along with many other great actors.
