A film that dramatized the understandable hesitation of facing the inevitable arrival of World War II, when a Spanish Republican, who was soon stripped of power, (Charles Boier) infiltrated England seeking support for his cause trying to influence the wealthy owners of the mine not to sell coal to fascists in Spain. He disturbed the local population, was persuasively beaten in one scene, and later in the film faced with an angry bunch of miners who saw him as another threat to their awful life. In spite of socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film frankly turns into a dark and uncertain intrigue involving unbelieving compatriots played by Katina Pakinou and Peter Lorre, and is professionally filmed in a number of darkly lit scenes set in a grim James Vong Hove hotel, and thrives more than once to break through your skin.
