I had the pleasure of attending the screenings of the Pacific and Eddie last weekend at the International Film Festival in Santa Barbara. This film attracted my attention a bit earlier when I came across an article in the Jalouse magazine. It looked interesting at that time, but nothing too exciting. Anyway, I saw it on the festival program and I decided to look at it. All I can say is that I was left speechless when the loans began to turn. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing movies I've seen for a while. Photography, art direction, acting and special directing were flawless and flawless. In this film nothing is "written" to you and actually leads you to think. Something that the vast majority of today is doing the opposite. The dialogue has been carefully created and, although this script is not a testimony wall, the words of the characters are very intentional and meaningful. It's definitely one of those movies that deserve a second look and the more you see that the more things you notice. It's a very layered and intelligent movie. You're not sure when or where to play again, but you definitely have to see for the movie enthusiasts.
