I just watched Rolla and it was a pleasure. The performance of Tobi Malonea really stands out, I found myself actually worrying about what is happening with Matt during the whole movie, which is in itself a very fun, very good with a good mix of well-rounded characters, which is quite an achievement given that it is a short time. Also, there are a lot of good plants that will guess you all the way. Other characters to look out for are totally crazy Tina and secret Jesse. Perhaps it will not have a huge budget for a Hollywood blockbuster, but do not let it turn you away, you could do a lot worse than checking it, you will not regret it. Good fun. 7/10
