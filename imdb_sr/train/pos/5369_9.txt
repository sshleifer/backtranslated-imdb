In the near future, Arnold is playing Ben Richards, a wrongly convicted man forced to play 'The Running Man', a deadly TV game in which people have to move to try to escape the brutal death in the hands of 'stalkers'. Of course, people are expected to eventually die, and Arnold must prove that the system is wrong. I did not read Stephen King's book, but this is a great movie, regardless of Arnold's best. He does what works best in the role of an action man, delivering death with unforgettable liners. The classics were probably "He was a real pain in the neck" after he drowned a guy with a wire, and "He had to split!", Thinking about the place where he just tested a person vertically. Davson is perfectly irritating as a TV host, and all 'Stalkers' are conveniently campsites. The action is violent, but its action movie. That's the point. The movie is fast, and in 90 minutes it does not stop welcoming. With Star and Hutch, Paul Michael Glaser at the helm, and made after the success of The Terminator, earlier this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for Arnold, and very far downloaded . But today, anyone who watches a lot of television can see how the film is approaching reality. I would not be surprised if I turn on the TV in the 'near future' and I see some emission far from it. On this depressing note, however, I must recommend the 'Man Running'. for anyone who loves the 80s, Arnold, funny acts or violence or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
