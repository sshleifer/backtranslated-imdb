An upset male photographic magazine Adrien Vilde (well-played with Michael Callan's considerable intensity) has terrible nightmares in which he brutally kills his models. When lovely ladies begin to appear dead for real, Adrien cares that he could be a murderer. Writer / director William Bailey Hilman connects a stunning story at a constant pace, builds up a reasonable amount of tension, delivers a few terrible effects of the moments of wild misogynistic violence (a woman with a plastic bag of rubbish with a serpent placed over her head) as she is definitely stressed) refreshing the emphasis on beautifully drawn and appealing characters that are real in life, further emphasizing everything in a convincing everyday world, and highlighting things with a nice inscription of a delicious female nudity. The fine acting of a great actor is very important: Joanna Pettet as a sunny, charming love interest Mindi Jordache, James Staci as Adrien's father-in-law brother BJ, Seimour Cassel as Adrien's psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter gay assistant Louis, Pamela Henslei as a brave detective for the assassination of sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as the stubborn police chief, and Misty Rove as a sweet, sparkling model Bambi. Polished cinema R. Michaela Stringera makes impressive occasional use of panoramic breath-taking images. Jack Goga's malicious rattling result is also a trick. They appear in the cold essential parts of Robert Tessier as a rough bartender, Salli Kirkland as a dumb whore, Kathi Shover as a furious female wrestler B.J. who fights in the ring, and Frances Bai in one of his standard roles of an old woman. A solid and comfortable picture.
