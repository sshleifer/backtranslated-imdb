I had to give a movie 10 because it did what many movies were thrown on to the black audience WARNING. This film was without any cliché clichés, and also skipped gangsters, rapper and ugly tongue. Several relationships between doctors, African Americans and African-American romantic relationships were examined at a completely new and refreshing level. I was impressed with the films of a careful mix of light humor with some rather difficult and difficult topics. The movie will at the same time leave you happy and sad. I saw him at the Boston Film Festival. It was premiered in AMC Loevs Boston and I hope this film will be much larger. Black People (and EVERYONE else) would love a movie like this - that only the industry was smart enough to put them there! As a supplement - if your doctor, resident, medical student, premeditated student, married doctor, has a doctor, has a doctor in the family, or knows a great period of doctors - he would love this film as well. She displayed residency and practice in the right way that doctors, residents and students of medicine who watched the movie are highly appreciated. Dennis Cooper fully owns his home in internal medicine - so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and this is very obvious.
