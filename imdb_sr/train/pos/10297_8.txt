Well, not really. This movie is still fun. I went and saw the girl last night and had to use the routine "I think something might be in my eye." The film is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carrey is as wonderful as a reporter who gives him the power to change himself and the city in which he lives. In fact, all the characters are great. The film is not overly funny or skeptical, a good move to see with a woman. All in all 8/10 .... note * I'm not easy. That's all from BigV!
