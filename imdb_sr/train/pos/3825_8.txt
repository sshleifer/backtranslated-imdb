A young woman comes to her husband's hometown after she died in an accident. She barely settled down in this small town, but soon loses her little son in abduction and all her hopes ... This could lead to all kinds of following complications in a normal movie: find a new partner and finally be happy; or depressed enough to fight and finally kill ... Trying to kill himself, but not after a series of hard fighting, with God. She believes in God, only to discover that God forgives anyone, even the killer. Well, I need to be careful here about God, the movie does not mean anything against God. Interesting is the way the film deals with the question: not from a woman's point of view or from God's perspective (in this way, I suppose, there would be many lawns, clouds that fly with views). Instead, it's from the third-party eye, the film has allowed us to observe it and do not explain anything. The film would not be so interesting that there was only a woman. There is this man who is all around the woman and obviously in love with her, but in his own way. He's a funny guy, like a clown I should say, shamelessly hanging around our heroine. The combination of these two, a woman full of tension, crying and vomiting always, and a man who smiles and speaks stupid, ends in a good balance of emotions: nothing absurdly wrong or too tiring. I recommend.
