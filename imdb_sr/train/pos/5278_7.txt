What starts out as a generation conflict in this film ends with understanding, solemnity and grace. The film screams across Europe with a father and a little son who have run in cars over 3000 miles. Greeks force the style of life, belief and life skills to collide. There is really no clear winner. In the end, everything is accumulated as experience, experience of multiple layers of life. For those who are interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle appearance without being aggressive in terms of the agenda. It is a story about the young man's age, his repulsive and rebellious nature that turns openness to receiving more lifestyles.
