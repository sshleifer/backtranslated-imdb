Sopranos (now preparing for the end) is the very top of television and drama for adults. When The Sopranos hits the mark, it really hits the mark. Using great writing and great actors (most of them Goodfellas statistics), the series is alive to advance in a satisfactory, unpredictable and remarkable way. The head of the actor is James Gandolfini, who for all intense purposes is Tony Soprano and Edie Falco, who certainly holds his own. The series also boasts a large collection of regular movies in order to suppress the plot in any way (usually violence and rude language). Toni Sirico, Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are great secondary characters who make each episode more interesting. Seasonal accessories are also worthy of attention, including names such as Steve Buscemi (super!), Joe Pantoliano (excellent!), David Proval (good), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. Sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern mafia societies that, despite rare bad stories, succeeds to be a unique TV. Symbolism and simple stories, dreams and shots and many other things create intertwined stories and relationships that are resolved at the end of each season to create another perfect HBO package.
