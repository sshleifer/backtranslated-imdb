For me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Overcoming racism, struggling through life and proving to be not just a regular "cookie", Carl Brashear is an incredible character who plays Cuba in the best light, the best performance in his life. De Niro, who is a living legend, gives the movie NEXT. He hated his character in the film, but he gives so much good acting to this movie, an excellent performance. It's always a big plus for every movie. So, if you have not seen this movie, I recommend it to those who love courage, a size that requires inspiration. We Vote 9/10.
