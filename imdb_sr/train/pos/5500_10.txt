This documentary (now available for free on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone has to see this. Chavez was elected in 1998. Its platform was to repel a fantastic oil wealth with 20% of the middle class to 80% of the poor. He forbidden the fishing of foreign vessels in the waters of Venezuela. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the poor neighborhood to free sick people for free. He erased illiteracy and set up new free universities. But his 30% tax on profits from the oil company has led to problems with the Bush administration. In 2002, while Irish film directors Kim Bartlei and Donnach O'Brien talked with Chavez in the presidential palace about his social programs, a CIA striking was launched. As the cameras rotated, Chavez was caught and thrown out of the ground. On national television it was announced that he "resigned." But the poor Venezuela did not believe the media. They went to the palace in their millions and asked Chavez to return. Faced with such an enormous number, the army turned the leaders of the struck and the conspiracy escaped to the United States. Chavez was rescued by a military helicopter and returned to celebration.
