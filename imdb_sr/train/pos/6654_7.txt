The film took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and shows how he was a man. His relationship with Harry was something that Gandhi was upset about and mentioned him several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. It could have been better to act by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too complacent and seemed to be deliberately portrayed in negative light in some parts of the film. relationship of father and son. The rest is blurred and is used only to display the time frame and the general setting of the movie. All in all, a good movie if you keep in mind that this is not a complete picture.
