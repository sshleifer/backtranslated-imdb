It's hard to put your finger on this. Basically, I guess it's a comedy about an unused rich drunkard who falls in love with a (relatively) poor girl, who wants to marry at risk of being rejected by his family. It has funny moments. , romantic moments and touching moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes his authentic character exuberant, Liza Minelli is a convincing film like the one opposite of what draws him, but John Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's wonderful sarcastic butler. But great fun with an unforgettable soundtrack, and ran for nearly 3 months at our local fleapite.
