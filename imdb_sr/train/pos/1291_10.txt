This is a good movie. Something fun about watching money at super speed, especially from a child's point of view. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about one child's dreams and what the boy could do with $ 1 million. I do not like it, do not look. They make films for observers, not people who have nothing better to complain about in their lives.
