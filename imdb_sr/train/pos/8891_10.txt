I can agree with other comments that the film did not have a huge amount of history, but it was not a documentary! It was supposed to have fun, and I think that a good job was done in it. I agree with the black family. The scenes with them looked like they were not in place. As if it had been thrown at once, but later I understood the story and the connection between the families and found that it was pretty good. In the sixties of the last century, there were very large and important periods of the decade. I thought it was very fun and worth watching.
