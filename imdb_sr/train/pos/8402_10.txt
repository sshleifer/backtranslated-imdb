VAN is a simple teensploitation image made especially for a ride that makes you feel comfortable, providing many opportunities for laughter and crying with your friends. Danny Devito has a small, but plentiful role as the manager of the car wash and almost steals the shov! All traces are well performed, the characters are complex and the director quite competent for this type of image. The Crovn International Release.
