This film was very, very strange and very, very fun. All actors are quite real and very strange. The overall "appearance" of the film was different, also, a kind of dreamy and blemish, which only contributed to the cosmic, indecent, strange vibration of the whole thing. I mean, that's not what you would call "mainstream," but that's what I liked. Unlike anything I've ever seen. . . unpredictable, with weird rhythms and hits in the strangest places. Children are so heartless stupid (and a pimp) that you can not feel for them. In other words, this is far from the "holistic" versions of teenagers. All that makes me good for me.
