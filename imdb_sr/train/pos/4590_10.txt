Perhaps the film is not one of the best movies of Jackie Chan, but I think everyone will agree with me that the fight in one of the best fighting scenes has ever been made. There were also some unforgettable acrobatics, who were so impressive that they made this film a class action. This film has influenced many other action films and I think that today's action filmmakers should learn from this film (as if they were able to process this hunting scene, I think it is possible thanks to modern technologies). There were also some funny scenes that made this movie pleasant even when Jackie did not fight. I think we could put more combat scenes into this movie.
