I saw a movie description on TCM and I just let it work because I like Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was surprised to discover that the film really liked me and that it was quite remarkable. Of course, it is seriously dated, but as part of the time it's worth watching only for subtle humor in the insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now the only problem is finding it on DVD, so I can watch it more often. I was also quite excited about the performances of Smith and Ustin as the lead, and Karl Malden, Bob Nevhart and the performance of comedians Robert Morley and Cesar Romer.
