For you who are not familiar with the topic that Kusturica continues to explore in his films - the Western attack on traditional Serbian values ​​- it will not be possible to understand his narratives. This continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and an unheard of comedy as its vehicle, is the one Kusturica chose for a mandate. From his fantastic work and the Magnum Opus Underground, Kusturica's Black Cat Vhite Cat, Life is a Miracle, and recently Promise Me This, his slapstick, carnival style depicts the 'vesternization' of Balkan culture , his ambivalent arrival and attack on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise me this', the paradoxical world of the city (urban space) and the rural (traditional idiom) of space are opposed. The world of the city reflects the western attributes that have established the spatial and temporal environment; organized crime, sexual exploitation, ruptured sense of identity and a fierce neglect of traditional values ​​- expressed towards a young village. The end of the film further illustrates this concept while we observe a funeral and a wedding on a one-way earthy road. They are on rough collisions; appropriately, the wedding, which represents the line of life and the pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, it will just collide with the funeral grieving, illustrating the death of tradition in this context. Nevertheless, Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through her unique, stylistic singularity. With its unheard-of and brilliant style that serves as a means of displaying.
