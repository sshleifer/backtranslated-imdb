Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for IMDb equalize the low budget and are not good. Whatever the movie may need, more budgets are not part of it. Large sets and many special effects would turn it into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than that. Almost unknown Alekandra Staden is enchanting as a puzzling modesty, and this is crucial for this film. Her wise smile and familiar look are terrible, and you yourself find that the camera will not leave the face. It makes it feasible that the bad guy Nikolay, played by a little-known (at least in the US) Nikolai Coaster-Valdau, can take an unusual cerebral interest for her, something that Modesti can use. She is able to redirect her rape with just one push and spit out "stop wasting my time!" and then he broke through between his heavily armed but suddenly uncertain supporters. Creating such a scene can not happen accidentally. Probably the biggest problem I have with Staden who plays a thin rod is not quite convinced that she goes hand in hand with an athletic and muscular type like Coaster-Valdau and fights it. She is not just Pete Wilson, or actress Hilary Swank, who can convincingly hit. Coaster-Valdau, who allowed Staden to overtake him, seems to be just expanding with his little sister. Since this is not actually an action movie, this is not a big disadvantage. I just hope that it will do better if and when they continue.
