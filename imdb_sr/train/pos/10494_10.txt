A great look at a mature woman who will lose everything (even a pruner has a mortgage). The way in which this particular "business", the innocence and the true love that exists between people in a small town intertwines in this particular, is a perfect mix to give us a fresh, funny and entertaining comedy. I could not stop laughing with the very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore. I love European films, and with these films my opinion is getting stronger. A film that I also recommend with closed eyes, in this same genre, is Vaking Ned Devine. Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as I do. You'll love it.
