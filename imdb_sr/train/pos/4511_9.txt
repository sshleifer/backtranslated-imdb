I just picked up a DVD release of this movie while I was on vacation in Norway where it was published with English subtitles. The film is beautifully photographed and strongly influenced. The young man who played 'frits', the main character has a stunningly open face that with painful precision reflects the tragic events that unfold around him. He has mental health problems, and this occurs when a brutal director denies an attack on a boy and suggests that he is his own father. simply standing on the ground and repeating 'lies' while being brutally attacked by your colleagues is a scene you will not forget. Films that are just a weak side are pretty clich√© 'Flover Pover'. a teacher who uses every trick of 'friendly teacher' in the book. Besides, I'm sure this is a movie that you really enjoy.
