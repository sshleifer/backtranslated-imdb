It seemed that in 1933 it was a great year for satire (for example, "Duck Soup") and this fits well, although it is an obsession with a contract bridge. The tone is like a witty piece from The New Yorker, convenient, because the film starts with the page "Goings On About Tovn" of that magazine. The only thing is weird. Made a few years later, Villiam Povell and Mirna Loi would be perfect. However, after 1934 you would have no adultery in such a sophisticated way, young and beautiful Loretta Young in some scissors and slim clothes, or a group of prostitutes who listen to radio on the bridge. Even if you do not know anything about the bridge, you can still see a rare example of Hollywood satire.
