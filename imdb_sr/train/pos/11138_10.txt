Midnight Covboi is not for everyone. It's raw, painful, realistic, but very fun. Leading actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who are going to become Oscar winners, deliver incredible performances. Voight as Tekas Hustler, Joe Buck, who migrates from the small town of Tekas to New York to become a hustler. He does not apologize for his chosen profession, but it is not easy. Women from Nev Iork as a lady lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass, starring Silvia Miles nominated for the Oscars, are different from Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Salli Buck, played by the beautiful actress Ruth Vhite who died in 1969 from cancer. Locations in New York are great for watching, such as the relationship between Fatso who play Hoffman and Buck's characters, evolve into a moving man in a male friendship. Men are struggling to survive in New York by not playing by rules such as getting the right job. As the film unfolds, Buck's past is coming to the surface and devouring, but it's not clear. The film is not for children, but in comparison with today's movies and television programs, Midnight Covboi could be pitomy. I can not forget the young Brand Vaccaro and the fun you can not forget. It's also a movie movie, so do your hankies.
