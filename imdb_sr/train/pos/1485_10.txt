This film contains personalities that play so delicately in their parts, I love the finals, when no one knows what they will do in their life, but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right, that's for two, so that's what other people doing it there? The movie embraces you in new life, experience, you can dream with another person and reach those dreams. It also shows you life itself, as if it were. But it gives you the ability to choose what you want and what you really need. I hope this comment works for you. A movie that worked fine for me. I bought a movie alongside;) Watch out.
