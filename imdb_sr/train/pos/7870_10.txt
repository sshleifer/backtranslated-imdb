The film is a real idea of ​​how it became an insensitive and selfish upper society. It has many characters and each character represents a different category of person. No character is 100% good and moral as opposed to the hero of all the typical Indian films and no character is 100% bad, and everyone is just different. The film is a perfect mix of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time I liked a movie that triggered some social issues. I would recommend everyone to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist covering those Bollivood entertainment parties for the newspaper page, but this is a story about how she becomes a reporter for the newspaper. But that's not all, then it shows that she could not survive there and when she helped save innocent children, how brutally her voice was suppressed. Even she was fired from work. Then she could not find the job of a criminal reporter and must work again. Not only she but a very large number of characters intertwine in the film and everyone gives a different feeling while watching a movie. I would really congratulate the director on what made such a good movie. Please, do not miss it.
