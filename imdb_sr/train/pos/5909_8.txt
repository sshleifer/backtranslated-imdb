I remember when I was five years old and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon ... except when the females and bullets were flying. I have to agree that this film will make everyone and everyone upset because he is set to discriminate against everyone and everyone ... but the truth is that he is as hell as hell is deep. I recommend this to anyone who loves classical classics. Also try with Fritz cat and NINE Life Fritz Cat. If I'm right, Ralph Bashki also worked on this movie. This includes a cat that is going through difficult times with family, streets, jobs, etc. When I was old enough, I rented all those movies. Since Coonskin was an insulting name during that era, it was also labeled Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also made Cool World a very young Brad Pitt. Greater traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man.
