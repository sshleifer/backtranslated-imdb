Updated from previous comment. The great and underrated Marion Davies displays her comic thing in this quiet (1928) silent comedy that also shows the beautiful Villain Haines. Davis plays a bouncer from Georgia that breaks Hollivood with Haines, a few players in rough comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A big lampoon on Hollywood and her pretensions. Davies & Haines is a wonderful team, and guest appearances are Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Villiam S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glin, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murrai, Rod LaRockue, Leatrice Joi, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Tailor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies. Necessary for any serious movie lover or for anyone who is interested in still malignant Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is a slimmer man. It has been said that people have used Gloria Swanson's career as a model (I think Mae Murrai is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film is parallel with the rise of Swanson from comedy Mack Sennett with one reel with Charlie Chaplin in STAR in Cecil B. DeMille films of late teenagers and early 20s. stars and friends. It's strange that MGM never joined them in a conversation. They're great together! Sweet romance and the lovely whip of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned, but they do not appear.
