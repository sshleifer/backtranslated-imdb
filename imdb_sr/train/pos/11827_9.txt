If Dick Tracy was black and white, the pope would not be religious. Bringing a new meaning to the concept of color in the film, we are offered a unique experience through the comic world, and this is one of several films that have succeeded in this, thanks to a serious scenario, a good direction, excellent performance (Al Pacino is astounding) and most importantly powerful a combination of cinema, artistic regime and costume design. Using only primary colors, the experience is quite different from what we have seen before. And there's also a pretty successful hommage for all the gangster-movie genre, praticalli extinct from a modern film. All in all, I see this film as a new attempt and touch of originality in a movie that is increasingly relying on old and already seen formulas. 7 of 10
