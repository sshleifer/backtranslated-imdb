I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is a great role model for young people and needs to be appreciated more. This film deals with tracking your dreams and never gives up, no matter what people can do or say to discourage and criticize you. Holly fills her dreams like Britney. There are times in every man's life when people evaluate them for what they are not. Watching this movie will make you realize that you are special in your own way and that you have to follow your dreams no matter what happened. I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. He will never know how much it means to me. Bravo Britnei. You are the best!!!
