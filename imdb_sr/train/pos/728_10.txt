The Ramones, which I consider to be the founders of modern punk rock, are borrowing their then unrepeatable sounds to an incredibly involved film about an indecent fan-rock (PJ Soles) who faces ruthless director (Marie Voronov) for the right to Rock. With a soundtrack full of incredible music, RRHS is fascinating with the concept and performance. She is full of irregular cheeks (like an experiment with a mouse), a teen spirit (probably my favorite movie for the whole time), and bizarre moments in the wall (madness scenes). If you are looking for a movie that seems to have been made from pure entertainment at the molecular level, do not look for further. But if you are looking for a nice, dignified, dramatic epic, you might need to look a little further. "Hello everyone, I'm Riff Randell, and this is Rock & Roll High School.!"
