The last time I saw the movie I was about seven years old, so my thought might be blurred over time. At that time, I enjoyed shooting movies that were changing between cartoon and live action. Then I felt sad about the blue camel and his sad life. I also felt happy when, after Captain Contagious, he kidnapped a heroine (princess or shepherd toy) on the tables they were facing. Unfortunately, the producers have never decided to transfer this film to VHS, so I only have twenty years of memories. I'm sure that if I were to re-vide the video, I thought it sounded sarcastic, but at that time I really enjoyed the film.
