Now it should be a family movie! There are several movies in recent years that have been directed at families or children who are truly worthy of their audience; but this is one of them. My entire family moved away from the film, delighted, entertained, blinded, and happy. We are still quoting small anecdotes from it and there. Children loved us too (hubbie and I are 36 and 32). Apart from beautiful and striking animations, characters (as small as they can be and imaginative as they are) are very well developed. There are none of them that you can not sympathize with. The personalities that bring these little creatures into life are well-drained voice talents, combined with the skill and art of some Disney's best animators. This is a film worthy of Valt Disney. I think Mr Disney would approve of this new film from his heart ... Flick, Dot and their fellow heroic hero can become popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. This is a family leaving the theater looking to see again ... and buy it owns a video or DVD. I'm eager to see him again ... to pick up what I might have missed for the first time. (I've never seen my kids so fast and alive to identify and accept the signs before ... my daughter is still talking about a small "Dot.") Fun for the whole family!
