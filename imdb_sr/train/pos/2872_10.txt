In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (Lucille La Verne's voice) was really devilish. You will see a movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she worked a lot, Cinderella (the voice of Ilena Stanley) was a very nice lady. For me, the scene was wonderful, the actor was well-chosen, and the writing was powerful. Before I finish this, I would like to say that everyone who participated in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disease masterpiece to all of you who have not seen it. Have a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, go back to your friend and watch it.
