I really liked it. The premise was good, the story fitted where the both of the series were standing, and here's my favorite part. Mary and Valery are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a particular series and then refuse to talk about it, or they can make it possible for possible reunions. Actually, Valerie said she would be delighted to do another movie, and then Maria later said the same, so I would look for another ... but if that fails, then she can run this again.
