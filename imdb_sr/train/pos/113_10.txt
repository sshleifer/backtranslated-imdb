I have not seen this movie for 5 years, but it's still haunting me. When asked about my favorite movies, this is what I think I always mention first. There are certain films (works of art such as this film, "Dark Citi" and "Breaking the Vaves") that seem to touch the place in you, a place that is so protected and hidden, and yet so sensitive, that leaves a lifelong impression on the viewer , not unlike a life-changing event, such as the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This film "shook me" when I first saw it. I was left with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.
