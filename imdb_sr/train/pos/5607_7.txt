I once looked at the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. It uses many genres of the genre: a vicious apartment, suspicious neighbors, apparitions, mysteries, hallucinations. The life of the hero, Trelkovsky, seemed to be surrounded by evil, secret forces that tried to woo him. Last time I watched it, I challenged this initial interpretation. If this film is a horror movie, it's just a horror in the sense that Kafkin is a novel of horror. In fact, this film can be understood at a literal level as a lonely man who slowly becomes crazy without any external influence. as if the development of madness in heroin never convinced me; Rosemary's Babi, in which the heroines are crazy villains; and a tenant, perhaps the best paranoid study ever made in the cinema. Trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman has been killed. He becomes obsessed with her and slowly begins to become: wears his clothes, puts makeup, speaks like she. But was he possessed by the spirit, or did he just let his wild imagination get the best of him? It's a hesitation between what is real and imaginative, which Polanski never solves, making this film so fascinating. Many of the events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easy as they can be normal causes, and it is up to the viewer to decide what to believe. Although this is not my favorite Polanski film though, it is a good example of his ability to create uncertainty and show madness in very convincing conditions. Technically speaking, that's a miracle. Suffice it to say that he co-operates with film composer Philippe Sarde and legendary photographer Sven Nikvist (Bergman's DP) in the making of this film. Slow pacing and sometimes unintelligible segments can make this movie more difficult to enjoy, but this is nevertheless an experience.
