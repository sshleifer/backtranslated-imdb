Well, this is John Reitman's film. With a rare exception, Ivan likes to have fun. His films are generally not "deep", but they are often entertaining. My super-ex-girlfriend surprised me by laughing more than I thought. Uma Thurman is very big, and I love her portraits. And I love Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was straight. Never take it seriously, the film is at the top, and yet it's not very unique, nor is it going where no one has gone before .... it's still a nice rent and probably a movie with OK date, especially if you have a headache and do not want to strain the brain. It's an escapist party and there's nothing wrong with that. When you take things off with a "super-girl," there remains a story about relationships and bad relationships. It's a boy who meets a girl, a boy leaves a girlfriend. And finally, the characters are looking for love. Not all of them thought they were "thrown" as they could ... part of a life with a reversal.
