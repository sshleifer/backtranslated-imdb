I see many really negative posts from people who wrote in August, although the film was not released in the United States, at least until mid-September. Perhaps they are unfortunate emigrants living in South Korea who have seen it early. I'm in the US and I've seen him today. I thought the special effects were great, better than the trailer. The story was non-Western, but I think we all get used to it from many other films. It was not difficult to follow. The acting was poor, but others were pretty good. There was humor. I estimated him at 8, because I spent a good time watching him, what I was going for.
