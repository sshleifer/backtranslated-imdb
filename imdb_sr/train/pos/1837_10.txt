Simply excellent movie without a doubt. Great story and top performances, either Amitabh, Akshai, Shefali, Priianka, Boman or Rajpal. The Hindi movie industry is becoming shameless with Mallik and Co., this film is completely free and is therefore bound to fall into vulgarity dependent on our Indian society. But the message and the concept that this film carries is absolutely wonderful. Anu Malik (boring copy-cat) could be avoided, and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiia could be used as musicians. I think Vipul Shah should have given some gujarati touch especially in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician and thinks he's popstar, but it's not a movie where presence was needed - It only looks good with Govinda style. I felt some pretty serious music with a couple of good Ghazal or sad songs that made this film unforgettable.
