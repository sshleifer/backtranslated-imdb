I was just looking at this film by mistake. What a gem. This film, made in 1956, looks and feels like a film of the late seventies. And it's actually better, more restrained and more correct than, say, the Blue soldier. Ecological, anthropological subtonas are far ahead of their time. The underrated cinema is remarkable and terribly realistic. Much more than dancing with wolves, The Last Hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the field of killing bison in the late 1800s. Probably because they were the real killing fields in the movie. The film was filmed during legal forestry, directed bison, so that the animals you see are really killing, the bones are real. In conclusion, a highly underrated Western masterpiece, top-notch, acted, directed and recorded.
