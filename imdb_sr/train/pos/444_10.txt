This is a movie that England can do in a dream, which means it's a compliment. Due to the success of the very British comedy of manners that existed at the end or the beginning of the twentieth century, and in particular the adaptations of EM Forster's novel, this large production, such as "Trgovac-Ivori", was received in light of its publication in 1992. It was a remarkable year for actress Miranda Richardson, who appeared as wife Jeremy Irons who reveals that her husband had an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as an IRA terrorist who finally puts wigs and gets nasty money in CRIING GAME . Here, she plays a quiet, tranquil woman in Rose Arbuthnot, who with Josie Lavrence, who plays Lottie Wilkins, goes on a journey that is filled with self-heights. They are joined by an unbelievable couple of lady: one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker, resembling a very vampire Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of her hair), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plovright). This four will eventually mate into deep friends just because the story is so filled with spring and overwhelming, dreamy sweetness that is almost predetermined, but that's fine; It's a movie that wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to the American audience) fill the actors as husband's two main characters, and all in all, Mike Nevell with his film makes a living thing of almost magical elements filled with quiet moments and wonder.
