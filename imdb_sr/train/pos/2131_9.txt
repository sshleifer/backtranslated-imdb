This is a movie that improves every time I see it. There are so many tuned performance in this. Villiam Tracei, like Pepi, is a pleasure, brings a sharp comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, the only "villian" in the film, and his fat lovers are well used here. Frank Morgan, the divan as the owner of the title store, Mr. Matusek, and his famous way is well used here. I particularly liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Very convincing in every aspect of his role. The two titles are equally accomplished, and Margaret Sullivan does an extraordinary job of showing a somewhat desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman. This film belongs to Jimmy Stevart. The film is portrayed from its point of view, with an action that moves around it. Mr. Stevart is more than a task to carry a movie, with incredible performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stevart, when he's dismissed from work, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to withstand the shock, rage, fear and shame that causes such a traumatic event so perfectly. According to my estimation, James Stewart is, no doubt, the greatest film actor in the history of the media. Nobody else is caught on a movie that is able to fully convey what it feels to the audience. At the time he made this film, he still had a larger part of his career in front of himself, but he was completely master of his craft. This is one of the best films of Jimmy Stuart, and also one of the sweetest, most beautiful romantic comedies you will find. I highly recommend this film, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
