Charles Boier should be Spanish, and he came to London to buy coal in a "trusted agent", and the 1945 film starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Pakinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seimour and Vanda Hendrik. Boier is Luis Denard, and everyone is ready to stop him except Bekal. His papers were stolen, he was charged with murder, but decided to get coal for his people in order to fight the fascists. This movie has its good and not really good stuff. It's high for the atmosphere and for uncertainty, and it's very fun. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boier is passionate, Pakino is evil, Lorre is slim, Hendrik is appropriately pathetic, and Seimour is unusually beautiful. . Uh, no. Boier is excellent in his role even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not British. Two do not have chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat wrong. Her acting is not for snuff; She's better in other films. But she is a stunning woman who looks, and much can be forgiven. Pakinou is almost over the top and hatred. Dan Seimour almost steals the entire movie as a guest of a hotel that studies human nature. It's a great part and his performance is perfect, while some of the other actors are not that good. This was definitely a case of small parts, only small players. Seimour was not a small actor. It's definitely worth seeing even his faults.
