What a funny movie St. Ives. It reminds me of the type of film filmed during the 40's. A classic story, rounded up with characters and a complication that is not too dramatic or openly complicated. In fact, this is almost nothing. The story of Robert Levis Stevenson - here adapted for the screen - reads as Jane Austen for men. We got a story that has romance in your heart, but it also has a lot of fun: scenes of battle (type), escape from prison, wrong identities, fencing and the most ridiculous line I've heard for years: "Only in Scotland guests will be named by masked ball. "There is a lot of joy, difficulty, and it does not hurt a bit when St. Ives tries to fight and find a way to family and life that he barely knew. Actors are absolutely stellar with too rare video Jean Marc Barr is absolutely perfect in the title role. Ana Friel is a refreshing enthusiasm like the resourceful Flora and Miranda Richardson almost walked away with the movie as her wise and worldly, she was there and saw - all this aunt Susan. Richard Grant offers the comic relief of the highest order. It will not be the best movie ever seen by anyone, but its charms are inconceivable, and the whole movie is pretty wobbly by the energy that shoots from life.
