*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Full of unforgettable moments (such as a quote above, verified by Primus), Deliverans tells the story of four guys going to the wild forests for rafting and getting out of the big city on for some time only to discover that their party is soon taking over the bad side. This is not a Hollywood movie. There are practically no special effects, the setting is extremely realistic, and nothing is sugar or nice. City boys look like townspeople, and even the stubborn young guy, Luis, who Burt Reinolds has shown precisely, is obviously at the mercy of the wilderness on this path. This is the perfect example of "what if" movie. What if a few friends went to rafting in a forest area that none of them knew, and eventually desperately tried to avoid the trial and condemnation of murders that were forced to commit themselves to save their lives? > It is clear that there is a very powerful element of the film dealing with the social and class structure and the relationship (or lack) between rural and urban peoples. When four people get into the forest early in the movie, they obviously do not know how to communicate with people who live there, and talk to them as if they are not sure whether they will understand or be able to communicate. This communication block is most fully illustrated on the stage with the wells, in which they try to fill the car and the truck and instruct someone to drive downstream cars for them. While the Drew and apparently an inbred and probably mentally defective boy on the porch are duplicated with a guitar and a band (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis has difficulty buying gas, and Bobbi comments on genetic defects and how pathetic it all is. When the boy turned from the Tree, who offered him to handle his big jam session, Bobbi told him to give the kid a couple of dollars, knowing that none of them were unsure how to react. <br /> <br This is the kind of thing we see in Oslobodjenje that sets as much tension as you need to follow. This great scene in which there was a lot of fun (including the funniest "dance dance scene" while your brother, where are you?) He ended up with everyone accidentally unsure what to do with each other. These people are apples and oranges, and they live by completely different rules of life. The people that Louis, Bobbi, Drev and Ed met in the hills grew up separate from modern society and modern laws, and live according to the rules of nature, which do not involve killing. Confused by their unpleasant behavior, the four friends set off on the river, hoping that extreme curiosity would end and that the adventure would begin. When they are briefly separated from one another and Ed and Bobbie run on the hills along the river that quickly become embarrassing, the uncertainty about the way these people live - as established by the scene above - comes into play to create the most tension during the scene. I think it's a good sign of such a quality triloger that the tragic element of the film, that is, attacks and real killings take very little time on the screen, but some of the most remarkable parts of the film remain. There is no violent violence here, everything is there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a stunningly powerful effect. This move is about the violent conflict between two very different types of people and what can happen when they are inadvertently found in the war. Traveling through the rest of the river after the attack, which takes up most of the film, brings some spectacular effective tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat, without bombarding you with so much that it happens that you become stiff. It's surprisingly effective when we discover that Ed could have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff, and the tension in the film does not stop even when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river. , because they give the police an inexplicable explanation of what happened up there on the river and why the son-in-law of the deputy disappears. This is a very disturbing movie, which testifies to its success, because it is quite obvious that a movie like this is aimed at shaking people a little. Hunchbackers are a human (ie, Realnija) version of sub-human sequences seen in childhood but rather similar to films such as Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, none of which could be compared to a timeless movie like Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the forest, the natural element is so real and we are so familiar with men in such a subtle way that it's like we, as individuals from the audience, really are the fifth member of the team. It's not often that a movie can come about that way.
