I've never heard of this movie, I've seen it on a DVD. A great movie, a perfect example of a movie that every member acted to do. There is no sophisticated typical Hollywood movie with the same old actors. have withdrawn any appearances in this film. I returned memories of my military military experience in Vietnam. He focused on people who were sent to fight. And they were ordinary people, some simply were not excluded from military life, I remember a few in my experience - in a word, they can not adapt to military life - but I will never forget them - I should have stayed very recommend, then think about those who serve today in Afghanistan. Basic training is a trip, notice that they do not know that they are morning people and maybe they need "training sensitivity" HA! HA! HA!
