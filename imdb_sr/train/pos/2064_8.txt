Scarecrow was one of the funniest killers I've ever seen! Plus, most of the time he jumped, which was great! He also had an excellent voice, I think he was perfect for him. The stories were great. I like how the soul of children was transferred to ScareCrow who was cool! Plus he had the reason for all this killing I think after these people did with him ..... And I would be angry! ScareCrovs look was really good! his gaze gives that person "OMG!" when they see him! What was wonderful about being ridiculous! These people were stupid, who would stare so long! They should have looked and escaped into their lives ... although this would not make a difference!
