This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo starring Anne Christie, but all the other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were shot in the background because Garbo had something like that in Germany. Garbo allegedly favored her Anna Christie in this version in relation to the English version. It's a good story, and it's mandatory for Garbo fans.
