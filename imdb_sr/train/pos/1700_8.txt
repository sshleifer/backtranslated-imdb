I loved this movie. You have to respect the dwarfs dressed as tiny Martians. It is certain that the story was sometimes skinny, but you can not take away the way it was done. I used to watch this again and again when I had a children's movie, and besides, it has some of the biggest quotes ever. Blanzee's "Home on the Range" version is great. Very well done if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
