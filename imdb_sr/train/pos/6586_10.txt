Jeremi Brett is simply the best Holmes ever, who, of course, pulled out the big Basil Rathbone, and this is probably the best adaptation of the short story of Conon-Doile. Adaptation length includes some new plots that fit well into the surrounding drama and increase the hatred you feel towards Milverton. Excellent performances of all circles, especially from Robert Hardy, and Brett and Hardvick are completely rounded and comfortable in their roles make this wonderful piece of drama.
