AG was an excellent presentation of drama, uncertainty and a thriller that is so rare for American television. Sheriff Lucas gave visions to many viewers. We were trampling on Caleb as he tried to resist the attempts of Sheriff Lucas. We became troubled and scared when we learned of the unimaginable connection between these two characters. The manipulations that gave a reason to fear what Lucas would do next week were really surprised. This performance led to a "Gothic" nickname in the way that American entertainment so rarely tried, and even less dominated. The suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show is embarrassing the current overclocking of "reality" shows - which are so much less than watching pleasure. The call for a set of DVD boxes is well-designed. This show is a quality viewing for a real-world market that is hungry for quality viewing. A public who is tired of the overload of confusing reality in reality, this gem of true storytelling will come true. Bring to the DVD side set !!
