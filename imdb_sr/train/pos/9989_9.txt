I recently had the opportunity to see the projection of this film. I believe it will be at theaters in Canada some time around Mother's Day. If it's near the theater ... GO! It's not a funny movie for a good feeling - it's more in line with a movie that feels and thinks. little by little. At first, her attitudes and behaviors do not make much sense. As her story unfolds, she becomes someone you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. By the end of the film, I found her sympathetic - especially when she opened her heart to a young man in a cottage by the lake. Many of our experiences in this world. Her youngest son, John, is full of life and adventure guiding the viewer at the very edge of her seat - and on the kind of raw emotions that are so authentic and rare. It's fun to see Ellen Page starring in this movie. It's so different from the young woman she plays in Juno. This gives me even greater appreciation of her acting ability. If you loved her in Juno, you will be liked in a stone angel. Of course, there is Ellen Burnstin as Hagar. Probably there is no way to express the power of action as powerful as the actor's ability to forget every other character they have ever played. Never during this film I did not think of Ellen Burnstin - I always thought about Hagar. She grabbed me with her character - a hook, line and toners. Kari Skogland is able to capture a movie on this famous book by one of the most beloved authors in Canada. Brilliantly brings the screen and the strange and angelic parts of this complex woman, Hagar - a stone angel.
