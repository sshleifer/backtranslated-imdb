Without Kirsten Miller, this project does not have to be completed. However, with the wonderful beauty and talent Miss Miller would definitely recommend. It seemed that the other actors played only its strong performance. Wagner's sad attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but several of his scenes did not diminish the fun. Mainly my critique was focused on writing and drawing, a group of talented talent did a heroic job of saving what was to be a disaster. Miller's charismatic delivery and time were flawless and convincing. She plays this fine line between persistent and commanding, but never insulting, she is actually an engineer of the construction she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen, but unfortunately, I was lucky to rent it before it was lost.
