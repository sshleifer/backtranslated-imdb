Sandler is incredible again ... I already became Sandler fan. This film is the saddest story about Sandler. His expression is fantastic. I cried more over Click, but there are some similar points. Considering the value of the family before losing it and saying "I love you" are some of the most impressive truths in life ... It's hard, it's really ... and in fact there is a real owner of this success, Binder. I think that the other director could not give such emotions in such a way. Cheadle and Burrows are also incredible ... Cheadle is one of my favorites from Crash. Do not expect laughter or a positive atmosphere ... If you are ready to face the reality of life, do not miss this movie.
