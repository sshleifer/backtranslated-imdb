I think that Loretta Young is hard to understand, too concerned about her appearance and too many women in all the wrong ways. But in this lyrical romance by Frank Borzage, and although she plays a younger self-esteem, who faces too much mistreatment from mistress Spencer Traci, she is straightforward and honest and irresistible. It's a weird little movie, played mostly in a one-room cottage in Hooverville, an unusual up-front depression, but romantic and idealized. Tape, playing a stormy, stubborn, "ordinary guy" who would be a horrible chauvinist and more violent by today's standards, softens his heavy edge and almost makes him attractive. There is good support from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never came to her), and Jo Sverling's script is modest and efficient. But true heroes are Borzaga, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close-up and Ioung. You somehow want to slap her and tell her her character is smart, she's too good for this guy, but she's so dull and convincing, you're looking at how happy their story is to a satisfying conclusion.
