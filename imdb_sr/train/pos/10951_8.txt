Big S is not playing taboo or forcing the agenda, like Mencia or Chapelle (although I love them both). She states obviously in subtle, near-subconscious remarks. Her performance will not change the world, nor does it mean it. But, along with the funny Brian Posehn and the former boyfriend Paget Brevster Jai Johnston from the glory of Mr Shov, this is just a modest shov with an appetite for destruction! My first episode was completely destroyed by my side. Look, I love this woman and as her famous boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just delivers lines and allows the viewer to get started. The best type of comedy. The placement of anything and anyone, such as "Mari Poppins" in the second episode when she sings fake birds on a quick comment on society and college, existential nonsense. This is highly recommended, but only for those who still have funny bones (and have not lost it in their latest healing or sucking).
