Excellent movie. The whole picture was taken in Budapest, so I'm proud. My small problem was that the trains in the movie belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (MAV), and it is clear that they were used in a large train rather than in a local railway - according to a story raised by Chikatilo to its victims of the local railway station. Besides, the movie is great.
