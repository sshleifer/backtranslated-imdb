I did not expect a strong film experience of "Girlfight". It's Indie; low-budget, no big actors, Bruxelles director. I heard it was good, but not so good. Located in the contemporary, ethnic, working class of Brooklin, Karin Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the daily struggle of urban Latinos. Diana, the protagonist, anger scouts and throws her peers from high school, is in trouble with the school and her friends. She raised her from her single-minded father who seems to like her and her brother, but applies a strict, double standard based on sex on her children. The father's double measure illustrates the fact that brother Tini takes boxing lessons at a local gym, but Diani is banned similarly. At the gym assignment to meet Tina, Diana is enchanted with boxing. Tina does not like boxing, so he and Diana trades; gets money from Daddy and gives Diane a lesson in his place. This is actually a good movie, while Diana is growing up and teaches about herself through boxing, meeting a man, and dealing with some very serious issues. There is no giggle, "everything that can go right goes straight" resolution a la "Bend It Like Beckham". The reality and accompanying personal issues are too great for pat resolution, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a better and satisfying movie for him.
