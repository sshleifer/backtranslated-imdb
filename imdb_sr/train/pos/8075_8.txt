I decided not to believe what the famous film critics say. Although this film did not get the best comments, this film made my day. I thought. What a fake this world is. What do you do when the most beloved is deceiving you. It is said that no matter how often you feed the milk snake, it can never be loyal and bite when they give them a chance. Just like some people are such that they are never grateful. This film talks about how many selfish people can be and how they all finally think about themselves and work for themselves. The brother dies inadvertently in the hands of the gangster. The surviving brother decides to retaliate. Through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone. Amitabh has given his life. New actor Arian gave a good performance. The actress who acted on Amitabh's wife stole the show. Her role was small, but she showed her role so diligently that she was touched by her performance. Chavla had great facial expressions, but her role was very limited and she did not get the opportunity to fully express her. The brilliant film of Raja Kumar Santoshi. His films always give a message to the audience. His films are like the novel Nanak Singh (a novel by Punjabi whose novels have always had the purpose and targeted social evil) because they have the right message for the audience. They are fun as well as giving lessons.
