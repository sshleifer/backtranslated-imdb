I have not seen this movie for years, so my knowledge is a little rusty. I remember thinking that this movie was twice the Braveheart movie. It is simply more realistic and has more convincing characters. Ridb Roi looks like Rob Roi could look like messy hair and chin with simple clothes. Also, Liam Nesson has a Celtic look around him, looks like a Scott and more importantly looks like Rob Roi. It's a comparison that disturbs some people, but it compares it with Mel Gibson like Villiam Vallace. Gibson was allegedly playing a man who led the legend to being described as a giant jeep of 6 feet, while Gibson almost went shorter. The story contains a small romance, plot and story of loss. Sounds like Braveheart? But instead of a film that reads "freedom," freedom and nationalism, we get a film that shows honor, love and justice. This makes it more interesting. Like a Gladiator. The acting is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this venture. The story is excellent with the way it deals with heroism and humanity. The very scene in which Maria was raped and she leaves the burned house with the look of a real Scottish force, she follows her sperm washing in a groin in extreme panic. This is something that a heroine in the Brave Heart would never have done. All in all, this is a stunning and almost perfect clock. Go and see!
