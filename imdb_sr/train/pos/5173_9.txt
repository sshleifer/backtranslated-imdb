I rarely see a movie in which I am completely preoccupied; This was one of them. He had a good acting, dialogue, plot, and the landscape was wonderful. I laughed loudly many times, especially the scene that was attacking the kitchen. The slapstick comedy performed by the lunkhead hired hand had one on the floor, but I admit that I am a naive for slapstick. The story dealt with a group of people in the thirties who returned to the summer camp who attended 20 years earlier. It was a farewell week of camping because the site would be permanently closed at the end of the season. As adults, the camp looked different, and they felt different about him and each other. I recommend to everyone this ridiculous moving movie. <br /> <br />
