I saw this as a previous viewer accidentally, but I watched it twice. I fully enjoyed it without any stupid messages that just caused good fun, good songs, good characters and a movie that feels good. here. I did not know that Rosie Alvarez played Vanessa Villiams, she is great and very sparse. Songs like One Boi and One Last Kiss are really pleasing to listen to and tapping Jason Alekander's complete contrast to his character in Pretty Voman ans is very good. Tine Daley is still held in my head by Cagnei and Lacey, and her voice and accent still have that memory on him. All in all, I loved it and I'm going to buy it if it's available
