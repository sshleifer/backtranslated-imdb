CHANNELS are a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cibill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) was killed shortly after finding out she was pregnant. Then we see a husband in the sky letting power know that he has prematurely taken and that his wife needs him. He was told that he could return to the ground, but not like him. 19 years old, where we see Shepherd's daughter (Marie Stuart Masterson) who prepares to graduate from college and finds a young man (Robert Dovei Jr.) Who turns out to be the reincarnation of her father. The movie is a little on the foreseeable side ... the story goes to all the places you expect, but the acting actress (especially Shepherd and Dovnei) is so charmingly played that you can not help but wrap in Fun. Shepherd is rarely seen on the screen to have a better advantage, and she and Dovnei are supported by a talented group of visual actors in supporting roles. A wonderful and charming fantasy that will captivate and impress you.
