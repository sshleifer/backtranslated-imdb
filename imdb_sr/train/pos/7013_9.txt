With the fascinating performances of Villa Smith and the story dragging on to the heart harder than the rock soloists, "Seven Pounds" runs alongside the director's previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a movie I liked. Remember the name Gabriele Muccino because some of his films can go unnoticed if the actor who is attached to the project is not so high. Too bad I realized that Vill Smith's scheme was early, I put two and two when I called suicide in the first scene and scene when the figure Rosario Davson was portrayed as an incurable heart. Still, I still think that the writer The director made the right choice by putting bookends (bookends the first and last scene) in this way, that is the source of urgency and tension in the film, revealing gradually how a precisely man could lead to this ultimate victim, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith and Davson's character is blooming and evolving, they know and in the background of the mind, always what was ready for those unhappy two. One of my friends with whom I watched the film thought that Smith's character could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven chosen , but sometimes he could be rude and awesome, and when he himself had the full weight of his situation he got too much for him and he completely broke up. It's a fairly varied version. In the end, I can not forget to mention the re-enactment on the scene of the accident, which was really quite amazing in terms of cinema-like music. Put this on your list.
