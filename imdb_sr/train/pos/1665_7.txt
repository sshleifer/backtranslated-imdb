The film looked like a passage for an "immoral study". Most probably I have never really caught up in the burning need of a female artist to certify male acts, and thus all that rumor about "Now, who drew this penis?" It sounded a little free. The dialogues in this film are quite scary, although visually this movie has got its moments. I almost threw it when Tassi painted the mental picture, but then the film returned to the penises. It is recommended to those who have not seen it.
