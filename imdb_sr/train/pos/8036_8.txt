Some guys think that the sniper is not good because part of the action was not good enough. Well, if you consider him an action movie, this viewpoint can be quite true, because the action part of this movement is not really exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama, not an action. The film mainly talked about the interior of the two snipers who had definitely had different personality and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed murders, looked as if he was cold-blooded. However, after Becket showed his daily dream of Montana, we can clearly see his softness from inside. The cruel war and the sacrifice of his partners have made Beckett a so-called cold-blooded heart. sniper. Billy Zane showed Millard's hesitation and fear quite well when he first tried to "throw a bullet through the heart" (as Beckett said). What he thought about the current suicide mission was that it can be easily achieved, and then he can safely return and receive the prize. they successfully demonstrated the difference and the impact they had on each other because of the difference in their personality. These two snipers broke up, doubted each other and finally came to understanding through communication and what they did to help save even the other. psychologically.
