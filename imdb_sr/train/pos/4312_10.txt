If you did not see this great film about the life of the 90s (in L.A.) then you missed a special treat. This is one of the most incredible and most powerful films ever recorded about the lives of Americans in the nineties and it is even transmitted into today's world in which we live. It covers everything from raising a child, prejudice (more than one way), love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc. This story adds to the climax, and when nothing else matters, it always returns to love with friends and family and the love of life. It helps us to dig deep into ourselves and make us seek what we want from life. It makes us ask questions about ourselves. Have we done enough for others, are we this, etc.? Take a bite and enjoy a wonderful and emotional movie that I'm sure will enjoy the rest of your life. Take note of Mari McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Wonderful Danny Glover through the whole of this movie. These actors are incredible and truly show the real brightness and meaning that messages are sent to all of us. These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after watching this movie more than 10 years ago. I still enjoy it. Also enjoy the wonderful music with her and do not forget to count how many times have you seen a helicopter fly and try to understand that it is a symbolism for a movie? Hmmm ... I almost forgot that this is probably the first serious Steve Martin actor role in any movie that he ever worked on. He also works perfectly in this film. This can be a surprise for most of you. Relax, relax and enjoy a really good movie .....
