One said, regarding Nathaniel Havthorne, that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I believe that the same remark would correspond to McDonald-Eddie's paintings. Especially this one. It obviously possesses many features of a failed film: it's a kitsch, scenario, because of censorship, it sounds inconsistent? Still, this movie also gets some good side: good Rodgers-Hart's music ("I'm married to angel", "Tira tira tira la"), a good acting with E.E.Horton and Reginaldo Owen. In any case, if you do not like it, you can not forget it. This strange movie actually leaves a very powerful, dreamy impression, and it's very likely that you'll have it for days, maybe weeks. Why? In the thirties and early 40s, the films did not have the same meaning as today: they aimed, as a dream, to turn the public off to forget about the difficult reality. Of all the films about the dreams that were made, at that time, this is especially powerful. In short, let's say it's a better way to appreciate this movie, watch without thinking whether it's good or bad. To watch it, as if watching a dream.
