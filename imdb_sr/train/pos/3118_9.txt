I did not see the previous two in the trilogy of Bourne's films, I was a bit reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum. However, it was a very exciting experience and I did not have misunderstandings. what happened because they did not see the first two films. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it reached the interval! I do not think I've ever seen such a brilliantly made and catchy movie, especially an action movie. Since I'm usually afraid of movies in action and thriller, this was a great news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most exciting films, which attracts your attention from the first second to the last minute before you get a loan. Matt Damon was simply fantastic like Jason Bourne. I heard a lot about his great performances in Bourne 1 + 2, and now, this fantastic actor has one more to add to his list. I can not wait to see more of his films in the future. Stops were processed with style - each was made brilliantly and I was shocked by the impressiveness of this movie. Good work.
