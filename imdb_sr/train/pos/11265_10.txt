I never knew who Robert Wooll was before I saw this. But after I saw her, I realized what a ridiculous he was. This HBO special feature teaches american university students a film "American History", and the man was phenomenal. He enjoyed at almost every key historical event that happened not only in the United States, but also in some other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that made me question whether what I accept as an unmistakable truth is truly true. Much more exciting. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in history and is ready to question what his beliefs are.
