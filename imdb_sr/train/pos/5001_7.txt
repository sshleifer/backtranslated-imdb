Aardman does it again. With Picard, Aardman Animation proves again and again how to properly do the animation. I had great time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it was well translated for the American audience. My only concern is that most audiences will not get subtle humor in this show. Since I was a fan of the BBC version and short film, I knew what I was when I sat down to watch this. The animators did a great job by stacking previously recorded voices with the perfect animal. Look at the first episode of the Skin, which sounds stoned, and dogs on the street that are called "davg". Is this for everyone? Not a long shot. In fact, I would be happy to see the show for the full season. But as I said earlier, the audience will not get it.
