Paul (Jason Li) is insufficiently able to engage with a princess named A, named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her clothes and her daily schedule. At his party party, Paul becomes too drunk and ends up in a way with a dancer named Becki (Julia Stiles). "Nothing happened," they say, but the duo wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen phones. She is on her way to Paul's apartment. It is understandable that Paul pulled Beck from the city, although her pants were left. But it's even more fun in front of us. On a family dinner at the house of Karen's parents, Paul again hits Beckham, finding out that she is a cousin of Karen. Talk about some explanations! But, instead, Paul decides to turn into a stomach problem and hides in the bathroom. Will Karen ever find out that Becky spent the night with Paul? And what will be the consequences? I'm sorry about the critics who turn such films. It definitely needs to be cheerful, because this movie is fresh and fun. Of course, this does not mean that Lee is a perfect ridiculous man, Stiles is a charming beauty or that Blair is natural as a beautiful but anal fianc√©. The rest of the actors, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, are also pretty good. The appearance of the film is beautiful, as well as costumes and Californian settings. Best of all, the script is imaginative and inspired, creating a big laugh for the audience. In short, if you want to tickle ridiculous bones, take this film tonight. There may not be Oscar material, but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn bad day into a goddamn good one.
