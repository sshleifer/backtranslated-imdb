The female bleach (played by sexy Jennifer Thomas II) has a fun task to fill all the fantasies of all men who are sentenced to death before they get to know their creator. And how to get started. Fortunately, this film is not real, or we would have many more people in this world who are in a dead spot. It starts very slowly. Bad and bad acting, like most (B) movies. It's getting better moving. And it ends with a scratch. I would rate it very high on cheap, very sexy movies of the nineties. It must be seen when children are absent or in bed.
