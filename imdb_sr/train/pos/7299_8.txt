Rubbish dumped, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde eaten alive, the evil scientist has seriously nasty mustache, one man takes water from a trained attackers and comes out a winner, horrible special effects, solves the problem by blowing heads of the monsters ... Excellent. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic scene during one of the killings. Ha-ha. Good fun filled with predictable crafts and funny lines. I enjoyed this film, but before watching it, be sure to have a good laugh. I recommend this film to people who can not watch the movie, but do not take it so seriously. I can not, in their sane mind, to think that this film was made to the people seriously. However, if you can watch it and sit back and enjoy, I really think that you can enjoy this film the way it was supposed to enjoy. Very simple. Get popcorn and a couple of beers and have fun with your friends and this movie. It brought me joy in life.
