For all murder addicts, this movie was great! Every character that has ever been in the show appeared in the movie. This helped to resolve some (but not all) questions from the series. Unfortunately, if you really did not watch the series, most of the enjoyment would have been lost, as the film made it difficult for every season of the show. It would probably be appropriate as a series of finals, as opposed to being a separate film, but we must take what we can get. I hope to shoot more movies, and continue to show the killer signs of Law and Order.
