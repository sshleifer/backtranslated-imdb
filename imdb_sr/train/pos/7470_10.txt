I went to see Vanilla Ski with a huge, huge, huge !! .. Tom Cruise, my extreme cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what to say .. I was totally enthusiastic about the film and especially TC performance, I thought it was a very moving movie and that it was not what I expected at all. I read reviews and decided not to go and see him, so I'm glad I was. compelled to see it. The strange thing is that I can not tell why, all I can say is that I have fully incorporated it and that I can not stop thinking about it the next day. As for what I felt about the film, all I can say is NOT THE HIS STORY (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever), about people and events that shape their lives and how small events, such as entering the car, can change As for what critics have written, perhaps the original was a stunning second film for Alehandre Amenabar, but this was a completely different interpretation of the theme, and not a narcissistic remake for the good of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. I can not even think of writing a few banal sentences to describe the movie just to see it !!!! Yes, I know this is not a balanced but careful review, but what then. It's not such a movie.
