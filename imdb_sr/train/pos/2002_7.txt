To a certain extent, I really liked this movie better than the original VAMPIRE. I thought the film was quite misogynistic. As a woman and a fan of horror, I am accustomed to the fact that women are in danger a basic genre. But they just slam Sheril Lee around too much. In this film, Natasha Wagner is a fully realized character, and the main bad guy is a girl! Arli Jover (who played Sidekick Vampire in BLADE) is very extravagant and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... OK, yes, there's no great actor, but he works well. At least it does not start to sing. Catch it with a cable if you can. It's on Encore action this month.
