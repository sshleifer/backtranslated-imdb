COME ON!!! They did it deliberately! Two of my current faunas on TV (Meloni from "Oz" and "L and O-SVU" and Janel from "West Ving") connect to a nice little sleep / character studio. The plot is nothing but a fancy, but the acting is on the mark. Tim Busfield appeared on some neat bits. It's worth a look.
