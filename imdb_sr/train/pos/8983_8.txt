Shot in the car from the windshield, someone else plays his last song, someone else did not respond, according to the voice. I wonder how it came about. There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how the camera was. If the scenes were recorded where the Varhols went down to the post-party BJM to be true, then it was an inexplicable exploitation to the maximum, if not, then was it a complete fabrication, whether it was embarrassing if that was the goal? Even through this film, I wondered how the recording originated. Taking into account the value, a beautiful portrait of the (tortured) genius we all believe we are.
