Masters Men is one of those movies that become more entertaining over time. There is naive innocence and "kindness" towards the characters. It has become part of our "culture", and we are often quoted. It's my favorite movie in the last two years. My kids are 13 and 11 years old and all three of us love this movie. Excellent acting and comedy. We love Galaki Cook and Monti Pithon shifts. Okay, we're not talking about intellectual, just about family ties!
