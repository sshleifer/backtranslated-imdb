I did not expect much from this movie. I got a ticket for an advanced view. I just stopped working. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait 40 minutes in the movie line and there seemed to be no cold air flowing through the corridors of the theater complex. Once sitting in the theater, tired and frustrated, the film began, In the beginning I did not recognize any actor, but the stream of the movie was perfect. From the very beginning I was preoccupied with the film, becoming more and more excited with every minute. I think this film was destined to be a fantasy / fairy classic. The actors were fantastic, the pace was perfect, and the ending was magical.
