A famous conductor decides after a heart attack to return to the village in which he was born to live a peaceful life. There he comes to Dutch with a local church choir, who will change his life. I had no expectations when I first saw this movie for the first time yesterday; I like to watch foreign movies that are not English, and I have already seen several Swedish films in my life, but this one was the best ever. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this film is a gem, thanks to many things, of which one is an extraordinary acting. Michael Nikvist is perfect as an imaginary, almost shy and dedicated conductor Daniel Dareus. Beautiful Frida Hallgren enchants her beautiful smile and her fine game. Members of the choir are well-developed, interesting characters with their story. This film tells the story, a beautiful story, about music, love, pain, memories, death, devoted his life to man, and who tries to create a peaceful existence in the village in which he was born, trying to he reconcile himself with the past and the way his life was until then. Kai Pollack shows us that the Swedes are outstanding film makers. Go see With cat and chimelen, it's a movie that makes you think about life and love, and that is also consoling, in a way.
