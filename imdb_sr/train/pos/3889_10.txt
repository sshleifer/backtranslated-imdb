Eddie Izzard is no less than a comedy genius, and this is Eddie at its best. His material is extremely witty and hilarious, and his delivery is one of the best ever seen on the stage. Instead of offending the audience's intelligence, he relies on getting out the humor from his wardrobe shelter, Hitler, landing on the Moon and the British. With so many unforgettable laughter, you can not help but repeat some of his lines. Forever more, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in standup routines. Every fan of a top-level stand up comedy should see "Dress to Kill". By far the best British stand up comedian I've ever seen, Eddie Izzard fought for success on the live scene. However, his lack of commercial success in the film should not be indicative of how genuinely talented. "Dress for killing" is a treasure that happily found on the road to home video, and can and should be enjoyed again and again.
