It's not the same as other movies about dancing. A few normal people found themselves in dancing. Unlike dance films in Hollywood, characters in this movie are not hot or hot young people. They are someone you can see every day in your offices. They are some depressed in their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams of dance. It touches me very much.
