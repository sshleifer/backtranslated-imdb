Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Excellent ensemble throws, tight editing and wonderful direction. A film that does not splash in standard tricks. About this movie can not be said much, not to spoil it. The tag line says it all - 5 people. 1 Sure. No Brains. Villiam H Mac and Sam Rockvell lead an incredible role. George Clooney should be congratulated on what this gem produced. <br /> <br />
