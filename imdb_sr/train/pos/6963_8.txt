It's a great surprise, probably because I was expecting to suck. Reviews were pretty repulsive, although they all seemed to agree that the concept is golden: a man finds out that his new girlfriend is a super hero and that when he wants to break with it, he finds that kind of psicho. I was constantly expecting it to crumble, but it never was. Of course, this does not make as much of its enormous premise as it can, and chooses to be short when it would be better to expand the film universe. But I can not blame it. Uma Thurman is great as a bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And I discovered, after several years I do not like him, that Luke Wilson could be absolutely perfect when he was thrown into the club. He gave two best comedy performances in 2006 (the second in a rather unreleased idiocracy). I absolutely broke the expressions on his face when he and Turman had sex for the first time. It's one of the funniest sex scenes ever. My only real appeal is that they make the G-girl a bit too psychic, as almost unbelievable. Perhaps I accepted better with some background. Still, I can forgive his faults, because I really had a good time watching him. Underestimated, safe.
