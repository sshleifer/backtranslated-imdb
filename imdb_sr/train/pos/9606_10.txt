This was the best movie I ever saw about Bulimia. That exactly affected what Bulimia really is and that it's not always a skinny and a diet. It turned out that people with bulimia tend to think about things like their view of life, friends and themselves. The best line and part that really shows what the problem with Bulimia is when Beth says: "It's not about you!" That line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. It turned out that people with bulimia do not have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else. This applies only to them and to them. This shows that it's time to talk about a person with a problem, instead of paying attention to yourself. It turned out that Beth had to call attention at that moment and that her mom was most needed at that moment.
