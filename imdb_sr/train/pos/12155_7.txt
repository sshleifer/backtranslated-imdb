I watched it (and recorded) a few years back on local television and, after being depressed, I later deleted the tape; However, when MGM released as part of the "Midnite Movie" of Curtis Harrington / Shelley Vinters double DVD movies, I could not resist giving him a second look (since then he has come out of print). In fact, I got a DVD a few months ago, but only now, with Harrington's passage, I came to him; Fortunately, this time I was more receptive to the film and, in fact, now I consider it one of the satisfactory VHATEVER HEPPENED BABI JANE? (1962) imitation (with which, incidentally, it was shared by Screenwriter Henri Farrell). opening news; stylishly made (praises to Lucien Ballard and Eugene Lourie's scenography) and can boast of David Raksin's effective result. Shellei Vinters, Debbie Reinolds and Michael MacLiammoir provide great performance; This second is especially impressive as a trainer of a wider and miserable dictation (although he ultimately only proves the red Haringa!). Also featured are Dennis Veaver and Agnes Moorehead (her only kameya, indeed, because the evangelist she plays is mostly heard on the radio). (including the funny imitation of Mae Vest), but I did not bother them personally; the movie is a bit of a welcome welcome due to a constant pace and (perhaps unnecessarily) complicated complication. Reynolds - the music star itself - ideally acted as the owner of the dance school and, despite their rivalry, she and Vinters work well together. This second, in fact, gives a more balanced view of paranoia and madness than in the VHOEVER SLEV AUNTIE ROO? (1971); The narrative, therefore, comes to a series of irony turns that lead to the expected development of Grand Guignol type. Apparently, the film was reduced (originally it contained more ups and even suggestions of lesbianism!) Producer Martin Ransohoff - against Harrington's wishes - to get a PG grade ...
