In fact, this movie has a stupid moment, both in the head, in Joe Pesca and in the children's section, and it's much worse than other MJ movies like The Viz, Captain Eo and Ghosts. But as Michael Jackson's admirer for almost eleven years, (Yes, it's half my life, guys!), I can not complain too much about that. Just watching this beautiful guy and listening to his wonderful music is a trip to paradise for me. But, as a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid that it would get a much lower grade for me, that my dear Mike was not the one who acted in it. But since no one except Mike is a moon, he must get 7 out of 10 of me.
