This film is obscene, ridiculous, rude, sophisticated and hit bucks where 99% of Hollywood films do not even achieve their goal. Paul Bartel should be recognized as one of the great directors of this or any other era. He is American Renoir & Bunuel _ in combination !!! I'm glad to have a videodisc.
