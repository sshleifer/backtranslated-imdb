In 1954 Marlon Brando was a BIG actor after his performances in a tram called the wish and on the waterfront. Frank Sinatra has yet to re-invent on the silver screen. But Sinatra's portrait as formerly Nathan Detroit helped reestablish Sinatra with his fans. It's a great screen version of great games, and the choice of players and players for support is great. Imagine the film in which Brando sings? It was his only singing role while playing Ski Masters. In addition, the female heads, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (repeating her stage role as Nathana's long-time girlfriend Adelada) invest in top-class efforts. Special attention is paid to the great Stubbi Kaie (as beautiful), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, no one believes in Rockin 'The Boat even near Stubbi. Sheldon Leonard, who will be celebrated as a TV producer of such shows as The Danny Thomas Shov and The Dick Van Dike Shov, asks "Harri The Horse", BSPullei is great as a sharp and rough speech "Big Julie", even Regis Toomei offers its excellence as "Brother Arvide". It's one of the fun musicals to watch, good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brand. Soooooo "Luck Be A Ladi Tonight" and brother ... "It's your cube"
