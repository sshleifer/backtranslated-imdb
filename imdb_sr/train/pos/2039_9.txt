First, I want to point out that the people who criticized this film made some obvious mistakes. Everything that has a rating below 6/10 is obviously nonsense. Creep is an absolutely fantastic movie with incredible movie effects. Actors are very convincing, narrating provocatively thought and horror and graphic content extremely disturbing. In this film there is a lot of mystery. Many questions arise when the audience finds out the strange and strange creature that creates a habitat in the dark tunnels that used to ride the rat. How 'Craig' was created and what happened to him? Fantastic film with great cold factor. A movie with so many unanswered questions and a movie that should be appreciated along with others like 28 days later, a bunker, a dog soldier, and a death watch.
