This is an incredible movie with the whole reality in just six or seven colors. When it came out more than 15 years ago, it stunned the audience with its color scheme, which was so different from everything that was ever on the movie. These colors, at least for me, make this movie absolutely fascinating for watching. There are literally thousands of scenes that I could freeze and somehow turn them into a picture for studying for their artwork. Characters and stories do not match the size of the photos, but they are all on top, especially the villains. Famous actors who have played them here must have fun on the set "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles" etc. Meanwhile, Varren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are as good as Dick Tracei and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she is cute and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo, while the delicate youngster Dick and Tess take it under their wing. Colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Villiam Foristhe, Paul Sorvino, Mandi Patinkin, Madonna and other names you know, but are too numerous to be listed here. Check full points on the main page and you will be amazed. The only negatives that I found were Pacin's voice that throbs at you after a while, Madonna's voice song and the fact that the movie would have been better cropped about 10 minutes. These "flaws" are getting smaller, because it's actually a fun movie ... a strip cartoon that revives the incredibly colorful fashion ... like anything you've ever seen.
