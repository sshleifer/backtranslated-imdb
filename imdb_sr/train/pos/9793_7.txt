I'm giving this film 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles, and the unknown batak creates an interesting game "guess who." The film, however, needs more Robin in it. In the film he appeared at the beginning and sporadically through the rest. I always thought that the new animated series was a little fair for Robin's new character, let alone for Knightving. This film only continues this bad tradition. The film spends too much time on Bruce Vain and his romance that would not be so bad in a movie that the romance was not so amazing. It's still a good movie if you are a Batman fan and I would recommend that you watch it.
