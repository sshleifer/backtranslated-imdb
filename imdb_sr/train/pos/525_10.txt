Immediately after the end of the Second World War, Povell & Pressburger was asked to think of something that would try to cure the split between Great Britain and the United States. At that time, there were plenty of "Overpaid, over seked and over" types of comments. Somehow they came to this masterpiece. My favorite movie of all time. Has all. Romantics, poetry, emotions, religion, drama and very strange. I can never explain why, but hit all the real buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still surely in tears at many points. Was it a magnificent acting, beautiful sets, inspired scenario? Who knows. But * DO * watch and see what I mean.
