The problem with the 1985 version of this film is simple; Indiana Jones was as close as Alan Kuartermain (or at least Alan Kuartermain TIPE characters), that the director of '85 made a mistake plundering IJ films for dialogue and story too deep. What you got as a finished product was a messy mess of Alan Kuartermain's name, in an uneven walk of a cheap imitated sage IJ (with the touch of Austin Povers-escuire cheese here and there). Many critics called him "a great parody" or "unintentional comedy." It's unintentional. This film never intended to be witty; witty, yes, but not funny. Unfortunately, it's better than funny. With this new mini-series M4TV you get much more stories, the development of your lead character, solid portraits and fine, even fun blend. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deservedly so this version carries the right story, and not just action and Eye Candy. Although Eie Candi has an action, it also corrects the error made in the 1985 version, forgetting the IJ all along and returning to the original AK materials, making a fine, well-thought-out action, and a good complement to the sub-plot. Now this attempt is not all action-extravaganza that is Indiana Jones. Nor is it a bad attempt to be so. This vehicle is rounded and turned to character and represents a wonderful performance AK / KSM saga. Filmed at a location in South Africa, the audience gets beautiful aspects (if they are empty), Indigenous culture SA, and some nice images of wild animals to smoothly mingle with performances and story. Steve Boium completely surprised me with this, because I was never the one who agreed to his vision. In fact, I do not like most of his work as a director until this attempt. I hope this is more a new talent and less fortunate than it seems. This version has 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale of ... Fiend :.
