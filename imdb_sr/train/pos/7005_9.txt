When the DVD was released, I came to the market and bought it. And I think my money was on the right path as I expected before I bought it. A phenomenal film I can say about Villa Smith, He was a terrific actor as always, either in action or serious films. It always gives a record brake performance. I think this is a film after August Rush, which makes a person cry while he is watching. The way the director described the story was really awesome. His previous life and his new life in the movie was properly handled by the audience. Even I could not find any error in the story or the way it was being shot. I think his DVD should be a household, because it will really be a good thing for your collection. It's not a movie that needs pop-corns to enjoy, this is a movie that allows the audience to learn a lesson. Now, which is a lesson you can see while you are watching. And I advise those who are film critics, please take a look at this if you can find any criticism about this movie, then please talk to me.
