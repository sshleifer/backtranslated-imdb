I never saw it when I was a kid, so this is seen with fresh eyes. I've never heard of it and rent it for my five-year-old daughter. Plus, the idea of ​​singing and dancing Christopher Valken made me curious. Special fk are cheeses, and singing and dancing are central. But the story is great. My daughter was enchanted. I loved watching Voken in this role thinking about what his future brings. It's very fun to see him dance! And if the songs were not great, at least they were not Disney's sweet salad. The scene of the fence in the beginning was a little scary for her, and it was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end, but it was mostly benign. It is interesting that we recently read "Cat in Boots" and I wondered about the incredible story. But while he remained faithful to almost every aspect, Valken's act made him convincing. Great fun. I would look back with my daughter.
