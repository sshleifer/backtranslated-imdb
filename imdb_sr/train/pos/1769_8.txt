I just got out of a short preview for this movie. I laughed every 30 seconds. The ending was so funny that my tears rolled down my face and that led me to wish that I did not buy that big coke. It definitely has some lullabies, but, overall, it's very fun. The film allows Steve Carell to shine after stole spotlights from Jim Carrei in Bruce Almighty and Vill Ferrell's Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendi. Paul Rudd is hilarious as ever. I love what can be so ridiculous in these broad comedies and continues to work in an indie drama (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should get more work, because he is so gifted and attractive. Leslie Man also had some incredibly funny moments. I recommend it to those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you are easily offended, you do not see this movie. If you are an angry feminist, you do not see this movie. And, please, regardless of everything, even if you think that you are one of those "hip" parents, do not lead the children into this movie. Of course, you should let your teens see this movie, just do not look at them. It would be for some incredibly unpleasant moments.
