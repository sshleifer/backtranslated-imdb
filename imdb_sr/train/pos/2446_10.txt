From the very beginning of the show, Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of it?! The performance is not the same as before. It's much worse. Best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can not replace someone from the beginning! It's like South Park without Kile or Child's Play without Chucky! It's not okay! The niece who replaced her is just, uh! Terrible. It does not fit into the story at all. She was one of the main characters, and her nephew can not replace her. She was a great actress. Much better than a niece. Return it, or you will lose TON viewers.
