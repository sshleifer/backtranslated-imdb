I saw the Mysteries of Men getting a little sticky in the press and public (for example, vote imdb), but my general feeling is that the Mysteries Men are more fun than most films, definitely more humorous than most so-called. comedy films and almost "smart". Actors are great; Greg Kinnear is great, as are Geoffrei Rush and Tom Vaits. Kinnear's limo scene with Ricki Jai is a perfect 'spoiled movie star' and permeates her image with the real balance of the quality of comics and realism in order to make him work. I will admit that the pace is a bit in places, and the visuals are certainly very flashes, probably at the expense of further characterization, but after all, this is a highly conceptual filming - it's about the small moments "What's Up Tiger Lily? " - and there are so many big ones in this movie to repeat it.
