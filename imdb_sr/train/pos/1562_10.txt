Show favorite Green Arrow (introduced this season), Akuaman (introduced in season 5), Impulse (season 4) and Ciborg (season 5) all together, along with Clark, stop one of Lek's evil plans in this exciting game episode mid-season. With its sophisticated technology, Green Arrow learns that Lek Luthor is building laboratories around the world that hold people caused by the kryptonite meteoric substance and people with the ability to carry out tests.
