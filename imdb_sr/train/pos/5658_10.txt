This was one of the best shows ever made for TV. Full mystery and intrigue, plant. Compulsive vieving. I was fortunate to have seen it in the UK. They could have wrongly ordered an episode, I can not remember, but at least it was in regular time every week. My girlfriend and I climbed out of the trailer, and none of us are a big fan of American series. After the pilot, we knew it was something special. We missed a few episodes, and it made you sad and crazy for a week without these lol. brilliant casting, superb acting. Garry Cole was absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as Custer. Lucas Black turned into an incredible play for a child, and Paige Turco was at its best since Parti of Five. And Nick Searci, of course, as a sheriff's long-standing enemy. Yes, there were some confusing and confusing bits, which, I guess, would be explained later, and no doubt there would be a later series. . It made the end poor, and you could say that they killed him. They made us go to WHAT? Why did they do it with one of the best shows ever? Shoot the execution.
