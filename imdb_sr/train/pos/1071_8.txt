it definitely took a bit of work in Season 2. Like Virus between Mac and Logan, and Ames Wave together with his ancient, super-cult. However, during the second season, the only thing that kept me is to see whether Mak and Logan will ever get rid of the nasty virus that infected Mac. Very good drama in the second season. But, of course, like all TV shows, if something is wrong with him, the broadcast company takes them off the air. I was seriously hoping for the third and final season. The second season leaves you hanging, unless you read Mac Allan Collins's book, then you'll know what will happen. just to get all the original actors back. since the carrier Jessica Alba jumped after the show. If that were the case, then there should be a movie that will end it. just like Shov Firefly, who of course FOKS canceled.
