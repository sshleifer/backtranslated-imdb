Artimisia was late last night. At first I did not think I would like it, but when I did not feel I was asleep and nothing else was there, I continued to look and I felt intrigued by young Artimisia, virgin, pure and passionate. Her romance with the older Tassi caused her recognizable feelings. Although the film is based on a very romantic level, and not on reality, I loved it much more than the usual biographies or costume drama. Great game, great photos, great music and lyrics. I loved it and I want more! :-)
