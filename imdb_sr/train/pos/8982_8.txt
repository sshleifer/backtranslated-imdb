Damn it, it was a lot to take. I was pretty hypnotized. It was pretty perfect, although I would say that editing has had much to do with it. I can not believe that this guy stayed in good relations with many of them (especially Anton) to get all these footage without serious ... beef. Dundee was well-suited, middle class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad about the Jonestown, and especially because of Anton, which might not have been what many other people felt. Excellent film work and a large selection of subjects. I recommend this to every music or movie fan. You'll probably learn something about filming.
