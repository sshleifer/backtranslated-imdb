Last night I went to bed with the gf, and as she sang her teeth, I turned the channels until I came across this Chinese movie called the King of Masks. At first I thought it would be a Kung Fu movie, so I started to watch it, then immediately caught me and I had to finish it. The girl in the movie was an absolute adorble. She was such a great actress that she was so small. Maybe it was in Chinese, so the English name was difficult for me to say ... but it seems to be perfect in character. I felt so bad for the girl as she was constantly trying to satisfy her "boss", but it turned out rotten. lol. Even when he was brought to him by another grandson, only in order to transfer his art ... it turned out that the child was kidnapped, so he was arrested and had 5 days to live. lol ... whatever it touches in trying to be kind to your grandfather, just come back. In the end, he sees how much love is in her and teaches the art of masks ... which is so cordial after all the accidents in the movie. Definitely a gem, and completely original. Scott
