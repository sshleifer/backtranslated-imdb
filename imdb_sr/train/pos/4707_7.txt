"Johnny Dangerous" is a kind of comedy that laughs and "huh". But I suggest giving him a chance. I think it's greatly overrated. Not too many people give a chance to this movie. It works. Imagine it as a small parody of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And it works well. Johnny Dangerousli is a gangster who wants to go more in life. He just pierces from the big bosses to the beautiful woman. And of course, like many of the mafia movies, somebody wants him dead. 90% of jokes laugh. Like, I said, give him a chance. Just take your fangs of gangster movies and change the comedy. 7/10
