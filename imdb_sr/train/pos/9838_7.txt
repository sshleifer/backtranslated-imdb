Born Again is a good season episode 1. Reincarnation is, in my opinion, cool. The more I look, the more I like it, but it will never rise above 'Very Good' for me. Although not very memorable, I will always remember it as an episode of reincarnation. In any case, I will now say what is good and bad in this episode, Good: Oragami. Oh Ieah! The pond was fine. =] Eject from the window. Very stylish. k] Bad: Marry the wife of your best friend!? O_O <br /> <p> What a random choice for reincarnation. Why did a guy who died by scratching his scarf, tried to take off a scarf for him? > Conclusion: OK, the episode, not very memorable. 7/10
