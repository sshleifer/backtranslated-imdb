Other commentators have described in detail the action and social parables and comments (or better) that I could, but I would like to join my admiration for this little jewel of the film. It is very well held more than 50 years later in each category - scenario, acting, photography, stage design, sound design ... it's really classic. This was my first exposure to "young" Alec Guinness, and obviously from the first cadres what made him so special that he would eventually get chivalry. I only evaluate it as "8" because it is basically a fairly light parabola that studies human nature, but it's not true; and because the plot has come to an end in an easy way, rather than actually resolving a conflict between the inventor and factory workers and industrialists who are chasing him across the city. Likewise, a few minutes of reflection reveals the underlying problem in the logic of the scenario - wear and tear is hardly a decisive factor in the purchase of new clothes (especially clothing); children grow up, people change size, gain weight loss, and constantly go with the latest fashion, and have as long as weaving fabrics. And if nothing else, the manufacturer would have made a fortune to provide indestructible material for military uniforms (especially the BDU). Still, this is a great movie. If you have the opportunity to see it on a classic movie channel, you should.
