I think this is perhaps the most entertaining film I've ever seen. The script of Robert Harling is near perfect, just look at the quotes section; On another thought, just rent a DVD, because the delivery really does make the lines sing. Salli Field produces a comic, over-the-top performance you've never seen from her anywhere else, and Kevin Kline is incredibly funny. Robert Dovnei, Jr. is typically brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimi is a mess as a burdened buyer. I've never been a big fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she is brilliant here as one * real * person surrounded by stars of cartoon characters on the set "The Sun also sets" - the dullness you feel underneath is Hemingway rolling in the grave. Or it, or really laughs. Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
