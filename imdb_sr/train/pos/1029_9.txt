I would rate the series with the perfect 10 for the outstanding and consistently high quality of the story and character development that there was no last episode of the season 10! The last episode of the 10th season "Unending", where (it would surely seem to be) that the Asgards were killed in a very hurry, unconvincing and very unbridled fashion, left me in disbelief! From the extremely fast end of the series, it is obvious that many of the story about the arakas were originally planned to occur for at least another season. I guess they accelerated these stories to set up the SG-1 franchise for two upcoming direct moves! Unless Asgard returns to the future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of "apparent" extinction), I think fans were cheated with poor cleaning of loose ends! Bad ending otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.
