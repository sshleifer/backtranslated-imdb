This is a great Classic movie from the 40's and well produced. In this film, there are very dramatic scenes with John Garfield (Al Schmid), Force of Evil, (Lee Diamond), Last Rites ('88), who are fighting with the Japanese during World War II. and with only one machine gun. When Al Shmid was able to go home after being wounded by a terrible injury, his problems began with his family and an engaged friend. Dane Clark gave an extraordinary role as Lee Diamond, who did everything to help his friend Al come back to life. There is never a complete victory in the war and we must not forget all the bravely wounded soldiers in veterans' hospitals from all wars and our current Iraqi veterans!
