Presenting Lily Mars is a real, nice little movie that shows comedy actress Judi Garland, as well as her standard moments of singing. The action consists of Lily Mars, who joined producer John Thornwai for a big break. I think the comedy is light and nothing is too hard here. I really recommend this film to everyone. Judy takes a breath in this role!
