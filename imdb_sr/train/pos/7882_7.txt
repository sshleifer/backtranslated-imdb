"Ship Ahoi" is probably made to show MGM talent. The film is a fun trip to the ocean boat on the way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at a time when the country was involved in the Second World War. This was a typical study offer, which allowed the movie to be entertained as light entertainment as an obstacle in these difficult times in which the country lived. where she clearly shows us that she was a dancer with whom to count. Red Skeleton is also seen in the right part with not too many clowns, while he looks for the beautiful Mrs. Povell on a boat that brings them to Puerto Rico. Irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man. Virginia Gray is seen as a fun girl who is not deceived. There are good music numbers with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, which, among other things, is incredible Buddi Rich, has several solos with g. Dorsey and Mrs. Povell. Young Frank Sinatra appears as a singer of the band, supported by Pied Piper. This is a nostalgic trip that should be enjoyed by fans of this genre, which MGM has completely controlled.
