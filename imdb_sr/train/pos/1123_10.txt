I really enjoyed this, and even though he ended up angry, I still give him 10 out of 10. Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) ride to Florida, in their way They meet 2 boys (Turner, Davis), they really do not add anything to the plot, but at least they are somewhat cute. The girls agree to meet with boys in Florida to have fun, but they have problems with cars and they never fail. One of the girls decided to go to the nearby gas station for help, and the other three standing next to the car. Soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, because in the middle of nothing there is no choice but to go to the bushes. Soon she testifies that a man (March) suffocates a woman, in a girl's escape from the area, she does not come far, but she succeeds in losing. Her friends in the car are looking for her, and they go in the woods and encounter the same man, one of them sees a dead woman, a man responds by shooting at a girl, the other girl escapes, manages to return to the car where She was killed. In the end, the other two girls were found also because they broke into a gas station, they were arrested. This is when I started to be angry, those poor girls are afraid for their lives, and the police do not believe them from the regular school. They are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the lunatic to kill in the cell, the remaining friend manages to escape, but not without dangerous situations. This film has a nudity, a good actress, a psycho-smoking shower scene, graphic violence against women and a solid story. Some women will probably consider him offensive and sensitive to people who will not like the ending, but above all, this is a big little unknown movie.
