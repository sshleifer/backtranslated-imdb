I'm watching this movie over and over again and again. I have to watch it at least once a week. I'm from Africa and watching this movie has taught me some things I did not even know about Africa. Denzel's films are a full lesson for people who live in life. I wish he was my brother. I also saw and love your Masala Mississippi. What an exciting situation. When Denzel tried to connect his brother to work, he reminded me of my teenage years when my brother was always angry at me that I was always busy. My brother always took care of my old father and he wants to see me the same. By the way, where did Denzel get this African emphasis in the Cri Freedom movie? The first time I saw that movie in Africa and then I did not know that Denzel was an American until I moved here.
