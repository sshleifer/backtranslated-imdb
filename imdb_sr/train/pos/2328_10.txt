Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite films have flaws - Rear Window sometimes seems a bit stylish, Chris Elliot character in Groundhog Dai does not work, Best Iears of Our Lives music is too raw, the beginning of the night Cabiria is a bit too slow - but this film is perfect performed from beginning to end. The script is brilliant, the performance is remarkable everywhere (although Reese Vitherspoon and Sam Vaterston are incredible, full-length acting), directing and photography are inspired, and music is breathless. be intrusive (like some Miramak results that are too manipulative). Every sad moment is really moving, every light moment makes me smile. This is truly one of the best movies I've ever seen and I would love to have more such films. I'm glad that Reese Vitherspoon became famous after this film, but I'm sorry to see that her recent films are much more escapist and stupid than this serious movie about real people, real feelings and real problems . Brilliant! You must see.
