FINALLI !!!!!!!!!!! I waited for this film to be released for almost a year, and finally I saw it at the premiere in the SB. I met a few actors, who were very good and who were great in the film. I watched the trailer so many times that I did not know what to expect, but I was totally sucked. The film was really nice to watch it and the music was good. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Ryan Donov, and the dominant svain was good at it. other actors were also good. I hope it will soon appear on DVD. For the first time I entered Rihanna from watching OC, and then I saw him in a bunch of good Indians like Imaginary Heroes. He's great in this movie, and everything he does is indie. I like Dominicus, but I did not see it. I hope I'll see them soon!
