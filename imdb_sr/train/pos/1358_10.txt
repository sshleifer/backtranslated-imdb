Season season, players or characters in this show look like people you absolutely love to hate. Is this performance set to be it or are they chosen for the same? Each episode specifically condemns one person and ends with killing. You enjoy watching them fuck, although it's completely wrong and sick. You enjoy watching them screaming others, fucking, playing dirty, coming back, running away and finally kicking them out Trump. It seems that the amount of tears increases for the season. Prizes that try to compensate for humiliation and suffering from the past are also significantly reduced. In recent seasons, such as "You can meet Xik who will hold you a lecture on the Uv" .. as well as who is concerned? The characters are so hysterical, collectively and individually, to wonder if they are paid actors? The only reasonable one to win. Watch with caution and maintain conscience. These are your human beings on the line of fire.
