As a rule, the full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid the film. But because I enjoyed Jeffrey Comb in other films, I gave him a chance. Not bad. It's not great, but it's something else. The film includes a fight with a mysterious (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character. Dr. Mordred also has to deal with people and authorities in the world, who is working successfully. Possible spoilers follow. Dr. Mordred can travel between "dimensions", and it makes him find the escort who keeps the fortress; however, the guard is blinded. His eyes were destroyed by his pits. So the sorcerer hands his hands over the eyes of others, and hey, the throne! His eyes were restored! This type of healing obviously works only with the eyes. Later, Mordred and his "brother" animated several animal skeletons in the museum to fight. Guess who wins. However, the side of it, the picture is not at all bad, although it is similar to the comic book. "Human" Adventures Dr. Mordreda is fine, and Combs plays the role convincingly. I saw much worse.
