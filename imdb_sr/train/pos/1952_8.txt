I had to watch the movie "On Thin Ice" on television in India. I must say that the film was really well made, and it really sent me an icy spine. go on while others stay dependent ... But I felt Diane Keaton was in her best ... scene in which she has a desire, and she begins to search her home for cocaine ... he was the best ... two boys are good, and Linda Boid has also shown what a good actress she is ... The scenario is well made as well as cinema and direction .. and casting You need to watch a movie .. . for everybody
