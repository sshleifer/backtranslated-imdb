So we compromised. This was a rather charming film, I liked the art direction (he felt a lot more "realistic" than most movies for children), and the costumes were not too sweet. Children's actors were not bad for watching (adult appearances were moving towards cheesy). It was great that they showed that the maltreated kid harassed others, as well as the children who stood before abuse. film to take him. And since "Barniard" obviously attended 100+ children at the same time, I'm really glad that we have chosen a poorly-watched "worm" show instead.
