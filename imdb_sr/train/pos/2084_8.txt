My main problem with the movie is that it takes place too long. Second then, it's pretty good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is preparing to marry through an arranged marriage. Luise Rainer is a servant who marries a Muni. They live with Muni's father on the farm and they work pretty badly. When he finally gets some money to buy more land, drought hits and nothing grows. All the stars to the north towards Munia remain at the beginning. When they leave and arrive in the city they feel that it is not their job and that they are worse than before. They even think of selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money, but they oppose it. When a group of people begins to plunder the city, the army appears and starts executing people. Paul Muni works well and Luise Rainer won the second Oscar for this film.
