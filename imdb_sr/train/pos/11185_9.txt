Since this is one of the most popular novels, I was very excited to see that move. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are several things I could choose, but I think the film has remained a loyal book and it was a really good movie. Stephen King's films seem to get a bad review, but this is one of the good ones. It's such a dark story, which I think I like ... and what's better than the dead who are alive ... and something about the animals that come back from the grave is also creepy. If you have seen a movie, do yourself a great service and now read the book! It's a well-written game on the screen, the actors could do a better job (I say only for Rachel, and Ellie .. she was so skinny) I all liked a lot ... and the most important for me .. the truth with the novel.
