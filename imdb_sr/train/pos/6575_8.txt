'Hands and Man' is one of Shavin's most entertaining games if he handles it properly, and this production has a good enough job. Helena Bonham-Carter, the film movie star, is Raina, the daughter of a military family, who has a brave peacock (Patrick Riecart), and hiding soldiers from the enemy (Pip Torrens) during an attack on the city. Full of color and energy, this production breaks down at a good pace, and if Bonham-Carter and Patsi Kensit as a maid are little more than other actors, they still hold their ground. Kike Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are thrilled, and the whole performance is mostly happy. Highly recommended.
