Branagh and Fishburne provide great performance in this version of Shakespeare's classic. Branag plays Iago better than I saw the character who played on the movie or on the scene. Some would say that this film is too lago-centric, but I disagree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in ironic film history, delivers strong performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as a Moor in Venice can be one of his best. The only problem I have with this movie is simply taking away a number of important scenes. Desdemon's character is given far less depth than it is in the show. In this film, it might not even be added at all. One of the worst cuts Branag made in this film was to confiscate the conversations between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the show shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child she has shown in this film. There was a large number of seizures that damaged the integrity of this film. However, if you have not read the play, or have previously seen the movie version of Othella, I recommend this film. The story, carved or not, is still incredibly enchanting. The acting, as mentioned earlier, is very good. If some important scenes were added, and Desdemon's character got priority a bit further, this would be a great movie. At the present time, it's still a wonderful version of the original. I give her a marginal recommendation.
