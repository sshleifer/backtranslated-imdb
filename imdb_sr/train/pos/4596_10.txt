This is the best movie, Jake Chan, and my personal favorite. After the disappointing US made by The Protector, directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie accepted the concept and put it in Hong Kong. This is probably the most violent film about Jackie, with an audience that is rocking on a broken bone strike. The bones were broken and the blood was shedding in the process of making this film, as you will see in the text. The script is a simple story about cops and robbers, nothing special, after everything that's written about the process. I have to say that the English version has some dodgy, but it should not overwhelm you too much. So, turn guys, crack beer and enjoy. By the way, the movie got the nickname 'Glass Story'. Why? I'll let you know for yourself !!
