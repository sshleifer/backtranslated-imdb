I remember seeing this movie many years ago, I think BBC2. I would very much like to see him again - does anyone know how I can get a copy? As far as I remember, it was a particularly powerful movie, and in particular, the scenes of horses wearing gas masks are highlighted. Besides, I really can not think too much about this story - that's why I want to look at it again! I found a network, but I'm not able to find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - there may not be a DVD or VHS of this movie on the market. I would be glad for any help. We thank you for help in advance. Best regards, Albani234@googlemail.com
