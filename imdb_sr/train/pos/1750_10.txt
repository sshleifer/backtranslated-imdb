Let me just say something about these actors, they were really a good decision, and from the experience that the actors really bring a dialogue into life. If you're late for these fifteen minutes, you'll be in shock, the movie will start already. You do not want to miss the first few jokes, assuming you have not missed jokes. Vov! I've never seen a movie that ended up with such an ending. To not be sharp, I think I liked it, but it surprised me that it really continued until it stopped! But I am in front of me, let's start from the very beginning, when it started. The sketch goes like this, there is this man, and no sender is given, (* Spoiler Alert !! *) (he had no sex ever!) They use this action to start the story, and there are (deliberately or not, it could go in both directions) some funny situations that the main characters, some that contain irony, jokes, and inconvenient situations, know. The director uses technology advances in combining a recorded movie on a set and scripted dialogue, some music and jokes to make a funny movie, designed as a comedy, leading us on a journey from opening to the end of a complete movie I walked in in this film, expecting to see a comedy comedy about what I already knew about it, and I left the feeling that I just left the theater that just played a funny comedy.
