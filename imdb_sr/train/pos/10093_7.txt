The beautiful London store took away the owner of a millionaire tea plantation and soon got married and lived with him in his villa in the British Ceylon. Although based on Robert Standish's book, this initial setting is very similar to Hitchock's "Rebecca", with the main lady Elizabeth Tailor, who confronts the imposing Chief of Staff in the castle and (almost immediately) her own husband, who is still under his baton the deceased, but the dominant father. Taylor, the last-minute substitute for the sick Vivien Leigh, looks creamy in her high fashion dressing room, and her performance is pretty strong; However, when husband Peter Finch starts drinking and barking and ordering her, one may think that her commitment is more masochistic for him (this feeling also makes it difficult to finish). Still, the movie offers a lot of love for soap lovers: a romantic drama, a little travelogue, an interpretive dance, an elephant stamped, and the perfect weather for cholera! *** from the ****
