This was one of those wonderful rare moments in T.V. which I wanted to capture forever on VHS. Will they never air again? It was so creative and I remember being broadcast once a week, and waiting for the next episode was troublesome. I want to see everything again. I want to buy it. I want what I can not have. Not even EBAI. So, sufficiently ranked, it was, by far, one of the best series of 80's. It should be considered a classic, but it is lost in space. This at least mentions this site and Wikipedia. Rooms. It was totally attractive, fun, flattering and original. Perhaps not as the original Sherlock Holmes, I actually think Quintin is much more attractive and has a greater chances with his main lady than Holmes ever could.
