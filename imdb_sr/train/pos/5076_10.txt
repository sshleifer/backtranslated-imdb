It's been almost five years since the release of this elegant action flick. I've been watching this movie almost 10 times and it's a great effort by Gauthama. From my perspective, I find this film almost flawless. Suria as ACP Anbuchelvan - no doubt .. class.Jiothika played her role Maia very well. Her face is very good. The character that attracted the attention of movie viewers was Pandia. Jeevan deservedly received the award for the best villain in ITFA 2004. Good support by actors Daniel Balaji, Devadharshin and others. Harris Jeyaraj are all buster charts while BGM is good for the movie. Cinema RD Rajasekhara is rich. Peter Hein choreographed the acrobatics well. Anthony edited precisely. action and romance. Even some Hollywood movie can not compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... undoubtedly.
