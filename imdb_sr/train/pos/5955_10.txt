As the creator of "this darkness," I admit that we have neglected 3 very important awards in our end-credits. Failures were noticeable events that could not be corrected when committed, nor did they include the parties who watched the movie at the time. On behalf of the great actor and film team, I apologize to them. Obviously, some of the criticisms published here are sharp in light of their credit chance. Our production values ​​were negligible, and our "special effects" were quite special, but the plot is very strong and John McLeod's cinema is great. We hope that you, the reader, will enjoy the "this darkness" and the efforts of those who worked their ass for free. Thank you, Dilan O'Leary, Director.
