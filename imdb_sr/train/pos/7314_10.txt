The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what attracted my attention. I expected it to happen, but instead I had to watch a very intelligent murderous mess with my head on a disturbing sound record (that's actually my bell at this moment: P). The fact that I could not predict when it would kill and when it disappeared was a big plus in my book. Predictable horror films bored me. I know that the story had some disagreements, but if you are like me, you will not notice them until the film is over and you lie in bed because of the fact that you have just witnessed the masterpiece of the movement. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my favorite theater scores, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie left intact in his remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very extensive article about him and now that I know that Mr. Zombie is giving John Carpenter, I hope he will take over this classic. This movie is great for every time you have a craving for hooks, but it's the perfect addition, opener, finale, call it for the All Hallows' Eve movie marathon. :)
