I once again searched the Disc Disc and picked up this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the movies I find in a container are pure shit (I mean horribly beyond belief), but half the time it turns out to be surprisingly good. This film is much better than I expected. I was very attractive, although obviously made by an amateur. The direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good excitement. I expected it to be more comedy, but I was not too disappointed. For the thriller, this film is surprisingly benign. No bloody violence, no curses, no nudity, no sex. Usually these films require all four elements. The PG score is earned - not as "Sixteen Candles" where "f" is used twice, and there is a short free scene. Interest in love could have been developed. The film tends to be difficult, and potentially good subgroups are pushed aside. Instead of developing chemistry between the two of them, in the end, we look at the unmerciful threefold montage of their romantic endeavors. In the end they are kissing in the end, but there is so little chemistry that it seems compulsive. "The machine of dreams" is not a jewel, but it is a good, pure game. It's pretty unforgettable - especially when it comes to unknowns, other than Haima - but it's much better than you would expect.
