This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is great! It's not an idealistic film, I'd say it shows the life it's like or it was in the 60's and the 70's the main story takes place. The characters are very nice, but they also have some "dark" sides, which makes you believe they are real people. A great movie with great actors who show that life is not funny all the time, but that you can find happiness with "fire and passion," as the main character Gigi would say.
