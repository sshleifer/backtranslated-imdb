I enjoyed the movie. It will surely leave the audience that he wants to know more, but it's really a lot more historic to know! Did the production team fall into the temptation of over dramatization, especially when it comes to shooting? Is there a tone of interesting precise material that is indicated? Prince Albert's contribution to Great Britain and the Monarchy guaranteed the film on his own, but it was approved that it was obviously not part of the intention. (who, judging by the length of the title in the end, was certainly not cheap) was looking for a specialist for the British Court's historical label that was above the Duchess of York. Did Princess Victoria really fill the whole truffle (?) In her mouth while talking to the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with his full mouth? "I could never feel sympathy for Victoria in this movie, or even in her shoes." Still, he loved casting directors, whose action was convincing, so did the script really allowed us to really get to know them? I have always felt like a completely separate, uninformed external observer, much more than with "Mrs. Brown" or even "the Queen". Still, to be honest, I still could not take my eyes off the screen, except for some of the techniques of avant-garde cameras that occasionally interrupted.
