The film was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the script (Ulee's Gold). Nice and easy writing, which was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, watching Ruby into everyday life. What we see is a part of the life of young woman Ruby. Ashlei Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit award for the best female role in this role. Ruby starts living alone and establishes her identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boys, sex, a typical search for young people. The film won the jury award at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast, I chose the film for Sundance. I appreciate this kind of film because it does not carry Hollywood luggage. Although the stories are completely different, that reminds me of the Nobody's fool, watching Paul Nevman. A later film is part of everyday life of an ordinary man. I like that. The story is very well told, and all we had to do was sit down and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure about is the title. I'm sure there are not many mistakes and flights in paradise as is the case in Florida. Since I'm allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a paradise, I think everywhere I think about Florida. I turn into a red ulcer. I recommend this film! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking on the beach of Panama, Florida. Moreover, the sand is very white. I was there. Favorite quotes: "Necessity was always a good excuse." "All this confusion about finding a man is not different now, who will be when and why." <br /> <br />
