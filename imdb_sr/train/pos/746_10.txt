When I reach the "back side" of 35, I find myself shaking more and more with the sexually abusive, today under the influence of drugs. It was great to remind myself that it was crazy for me in my day, as it is today for teenagers. This film moves this spot home to the core. If you are a fan of the late 70's, you will like the movie. From the KISS poster to the Angel Concert, this film is a stone! Beware of the young Laurent Dern. Why did not they have more songs from Runaways I would never know? I had a problem with the image of Randy Kuaid who deflovering a 16-year-old girl. While absent, she and her friends have a party that destroys the house. They came to the cops and everything, but not all the juvenile drinks are mentioned and how these children got to these things. The foxes belong there with Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused, and Kids as one of the oldest teenagers. I say to buy it and watch with your children and talk about it.
