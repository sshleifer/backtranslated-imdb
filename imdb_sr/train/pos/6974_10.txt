I recently looked at Caprico again and thought I could come and write a review! This was the first time I saw it immediately after I saw the finale of the Battlestar Galactica series (Being a big fan of fans in the show left me to stick with everything I could from the space program) so I did not know what to expect ... but I came out with smile though I have to admit ... The story begins dramatically on the planet caprica and we met with various interesting characters ... I will not give too much but there is a dramatic event that dictates a stream of stories, but I suggest you watch this . Must say ... Esai Morales is a hellish actor who pulled out young Joseph Adam. .. (Father of the Admiral in Battlestar Galactica) I found his acting place and I could believe that he is the father of Villiama Adame of the BSG ... And Eric Stoltz exactly fits his role. ..! It was particularly nice to see Polly Valker outside Rome! Do not sit and watch Caprico with the expectation of being like Battlestar Galactica because the story is pretty impartial and everyone can watch it ... without the need to see the BSG! This show is a well-written drama for those who love this drama with a little sci-fi hit!
