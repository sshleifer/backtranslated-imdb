After "Beau travail", they all waited for Claire Denis to make a masterpiece that never came. Now she has. Denis makes a quantum jump in this movie, an orgasm of great cinema, elliptical editions, and deliberately vague narrative events that are strange and even strange. There is a nominal plot (made partly from Jean-Luc Nanci's book of the same name) about a mature man who needs a heart transplant and who is looking for a Tahitian son he had left long ago; but it's mostly research into the idea of ​​personal and cultural downturns. It takes a few reviews to fully understand, and puzzle problems are near the end, but it's even more advanced and more appealing than anything I've seen this year. Skip it to danger.
