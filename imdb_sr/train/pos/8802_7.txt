This is a very interesting project that could have been pretty brilliant. Collecting 11 prominent international directors and assigning each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds, and 1 frame to create a segment of your choice; every short survey of global echoes on September 11th. Without any spoilers, I would say that the piece of Ken Loach is a jewel in the crown, and the short Mira Nair (segment "India"), based on the true story, deserves to be in full motion. Also, realizing, watching his short film, why is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrito one of the best directors in the world today? He is simply a media master, who also has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts were made. Ioussef Chahine, in his segment "Egypt", assumes the Arab position of collective guilt, which could potentially be the most interesting. He broke down poorly. Chahine's short text is poorly written and poorly performed, at least enough to distinguish among other superior chapters of the film. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would still give a movie 7/10 for the concept, if not for execution.
