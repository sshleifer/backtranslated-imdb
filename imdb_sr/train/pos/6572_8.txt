One of my favorite films has been "Last Hero Hero" for many years; Unfortunately, Arnold Schvarznegger decided to spoil my party by becoming a corrupt politician; so now I can not stand any movie that he might have had. Jake's Adventure Jokes are actually toys with some themes similar to those in Last ... Hero; so I was glad to find him on DVD, so I can watch how these topics play so well. In spite of the "intruding intrusion" that involves white slavery during the civil war in Africa, this is not an action movie. The plot of "plot-in-the-plot" is actually a question which film does not intend to solve: is Jake Speed ​​the real person who helps heroin to save his sister from a wholesaler; or is he actually a fictional figure (which means that the heroine somehow entered the universe that really exists only in a series of pulp novels)? I suggest that this is not everything that is clearly defined in the film, and that Vaine Cravford and Andrev Lane are perfectly aware of this. The film thus becomes a presentation of what the audience might want from such a fictitious universe of "adventure story". It is actually a rich topic, a potential weight that is lit by a kind and stone sense of the film. The film has weaknesses - primarily cinema, which makes the movie a TV shov. And pacing is occasionally retreating. But these characters really like me, and I enjoy the adventure they live in, no matter how stupid. And I just think that it's a fascinating idea that this adventure really takes place in a novel. Adhering to Multiple Views - a good show!
