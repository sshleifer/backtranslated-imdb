For the first time I had the opportunity to see this, but forgotten, classic in the early eighties, in one of our art houses as a revival. As I watched this feverish dream of exercising sexuality in the 1930s, I thought IOVZA! They were murdered in Europe at the time. Unfortunately, this film was carved in the original American edition by the blue nose of the Haies office (the firm ruling censorship launched by the "shining of you" by the Bible thief, Villahies, a former postmaster, if you can believe it) because of the overall themes of human sexuality (the heavenly people forbade themselves actually had sex in the 1930s). The action of Ecstasy refers to a young woman (played by Hedi Lamarr) who marries a much older man, and later complains. She (Lamarr) meets a handsome young man and has an affair with him, which resulted in a divorce from her previous husband (another not in Hollywood films then - Divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the first time a director who worked in a sound format (i.e., it seems that the film possesses techniques that were mostly used in silent films, ie, Expressionism from 1920). It is still prudent to look for a window in early European speech images, along with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and Karl Westor (Vampire) (1931). It is not rated, but it contains this notorious scene of naked swimming and some thinly concealed sexual references, which according to today's standards could be slightly higher than the PG-13 (but would easily reach "Ks" from the 30s, if it existed then )
