I can not believe that people are looking for a movie in this movie. These are Laural and Hardy. Already light up. These two were rebellions. Their comedy genius is so ridiculous today as it was 70 years ago. There was no dirty word from both of the mouths and could hold the audience in the seams. Their comedy was not sophisticated by any part. If the pillow can not make you laugh, there's no reason to look at what those guys did. It was simpler, and people were laughing at things that were funny without complicity. I guess it takes a simple mind to enjoy these things, so I qualified myself. Two comedy teams do not count, We are too sophisticated ... Are not we happy?
