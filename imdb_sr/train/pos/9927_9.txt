Domino is a great movie. It's about the young woman Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightlei) who becomes the head hunter for her boredom with her lifestyle. She joins with two fellow hunters (Mickei Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. The script is good. Very humorous and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I have with this movie is to concentrate on the different things they do, rather than the character of Domino. Even with this, Kiera Knightlei gives fierce performance. It shows the true amount of anger and dedication in this show. Mickei Rourke continues his Oscar-Vorthi performance in Sin City with another rough performance. Edgar Ramirez does not really do anything except that he sometimes speaks Spanish and stares at Kier. Deloroi Lindoi gives good support. Mo'Nikue was alone, although she surprised me in one particular scene. Lucie Liu has excellent chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her. The best thing about the movie is in the direction. The fast-moving thematic style of Tony Scott really revives the film. Cinema is one of the best I've ever seen. He takes a regular film and puts acid. All the blacks are blacker, the whites are brighter and have some kind of green glow. Action scenes are exciting. OVERALL: If you like Sin Citi & Man on Fire, you will love Domino.
