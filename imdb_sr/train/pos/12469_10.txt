It's a great movie. I shine that some people think it may not be based on a true story. Regardless of that, the movie is great, and you can all think that it's not a reason why the balloon with a siren ends on it in siren and so on. this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we believe in us and do everything in this world to be true. The girl (Desi - in the movie), and her mom, were the best actors I've seen for a long time. Good for them, for all the actors, everything for the director. If somebody can tell them, tell them: "A guy of 25 years from Romania says thank you for making this movie."
