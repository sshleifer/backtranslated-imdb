Okay, here's what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for VHS tape and I thought, this looks interesting. Take it out and take it home. The guy was right, interesting. They put the spirits of a serial killer into dreams, in corpses and in the interior every day. But this must be the most unique place to place the spirit of a serial killer. Inside the body of snowmen. I liked all the nice footage of snowmen who threw a landscape, a pot holder, a snowball, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, had fun at a killer who had not seen FREDDI KRUGGER. That's right, I said. FREDDI KRUGGER. That's the level "cool". I wish some of the puppet effects were better, the mouth movements could better fit. But that can be a small budget. Actors do a great job, there are some great liners and fears that any hardcore horor fan jumps. Everything and everything, great story, good effects, excellent dialogue and great acting. I'm giving JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
