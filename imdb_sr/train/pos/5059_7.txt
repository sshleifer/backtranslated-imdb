We looked at the vice and thought it was fascinating. Not knowing anything about this true story, I thought, "Oh, no, P.Brosnan as an American Indian (the" red "Indian in the movie), what a bad choice" until I discovered the truth about the gray owl. The film well demonstrates the dignity of these indigenous peoples and undermines racist myths about them. And Annie Galipeau, VOV, what a beauty, and very persuasive as an Indian (I believe it is French-Canadian; it certainly returns to the much-known speech of such). In spite of Brosnan's alienated style, in the end he appears convincingly as a passionate, committed man. The action is a bit weak in the demostration of his transformation from the denim into the animal cooperator. Good movie, it's recommended.
