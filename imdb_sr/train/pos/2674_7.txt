If the excessive exit from a ship, on board, from a bus, on a bus .. is a way to waste time, then you should return to Hollywood movies that wrap this part in one assembly to get money. and thus leave you unconnected and in a cinematic limb that stems from not really depicting the reality of life. Long drawn travel sequences allow the viewer the same frustration and sense of 'waiting in line' that characters must endure. Frustrating? Yes. Vital? Really. the limbo of that journey is the key to the 'no root' of this Turkish family. A wonderful movie with great acting. It's sad, but it's worth it.
