Seven pounds, this was a film in which I was convinced that Will Smith actually go to the movies, "I'll make you cry." One thing you can give him credit, one can wage. My only thing is as moving as the story, Will Smith has proved again and again that it can be, so why take this extremely depressing story? However, it is still a good movie. I must admit that I was to cry, but I felt it was noticeable performance Rosario Dawson, absolutely love this girl, since I had seen in 25 time with Ed Norton, I knew that this girl will go far. She is beautiful, charming, funny and talented, can not wait to see how long it will continue to advance her career. But she and Will Smith are not so sure if they had big chemistry that the film should have done in a great movie. <Br /> <br /> Two years ago, Tim Thomas was in a car accident caused by your mobile phone; Seven people died: six strangers and his fianc√©e.

Will Smith pulls a good performance, but not the best, but most of the film asked him to cry in every scene, but it was the last DOOZA. But I loved the end, he was wonderful and truly told you to appreciate life and not take it for granted. There are still good people in this world and Ben's character reminds you that you value life and give to those who are in desperate need. Although he went a bit far, but it was still a nice story. 7/10
