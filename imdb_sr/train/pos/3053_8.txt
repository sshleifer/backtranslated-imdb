William H. Macy is in her most desirable and fascinating place, as a hit man and a loving father who wants to get out of a family business, not to anger his encouraging parents. There are many of the same territories as TV Sopranos in the sense of the crisis of the Middle Ages of the criminal theme (and here it is visited by a psychiatrist), but it is still worth watching through a tense direction from Bromel (I am looking forward to this man going on), an excellent scenario, and everything about big performances. Macie is as good as ever. This is probably his best role as "Farga". Donald Sutherland is in his freaky place as the dominating father. Tracks Ullman gives a surprisingly seductive dramatic shift like Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Matias's brilliant and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-loose and beautiful). Even Neve Campell (whom I usually bother) is tempting as a problematic young woman who catches Macy's eye. All of this is accentuated by the moving result and a sharp pace leading to a predictable but still strong climax and meaningful and touching consequences. This movie earned a much wider edition, as I think it would be related to the audience.
