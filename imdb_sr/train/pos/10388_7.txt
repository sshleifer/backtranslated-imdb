I'm a big fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed much more here than with other summer blockbusters. It's strange that people listen to this movie with excuses such as "lame" and "much harder than performance". Do ALL remember the rudeness of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy makes incest jokes, and Bo says Luke probably took half of the children in the orphanage. The only reason he was purged is that he changed at an earlier date. As for the plots. It was the perfect plot of Ducks. In fact, as a remake, more original source material probably remains than any TV show that migrated to the big screen. While Sean Villiam Scott and Johnny Knokville are not just like their small version of the screen, they work well and work together well. Although I was not too interested in Burt's boss Hogg. And I'd have a little more incompetence than Roscoe's sheriff. In Roscoe's movie, it's a little ... scary. And who had no smile on his face while General Lee was running down the streets of Atlanta and the Hazzard passageways? People, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car racing, you will not be sorry. It's a great movie!
