"Shower" is a story of loyalty, of the unstoppable progress of the modern world at the expense of traditional and human ways of life. A man who was forced to choose between his successful business career, his life in a big city, his wife and his retarded young brother. The eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do. Modern China against the old. Public baths with their gatherings, cricket battles against shopping centers and skyscrapers. Many old people and women no longer need it. China, one country, two systems, like Xiao Ping said ... although one of them kills another. Tenders, moving, full of funny moments, and from bitter sweet ones. Sensitive will cry and laugh equally. Actors are huge, especially those who play the role of a retarded boy; and Iang Zhang does a good job, easy, simple, letting the story run just by itself. My rate: 8/10
