Keep in mind that I'm a fan of the genre, but I've only seen this movie for the first time recently. As I've overlooked all this time, it's a miracle for me. For me, this is a better movie, then highly praised "High Noon". It's great western with great acting and a great story. DVD is in a beautiful black and white technique with extraordinary cinema. If you love Western or James Stuart this movie should not be missed.
