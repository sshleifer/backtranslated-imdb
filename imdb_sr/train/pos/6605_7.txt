2054. Paris is the Escher Drawing with people and vehicles strolling on several levels in the obvious respect of Metropolis Fritz Lang. Paris is ultramodern and collapses. Blinking between surveillance, a rather young medical researcher was abducted immediately after leaving her sister in a nightclub. A heavy police captain is investigating. Shown in black and white, with dark corridors, shady streets and unique original illumination characteristic of the most stubborn film noir, comparisons with the City of Sin are inevitable. But the story owes more to Masamune Shirov and Villiam Gibson than Frank Miller, such as high-tech surveillance, an almost invisible suit and ruthless super-corporations equally part of the landscape as weapons and cars. The film never generates the atmosphere of the vicious Gibson cyberpunk vision, with its tough marginal characters confronting the industrial types of corporations that all have their Ministries of Fear, but the viewer definitely gets the feeling that future Paris no utopia and future science are no less benevolent. And as the police procedural line unfolds, we are drawn into darker recesses of individual ambition under the brilliant veneer of Avalon Corporation. The motion capture process used here creates a look somewhere between black and white comics and next generation rotoscoping, and it is amazing or intrusive depending on your taste. Nevertheless, there is a great visual sense here, and since Paris is filled up to fine details that give the painting a unique look that is in the craft and spartan and baroque. It's worth a look.
