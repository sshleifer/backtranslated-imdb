Watching this movie brought back some great memories of childhood. I'm 34 now, I have not seen him since 12-14. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I recently watched it, some of the scenes literally brought me tears! That little robot "Jink" (friends forever!). It was like I was back in my childhood. It was an absolutely incredible experience for me. I'll always cherish this movie for that reason. I hope that some of you readers can refer to my experience, not to this movie, but to any movie that you have not seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... - Thanks for reading
