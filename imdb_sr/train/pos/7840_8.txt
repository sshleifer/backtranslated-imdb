BORN TO BOOGIE is a real 'invention' - although it has been a fan of almost thirty years, I first saw the movie a few days ago and put it among the best rock films of all time; the music is brilliant (cream T. Reka) and visually consistently exciting and unusual, leaving this viewer a craving for the previous directing efforts of Ring Starr, who has done a good job here. If you love music, you will all be in T. Rectasio, while Marc Bolan is really the star of the work, in front of the center. Even the fact that some songs repeat is not important: various spaces, costumes, musical arrangements and bizarre visual concepts are used to borrow different textures and much optimistic humor for what could have been only a Concert film in other hands. As rich and full as BORN TO BOOGIE, the film takes only an hour, but what's in it is completely satisfactory. That's my only criticism - the video package says something like 71 minutes, and at least one online source claims the movie takes 67 minutes, but it looks like it's more than 61 minutes of rocking fun.
