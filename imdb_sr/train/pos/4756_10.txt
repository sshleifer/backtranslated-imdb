This is one of the most beautiful episodes of Zone Twilight, with fun dialogue and fun characters that break the tension of some nasty moments. There is a usual blonde "dancer" (what about Serling's affection for such a character, so she appears in various episodes?) And other diverse characters, but "old man" Jack Elam who steals a show totally. I think it's a funny, carefree version of "Monsters that are on Maple Street" - or, perhaps, a 20-minute parody of "Stars". On the second note: I thought that the young lover of this episode could be someone who ultimately switched to other things - he seemed familiar - but it looks like "Ron Kipling" disappeared after just two TV attachments on his behalf.
