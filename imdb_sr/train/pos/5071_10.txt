I saw this movie on the Hallmark channel and I thought it was wonderful, especially because it was based on the right man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as a lonely Englishman who took over the personality of the half-breed Graya Ovl. The photo was beautiful. This film made me explore this character who Archie Belanei is known as a simple gray owl. I want to read as much as I can about him. At that time, I did not know that Richard Attenborough had sent him. But I'm not surprised. I love all his films regardless of whether he plays or directs. I gave her the highest grade. However, I would love to have seen more in the film about why he took over that person because he showed only two aunts that had been raised by him and his room in their house. it's not ok with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a wonderful story without listening to the abominable language and fictional special effects every few minutes.
