Mendez and Marichel gave us a serious, convincing and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism aroused in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the hospitable people I met, and yet, since our nation refuses to face its imperial responsibilities, Puerto Rican people are allowed to douse and die. The spiritual crisis that the colonial situation in Puerto Rico has created is, if it undermines families, and the basic institutions that support any society. Corruption is unbridled to the point that people do not pay taxes (which has led to a fiscal crisis for this nation) and the sense of cynicism and distrust sweep the island's culture. yet another powerful film to be produced. Must be seen. . .
