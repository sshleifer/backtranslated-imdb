It's nothing brilliant, revolutionary or innovative, but 'Dog Dais' is for some reason extremely fascinating character studies. It's like CRASH stumbles on a bad dose of heroin, but not exactly. It is an Austrian film that tracks the lives of several depressed, disturbed and boring people and their violent relationships. It's disturbing but very good acting and it's interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do. Certainly not for the weak, this highly pessimistic film does not give a conclusion or revelation in the end, we just see the lives of these dirty individuals for two days. Rating: B
