I saw this movie yesterday at Turner, and I could not stop watching until it was over, although I could somehow guess what would happen. Farrel was great in his role, and everyone else did a great job. Some of them stretched to the borders, but all in all, I loved it !! If you have the opportunity to see her, please! I actually cried in several scenes, but then I assume you're your mom. Loretta is beautiful, and I was just startled by the very idea that there were mothers who were unmarried, it seemed to be ahead of their time. I say, watch if you can not even listen to criticism. As they say, I was laughing, I cried! I enjoyed it completely!
