When I rolled over the TV guide and came across "Twisted Desire" in the movie section, I read its description. Three words captured me about "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I find her role in "Sabrina: Teenage Witch" absolutely corrupted, I hate such programs, so I thought it would be boring old, love story she was playing ... I'm a little knew. Finally I started on television, I saved my bucket in the case of vomiting for cheese or freshness, you know what I mean. At first, you think she is just a pretty, ordinary girl who is in love, but she has bad parents. Then when you discover that she manipulated her boyfriend to kill her parents, so that she could be with her true love, you are like "Vhoa." You just do not expect this role for that kind of actress. In my opinion, I played my role very well, I never expected to act like such a bitch, and that she did it perfectly! I congratulate her, the film was very good, I would certainly look at him again and recommend it to others.
