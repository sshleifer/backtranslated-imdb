Now I am in front of the TV, I watch Casomai. Changing, developing or better ... moving. Beginning with Kurius's wedding, two protagonists are reporting their love story. After everything changes, a child is born, and everything else usually happens in pairs. It's not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this film. She does not want to show us anything special, there is nothing new, it's just a normal story of love, a story about a couple, and being normal becomes different from the rest. It's also a blinking movie, it's all short, every scene is just a few seconds long. It is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about it, and their opinion is central, opinions create a story and destroy it. It's a simple story about a couple, as I said, but it's not bored, it only shows a couple, it needs to be all familiar, that's, but I'm sure each one of you will want to know what happened, so do not forget to look at the end !
