It is loosely conceived as a satire by D.V. Griffith's intolerance, Three Centuries, was the first attempt by Buster Keaton to comedy. The only similarities with intolerance are the initial "book" of the scene and the fact that similar stories through centuries are arranged together in a complete movie. Keaton's explanation that this style applied was that if it fails as a feature film, it can be reduced to three binary. Luckily, The Three Centuries brilliantly grows like a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I've seen in any of Keaton's films. There is nothing unique or bold about the story. They are a simple boy-girl, a girl-girl, a girl-girl-girl, but the satire of the period is rebellious and set standards for the future works of Mela Bruce and all the films of this genre. However, I do not believe that anyone ever crossed this comedy. Nobody can play a nice jerk like Keaton, and stops in this movie are some of his best. In addition, the appearance of Vallace Beyer as Keaton's rivals contributes to the appeal of this film. Anyone who thinks that comedy from the 1920s can not be appreciated by the modern audience must see this film.
