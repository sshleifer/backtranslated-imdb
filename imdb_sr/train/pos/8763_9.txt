This film is a cold, naked truth. We often think "no, it will not happen to me." But he can. Drug smuggling is big money and often people are unconsciously (or deceived) doing things for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who love them, they just wanted an exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare. People need to know that such events are not incredible or exaggerated - this is a big problem in today's society. Movie. It's very emotional and raw. It's worth watching and surely stays in memory.
