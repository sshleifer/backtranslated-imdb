I was a fan of Jennifer Connell ever since Phenomena, and after I heard seven minutes in the sky, I saw him as soon as I could. The film is not just a comedy if you think that most of these things have passed through as children and are currently passing through not only that the film was greatly led by the phenomenal jennifer connelli, but it attracted my attention that this film was scrupulously written and acted it was a good job I loved him and looked at him again and again for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelli that can not postpone watching this movie !!!!
