Necessary for any punk rocker, this is the film that The Ramones made as the name of the household in the early 1980s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). This was one of the first and best American Punk Rock films, with a cult classic status there with The Rocki Horror Picture Shov. Initially, the producers wanted Cheap Trick as the stars, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" just made superstars and too hot items in the low budget movie. Very good luck for Ramones who asked to leave the underground punk rock of the world and the mainstream market (which unfortunately never happened until the death of bands). The band, especially Dee Dee, did not like the movie during the 1980s, but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movies while waiting to enter Ramones broadcasts. This movie, like most classics, is a stupid party with some classic Ramones video at its peak. Do not expect more, you will not find it. It's very fun, so enjoy. Another classic Allan Arkush on a similar vein is Get Crazy, with Lee Ving from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
