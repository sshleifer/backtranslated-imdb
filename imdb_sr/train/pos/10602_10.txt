I must say that I completely loved the film. He had funny moments, some cordial parts, all well. I liked the movie personally because it is something that can finally be linked to your childhood. This film, in my opinion, is more focused on the young gay population. It shows how a young gay boy would be treated while he was growing up. All the strange, named names and ignorance is something that I, like most other young boys, will always remember, and now finally a film that illustrates how gay it really is to grow up. So, I would definitely recommend watching this movie. Probably you should not look at it until a person is old enough and mature enough to understand it
