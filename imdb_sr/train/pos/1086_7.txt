This film is a bit unusual in that it has very thin work and the film is doing very slowly and slowly. Although this is quite different from Grant's average film, it's still very visible and fun. It's as if somebody said: "Let's follow Tsar and watch him bother all the small problems that arise when you have a rehabilitation house." Considering how fun the actor in the film and the great support she gets from Mirna Loi and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. While the film has quite modest pretensions, it mostly uses material. It's a great movie for fans of Cari Grant or for the whole family.
