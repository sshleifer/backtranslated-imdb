Vov I really liked this movie, Villiam H. Macchi is great as a quiet hit man Alek. All the performances are really good, the plot is interesting and fun. Alec, a married person (as well as his father) with a small son, goes through a crisis in the middle ages and wants to leave the family business and then goes to a psychiatrist for help and in this place meets the young spirit Sarah in whom she falls in love . One day Alek does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill the person he knows. I recommend that you watch it if you like mature interesting movies. 8 stars = very good
