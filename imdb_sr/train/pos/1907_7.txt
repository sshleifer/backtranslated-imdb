8 Simple Rules is a funny show, but there are also some life lessons, especially a mature lesson about going after a lost episode in which Paul died, which was the first episode I've ever seen in a show that comes to ABC. Clan Hennessy - mother Cate (Katei Sagal), daughter Bridget (Kalei Cuoco) and Kerry (Ami Davidson), and son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - look at each other for leadership and support after the death of Paul (John Ritter), family patriarch . Kate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) help. It was nice later in the second season of this show that they decided to include David Spade in this show because he ended up with the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But all this and all this performance is pretty good. This show reminds me of many classic family comedies from the 80s and 90s that used to be at ABC.
