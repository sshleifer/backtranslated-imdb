"Before the devil knows you're dead" is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. The performance of a great ensemble is incredible. Philip Seimour Hoffman performed extraordinary performance and got charged each time on the screen. Ethan Havke is responsible for the scene and Albert Finnei simply chews the screen. Marisa Tomei is, however, under-exploited in criminal terms, but looks incredible for 42 years. The script is great, the story is non-linear, but easy to follow. Sidney Lumet, though not known for her blockbusters, turned out to be a jewel with this!
