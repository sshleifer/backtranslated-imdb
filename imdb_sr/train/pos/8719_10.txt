I was amazed at the improvements in the animated film. If you sit near the screen, you will see details in the structure of the grass and surface. The details, colors and shadows are at least the order of magnitude better than the Toy Story. How they managed to pull the shadow, I will never find out. I hope PIKSAR will give a documentary about how the film was shot so that it can find out how it's all been achieved. Based on this film, I think that the animated films of the future will be evaluated based on this film.
