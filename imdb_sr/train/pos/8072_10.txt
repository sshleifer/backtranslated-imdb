Magnificent and unforgettable, stunning atmospheric and brilliant all. I really can not understand which people this masterpiece transmits and give voices like 8 (and nine)! > <br /> This is, along with Grapes of the Vrath, John Ford's greatest movie. I would say that the Long Voiage Home is next in line, although it's far from coming back. Rating: 10. She deserves 12th.
