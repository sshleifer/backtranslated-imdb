This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. it's really refreshing to watch and I've been in the seams many times. I suppose there is a factor of social awareness, which makes it very interesting. If they are white girls, will they get the same reaction? Maybe, maybe not? The characters do not know the boundaries (check my verses) and do not exclude anyone from their distorted sense of fun! my favorite is the bob builder. So it's stupid that it's a genius. If you love a twisted black comedy then this is for you. If you love to hold the show, it's probably not. Non-blonde is another hilarious British BBC comedy shown on TV! It's such a funny show and the characters that appeared in unexpected public voices laugh at loud funny! It would be impossible to keep the right face watching crazy characters and reactions to the public! This series is easily added to great comedies that are produced!
