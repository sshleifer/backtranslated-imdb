One of my favorite movies. It has everything - a sound rocking pad, thanks to Eddie Clark, the former Motorhead, a lot of action, a lot of laughter, a totally funny plot and the nicest stereotypes of the 80s as characters. Eddie, a nice guy who just wants to stay alone, Leslie (as wet as they come), Nuke (burning the wall), Eddie's mother (pathetic), Roger (geek) and Ozzi as a preacher (surely there is in America? ). Then there are boys (rich, evil and stupid) and girls (empty, empty and stupid). What more can you ask for? Well, first of all, there's Sammi Curr, rock star, the amalgam of every bad rocker of the 80s that you can remember. What about the rocket that shoots the guitar? Then there's a scene in which Sammy pulls an old lady through the TV screen and breaks it. And what does Roger do? Why, thank you, just like a good geek. My favorite scene is where Tim Hainei gets his long-standing prize from Sammy through a damp finger in his pocket - magic! If you were in the rock of the 80's or just love funny movies like me, then check this out. It's available on DVD and it's very cheap (trick or) to treat yourself.
