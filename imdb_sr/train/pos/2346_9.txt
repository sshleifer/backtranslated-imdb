Very cute pilot. The show smells of better films by Tim Burton ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie and Chocolate Factory. Cinema, narration, music, exterior effects on all screaming Tim Burton. There must be a connection, or STRONG influence, I just did not investigate enough to know where it is. As I saw on the forums, that Anna Friel plays the poor Zooei Deschanel. Every time I see it on the screen, I see Zooei. Do not misunderstand me, Anna Friel does a great job. Her character is very sweet and appealing and is easily attached to her. That's more than an obstacle that I'm constantly thinking "Why did not they get Zooei Deschanel." Lee Pace also does a great job. I tried to remember where I knew him and I just looked at him. Vonderfalls !!! Great, short-lived series from 2004. If you enjoy Pushing Daisies, you have to rent Vonderfalls, which is another Brian Fuller creation ?? Again. Two underrated actresses who never manage to bring her performances.
