This movie has its ups and downs, but for me the good things in this movie are far bigger than bad ... What is not good in the movie are sometimes dialogue, sounds, lighting (is it me the only one who noticed that the sets were illuminated by an amateur, and the acting ... What is very good are a very original story, a very intense atmosphere, a very high factor, and the effects that have been made ultimately. So, it's certainly worth watching, or maybe even making sure to see for all of your horror and lovers upstairs.
