'The Luzhin Defense' is a good movie with fine central performances, but too many novels and insufficient filmmakers flourish. Most of the films were clear that the characters only helped to narrate. Marlene Gorris may have been able to examine Luzhin's psyche instead of describing him as a tortured innocent victim torn by the cruel motives of others. a novel written in the early 20th century. This film does not enter deep enough into the relationship between Lu≈æina and Natalija. Natalia's confrontation with her mother encounters an unremitting disagreement of her mother, not a dramatic point in the film. I felt that Luzin's troubles and the possible tragic end were questioning me, and that I was not satisfied that his unusual and complex personality was divorced. However, this was a moving and enjoyable movie, but certainly not great.
