Salva and his friend Bigardo spent most of their lives on the brink of the law. We see them hurrying in a car underground, where their terrain for donations is so lame, nobody gives them anything! Salva, who is a hard-core, small criminal, does not even have a redeeming quality, that is, until he finds out realizing shov on television that gives him an idea of ​​what's next. Religion and business show are a winning combination, something Salva capitalizes. He and Bigardo are in prison after the accidental death of a priest who has criticized the duo. Salva shows that he is natural to realizing shov. He turns Christ into a similar figure that is the current success in the program. Espe, who is a dumb woman who is the producer of the show, can not escape from the way Salva pays unusual attention. In the end, Salva is ultimately the victim of her own success. Jordi Molla, whose first directing work in this film, had some success in the way in which the film saturates the role of television. Spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, saw its share of bizarre things, which was what the director felt as an attack on the audience and wanted to put his story from the perspective of people who make happiness from a naive audience. The ensemble of actors has some good moments in the movie. Mr. Molla, like any other actor who decides to direct his first feature film, would be more efficient to concentrate on the image in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching a movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and others responded well to the new director.
