I read Schneebaum's book (the same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply touched by his ability to see through many ways of "otherness" (his and the Amazonian people he lived with and loved) that the way of life of a decent life . His next books were not so powerful, but they showed his constant search. His description of sexual relations with tribal people was far ahead of his time in the early sixties, but his sincerity and openness in that regard were welcome. This film beautifully transmits man's strangeness and generosity, but also provides an insight into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which in this case is not a morally positive term) that happens when "civilized" people fall into traditional societies. Even so, Å nebaum himself went into some kind of more innocence which suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.
