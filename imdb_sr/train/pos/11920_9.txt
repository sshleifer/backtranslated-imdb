Christopher Lloyd is ridiculous and really convincing as "Al the angel". This film is much better than the first, but it has great special effects that they did not have first, as well as a much better complication and writing. Just as fun as children. Tony Danza is doing a very realistic job in his role - but this is not a reunion of taxis. For a change, a pleasant change. Take a look at once - it's worth trying to catch her.
