"GOOD TIME", in my opinion, you have to see the CBS hit! Despite the fact that I have never seen every episode, I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I really love the theme song. If you ask me, although I love everything, it would be nice if everyone else was on the show during the entire race. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, costumes were well designed, and writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can now be seen on TV Earth, I strongly recommend that you catch it in case it turns off forever.
