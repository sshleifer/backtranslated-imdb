This is the last episode we earned. At the end of last season, things have remained in the 'life goes' mood, which is difficult to end up with this real series deserving. Although it was not a happy show, this series was always the one that made you think (a rare thing on television), and this is no exception. "Is death justified by reasoning?" "Does the morality reflects society or is society shaped by morals that are chosen by a few in power?" "What is just death and can it exist?" All these questions, and much more, are set by the authors of this show every week, and this is their final thesis. Excellent acting, great writing, beautiful camera work, great editing, clean direction. If you've seen the series and missed this when it was running for the first time, then somehow keep a copy. If you've never watched the series when it started, then it will be independent, but it can be difficult to try to keep up with the one that all the characters and what they allude in their various past times. For those of us who were passionate watchers of the series in the last two seasons, this is a very satisfying look.
