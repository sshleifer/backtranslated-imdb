Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story about it), this is, in my opinion, the best of all. Almost true to the original story - with some minor deviations and omissions, e.g. the absence of Scilla & Charibdis and the fact that Eumaeus the pig recognizes Odyssey disguised in his hut - realistic acting and authentic landscapes and costumes all contribute to making this an unforgettable masterpiece, not some Hollywood sword-sandal B film. Regardless of the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are entirely in Italian, if you are familiar with the story, he can still make a head and tails about what happens and what the actors say (provided you have a good Odyssey manuscript) at hand) . At least I did it, and that's enough to inspire me to learn the Italian language in order to further appreciate the film.
