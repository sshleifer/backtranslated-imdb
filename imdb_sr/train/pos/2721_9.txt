The real story (happened in Kansas, 1959) about the murder (Perry and Dick, two former prisoners who broke into a remote house in the rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks sent a cold and disturbing Capot's book about the reasons that led these children to crime (Are they naturally born murderers?). The crime sites are very brutal and persecuted because of the lack of senses and the reasons for what we saw. A stunning black and white cinema from the Conrand Hall, a great party for Countri-Road music from Kuinci Jones, incredible performances in the two main roles of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, and the first time in the movie a sad commentary on the death penalty at the last moments before death . Jones, Holl and Brooks (as a director and writer for the adaptation scenario) were nominated for an Oscar. Capture, superbly directed and scary, one of the best films of this decade
