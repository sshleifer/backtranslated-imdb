"Rumors" Friz Frelenga are an excellent cartoon "Private Snafu", which warns of the spread of rumors that cause panic during the war. Produced, as well as all Snafu shorts, in order to show the military audience as entertaining teaching films, 'Rumors' are extremely imaginative and sinking ideas into their very short lifespan. When Snafu starts rumors of a bombing, he escalates into a possible rumor that America has lost the war. This is greatly illustrated by a long, rubberized piece of nonsense and a few weird, fictional creatures returning to chase Snaf with increasingly terrifying news about his country's army. 'Rumors' are inventive, quick and funny, all of which helps make shade quite tiring, 'do not arm' messages. It stands as one of the best private Snafu shorts.
