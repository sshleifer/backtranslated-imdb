From the first scene, I was very excited. "I can say this will be great!" I thought. The acting was so good that I felt like I was shooting at the lives of these people. And music was extremely disturbing. The action began with a sudden event, and then she moved forward (it was possible to feel) toward an irreplaceable fate. The construction was slow, but I personally love such things, until calm tension remains on the right track and does not get out of the track before it is ready to pay off. So that everything goes well, and then the fireworks start, and before you find out, the loans turn. "WHAT?!!!" there was everything I could say. If you understand the director's intentions, the stupid ending makes sense (for those of you who have already watched the movie, look at a very fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden on filmcritic.com), but I can not say It could not be corrected. This could have probably been solved with ten minutes of material up to the peak. Anyway, that's bad. These ten minutes could make a difference in the world. (But for those of you who do not write or make movies, you need to know that making a story with real timing is MUCH MUSIC in the ass, and I certainly do not make this criticism from any pedestal!) Vendigo it seems like a masterpiece that it gave up before it was finished. But hay, I would take a blunted masterpiece every day over an excessively produced piece of dog that is too compensated by too many digital effects (like most of these horror films these days). Another comment. Some monstrous scenes left me confused whether I should be scared or laugh. I do not know how to explain it, but Monti Pithon's feelings about this monster in his more attacking "monstrous" forms were distinct. Although this may sound like a terrible criticism of a horror movie - I do not know, it still has to do with me. I will never again look at the horns of the deer in the same way! :)
