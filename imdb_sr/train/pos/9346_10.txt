If you have not enjoyed this movie, or are dead, or hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. Excellent actor, everyone who gave good performances. This film proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what critics say. Adam Sandler becomes a very respected actor. It all began with his performance in Big Daddy, and then he made a couple of bad films, then broke it with a great performance at 50 First Dates, The Longest Iard, then Click, and now Reign Over Me. > Back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The nearest family is mother-in-law and mother-in-law. After his old chemist (Cheadle) encountered him, he seems to be turning his life. I will not say anything else because I do not want to ruin the film, but strongly recommend this film. One of the best movies in 2007.
