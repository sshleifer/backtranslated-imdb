King's Solomon's Mines brings us Patrick Svaize (starring Allan Kuatermain) who spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides it's time to go back to England and father his son. He discovered that his wife's parents took custody of his son and that he had very little chance of getting custody of him with a lot of money for the lawsuit. Alison Deedi (starring Elizabeth) comes in, whose father is in Africa and holds him an African tribe to buy a card that Elizabeth's father sent her. Elizabeth asks Kuatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. There are good actors who support Kuatermain and Elizabeth, and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want the map too. The film retains your attention to the end. Patrick once again plays a nasty and handsome honest man who rescues a girl in distress. Patrick is a great drama actor who can easily show passion, loss and despair, a rugged silent good man, anger and strength; In the minds of King Solomon his character actually smiled several times. I really would like to see Patrick Swayze again in a relaxed and relaxed story, in which he does not have to tighten his jaws and be so strong. Maybe a little dance would help. But this is a good movie for the whole family and it's worth watching.
