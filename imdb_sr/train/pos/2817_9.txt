This review is intended for the extended cut of this film. First I watched the Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVD a long time ago. I've always loved this movie and you can read some of the more positive comments to get a general idea. It is said. I always thought the story was a little confusing. The film is, after all, a love story. And it always seemed strange that the love story had to end with a 20-minute battle scene. Well, in an extended version it's no longer the case. The old "original" version starts with a large sequence similar to the barrel / rugby, which is the new final sequence in the expanded version. The introductory sequence is Jackie Chan, who is concerned about his home and pretends to be practicing and reciting whenever his father is nearby. It makes a lot more sense when you watch it. Pacing is also better and generally works better. She feels more like a love story and does not leave you to ask questions about why she ends so drastically and dramatically as a regular version. I suggest to everyone who is Hong Kong Kong or just the usual fanatic Jackie Chan to get the extended version and watch the movie in the way it was originally intended. (Or at least I think it was intended. It was done watching, I felt like I was watching a brand new Jackie Chan movie although most of the sequences were the same.
