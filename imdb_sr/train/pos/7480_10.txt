This film is one of Tom Cruise's best films. His role as David Aames deals with the imagination of the audience. His character can relate to all of us in some way. The story is very smart and holds the audience on the edge of the whole movie. I've never watched movies on Cruise before, but after I've seen this, it shows me his real talent. My favorite part in the movie is the end where everything comes to a big conclusion and he finds out the truth. If you have not seen it yet, you should certainly try. It's one of those movies that once you start watching it, you have to see it completely or will keep you thinking and regretting it. My opinion is that you should buy it and download the risk I have made and it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. That's A * 10/10 I promise when you look at it, it will stay with you and you'll be happy forever.
