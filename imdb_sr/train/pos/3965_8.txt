The film as a party is very good and Jimmy Stevart is as good as Chip Hardesti, with well-performed actors Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervin Leroi, was constantly checked, and the approval of the script, as well as every aspect of the film, all the way to the clothes, was carefully monitored and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. It's not that J. Edgar Hoover had nothing to be proud of. His leadership of the Bureau from 1924 until his death brought some of the best investigative services in the world. But by 1959 Hoover had already begun to worry about being expelled and he had already begun to collect files of powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom. And he was determined to make sure that no film showed any nipples about the bureau. Films show only unceasing successes and failures in terms of failings that have taken place, as well as the role of witch hunting bureaus in the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with the tongue firmly in the face.
