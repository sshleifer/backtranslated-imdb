Disney repeated it. The brilliant way Timone and Pumbaa are revived to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when they needed them. I love this movie and I watch it over and over again. This shows how Timone lived with his family and colleagues mercat before he went to find his dream home and adventure. Then he gets to know Pumbu and things change. Together they are looking for the house that Timon wants and is failing several times, which is ridiculous because Timone is getting more and more crazy. Then Simba appears and we see more childhood than the previous 2 movies. Other, you already know.
