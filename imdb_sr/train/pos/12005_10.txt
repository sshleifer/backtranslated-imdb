This movie was the best movie I ever saw. Being LDS I recommend this film because you are able to feel more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film is not recorded with highly acclaimed actors, it is a remarkable film that changes your life and can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. I saw this film with my family and I can testify that we all had a change in the heart. This film allows people to truly understand how much life was difficult for the prophet and how difficult it was for him. After I saw this movie, there was not a single dry eye in the whole room. Everyone was touched by what they saw, and I was not the same since I saw it. I recommend this film to everyone.
