I recommend this film. It's about a boy, Stanleiu Ielnatsu (Shia LeBeouf) who was wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake, a boy's center. There he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet. While there, he meets other guys from the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Skuid, k-Rai, and ZigZag). They all dig, not to "build characters", but to find treasure Kate Barlow. Through film (and a book), Stanley learns more about the past, more about herself and more about digging holes. I give this film 9.5, because I am very picky when it comes to books for films (I want the film to follow the book TAKO). But it was still good.
