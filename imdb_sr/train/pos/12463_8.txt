Nora is the single mother of two children who still want to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as well as her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The philosophy of free love is not entirely out of the system? and Nora did not count on falling in love, especially with a drug addict. Hazlehurst won her first of the two AFI Awards for a four-year period for her incredible portrait of Nora, who made sure she did the right thing for her children, but at the same time she falls in love with the drug addict (Friels). Garner ?? who would later cost him in films like LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHERS and STRANGE PLANET ?? She was thrown well like Norina's pre-puberty daughter, and Caton (perhaps ready for the role of the host environment program HOT PROPERTI in 2000) appears as a bearded painter. Early effort Cameron is the winner; he continued to make the rewarded miniseries MI BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But this is the staggering delivery of Hazlehurst that revives an intelligent, searchable script based on the award-winning novel Helen Garner.
