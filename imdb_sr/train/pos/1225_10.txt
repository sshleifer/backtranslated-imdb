Does anyone know where and how can I get a copy of this movie? !! I've been looking too long, someone has helped me! In 1997, my friends and I were statisticians on this film at Long Island, and in fact we never saw it. :( I was hoping to somehow find a copy so I can finally check it out and share it with the girls! (and, it does not matter if it's in VHS format, I'm still in the ice age.) If you, or anyone else know, have a copy of this movie, please help, I would be willing to pay a good copy!
