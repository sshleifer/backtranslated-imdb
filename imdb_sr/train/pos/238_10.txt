Obviously you can imagine a better movie than this one. Hey, before you all go to "Chick Flick". I am a very big and powerful, macho man, who accidentally thinks this was one of the better films in the last 20 years. The acting was great and the story was amazing. This is a wonderful remedy for the heart and soul. The acting could not have been better or the film was playing better. I know for good while Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plovright, Lady Edith Evans, Sissi Spacek, Judi Dench, are among the greatest actresses ever to appear on the film. And, of course, Cloris Leachman (also in this movie) in my opinion can actually overcome them in the strict magnum of her talent and the various roles that she has appeared over the years. In any case, this was Amazing cast. This movie was like a book that you can not deposit, and when you get to the back page you want more ... even more. I can not understand why this movie here on IMDb only estimates 3.9 <br /> This rating is completely incredible. Or maybe not. In fact, I really understand that, and that's what makes me very sad. It makes me so sad that films such as "American Beauti" "Leaving Las Vegas" "Seki Beast" and "Fight Club" rating jumps from the popularity rankings when in fact at least in this view of viewers should get "R". "rating ... This is for" Nonsense. "Hey, I understand that there are many different stories in this world for many different audiences, but it's a sad commentary when this beautiful, powerful ... exceptional, directed, acting and writing the movie seems to be exaggerated. It was obviously also on awarding the Academy Awards .... How sad. And how predictable. My summing up is that if you want to see a powerful, happy, sad, nice story ? vatch ...... preferably own this movie ...
