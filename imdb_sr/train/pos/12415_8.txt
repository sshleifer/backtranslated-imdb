This was obviously a prototype for Mick Dundee, but 'Barry McKenzie's adventure is funnier. I was having fun and laughing many times. An outstanding central performance by Barry Crocker in the lead role, an Australian who attacks England to upset the pomp by his free, unruly ways. Little Britons will be upset about Barry's often cruel observations of his hosts. The relationship between the two countries is barbaric, but friendly, and this is emphasized by the last line of the film, brought by McKenzie, who hesitated as he returned home. "I just started to love pomms."
