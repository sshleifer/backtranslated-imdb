Pleasant surprise! I expected a further fall on the line: Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such a movie. Perhaps this is the reason why there are so few who have approved this new type of Bruckheimer tariff. Smart dialogue instead of fast lines, decent background / motivation instead of shake-n-grandmother stereotype, and when the pointer came, you really craved the team. The fans are waiting for Armageddon's slide ride: go away. This is one of the more intelligent action fans. It did not even bother me that Jolie appeared so little.
