There are other reviews, so I do not need to say how big it is or what it's about ... My point is: I've heard of this movie many years ago, before it's shown. I can not even remember HOW, I just know it was over the Internet. Dealers went before he ever hit! I moped for months and complained. Please note that there is a link to purchase this movie on this page and the only highlight is VHS on Amazon.com in Germany. You can translate Alta Vista's Babelfish. I know it's PAL format and they have changed the text on the screen in German, and at the beginning is a small part of the narrative that is also called in German, but so hilarious and silly as this movie, it just makes it more fun! If you want to see this movie and have a place nearby that makes conversions, then it's worth it! It cost about twenty dollars to come to USA from Germany. Believe me, you may seem to spend a lot on the movie, but if you're in cowardly flashes, you'll blow left and right, getting conversions for your friends!
