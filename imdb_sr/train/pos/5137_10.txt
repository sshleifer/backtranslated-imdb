Interesting, fast and fun. I am not one of those people who watch the loads and stacks of television. I came across this show while one day I was ill with a bad flu, and I was immediately hooked. I fell in love with John Burke. Both he and Claire have done an incredible job to organize a show together. You can really say they both love their job. Super collector segments were excellent. I was interested in things I never thought of before. What I really liked to know is: What happened to Dog Jack? Did one host adopt it?
