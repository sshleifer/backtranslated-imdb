Completed, elegant Carol (beautiful play Rebecca Brooke), her fine husband Eddie (lovely David Houseman), Kerol is wacky, she constantly eats best friend Ann (she was beautifully written with the addictive comical frenzy by beautiful Chris Jordan), and Anna was crazy . , the loving husband Pete (usually the fine Eric Edwards) is a quartet of freed swingers who enjoy frequent group sex. Their usual routine is interrupted when Carol's lonely, suppressed but still tempting widowed mother Jennifer (top-notching show of beautiful Jennifer Velles) comes to visit. Soon Jennifer relaxes and becomes a willing participant in the endlessly pleasant and unspoiled lifestyle of the swingers, with everyone except Kerol eager to seduce her. Scenarist / director Joe Sarno invents a sharp, astonishing and perceptive examination of suburban fear and the limitation of the entire sexual revolution in the wild; Sarno converts traditional middle-class customs into their heads and continues to spark brave and provocative underpinnings for incest mothers / daughters. Moreover, Sarno challenges the first-class acting from the bang-up of actors: Velles and Brooke are remarkable, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlane Blue as the crazy Nev Age sex therapist Shandare, and Erica Eaton as a ravenous neighbor. . Fields. Better still, all women are extremely hot and seductive; Velles is particularly seriously passing through the screen with his extremely sensual figure and a shrinking erotic presence. The sex of sex is really sizzling and quite explicit, but never rude or boring. The brilliant, polished cinema of Stephen Colwell and the powerful melodic acoustic People's Party Jack Justis are solid and effective. Recommended viewing for Sarno fans.
