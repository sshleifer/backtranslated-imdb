I happened to "Bait" on the cable of one night just when it started and thought: "Eh, why not?" I'm glad to give her a chance. "Bait" is not perfect. He suffers from unnecessarily sway and occasional drowsiness. But all in all, this film was working. All the elements are straightforward, and they've pulled out what could have been a pretty ugly movie. Most of this, I think, deserves Jamie Fokk. I do not know who marked Fokka for the lead, but whoever did this film is a great service. Faithful and amazingly cute, Fokk slides through the film, smoothly as a butter and funnier than hell. You can say that he is working on an instinct, and the instinct does not let him down. The action is, though unimportant, actually well connected, and there is even a characteristic arch through which Fox's character grows as a person. Again, they could collapse without any of this, but that makes things much better. I'm surprised at the low rating for this. Perhaps I just caught this move on a real night, or vice versa, but I would give 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Fokk.
