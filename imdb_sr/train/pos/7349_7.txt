Of course, if you read my review, you've already seen this movie. 'Raja Baba' is one of my favorite characters. I love the concept of a spoiled derish with a 24 * 7 slider on a motorcycle. Watch movies and imitate characters, etc. Etc. I love the scene when the stone bursts in the mouth Kader Khan while eating. Also, where Shakti Kapoor tells a wacky story about the affairs of Raja Baba on the table, and Govinda wears a 'dharam-veer' uniform, she gives sentimental remarks. This is my favorite film scene. The 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is just a chemistry between two great Indian actors who make a comedy scene without dialogue. Great. It's a cats movie. Just watch those actors helping each other and still taking the scene from each other. His total fun. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry then it's necessary. I think RB 6 is on my list of David Dhavan. 'Deevana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Svarg', Coolie No 1 'precedes this gem of the film. 7/10.
