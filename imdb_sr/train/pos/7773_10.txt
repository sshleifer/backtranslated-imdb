Fabulous film! He recently rented a DVD and was full of this stunning piece. Douglas Sirk was a genius and performed with Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (nominated for the Oscars) and Lauren Bacall who can not describe the words. Paul Verhoeven brilliantly paid tribute to this film by Dorothy Malone acting Sharon Stone as an inspirational gurus killer in his Basic Instinct. What a great joke! The film is, however, hilarious, rivet, camouflaged, sharp, trashy, striking, and eye-wavy! It's definitely the grandfather of every heavy and small soap on the screen, but none of them has had a great style as you'll see here: work on the camera is smooth and polished, color use takes away breath, opening the installation set to the title track is out of memory, one-dimensional the characters are unforgettable, and the final image will scratch your head so that the final cut will be censored! While most older, high-profile films can sometimes be a boring job to sit, written in the wind contain so much and go so fast that it's actually a shame when it's over. Thank you Sir Sirk in the craft - and Todd Haines to attract attention - what has now become one of my favorite films of all time! SEE THIS MOVIE !!!
