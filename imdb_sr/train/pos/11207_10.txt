This documentary has been nominated for an Oscar and is easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it's a pretty impressive job. Why is not the mystery of the Disease just explained? It's good to use live tape and animation in tandem. It used to function as part of the "Vault Disnei" every few months, but I did not see it for quite a long time. * Sigh * Recommended.
