This is an old-fashioned, beautifully entertaining children's movie with the safest, most attractive beginner witch ever. Unlike many modern stories that enjoy the dark witch, this is just a magical story of a hocus experiment that is cute, hearty and charming. Peppering Eie, where three children from Cockney, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rollins, were evacuated from the dangers of World War II air strikes. They are wrongly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who study at the correspondence course to become a witch. Eglantine and a trio of children use a magic bed cap to travel to London on their flying bed. Here they meet with Emilius Brovne, the fake director of the magician's study of Miss Price Price-list. Ms. Price decided to work on spells that were designed to revive non-living objects. In the meantime, they also have to deal with a dubious character called Bookman and his associate, Svinburne. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Brovna, the director of the dead magician's school, who has now turned into a street magician. This actor previously acted as a child's father in the movie Mari Poppins. In fact, this film is a story that resembles earlier Mari Poppins, both fantastic fantasy stories for kids. Perhaps this film does not have as much memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it can boast some appealing little tunes. Some were critical, but the film has excellent special effects. All in all, the story is a fascinating family party. It is a pity that modern children are too sophisticated for this beautiful and enchanting story, which should attract a child in all of us.
