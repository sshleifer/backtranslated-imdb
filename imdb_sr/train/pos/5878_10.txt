Garam Masala is one of the most entertaining films I've been watching since ancient times. Akshai Kumar is great as a female worker with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. John Abraham is sometimes fun, and that's one of his best works so far. Paresh Ravail is as good as usual in most of his films. Director Priiadarshan has in the past delivered big movies. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are some of the best. Garam Masala is his most entertaining film that he recorded. Three new actresses are average. Rimi Sen does not have much room in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priiadarshan made a movie with a simple story about a guy who had an affair with 3 girls at the same time. All three girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house. Equipped with a multitude of laughter, this is one Non Stop Entertainer.
