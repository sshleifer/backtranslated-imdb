So, the first few seasons took some time to get started in the way of special effects, but from the very beginning, Hidden Frontier consistently gave good stories and performances, and they were always ready for the mistakes they made. They advise people to first see new episodes, so they can see how much the show is good, and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. Actors have fantastic friendship and it is displayed on the screen. The influx of guest actors who are stamped on the show and with fans also confirms on the shov, because the stories turn from strength to strength. The show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression, drug addiction and major homosexuality - and maybe several people misjudged it, but that's what Star Trek is. She displays these stories in a smart and emotional way, confronting them subtly and smoothly. Yes, they used some characters from Trek history, but they made them - characters such as Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, who were fairly underutilized in the show, had a re-birth in the books of Nev Frontier, but lost their tantrums after someone time, when Peter David is more in comparison to wild fantasy than serious science-fiction, and HF shows these characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. The site also allows fans to communicate with rooms and forums and can meet people involved. They play bloopers for each episode so that fans can see how they laugh, because they are people who do it at leisure, with a commitment that would make many professional actors shocked! What this series, which now ends after 7 years, has reached such a limited amount of resources is nothing more than unbelievable - bringing people together, inspiring others to do the same. The HF will live a long time after it is finished, as long as people continue to enjoy what has begun.
