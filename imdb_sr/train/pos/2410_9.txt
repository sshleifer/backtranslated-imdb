This film is one of the most provocative Jesus films I've ever seen. She does not try to tell the whole story, but only to show the interpretative expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is gloomy, playful and seriously faithful to the elements of Jewish tradition and the contemporary interpretation of the letter. Judas are much more common than other portraits, not the dark and evil evil that we sometimes imagine, but the grossly wrong man, terribly wrong in his zeal. Jesus Christ the Saranden is playful and serious, faithful and dedicated - very human, and also divine. The final dialogue is deliberately made and serves as a sort of little conversation that two powerful men could do when they just committed the crime. I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
