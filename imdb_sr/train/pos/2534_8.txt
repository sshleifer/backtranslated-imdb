A scientist who works hard in isolation finds a way to find an impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. All (pseudo) sciences and breakthrough technological talks from the 1930s are right here, including the idea that radioactivity can cure any disease if properly used. When he calls his rivals - who have kicked him out of the scientific community and laughed - to testify to his discovery, they propose a "joint" expedition to Africa ... of course, at the end of the theft of dr. Rukh's original discovery, giving him only the remaining loan. In addition, a feminized slut who looks like an actor in the comedy Abbot & Costello (Lavton) literally steals dr. Rukh's young trophy wife (Drake), who falls over his head for that piece of human being. Growing horns like a deer did not want to make dr. Rukh (Karloff) was more comfortable, so he embarked on a secret vengeance mission ... killing two of his enemies and friendly dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who helped him ... finally succumbed to lethal radiation that allowed him to venture into revenge to begin with, but (to my greatest dissatisfaction) saves the adulterer and this poor excuse for the human to marry. The acting is generally good, Karloff & Lugosi is very good. Check the hysterical scene of the servant ... Other characters are not worth the ... Recommended, like all the old universal horrors ...
