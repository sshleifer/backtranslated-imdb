No Strings Supplied Capabilities Carlos Mencia is working on a stand-up that smiles and thinks us. Not only is raping racial questions (as many claim to hate), but it also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women think when they say they want to be treated equally ... why Americans are crazy from Arab terrorists ... why no one should pray for the pope - and what he hopes to do in the sky ... the theory of how the tradition of Easter began (aka the Great Ascension on the day of Jesus) watching the film Passion of Christ - and his subsection argument with a woman about whether or not he was hit by Jesus ... how society should be treated It's physically handicapped by people ... and even if you have the right to say a joke. Also, he never stops reminding us that each of us has a voice. So, we should use it to tell the truth, to say what we think and not to be afraid if others offend. Carlos is a bomb.
