The Zu legend, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think that many of the people who did not like it do not see the background behind the mythology behind the film. They were expecting something similar to Star Wars, and that was not the case. I believe that Joseph Campbell would love this film. There was a large number of metaphors and hidden meanings that the average viewer might have overlooked. We all have mountain swords in us. We all need to get into our cave blood somewhere in our lives. We all have to face one day with our own insomnia. A certain portion of the narration was a bit confusing, and some of the actions were sometimes a little hockey, but I think the other points of the movie were easily compensated. I would watch again. I do not know if there is a difference between the Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Varriors (version called USA). audience, which would really distract from this film.
