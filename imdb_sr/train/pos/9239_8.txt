As I said in my comment on the first part: These two films are better than most fans of science fiction. The scenario in the second film is not so mobile as we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but the consequences, thousands of refugees fleeing in small space conserves, protected only by one powerful spacecraft. But when the Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story gets warm, carrying the battle back to Cilone Planet. Okay, there's a little Mad Mak, because everything that fights is fuel for their spaceships to travel to find the distant Earth, but it works for me. It's an exciting fun of Science Fiction with fine actors and decent special effects (although they are repeated, at least :-)). I would like to continue with Starbuck and Apollo on board, the board. Instead, we got a second sequel without the name of the characters who proved that the story was working before, especially since the characters were so well selected ... So the 1980 production thumb , but a thumb for two films from 1978.
