Rohmer returned to their historical drama in the true story of Grace Elliot, Englezkinji that remained in France during the peak of the French Revolution. I always suspected that Rohmer conservative, but he knew that he was so crvenokrvni reactionary. If you can set aside Rohmer's intransigent defense of monarchy (and it's not easy to do, given the fact that, for example, the French lower classes here as hideous puppets), it is actually an elegant, intelligent and smooth film. In the absence of money for a great cinematic recreation of France from the 18th century, Rohmer instead actors playing against obviously painted cardboard. This is obviously an artificial conceit, but somehow works. A newcomer Lucy Russell manages to make the character of sympathy, which should not be.
