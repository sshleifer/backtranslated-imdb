I could not take my eyes off this movie when it appeared on the cable. Dialogues and costumes are best linked to soft-core pornography. In this case, a suitable plot serves as a non-sex vehicle, but for a serial carriage with nuns. (Maybe for sex, but not for Indian television.) Do not be a fan of the genre, I could not put Jeff Vincott, and I did not have any search results. Once Brigitte Nielsen sold her futuristic costume to her sister (so the mayor!) For a tall color to remember from a Beverly Hills II cop, I made her a positive identification. This movie will not suspect you are entertaining every fan of couture in the early nineties or a thief on Paul Verhoeven. Can we add the so-bad-it-good genre tag?
