I never watched this movie and enjoyed the singing and dancing of Cagney and other actors, namely: Dick Povell (Scott Blair), who had a big tenor voice and Rubi Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagnei plays the role of Chester Kent who writes musicals and ultimately enters the production of Prolog, which is featured in feature films shown in films during the 1930s. Chester has problems with people who are trying to steal his ideas for his performances. This is a very fun film with lots of comedy and a lot of laughter. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) provided a great supporting role, which was also very young and beautiful. Dick Povell was great as a singer and dancer and has just begun with his long and successful career. Enjoy.
