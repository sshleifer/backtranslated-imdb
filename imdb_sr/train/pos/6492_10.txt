I'm not a good writer, so I'll keep this brief. The World War II is the best documentary from World War II that I saw. I saw different World War II documentaries (not only English / North American) and this documentary looks like the most complete documentary from World War II I saw. I think it might be a little more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but it works very well to cover the war. It seems to be completely and objectively / fair to everyone. It does not exaggerate or reduce the role of different nations. There are many original shots, including color shots and many eyewitnesses (it was made in the 70's when there were many more alive). He has great music and narrator. All-in-All I gave to this 10/10, because it's so good. (I did not see specials in the DVD version so I can not comment on them)
