Tony Scott can make good movies and bad, personally I think it can be a bit colorful and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with his rather famous brother, but this is probably his best film. What makes this movie so great is that Scott gives Denzel (in a terrible form, better than Training Day) and the revelation that Dakota Fanning's time has developed a relationship of true warmth and tenderness. The set is absolutely not boring, although it takes time - it includes, and takes us on a little journey to characters - including a great role for Radhu Mitchell as a mother. All this serves to make the action much more efficient, because we are so invested in characters, for all their obvious weaknesses. This movie has you on the edge of the whole, and in the end you do not even move. The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why it seems to have such a role, when it's quite clear that it's as good as almost every leading man there (I can only think of one, Daniel Dan Levis, who has more power on the screen these days). This film should have been enormous, given its status and the power of its performance and the quality of the film. It only shows that if the studio does not support the film on the ball, it ends up on the video. I wish I had the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
