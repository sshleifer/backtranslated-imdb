The first time I saw this movie when I was a kid, I immediately fell in love with him. The sets are breathless, and some of the scenarios are very fun: "You are sons of a thousand fleas." about 3 o'clock in the morning and it just started. TV companies should show a little more respect and put it at a time of impact on Sunday, so everyone can get the chance to see this fine job. 10/10
