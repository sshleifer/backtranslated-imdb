Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, fun and talented, dark and demonic. I read the second 'comment' in this show, as well as messages on the board and people just do not understand it. Nothing appearing on T.V. It's not a coincidence. Too much money, time and work have been put into the production of TV shows to make mistakes. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted to be stupid. This show is underage because Sarah wanted to be underage. I thought jokes were great, and the thematic show, like other music numbers, was beautifully bizarre. It's a lot like the Pee-Vee Plaihouse for the uncomfortable, crazed adhesive beauty that snows, the Future Pornstars of America from the valley. The actors are brilliant. Scenarios and actions are well-timed. I hope this show will succeed after Comedi Central did not allow David Shiloh to keep his performance. Who plays Sarah's sister? She is not on the list of actors on the title page of the show. I'd like to see her. Does anyone know about her upcoming dates or DVDs that might hover around?
