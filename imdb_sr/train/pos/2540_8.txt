Although not as well known as some of their other collaborations (such as THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), this is a bitch's little horor film, although the casting decisions were a little strange. Boris Karlof plays dr. Janos Rukha, a strange scientist living in the Carpathian Mountains - near the place where the character Drakule is located. White Lugosi plays dr. Benetea - whose nationality has never been discussed, although the name certainly sounds like French. I really think it would make sense to have two roles, because the Carpathian role seems appropriate for Lugosia - especially with his emphasis. However, despite this unusual turn, the two of them continued to do great jobs. Karloff was definitely the main role, but Lugoshi was well forgiven as a relatively normal person - something he did not often play in films !! It seems that dr. Rukh somewhat pariah, like other scientists (especially Benet) think his theories are bizarre and meaningless. However, during the film, Rukh turns out to be right and Benet is particularly generous in his new praise for Rukh. But, unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh has discovered has a nasty side effect turning him into a crazy machine for killing (do not you hate when that happens?). Although this could only be a simple fine scientist who had a crazy story, the plot was well-constructed, the characters developed nicely and crazy Ruk was not a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting. Film will surely enjoy everyone except for people who hate old horror films. You can really say that Universal Pictures took out all the breaks and made a bigger budget movie instead of cheap rapids as Lugosi and Karloff unfortunately followed in later years. Good thing.
