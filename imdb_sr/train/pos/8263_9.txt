This film, together with VESTFRONT 1918, are my favorite Pabst-directed films and I enjoyed in them more than many of his famous films featuring Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA's BOKS). This is probably because both are very similar to neo-realistic films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style movie has called for the use of non-actors (typical people only) in everyday settings to create intense and realistic films. In this case, the film talks about French and German coal miners, so in an appropriate way, people in roles look like miners - not as actors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the French-German border. Instead of one large mine, it was divided at the border, and German workers were not welcome in the French mine, although there was more unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (beautifully illustrated on the dance floor scene) and the First World War, are shaped to create a huge split between the factions - resulting in the MI mentality. Later, the explosion caused a huge collapse in France, and the Germans refused to sit and do nothing. By risking their own lives, they prove that there is a genuine difference between miners and men in general. The film is a powerful critique of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to instill the German audience to see the futility of war and hatred. It was a great moving movie with some of the most horrifying and claustrophobic images I've ever seen. However, given the history, the impact of the film was at best minimal. It's a real shame, like this, VESTFRONT 1918, JAACCUSE (GANCE) and ALL THE WALK IN THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony, but in the end there were failures in the positive swing of public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, it is an incredible and sad relic that is worth seeing.
