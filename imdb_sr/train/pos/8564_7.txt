I do not expect this film to be understood by spectators from Romania. This speaks of something that is certain, or perhaps about the lack of universality of the film, but also tells us about how different history is, and even the life of ordinary people in Romania, compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. The film is an adaptation of the novel Marina Prede, a controversial writer who died during communist rule, shortly after the book was published. She tells the story of an intellectual, a professor of philosophy whose life was broken after being imprisoned for false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era. Basically, the first part of the film talks about his struggle for survival in prison, the other describes his provocacy to regain his life after he was released. Indeed, only his release is apparent. Romania is seeking different types of compromise and crime in the 1960s, but his struggle for survival is tough as well as in prison. The film was greatly influenced by the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who has a lead role at some other time and in the second place as a mega-star, here we can get a good insight into his incredible acting art. Although suffering from reckless storytelling and sometimes falling into irrelevant details or comics, the film is still an important landmark for Romanian cinema, as well as for the process of recovering moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
