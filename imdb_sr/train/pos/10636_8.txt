This story is a complex and wonderful story about the last harem of the Ottoman Empire, well told and challenging to see the inner action of the world that has now disappeared, and learn about the people who lived there. I enjoy stories, characters, acting and scenes. Several scenes that suffered rapid changes, and the subtitles sometimes disappeared too fast, otherwise a wonderful piece. The main character of Safiie is a wonderful game by Marie Gillain, whom I can gladly say has done a fantastic job without overthrowing it. The scenes with her and Alec Descas (Nadir) are charming and lovable. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to look somewhat less holistic and more authentic in the world that mimic.
