Today I went back to see Rivers and Tides. It's the second time in two days and that, I watch movies I love as many times as necessary. Yesterday I was amazed by the brightness of the images and Goldsvorthi's works. I got # 29 The Abismal (Water) this morning when I dropped coins. Goldsvorthi has an affinity for water, hence the title. I got the fifth line that moved to the # 7 Army. Blake Art is war. Anyway, I knew I had to look at the movie again. I read one of several reviews that passed Online from the SF examiner. The critic loved the film, but said that Goldsworthy's comments bothered him in his filming. I'd rather have only pictures and a wonderful sound record. So I was aware of it while I watched the other way. Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andrew Goldsworthy as the King of the World. Well, today I could just get out of the picture a bit and listen to what he had to say. Can I enjoy the movie without his comments? What he does, what he says goes beyond "art." His understanding of the Waters, Times, Stone, Changes, continued to lead me to believe that the man was a reincarnation of Lao Tsu or an Avatar. Some of his works / words are female. His knowledge ... In any case, the film is only (apparently) shown here in the Bay Area. Be a trendsetter. Go to your local cinema and tell them, do not insist on having to book the movie you heard from the hinterland. It's called rivers and tides. <br /> <br />
