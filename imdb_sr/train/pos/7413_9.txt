The shower is kept in a lot of ways. Almost the whole film takes place in an old bath, and the inhabitants supply humor, pathos and emotional touches. Love and friendship between the owner and his retarded son is deep and moving. The way the older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems unreasonable and convincing. The action is winding, full of surprises and irony, and is totally touched by the feeling of what I would call the neighboring relationships and conflicts of the performer. This is a movie I pull when I want to believe in the world again.
