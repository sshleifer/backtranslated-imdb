This is the best movie I've ever seen. I saw a movie on Dutch television sometime in 1988 (?). This month, they showed a Yugoslav movie every Sunday evening. Next week was another great movie (which included a train, not a bus) whose name I do not remember. If you know, please let me know! Anyway, how can I see this movie again ???? DVD of this movie, where? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl Next week there was another great movie (which included a train, not a bus) whose name I do not remember.
