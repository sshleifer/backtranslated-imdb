Eddie Murphi plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who dedicates his time to finding lost children. When beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Levis} enters his life, she tells him that he is chosen and has to find the Golden Child. Skeptical and guided by pure lust and intrigue, Jarrell intertwines without understanding that he will embark on a fantastic journey, which includes the danger of the worst of all, the demon of Sarda Numsp. the product of my time? I think Eddie Murphi and the popularity of The Golden Child exclusively for the audience of the late eighties? Because I clearly remember how much this movie was entertained by folk in that decade, it was $ 79,817,937, making it the 8th largest earnings in 1986, but since the 80s it has faded away from the memory that Eddie Murphy's painting turned down the comedy that was in fact they used to. The golden child is unwilling to accept Murphy's 80s photographs, such as the merchant outlets and a Beverly Hills cop, but after I recently looked at the movie, I personally think that Murphy is in his wise, innocent and charming best! Seriously! > Bringing on the formula of fantasy action Raised Of The Lost Ark Raised In 1981, The Golden Child hit all the necessary genre buttons. A beautiful girl, a brave hero with a barbecue in her armory, a horrible criminal {Charles Dance so that I can kiss her English alone, a beautiful color and a sweet child with mystical powers, the movie just asks you to get involved in the party, not to dissect and turn away value as a skull figure. Yes, the CGI demon now looks staggered, and the genre was much better in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the shameful rating of 5 here on this site, you might be taking too much of this genre. Seriously, seriously. 7/10
