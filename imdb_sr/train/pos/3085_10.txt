I watched non-broadcast episodes on the internet and I was so sad that the series would not come back. She had the best actors of mature, talented actors and incredible chemistry. It seemed as though all actors were personal friends in real life. At the end of the show they became interesting, sexy and very visible. Of course, some of the stories are not realistic, so what ... The characters are all nice and you are enthusiastic about them. The performance reminded me of the cross between two other favorites: "Sek and the Citi" and "Felicity". Great honor to all actors. Note for ABC Execs: Nielsen Rating Reports do not show true results. Audiences will mostly record. I was very disappointed with the big networks that overwhelmed us with TV with reality or oriented shows. Why get mature, thoughtful, well-functioning material that we need to switch to HBO or FKS? I can only thank the network to make the rest of the episodes available online. New stream media are gaining popularity among viewers.
