I thought that the film was pretty well made for a film made for TV, and it contains a lot of action and humor. I found a fun value worth watching, and I looked at it again or a similar performance. I'm disappointed that Sean was not assigned here to IMDb. I can see the possibility of a series of actions based on this concept or the sequel to Sean, which again plays for even greater "cash" roles, because his life was already on the line anyway. I felt that Sean played the role very well, and he reminds me of an actor named Matthev Ashford who plays Jack Deverauk in the Days of Our Life - Soap Opera.
