Damsel and Distress is delighted by the great Gershwin's songs, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and great support led by Gracie Allen and George Burns. Typically stupid plot for the Astaire movie as an American dance star in England with Burns as his publicist and Allen as a secretary. They invent a story of his love as bugs with women who have become victims of the left and right. He bumped into Fontaine who held the dominant aunt and obedient father in prison. Silli plot. Great songs include Day Fog, things look up, a good job if you can get it, and now I can not be worried. Fontaine does not sings, but has a short (and decent) number with Astaire. Amazingly good in several dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen, including inventive and entertaining fun through the amusement park. like Albert), Rai Noble and my favorite - Jan Duggan as the main singer of madrigal. Jan Duggan is in the middle of a stupid trio that sings a nice piece if you can get it. Her facial expressions are hilarious. She was also the thief of the scene in V.C. Comedy Fields, The Old Fashioned Vai, playing Kleopatra Pepperdai. Many abuses have accumulated on this film due to the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as mentioned elsewhere, would be terribly wrong. The TCM host notes that Rubi Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Iikes. Two more disasters. Fontaine is as good as Alice, and the dynamics allow music numbers to belong to Astaire, with a wide comic relief from Burns and Allen. !
