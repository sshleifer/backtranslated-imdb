Paul Reiser has made a spectacular job in writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the results of his life. Worthy is the Oscar. This was one of the most notorious and funniest films of the year. Reiser is fantastic and he is as good as he gets and as he was in his long TV sitcom "Mad About You". Peter Falk has done a masterful job as his father, and Peter, now 78, is a young man who laughed and cried at the same time. The support was the same as the task, especially the beautiful Elizabeth Perkins. It's a movie that needs to be looked at in 2005. Let's bet that everyone in all ages and religions will love this movie and in some way be kind to him. In the film we have mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters. We all had good and bad times together and we wanted things to be the same, but different.
