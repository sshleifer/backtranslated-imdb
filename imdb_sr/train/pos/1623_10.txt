This is a cartoon that was supposed to win instead of Countri Cousin. Visually well done and much more fun and unforgettable. It's Worth Watching Only for Music! Although there are elements that will undoubtedly bruise the sensibility of some of these days, the cartoon must get a little perspective. He is over sixty years old and, after all, it's just a cartoon. I am disabled, and if I were as sensitive as people who watch things like this cartoon and take a bum, I would long ago get skewed in fetal position and fade away. Sometimes you need to light up, restore your head and float! The cartoons of celebrities in cartoons were common in the thirties and forties and were almost never flattered. Bing Crosby allegedly hated him when he was used more than once. * SIGH *
