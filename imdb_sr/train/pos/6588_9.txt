After looking at several episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that television producers were completely devoid of any originality. Here is the old stand-up of science fiction, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and still just - almost - make it work. Male actors are quite skillful in their professions. Most characters are well drawn, with special honor for the hero and his more than a nice hit. And most episode episodes appear as delicious. Then what could be wrong? What about the female characters and the cosmetic perfect actors who are chosen to show them. Manufacturers insist on showing female characters in this - almost good - series, in a way that makes the ultimate product look like a misplaced cheerleader. Why, I ask, why? All episodes fall whenever a woman visiting a star or a repetitive figure appears on the screen. These actors are absolutely incredible in their roles, and you actually do not have to see them knowing they are incompetent for their acting tasks. A blind person could say. Just listen to them talking. They deliver their dialogue with their drama and the effect of sixteen-year-olds at the graduation matura. Who would believe that these women are a doctor of science, senators, corporate leaders, and doctors of medicine? to choose - every time? And of course, the series suffers from that. A pity!
