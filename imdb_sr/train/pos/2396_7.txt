This is a very funny movie that follows the process of Macbeth production in New York. Although there is much to say about power, jealousy and ambition (the Macbeth theme) in our modern world, the film works best when it's not taken too seriously. Recognizable actors like John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansburi are doing good roles, but for me the highlight was a hilarious scene in which the "murder" of Bankuo (John Elsen) was practiced. Probably a funny movie for those who deal with the theater, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this film.
