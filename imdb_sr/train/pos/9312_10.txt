I like to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes of the raptors. I love the predators because they are terrifying. My favorite parts are those in which the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of the scene of Friday 13th film with a girl who eats a banana. I really like to watch a lot of this movie because computer graphics seem fake, but that's fine, because once you enter the movie you barely notice what's happening and I think it has a good end, even though I'm not really I understand what's going on in my first couple of reviews I've understood over time and it's an important part. Another important part is how much dinosaurs are terrifying, if you look at it for the first time. THIS IS THE BEST FILM.
