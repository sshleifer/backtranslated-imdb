I and my sister saw the prime minister last night ... it was so good that we were glued to the whole thing .. hahaha..and I think I'm hooked for the season !! .... they have some really good actors in this thing .. the guy from the head coach and the player who loves Pete were very good and complicated already, but I do not understand how he will keep it stretched throughout the season .. it will probably be some big tweet tho..and I can not wait until Tuesday .. finally Jeremi sampter who is he? I can say it will be great !! he was so good that we fell in love immediately with his character ... I can not wait for the next episode .. GO Jeremy! Aimee
