"To Deso ka den" is the first colored film by Akira Kurosawa, and it is surprisingly not about samurai, ronin, warriors or battlefields. It is located in a very poor community in the poor neighborhood of Tokyo, where residents are homeless, beggar, tramp, abused women, losers. I do not know why Kurosava chose this tragic topic and environment to put in colors, but they are really very sad stories, some of which are hearts. I personally love the touching story of a boy and his father who dreams of their house and what they built; the story of a retarded boy who believes to ride a train; a story about a man who raises five children like their sons and daughters; and the story of a young woman who was abused by her stepfather. My voice is nine. Title (Brazil): "Anxious? About Caminho da Vida" ("Anxious? Way of Life")
