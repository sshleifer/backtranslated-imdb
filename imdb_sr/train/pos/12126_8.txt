Bette Davis turns into a cool fun show like Mildred Rogers in this 1934 movie. The film seems pretty dated in 2003. There is no doubt that it's worth watching the film lovers and fans of Bette Davis, but may not have that much attraction for the average viewer of the film today. It was amazing to see how young Mrs. Davis looks in this move. Actors turn into performances that are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard acted well as Philip Carey, a club student. This is a movie with a strong message about whom we choose and why. However, it seems that "Of Human Bondage" did not have a strong influence on me mentally or emotionally. I felt uninteresting and separate from the film after I looked at him. I have an intuition that this may be a reaction to which the director went. You are a judge! <br /> <br />
