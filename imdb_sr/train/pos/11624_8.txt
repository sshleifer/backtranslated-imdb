The Red Eye, a movie he wanted to see for a while ... Cillian Murphi plays Jack the Ripper as the managerial position for the Assassins, and his literary killer plans to overturn a highly profiled man and his family. /> Everyday woman "Lisa" (I think) is a normal woman, goes to work, home ... worries ... she hates flying. The death of her grandmother sends her to a flight that is delayed several times. The flight in which he meets Jack ... an ordinary seeming guy, until he discovers his profession and plans, which incidentally involve in them, is the Key to Keefe's (sp?) death. She manages to save them ... but almost took the price of her life, Jack is beaten ... Keefs are preserved ... oh what kind of story * laughs * just jokes, the movie is really good, actually the best since last year ... there are small things to pay attention to earlier in the movie that later play a major importance for the movie. .. (feather Frankenstein) I v Few times before they captured all the small jokes and toys ... Must be seen for the fans of the trilera without sex, but there is a slight hint (the scene of the bathroom) ( jack) "Thank you for the bitch" and (female companion) "Ohhh ... it will be ONE of those flights" (the other woman) "Hey, this is not a motel" you get an idea ...
