It's hard to show this movie in several ways. Everything works fine here; Casting, acting, screenplay and cinema are top-notch. For the film's viewer, it's a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. There is a lot of sharp techniques and technical merits for the film critic. There are some tactical mistakes, and as discussed on the boards, the ending lacks realism if it is rigorously formal with the CIA agent training angle. However, I realized that the ending is more mobile because of the fact that Instead of following the pragmatic approach of the CIA, Creasi essentially recognizes his soul Ultiman without considering the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Creasi becomes a superman through his sacrifice, whether it is actually a pragmatic or not. In any case, I appreciated the fact that Creasi frees conventional bourgeois morals and only covers the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice, which in turn results in redemption for both himself and the innocent. In any case, this movie is very worth watching if you are at all attracted to the genre. Excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless casting and solid performance on the board make this top-100 (or better) movie.
