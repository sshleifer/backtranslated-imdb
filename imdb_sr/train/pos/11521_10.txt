The wizards are a wonderful ride from the beginning to the end, thanks largely to the magic generated by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in the last few decades. Like every really fine movie, it's the way in which the theme is redemption and dreaming results. I can not believe this movie is so hard to find - I would buy it on a DVD, but I still did not find a socket.
