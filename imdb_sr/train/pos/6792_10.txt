I remember these games. He was always on the shelves, until one day I decided to try something new to change, and I got this game. I was stunned because it was the first PS1 game I had and which had 4 discs. When I played it, I could not seriously lower the controller. The story of this game is so good and distorted that it's almost as good as Final Fantasy VII story, and it's hard to achieve. When you play the game, you are having so much fun with the characters that it's amazing that it's just a PS1 game, because it feels like a movie. I believe this should be done in the movie. It's a shame that this game is an unheard-of game and hardly anyone has not played or liked it, because it is one of those games ending the shelves, with a 50% sign that is sitting on it, trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those people who always look at those in the end, and try it out, and most of them turn out to be really good. Damn, so I went into Final Fantasy VII, looking at the catalog and finding it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. Legend of Dragoon, is the only game or RPG that is better than most squirrel Enik games, surprisingly. I would not be surprised that it was made of Ekuni's squash, but it did not. It's hard for all the games I play to be better than the Final Fantasy series, or the Dragon Quest series, but this one is. But what really bother me is why it is very little known and is not praised, which should be. The graphics are pretty good for the PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? This is a PS1 man, made in 1999. The story I already mentioned was incredible, almost VII won. The characters are amazing, so engage in them and their actions. Definitely 10 out of 10..
