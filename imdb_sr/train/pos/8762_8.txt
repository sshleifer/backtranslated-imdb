"What would you do?" is a question that will keep you in mind for weeks after you watched Brokedov's emotional palace. You will also be asked whether Alice (Danes) spoke the truth or not - the issue that remained unresolved, and rightly so. This is a particularly good acting and wonderful movie. Although it is slowly slow, its tempo reflects the line of the story - but a lot of the film will keep you on the edge of your seat; wanting to know what's going on. The ending will also let you imagine yourself in the minds of the main characters, who greatly play Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is also praiseworthy.
