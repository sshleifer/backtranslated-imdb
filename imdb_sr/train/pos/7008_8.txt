VOV! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not really a fan of contemporary Italian directors. I usually do not like drama. I'm not a Vill Smith super fan, even when I think he's a very good actor ... but this movie! It's a great movie with such an original script and so good direction and so good acting ... wow ... it's amazing. This movie attracted my attention minute by minute and I did not even like "A search for happiness" (maybe because I did not like actor Vill's son who is a very bad actor as children usually look like all of the born actors, I saw he last night in the "Day when the country stopped," and I confirmed the feeling that Jaden can not act. I do not want to write a spoiler, so I'm not talking about a story, but what I can say is that this film talks about love, death, and other feelings which I do not like to watch in movies .... but This movie is a super super movie. If you have a minimum heart, n you will regret it
