Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who is forced to retire when he is forced to save the life of his brother, Giovanni Ribisi, when he screws up the job, finishing his brother's job in stealing 50 cars in one night. He must merge his old crew, in which he can trust him, to help him do it and get his brother out of the Dutch. But the police caught him, so can he do it? This was one of the great candidates for the film that was supposed to re-create because the Original was far from the classic. And if you do not get into it and expect a lot, and turn the part of thinking into your brain so you can ignore the hole in the plot and just take a movie for what it is. In the end you will enjoy driving. Watch it on a dual account with "Fast and furious" at night speed, just do not take a screw car right after that. My Rating: B - DVD Ektras: 7 minutes Jerry Bruckheimer Interviev; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Overload Action: Highlight Reel; The Big Chase; "0 to 60"; "Vild Rides"; Stars On The Move; Kult "Video"; Theatrical Trailer and Trailer for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coiote Ugli"
