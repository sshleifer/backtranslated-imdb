OK, OK, do not be distorted. I was kidding. "Bustin 'Out" is actually a better and more authentic name of anihoo. Ralphie boi. And he's doing one of his better jobs here. On the front of the crime it shows the truth. They build it, defend it, then so far and stronger rivals cause it (possibly) to lose. Be sure to see for yourself what is happening. Diluted? I do not know. Since Scatman (RIP) and the Love Wave (also RIP) were black and the main point of view, I saw it most as an attack on racism. The fact that Richard Priya liked this is just as good. And younger (before "Miami Vice"), Phil Mike Thomas was surprised. It is an animated film "Blacksploitation". That's a good thing. Well done and well done. There will be some snorting (like a lynx scene), but unfortunately it is based on facts. But Ralphie REALLI should really reconsider this title.
