First, this is really my favorite movie ever. I do not have to give a description to anyone because every ** hole does it. I am literally obsessed with these virtually bleak, seductive, lame effects that have a 'boom-stick showing', a badly decorated, metal-horor masterpiece of the 80's. The director (I heard) was hoping to hit the cashier, so he could make sequels and have the FREDDI / JASON job for himself. Damn, I wish it could fall so! Sound recording magnifier. The acting is good .... CHECK THIS MOFO OUT. and any hardcore fans there, feel free to send an e-mail and talk. Midgetorges .... I can be found in IAHOO.
