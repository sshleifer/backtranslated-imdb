I love these "Babys" diapers! Such a film could not be made today and is rich in film history. It's silly and the movie is made to make you smile, as it is. How did they ever get these kids to "act"? I will never know. I think they are precious and kids laugh at me, but others who have made this film because it shows the naivety that existed in the early thirties. You must remember that this was when the film industry was very young, that the stock market fell, that the world depression started and that these films were made to give people a break from the real world. The fact that you could watch movies for five cents is beyond my understanding, but then it's even 25 cents dinner. It was another time with a completely different mind.
