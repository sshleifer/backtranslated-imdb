I went for a little projection of this film on July 19th, not knowing anything more than the name of several actors and that it was a fantasy / adventure quest of some kind. The plot line is really nothing like I've seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that's currently in or soon in theaters. Despite the first impressions, it's not cheesy, rugged, sticky or funny, and it's really fun and fun. The flow is pretty well made, nothing is hurrying or pulling. Soundtrack, because of the lack of better words, is magical and adds a lot of film, as opposed to simply filling in silence as it often happens in movies or on television. And although I may have known what was coming, I still could not stop watching the screen; As far as I know, no person left the theater during the entire film. My only remark is that it looks like there's almost no marketing for this movie, and so brilliant as it can not figure out why.
