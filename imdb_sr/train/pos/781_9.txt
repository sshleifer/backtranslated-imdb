"Crush" examines a woman's friendship, largely avoiding the quality of saccharin that ruins so many movies of the same theme (for example, "Steel Magnolia"). At the same time, it reveals the power of sudden passion to swim and surprise. The events presented were very incredible, but the emotional truth that basically worked for me was very sincere. It's not a movie for crowd-vehicles and explosions, but adult women will surely respond with laughter and tears.
