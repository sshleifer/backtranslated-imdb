So, I find myself pretty big in anime scene, with very few shows that I simply will not follow. This broadcast, however, would be recommended to everyone. Quite possibly the most original series to date, that's all I could ask for. A side story, so to speak, of unconditional love that will not be accepted, a very open comedy, and a very well-assembled actor's action (both Japanese and American translation). Not because of the hilariously funny aspect, it would be, just another anime. More or less, as I noticed, "I love or hate it", very few people I've seen This series will end with disgust for her. Originally for the core, with everything you can look for in one afternoon, put the house on this series. I'm ready to guarantee you that you will enjoy it.
