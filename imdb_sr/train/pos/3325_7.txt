OK, I would not normally watch Farrell's film. I can not remember that I've ever seen one. I also do not remember seeing Jimmy Fallon's film. Okay, I was looking at a cab, but I said poker and I was forgiven for that mistake. But this film is Drew Barrimore and I just think it's the sweetest thing. I do not know what it's all about, but I just laugh all the time while I watch it. Just loves me so. I mean, I even looked at Adam Sandler just to see her at 50 First Dates. How is it sad? This was not the best baseball movie - it should not have been. It was a love story about a sad puppy who kept the only thing that never betrayed him until he found something for which it was worth it. He had a predictable ending, but there was so much on the way to pay off.
