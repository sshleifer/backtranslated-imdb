This is one of my favorite family movies. I loved when I was little and still keeps me in my arms when I'm older. I still laugh at all the same old jokes and maybe even shed tears. I never really care about talking to animals, or at least for those who are animated in the UN, but I'll be sorry for this. It's a pretty old movie, but it will always have a place in my heart. There are no other live animal films that I can remember at this time with which I can even compare myself, let alone like this one. Perhaps I give too much praise to this movie, but I do not think it's showing up. I really keep that big message that "the home is where the heart is." Or at least the message I received from her. It is definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.
