This film is about the side of Ireland that Americans do not usually see, the narrow-minded, religiously prejudiced side of the 'friendly race in the world'. The film, following the recognition of Fethard residents who are old enough to remember the events, is fairly accurate (although they insist that filmmakers have invented some of the violent scenes just to spice up the action). The film was very unpopular in Ireland because it showed the Catholic Church in bad light, but the fact that representatives of the Catholic Church * organized a veto of a minority (before the Protestants were Jews). The film is a fascinating insight into the whole topic of religion in Ireland
