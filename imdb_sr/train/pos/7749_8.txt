This movie hits you. This debut film by Tom Barman (known from the Belgian rock band dEUS) introduces you to 8 intriguing people who build blocks of fantastic movie mosaics. Each of them survives one day and one night in the Antwerp metropolis. Barman enriches his characters with great faith and competently intertwines their individual stories, a tour of power that resembles the best works by Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The color of the anecdote is surprising, running, entertaining; Dialogues are so natural, they seem to be improvised. Some great performances by Matthias Schoenert, Natalie Broods and the extremely funny duo from Gent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Louvick himself is an unforgettable "Windman", a bizarre guy who dances through the movie. Sam is also responsible for the stunning choreography, and, of course, Tom Barman himself has taken care of ultra cool Sound Track. We were seriously impressed: Ani Vai The Vind Blovs is a movie that takes your feet away.
