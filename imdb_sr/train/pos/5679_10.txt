After the success of the second part, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder had a third appearance. This time, instead of Tudor time or Elizabethan time, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rovan Atkinson) lives in the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now dumb but cute Baldrick (Tony Robinson), Blackadder is a "faithful" butler to George, Prince's regent Wales (Hugh Laurie). Through this third series of wonderfully written sitcom Blackadder is trying everything that can be enriched and made powerful. He tries to choose a mistress for a broken municipality, tries to sell the book, tries to get a bet for Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a man on the highway and finally presents himself as a prince. This is a very good sequel to the popular comedy. Includes performances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerney, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Friy. He won BAFTA for Best Comedy, and was nominated for Best Design and Best Make Up. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on the 50 greatest British actors, he was number 24 on comedians, and he was No. 8 at his favorite British comedian. The greatest characters in the comedy world, and Blackadder (all four series) is No. 2 in the British Best Sitcom. Outstanding!
