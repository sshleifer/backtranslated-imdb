I understand that this review will be broken by critics who patrol this place, but I will defend this film. The dentist is actually a good movie. The acting is not always top-notch, but excitement is good and the story is good. Plus, you see Linda Hofman's Tits. It's not that I'm an expert in this field, but the direction looks good and the plot makes sense. Corbin makes a great dentist. Dentists do what Javs does to sharks ... ish. Obviously, he had a pretty limited budget, but they did what they could well, and they developed well the characters (those who count). Ends.
