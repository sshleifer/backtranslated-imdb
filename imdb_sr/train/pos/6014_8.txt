All reviews about how much ZP is missing, plot is wooden, orgy scene does not make sense, etc., Everyone misses the main thing. Be honest. This film was made in the stormy times of the late sixties and early 1970s in Los Angeles. It's a movie to be watched while those H-I-G-H are out of your mind on some psychedelic substance. Find some kind of bud and smoke, or you get a mild acid kick. Seriously, these genuine and sober reviews of the ZP miss the point. You can not extract anything from this film in the right sense of the mind. As long as you did not watch this movie on the big screen (I was lucky to do it three times in the 1990s, the ZP was pretty scarce) coming out, you have no idea what this film is about. If you insist that you watch it not stunned, you can at least appreciate the ending when the shit comes to the soundtrack of Pink Floyd's wonderful re-work "Careful Vith That Ake, Eugene", "Come in Number 51, Iour Time is Up. "
