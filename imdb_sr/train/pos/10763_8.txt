I must admit I was very skeptical about this documentary. I expected this to be the kind of American propaganda that we do not like here in Europe. I was wrong. This is NOT a propaganda, in fact, it is not at all political. It's amazing that this documentary has been recorded! This film was originally shot as a document that the rookie NI fireman became a "man". We can only thank film makers that they continued with their work during the terrible temptation they faced. Absolutely stunning material. It is recommended. Sincerely,
