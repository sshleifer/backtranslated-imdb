This movie was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of baseball, but this is a movie that's made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, and so on. Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. were brought with various talented actors and understanding of sports. The action was convincing, and I love the message. Villiam Dear and the guys made a great movie. Most sports movies revolve around true stories or events, and often do not work well. But this film hits 10 on a scale of perfection, although there were also some minor errors there. 10/10
