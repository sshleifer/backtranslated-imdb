Every country that has a working film industry has some sensible (and perhaps some crazy) artists who make films that you can fully understand only when you are part of this country. I suppose Hundstage is such a movie. You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, upset, weird, cold. But they still have enough money to be able to afford upscale cars and big houses. And here are definitely doing many weird things that may seem to them "normal", because they do this all their lives. From a normal human point of view, you can now easily follow the movie and be horrified or fascinated and watch a fine art film in Austria. But if you live here and you know people in which you see the figure of the Hundstage as a tumor of society. A society that is becoming lunatic from day to day, creating its rules that no one else can understand, burns the social system from within. And you see people. Sitting in the park, standing on the opposite corner of the street, waiting in the same line. You may meet them at the bar or discotheque you can visit. You may even work with them in your business or live near your home. You begin to hate them without knowing exactly why. You will try to escape - but you can not. Maybe you'll end up like them. But it seems to be "normal" for you because you do it all your life ... Life is not so clear even though Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. She has wonderful people ... but some are ugly. There are many hardworking people who are trying ... but there are also riding on the back of others and destroying everything the people of Austria have built so far. Very pessimistic film.
