His hollywood Imitator Daitiem Soap is at its best! It's a party we never see. Great characters and big lines. Vhoopi is hilarious ..... Salli Field is so on the top .... Gary Marshalls lines are mess ... this is what I like about good comedies. I've never been afraid to have fun in myself !!!!!! The sets were great ... the dressing room was in place, and the backstabbing "Montana Morehead" was a devil's pleasure. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but she was great and fun when she was on the screen. I would like to know how the idea for this film came up. I've never seen people have so much fun in comedy! Soapdish had to have and I'm waiting for DVD !!!
