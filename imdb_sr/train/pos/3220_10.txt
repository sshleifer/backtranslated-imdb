A soldier may not have an academic acting or Lucas special effects, but that's definitely working for me. I'm not going to tell you what it's all about, I'm sure you've already read the abstract. This is a great condemned futureistic action / science fiction movie. Kurt Russell does not speak much, he usually has a sullen or drunken expression on his face, but suits the character. There are great actions and scenes of struggle; Some of the scenes are unrealistic, but Hollywood believes that the country must escape from normal life. I did not see Soldier 2, but this one is one of my favorites. I'm happy enough to have a wife who's digging in movies; We both love this film and we recommend it to anyone who likes heavy guys / sci-fi movies.
