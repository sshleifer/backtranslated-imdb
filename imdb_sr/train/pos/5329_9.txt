This movie was great. The operation was absurd. Action sequences have been created. it was a very exciting piece of the combination of Keistone Cops and Lone Ranger. The bad ones were funnier than bad ones. The good guys were not very good. Black actors played normal characters, not black stereotypes. The involvement of the baby has added a good touch. Perhaps the sympathy was a little harder otherwise. I have to disagree about acting. All in all, he was very good. I really wanted to hit Judge Reinhold. And, after all, is not it a sign of a really good movie, who wants to hit Judge Reinhold?
