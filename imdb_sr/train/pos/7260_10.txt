Greetings to all my names Larissa I am 13 years old when I was about 4 years old watching a curly dried up and it had knocked my socks since I was watching this movie for a long time in fact about 30 minutes before I just did seeing it. Alisan Porter is a really good actor and I love this movie It's so funny when dealing with cards. Every time I watch this movie at the end of it I cry, so I said that I know that I am only 13 years old, but its such a touching story is really weird that Alisan is now 25 years old. Every time I watch a movie, somebody is always young and the movie comes out like a year after they've made it and when I watch it and find out how old the person in the movie is really vulnerable they can go from one time to the next. Like Harry Potter. That movie was also great, but Daniel still had about 12 years in the first movie, and I had about 11. And how could he go from 12 to 16 in about 4 years, and I'm only 13 years old. 16 is currently I think it's almost 18, but it's kind of weird when you look at one movie and the next there about 4 years then when they were just 1 in the last. I'm not sure I have big imaginations and I like to revise it. I'm a kind of computer person, but I love to do a lot of things for kids too. I'm as smart as a curly sue in a movie, but one thing I do not like in a movie is when this guy calls the foster home and makes a curly lawsuit taken to kill that guy that he really did it in real life. Well, I will stop writing, sometimes I can write a lot, but children have a lot of things in the head that should go out, and if not, children will never learn. Larissa
