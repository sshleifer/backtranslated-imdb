I recently watched this movie, in the lazy Sunday afternoon, with my friend and we have a lot of fun! This film is a masterpiece of garbage. Try to watch it for this purpose! Of course, it was not expected, but the performances made by actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), poor script and cheap budget created an incredible combination of stupidity. Tomba had just pulled out of the Alpine ski races, where he was the dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships and nine titles in the World Cup. Seriously about the director: no one knows why Damiano Damiani signed this film. All other Damiani instructions are significant.
