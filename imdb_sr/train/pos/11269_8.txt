Have you ever wanted to know how much Hollivood could have been pulled out before the Haies' Code officially came into force? Well, unfortunately, the "Convention Citi" is lost, so you just have to watch "Tarzan and his Mate" to find out. For 1934, there is an exceptional amount of sexual allusions and even exposed flesh. Just look at Jane's naked swimming. Although Tarzan is often regarded as a b-adventure film made for young boys and no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally very grown. More than seventy years later he is still as sexy as when he came out. Beside the envelope that encourages taboo nature, it's a wonderful and exciting adventure story. I always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood released in the thirties and forties, but it's a bit of a genre that I've called great films. "Tarzan and his Mate" is by far the best film of this long-lost subgenre. Seizures of attacks on safari or monkeys or indigenous people still manage to create tension today. Also, the animals are too cold (especially monkeys throwing stones). The show will not soon receive any significant rewards, but certainly more than adequate for this type of image. The film was again stolen from Cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. One of the funniest examples of pre-code Hollivood.
