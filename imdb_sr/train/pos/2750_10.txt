This is a film that America does not do. That's why people rent foreign films. It is a great story about how a person, even if he is retarded, can make a person find the reason in his empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people who are mentally disturbed suffer from their lives and show them in a very realistic way (I think). As a classic in foreign films, this film has a bitter-sweet ending, but it only makes it a better movie.
