Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film by German director Ulli Lomel. He directs, produces and plays in this latest production. Not only did he manage to make a cheap movie. But he reaches a new array when Herr Lommel works in the footage from almost the entire catalog of the film. I saw movie clips from Boogeiman I and II, War Birds, Tenderness of the wolf, brainwaves and cocaine cowboys (even Andi Varhol made a kameya on the other side of the serious courtesy of this film). Although he uses many old recordings, he handles them well (and I could add creatively). The film follows a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. also corresponds with the writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about a serial killer during the late sixties and early seventies. The friend of the writer (David Hess) helps him to try to find this zombie. Can this killer be stopped? Will the writer put two and two together and regain something from his old glory? Is David Hess still a man? You will have to discover yourself and watch the Zodiac killer. This film is NOT about the original Zodiac killer. I also heard people laughing at the fact that this movie is being recorded on the video. So what. The editorial style artistic style surpasses the fact that it was filmed on the video. My only complaint was the overuse of the images from the previous films of Herr Lommel (but I understand why "it hints" ".) Do not believe in a hypo This is a brave and street horror movie. You love this statement. Very recommended for lovers of Ulli Lommel.
