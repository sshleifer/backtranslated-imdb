Love the characters and the story. Very funny with lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great performances. I enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very sympathetic and surprisingly compassionate, burned killer. All three actors are among my favorites and have them in this movie for a special treat. Nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I recommend this film. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Replacement Assassin, L.A. Confidential, Long Kiss, Good Night, Bezdan and, All Nine Jardi ... you'll love this movie.
