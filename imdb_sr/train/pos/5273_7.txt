It was directed by Ruggero Deodato, a real icon for many fans of horror films after being directed by the ingenious and infamous Hollywood Cannibal. However, do not expect to find such a glory in the film that is being considered here because it shows up as incredibly pitiful in comparison and plays more like Conan's inspired exit for a young audience. Such a description can immediately postpone most fans of the entire Conan inspired Svord & Sorcery genre, but before you turn your nose on it, it must be said, this movie is really fun! Mainly plays laughs and shows two great and very sympathetic heroes in the form of David and Peter Pola aka. Barbarian brothers that both look like they have a ball with their characters. B-Movie favorite Richard Linch appears as the main bad guy in a piece, and it's also great to see the roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berriman. Besides, ladies are stunning to watch and appropriately scarce dressed throughout the duration of the films (clip and much welcome ingredient in the genre!) Can I say, - this is really Have fun and carelessly take the genre and I recommend it wholeheartedly!
