This movie is great! He touched my stone cold heart. I could not talk about racial discrimination that Antwone experienced because I live in my own country. I suppose it's really hard to be discriminated against. We watched this movie at Sociology at the University of Nev Era, and I did not know it was the real story, I thought that an intellectual was just created that wants to bring fresh air to the industry. That's very good. The part that shocked me was when Nadine sexually abused Antwone (who was only six years old). If I were on his shoes, I could skip a tall building of ten floors. I salute him because he was so strong! The scene that touched me here was when Antwone finally saw his mother Eu face to face. He did not bite her, but told her about the achievements he had received in the long years that they were separated. (I think I'll do it when I get a chance to find my roots.)
