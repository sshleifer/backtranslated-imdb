This is an excellent example of early talent Bette Davis. Production is above the average for the timeline in 1936. I can not understand why the copyright owners did not put this movie on DVD. The owners, please, let them go. I'd buy it right away. I have not seen him for more than thirty years, on television, but I remember well.
