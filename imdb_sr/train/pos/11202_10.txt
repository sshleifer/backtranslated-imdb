At first I thought the Ring would be more than a normal movie with its usual complication. How I was surprised! Of course, the plot is simple - one girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings us on a silver plate, with laughter and fear, with compassion and pain. The way in which it shows the popular crowd of the fair, the power of the girl's attraction to both men, the tragic elements that come along with the techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest films (North of the Northwest, rope, etc.). The teacher did this perfectly well before the thirties!
