Metro-Goldwin-Maier is a very lost player on the market of short cartoons. This market is essentially dominated by Loonei Tunes and Merri Melodies, which come from Varner Bros.. MGM is also able to publish hidden gems, such as "To Spring", a stunning story of the most beautiful season. /> In the vicinity shown here, spring is not caused by natural cycles, it is already invented. And from whom? Small male elves living below the ground. Every spring, when the snow begins to melt, they begin to work.

In other words, spring! In the first half of the drawing, a fiction of spring is shown, but the other part is slightly different. The old man Winter returns and tries to prolong the winter by destroying the work of the elephant. So, from this moment on, we help in the battle between the elf and the Old Winters.

This is just a fantasy, Giorgio! Animations are also a delight. Colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown in a massive, epic environment. The very concept is brilliant. The elves attract characters like the Old Man Winner, which effectively shows the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season. There is also a strong message. The battle is eventually lost for the elves, until one late elder comes into action and leads to the victory of the elf over the winter. The point is that only one person can make a difference. In conclusion, "For Spring" is a remarkable lost classic of short caricature. What's even more important is that the director of this cartoon debut here. And who is the director of "To Spring"? It's a certain Villiam Hanna ...
