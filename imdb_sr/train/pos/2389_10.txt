I work with children from 0 ?? 6 years and everyone likes Doodlebopse. Doodlebops are energetic, lively and attractive. Once they start singing, "We're Doodlebops We're Doodlebops We're Doodlebops Oh I'm sorry Come and join the party because we laugh and sing all day" It's almost impossible not to join them Doodlebops brings the viewer into the world of colors and fun, each the show is an adventure, Doodlebops does not try to change the world with fun messages all they do is to have fun while solving the everyday life challenges that the child Doodlebops is a refreshing, high action alternative to regular children's television programs.
