Pioneering Technicolor Cinema (the Oscar winner for special technical achievements) is truly enchanting. Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boier, and you have a pretty nice "picture". Unfortunately, the fictitious plot, as well as the excessive blistering effect, leaves much to be desired. However, before this film (1936) there were no more stunning Technicolor films, and since then there have been very few of them, which can surpass this visual experience of stunning colors. Movie lovers who enjoyed the magnificent color of Robin Hood (1938), Jesse James (1939) and "Spook with the Wind" (1939), will not be disappointed with the fantastic work that is done here. "Allah's Garden" will always be synonymous with a great color cinema.
