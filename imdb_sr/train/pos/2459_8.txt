A beautiful and touching movie that deserves wider viewing than it is likely to be. Semra Turan plays Aichu, the second generation of a Turkish immigrant, who tries to break through the mold. Not entirely at home with her moderately conservative Muslim family, nor with her liberal Danish friends, Aichino's martial arts experience becomes the struggle to find and have the strength to allow herself to be what she wants to be despite her family and friends. Director Natasha Arthi manages to balance introspection and narrativeness so that it has depth without becoming a difficult philosophical discourse, and drawing on the Xian Gao choreography exercises in the spectacular sequences of the struggle. After all, this film spirit gets a stunning debut performance by Semre Turan. Wide charisma and the necessary skills of martial arts are complemented by the heart to make her drama a credible one. Good value for your time.
