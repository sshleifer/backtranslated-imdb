Smart, persistent, witty, fast, sexy, extravagant, slim, erotic, sincere and crazy, Footlight Parade is a first-class entertainment, which is what's in the movies. Realistic, satirical treatment gives fresh edge material and its pace and delivery lines take away breath. To think that they started to make only characteristic images 7 years ago! The brilliance of the dialogue can not be reconciled even today, especially if one takes into account that "realism" has taken over and captured contemporary cinema. This film was made at a time when Haies's code that restricts content is ignored and the result is a fresh, self-directed, critical and live film that directly spoke to a modern audience suffering from depression and general fear of that era. I recommend watching any movie from that period, that is, 1930-1935, for the vision of what popular cinema can be.
