Rock n 'roll is a messy job and DiG! It demonstrates a masterpiece. The project of a serious ambition, and perhaps recklessness, the filmmaker is able to merge seven turbulent years of tracking two clumsy rock groups. In this regard, an abundance of quality material ensures the ability of the film to fascinate the audience. If you have ever been interested in any field of music industry, this film will undoubtedly be a capture watch. The music in the film, although it suffers from minimal cutting and gluing, is worth the price of the reception. in the morning after I saw DiG! I went straight to the record store to pick up the album Brian Jonestown Massacre (I already started Dandi Varhols sounds). Primarily defined by her rock music exploration, the film thrives on other deeper levels. Dig it! is a sincere and sufficiently objective view of the destructive and unstable nature of the creative process and of people who are trying to counter these forces.
