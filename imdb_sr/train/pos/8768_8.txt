I saw this movie in a cheap section. In fact, I vividly remembered that I had seen commercials and trailers a few years ago. I thought "What is it" and bought it, basically because the shop sounded interesting and Claire Today was always one of the talents in my eyes (that was before I became a big fan of Kate Beckinsale). So, it's about two girls who sneak into a holiday in Bangkok, get caught for drugs (which are innocent) and then go to a Thai prison, and the film follows what will happen to them and occasionally calls into question their innocence. And Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of this film ends unconventionally, and asks some nice questions about moral discussion. I think this is a solid good movie, but there could have been some improvements. It could have been longer ... it would help these figures to be solidified and help them gain greater insight into the Thai justice policy system. <br /> <br Still, besides, it's a good movie with great performance. PS For all you pop-cult drug addicts you will be looking for a two-minute role by Paul Valker. I did not even notice it when I first saw a movie.
