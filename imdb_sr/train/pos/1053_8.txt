The sisters in the law are made by the same directors of the unusually fascinating 'Divorce, Iranian Style' that was exactly what he said, because we received a brief review of the divorce court in Iran. They have now drawn attention to the judicial system in Cameroon, Africa. What is great in this court is that there are 2 Judges of Women, which is unusual for such a country. In any case, they deal with many men who are accustomed to clinging to women, but this film is remarkable in the fact that women appear to have made great strides in society, with recognized legal and women's rights. Thus, judges often punish people to behave in a primitive manner in these times. Not to say that women who appear on the ground receive a softer treatment. One of the main focus of the film is the case of child abuse by aunt. Judges do not waste time in attacking a woman with rage. And who said that justice does not serve anymore? With that 2 behind the bench. They often make maximum fines! And a! You go girl!
