The secret of Furia, in many ways a romantic uncertain drama (directed by Mel Ferrer), has top executives in Colbert and Ryan; it remains confusing, if not quite appealing until the end, when incredulity wins the suspension of disbelief - as it often does in this genre. However, for some viewers, the highlight of the film will be the show of the lean Leah by Vivian Vance - the immortal Ethel Mertz on the film "I Love Lucy". Strangely, Vance had very little film roles; Her real home was Broadway, where (among other performances) she was insufficient for Ethel Merman. Here she contributes to a winning turn as a maiden subordinate to play a lesser role in the dishonor scheme; he watched half-heartedly trying to breathe a smoke when he had fired a secret cigarette at the hotel's flax storage - an offense for which she ultimately pays the ultimate penalty.
