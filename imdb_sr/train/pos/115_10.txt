Part of the subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Undoubtedly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. A Kafka-style story about the impossibility of winning or surviving in the endless strange world. Life is, in this film, only an adaptation exercise. A lesson on boundaries and original sin, the fragility of innocence and mistakes in his paths. Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Trial images and the same blurry woman. And Europe is a symbol of a basic crisis that has many aspects, such as chimeric wars or disagreement in the search for the truth / essence / golden age. War, peace, work or lie are just details of the time of gelatin. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love - a convention. The method of the victim is only for the hope of understanding the painful reality.
