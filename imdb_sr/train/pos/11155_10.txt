Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York thinking they will make a living by being a stallion. He arrives there and quickly finds out that it will not be easy - he goes through a humiliating experience after another. At the end of his rope, he merges with the mutilated, vulnerable Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida. But will it succeed? Very dark, disturbing, but fascinating movie. Director John Schelsinger paints a very dirty portrait of the NIC and its inhabitants. In this way, it was dated - the city may have been so bad in 1969, but it has so far been cleaned up. He also uses every trick of the camera in the book - the color turns into black and white; sequences of dreams; flash forvards; a flash (especially in connection with rape); impact cuts; strange sound effects ... name. Keeps you disoriented and out of the center - but I could not stop watching. There are not many stories - it basically focuses on friendship between Rice and the Bull. There is an implication that they may have been lovers (the final shot shows it). It's just a portrait of two injured characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel, urban jungle. This was originally rated as Ks in 1969 - the only reason MPAA did not think that parents want their children to see this. Nevertheless, it was a big hit for high school students (then Ks meant no one under 17). It was the only film that ever won the X's Best Picture Award. Hoffman and Voight were for acting awards as well as (mysterious) Silvia Miles who was on the picture in total (perhaps) 5 minutes! It was finally dropped to R (without cuts) when it was reissued in 1980. Also in this film, the great song "Everibodi's Talkin" was also presented - and it became a big hit. Br /> Large film --- but very dark. I'm giving it 10. It's not seen on commercial television - it's cut into strips and incomprehensible.
