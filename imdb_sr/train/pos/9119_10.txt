An interesting way of looking at how often, as human beings, we behave, sometimes we are blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that sometimes destroys the foundation of what we are trying to achieve. He also deals with the question of how we ignore those of us who are not so open and we can miss a great opportunity. Injecting comedy also makes watching a movie enjoyable. It must be seen for anyone who is interested in a reflexive, yet comical look at life. I'm looking forward to your next product. I hope you continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Great work ... Joanne
