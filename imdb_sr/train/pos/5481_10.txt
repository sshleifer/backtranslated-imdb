For me, this was more a call for awakening, and the realization that most of everything we see, hear, read and think about everything depends on what the media feeds us. This is a classic example of a high-level physician who is trying to control the masses through controlled information. This is also a great example of how people who have a freely bought constitution will not be corrupted by this media control or by any attempted misinformation. Once again, it shows that at the end of the day, many people actually need to prevail over the needs of a few. It is also enlightening to see that in a country where a religious civil war does not occur, democracy is not really difficult to implement.
