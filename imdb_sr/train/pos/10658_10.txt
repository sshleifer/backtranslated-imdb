The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I remembered all these years because I could not sleep for a week or more after I saw it. It absolutely upset me. I was on a holiday with aunts in Ft. Wort, Texas and I will never forget that. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to watch as an adult. It took a lot of research to find out what the film was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanvick was in it and finally managed to get the name and reviews about it. I enjoyed it a lot, but that made me scared! Yakui
