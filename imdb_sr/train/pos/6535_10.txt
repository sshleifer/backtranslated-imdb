This was a great movie! Although there were only 15 people, including me, it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mom enjoyed it. There were two middle-aged women in the middle of the twenties and seemed to enjoy it. I love the part in which Corky and Ned loved Nancy and love sweet lol. And when he gets his roadster and Ned is there. Yes This was a great movie, even when people were underestimated. Go See I bet you will enjoy !! I really enjoyed my friend too. The people were so fierce in this film and they did not even see it. I bet the next time I will give the opportunity to the movie and the actresses. Everyone did a great job in my opinion. But if you have small children, that's still appropriate. I'll probably take my seven-year-old nephew to watch her.
