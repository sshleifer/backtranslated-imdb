Yes, this gets ten stars. It is clear as the day when this fulfillment is ingenious. The Universe one day sent Trent Harris to a young, strangely strange man, and Harris caught him on a tape, in the real true glory of an unsuitability that you just can not lie. It's a shame that he ended up in a tragedy for a young man, if only an alternative ending can be written for this story. The other two steps in the trilogy speak of the story, and Sean Penn and Crispin Glover play the role of a young man. The world is expanding and unusual is contextualized by reassessment, which gives us a wider insight into the strange growing up in the vanilla of America. Recommended for everyone and everyone!
