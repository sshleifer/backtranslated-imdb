Again, it seems completely illogical, at least for me, that "Arthur" deserves only 6.4 out of 10 possible ones. The one-time masterpiece by Steve Gordon here is completely "incredible" if not quite "impossible" mixing of wildly disparate elements. Having succeeded in making alcoholism ridiculous, but not tragic, is tragic. If he gave Dudley Moore his best role, and every other film element in his optimum impact, including the result, seems to me to be patent and unimportant. I challenge everyone to sit through this film and not laugh loudly. But, apparently, almost a third of her audience succeeded. Well, for example, I found and found Gordon's efforts, both ridiculous and appealing, as well as the similarities of Geraldine Fitzgerald's aunt and Steven Eliot's murderous potential fathers-in-law, the absolute jewels of background characters. Even the black driver managed to escape patronage, and late, ginger Sir John Gielgood was right when he accepted his compensation, but he was wrong in taking over his role. "Arthur" does not bother to "Underztand", and especially rationalizes, the monster "alcoholism" (hey, iFit is not alcohol, these are other medication options, including meth, and addictions are just symptoms, not targets), he simply looks at his own questionnaire.
