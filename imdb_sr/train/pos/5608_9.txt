Of course, it soon became uneven after this film, but from "Night in the Water" to "The Buffer," Roman Polanski could always count on delivering something fascinating and unique. Despite many current issues (alienation, paranoia), none of his films is identical. The story of this is somewhat similar to his "Repulsion" ten years earlier, but the tone is completely different. "The Tenant" manages to balance the darker of the dark absurdity (I'm a little hesitant to call it humor, although the protagonists of bizarre behavior and dialogue were occasionally ridiculous) with some genuinely tense paranoia. Polanski has always been a master in the construction of disarray, and the moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy. The overall strangeness of the film is also a plus. In addition to the exceptional Polanski as usual, the rest of the actors and teams offer a great contribution. Polanski's actor is often in the shadow of the Polanski director, but his performance here really captures his characters of clumsiness and feelings that they were rejected. Topics of social discrimination make this film more than just strange because it is strange. The rest of the actors also offer strong performances, especially the sympathies of Isabelle Adjani, and Melvin Douglas and Shelley Vinters' appropriately boring. "The Tenant" is often underestimated by how many people are ready to boast of "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Babi", but it is as brilliant as one of those classics. (9/10)
