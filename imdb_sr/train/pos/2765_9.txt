These are the French and the Belgians who are doing what they do best. This is a strange, visually inventive, exciting and emotionally challenging narrative. Director Jaco van Dormael takes us to the world of Georges, the Dawn Syndrome and his search for a meaningful relationship with someone, with everyone. This is not done in a patronizing way, but with a great sense of entertainment and honesty. Georges' interaction with the corporate management guru, Harry is freaky - he shifts from comedy to tragedy back into comedy again with staggering ease. Zemeckis's Forrest Gump is well and really in the shade. Sometimes, it evokes the humor of One Flev Over the Cuckoo's Nest of Milos Forman, with Denis Poter shades, which are thrown in a good measure. another sublime performance. But it coincides with the brilliant Pascal Dicken like George. It is a film with evenly strong performances and so many, unforgettable sets - a shoe store scene, a car showroom scene, George's dance in Genesis's 'Jesus who knows me,' the scene of the conference, the scene of fireworks. If you have not seen him, there is only one thing. Just rent it or attend a projection in the retro cinema near you and see what you miss. Better yet, buy this movie. Sheer genius .....
