Situated in the middle class district in the imaginary city of Villard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch of toys with such American obsessions as mania pistols and violence, materialism and maintenance of Jones, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposal of the dead. Yes, it sounds pretty hard, but trust me, it's almost as light as a pen. Zombies are highlighted among the characters. Key questions arise: who will become zombies (90% of Villard's people choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many zombies should work as robots (have become a sign of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be developed between the living and the species of reincarnated dead? Somehow, the director Andrew Currie, who is also the co-author of the live script (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this incredible material that spills for an hour and a half, while not letting it make a good laugh. Super actors are helping: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerni, Tim Blake Nelson, Mari Black and Sonja Bennett are the directors, with the help of young K'Sun Rai as Timmy, the innocent child with a good heart acts as a fair witness all the craziness of adults. (Seeing only in "Memento" and "Matrix", I had no idea that Moss had such fine comedies.) The design of production and music are excellent 50s. . Maybe this is not for everyone. It will certainly be a difficult movie for my annual Bizarro prize. But intelligent comedies that remain funny from the beginning to the end are among the most difficultly conquered in filmmaking. Anyway, for me, "Fido" is a noise! My ratings: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (view details 01/30/07)
