I've seen this movie many years ago on television. Then she passed the title "Stairway to Heaven". Even as a boy, I remember being deeply touched by the story and stunned by the visual effects of the trial (those who saw him know what I'm talking about). Such imagination! The perfect combination of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this movie is right there with the greatest classic ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone vith the Vind. This film was rated extremely high by the voter of the IMDB and rightly so - over 51% of the voters rated it 10 out of 10 votes; over 84% rated them with 8 or more than 10. I was surprised that he was not included in the top 250 films until I realized that few of them saw / rated this film compared to those on the list. What a shame. I hope this movie will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so 1), I can buy it, and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
