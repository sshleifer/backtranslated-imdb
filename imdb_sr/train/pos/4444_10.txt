Most Italian horror fans seem to hate this film because they have nothing to do with the first two films about Demons. And with "Demons III" in the title, it's supposed to be. The problem is that this film never intended to be part of the Demon series. Distributors are only "Demons III" above the original title "Ogre" to capture the popularity of other films. The new American DVD release of this image has the title "Demons III: Ogre" on the side of the art, but the film only says "Ogre". I do not know if the previous editions had the title "Demons III" on the film itself, but it seems that this new edition is just a little white lie. If you can go past "Demon III" in the title, you might enjoy "Ogre". It begins with a crawl introduction, and it remains pretty creepy. It's not even worse movie films slowly, but I've dug it up. Just do not expect it to be like the other Demons movies. I'm giving "Ogre" 7 out of 10 Italian fans.
