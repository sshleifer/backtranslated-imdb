Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD Edition. Once upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with the "Matrix", and I may have been one of a few fifteen-year-olds who still believed that "Terminator" was better than Matrix. I was just an ordinary teenager who was looking for a good action movie, and then on the television station, which I never watched, there was a bright light, a small station known as SBS. One night I noticed in the TV guide that the movie will later play a movie with Jacky Cannon - The Police Story. Since I was fifteen and only saw 'Rumble in the Bronk' and 'Rush Hour', I said ... "VOV AVESOME" and sat down to watch, and he constantly shouted "VOV AVESOME" as the movie progressed. Two weeks later, after SBS showed the trilogy of "Police Stories," I knew that I found my new favorite actor. , Chu (Iuen Chor). Chu's secretary, Selita Fong (Brigitte Lin), is being held by the police as a witness against Chua, and Chan is in charge of protecting her. Things go bad - reaaaal bad - when Chu's case is fired and he decides he wants Fong and Chan to be dead. Chan movies. It starts strongly and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever recorded. Everything is great. However, some of the funny things may look a little untrustworthy for more people ... As a story, this is another of Jackie's best efforts. For an action movie, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this than in the acting and intense 'New Police Story'. This is not 'miracle', but maybe it's a good thing. The 'Police Story' is one of Jackie's best works. I managed to hook myself to the movies, Jackie Chan, and should provide a good start for all potential fans of Jackie. Bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan films do not come much better - 10/10
