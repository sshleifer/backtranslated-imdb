Budget constraints, time constraints, scripting and cutting, cutting, cutting ... This team is a group of good, young filmmakers; imagined in this scenario - yes, allegory - smart in the effects of the zero currency when time and knowledge are all you have, relying on actors and friends and kindly others for their time, dedication, location; and getting the first function in the can, the thing is 1-u-1000. These guys make movies. Good. See the collection of short pants "Heartland Horrors" and see the development. And I can guarantee that working with them is the most fun thing you will do at work. I am struck by a rude, offensive criticism for this film, wondering if one reviewer even heard a word of dialogue, thought about one thought or concept, or if all that was desired of this work was visual killing and killing to please one a foolish look at what horror means for the audience. Let The Empti Acre take you. Do not assume what you expect to be just because it is placed in the horror / trilogy of horror because of its supernatural assumption. It's a drama with a depth that goes beyond how far you can stab the blade in someone with respect for a message that does not attack the visual center of your brain, but relies on someone's empathic imagination to experience someone else's mind and spirit. mark ridgvai, Curtis, "The Empti Acre"
