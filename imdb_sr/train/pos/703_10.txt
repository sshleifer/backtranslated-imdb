I rated this rating just because it seems so impressive to me that an eighteen year old can do with a video camera. It's not epic, but it's pretty interesting and I've never been bored. If tens of millions of dollars can enter into a myriad of bad films that sweep heavily, then give that director the same amount of money and see what's happening. I know I will be in local cinema for her first major release. Damn good job, and worth the money. What a scenario! There could be a bit of budget, but it's better than half of the main images I've seen lately. Nanavati knows how to tell the story, and written on the screen. Serious praise to her, I can not wait to see more.
