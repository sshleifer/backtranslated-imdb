As a fan of further consideration of the phenomenon of school shootings, this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea. Presented as a series of videos of two disturbed men (they can not refer to people who kill as boys or teenagers), months of preparation leading to zero day (codename for the day they attack) to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun. It seems that the intention is to show the pain that is suffering, but still focuses on the literal preparation. The problem is that a little in terms of emotion is delivered directly. The only point where emotions became irresistible was the end, as expected. But, to this point, it's never clear why they are planning. We are told that it is a must-have story that they were mocked, but this film seems to be contrary to it. Without ruining the film, it is easy to say that it was a big attempt and that it had equally great intentions, but it is lagging behind the creepy creation of the film. All directing is amateur, in order to improve the domestic video concept, but the story and continuity are weak. It seems that the film wants the audience to decide a lot, but also does not provide information for such an event. The ending is sudden and does not feel as if it ends everything that the film has started.
