If this was an American film, I would rate him 7: we've already seen this. Since this is an Argentine film, and that I am Argentine, I would like to give him 10, because it was the quality that I was hoping, and I did not expect it. Outstanding quality is stunning, given all the restrictions imposed by the Third World ... I can not forget the scene when Diaz forced Silverstein's fianc√© to admit - you know what I mean, if you've seen the movie. I think this is the key moment of the film, maybe it's not surprising, but still original. Then real action starts. Before watching a movie, I always try to collect some previous information. Since this is the main, satirical, commercial, I press "Play" and I make a suspension of reality and logic, I would say that the best state of mind is to enjoy these films. It is impossible to discuss the credibility of the whole action, but this is convincing in a certain way. As far as I'm concerned, I could not stop laughing at every joke and comments - "a little sauce" ("you're evil") ... put in the mouth of Diaz, the biggest one. Very tired of watching movies "designed for" Peretti. I know that he is an excellent actor, but sometimes I feel that his roles are unfairly opaque, the role of Louis Lukue in this case. I do not like Argentine television, so I did not see much work from Lukue, but it's pretty obvious that he is a great performer. His physical role, his patience, his content attitude in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role should be upgraded, just to show us how it can be great! I do not know if the Chifron plans to make a sequel or not. I know that it will not work if the rule is that "other parts were never good," so if he does, I will surely see it. And I hope to take into account in the future the possibility for Peretti's colleagues to provide the same chances to develop their roles. Excellent movie, great performances and lots of laughter!
