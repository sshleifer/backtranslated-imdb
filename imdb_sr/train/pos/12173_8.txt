First, quickly 'shut'! to those who say this film smells. You can not go to any film waiting for 'Citizen Kane'. This was actually a fun movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only drawback in this film is, I do not think there was enough chemistry between Lee and Julie Stiles. They should have dealt with the issue more. In addition, the movie is a good party. Selma Blair needs something to eat. She cares. But she still looks nice. So, yes, I recommend this movie for a day's entertainment or a light Saturday afternoon party. Go see. RATING: ** 1/2 of ****
