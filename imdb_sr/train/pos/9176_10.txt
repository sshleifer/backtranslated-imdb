This revision lasts for almost 30 years. However, it should be noted that I copied the copy of this film accidentally at the beginning of 2008 several times in a row! I had to write about it! When I saw this movie, I got it and forgot that there was something else. How ironic it is to look at the most rugged male protagonist of literature shown by the most handsome man! however, what a welcome irony! It was perfectly suited to me more because Timothy Dalton fully fulfilled his role. He performed a stunning and triumphant performance! I've never seen anything like this! All other actors are also very good. The whole movie is made beautiful. I do not care what someone says about this movie. I love him and I love him! It made me happy and satisfied. I'm a bit curious to say this, but I prefer Jane Eire in 1983 to A & E P & J, which I believe is the ultimate mini-series. Excerpts from Jane Eire scared me at school a bit. I never read the book seriously knowing the story so well. Seeing this particular production, the story revived for me and led me to a rage. The scenes and the voice of Mr. Dalton persecuted me infuriated and eventually led me to seriously read the book, which is, of course, a masterpiece. Bravo to the whole team, and especially Mr. Dalton !! This movie is now part of me. I give him the grade 10/10.
