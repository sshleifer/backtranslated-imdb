I saw this series when the world premiere was shown at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea of ​​the film, where two men gathered and told the director from every country to direct the 911 film. These directors never met before the project was finished, and they saw how it all looks together. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All parts were very powerful, and some were controversial. If you are an American, you may not like this because some parts can be found anti-American. However, I know several Americans who enjoyed these series. The piece that I found was the best one from India. It was that the Muslim family living in America had two sons, and one of them disappeared. The Americans gave them a cold shoulder and automatically assumed it was associated with a terrorist bombardment. So well describes my mother's despair and humiliation of these accusations, that my eyes have caused tears. In the end, we see her son die while trying to save many victims from the collision of the towers. It was a true story, and that's what made it so real. There were many emotional and powerful pieces, and the African one was one of the best. He was humorous, but equally as powerful as the rest. It must be seen everybody, and I hope that America will take it and let it play in their country.
