I have not seen her for over 20 years, but I still remember things about it. This film could not be colored. Stark Gray is what makes it, and is life really so simple in the 1950s? What points out most in my memory is Perry Smith, who is going to hang on. His breathing under the hood just before they cast a trap. I do not think I can look back again ... ... once it's enough. It's like that untitled guy at the beginning of the "Papillon" that's pulled into fear of guillotine. The guy who said he was watching this on a double account with Dead Man Valking should have added the last 10 minutes "I Vant To Live" as well. on the guillotine 1794-95, so my feelings towards the death penalty are quite intense.
