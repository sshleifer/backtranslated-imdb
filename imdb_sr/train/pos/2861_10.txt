I love this show and my 11-year-old daughter and I like to watch her together. Teaches good old-fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventurous and fun way (though with a fairly predictable story most of the time). It's also fun to mock ... you know, rewind and insert your dialogue, instead of actors. I have a tuned DVR to record all episodes and have caught a tail episode (just before the beginning of the next ... so I do not know what the episode was) but there was absolutely TERRIBLE error in sequencing ! Adam handed the sheriff to the café a small piece of "skin," which was torn off some of the burglary caps while trying to make his escape, I suppose. He placed it on the table and placed the sample where he was dressed. This pattern was exactly rectangular ... which I think would be almost impossible to get out of the skin (Naugahide after 1950? Yes, skin? I do not think it was). Well, the sample perfectly agreed and the mystery was resolved. Even 10 seconds later on the scene, we see the coat again, still lying on Roi's desk. But this time, the svatch looks more like the shape of North Carolina and is now in a completely different place on the coat (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which was a smack-dab in the middle of the svatch) is now gone ... as what is the seam in the coat. My daughter laughed very well while we played a short scene over and over again! It's top for ioutube, I tell you! Still fully love the show, and the sequencing errors make it fun!
