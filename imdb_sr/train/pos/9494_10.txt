VHITE FIRE recommended me the guy who owns it on two separate DVDs and on VHS. He claimed that this was one of the funniest and best shareholders with a low budget ever made. Mostly I do not watch movies knowing it will be bad, but I made an exception for this ... and I was very pleased to have done it. It is loaded to the top with action (much surprisingly, graphically), sleazy (isolated with nakedness with a key female character, but so much in a scene that it becomes hilarious) and an unusually unpleasant dialogue, which adds laughter - challenging the tone of the film. Ginti, the unusual star of the EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low budget campaigns) is fun in the lead, giving the best performance he could gather. Villiamson is better than usual, obviously he is laughing with incomparable joy (and he does not get to the middle). The rest of the actors are also fun to watch, especially angry, of which there is a sadistic sex that speaks with an accent that looks like a mish-shampoo of Spanish and Italian. She is invaluable. Again, I can not emphasize enough how much it was bloody. It's not so bloody it's painful, but it's unusually violent in parts with some fleshy beepers that appear in the shootings and has a tough line of torture that no one will soon forget. Also, when Ginti crowded a bunch of bad guys, he easily gets a chain saw and the accompanying moments will be followed by all the fans who cheer and sprinkle their beer. Don Do not miss VHITE FIRE. It's an incredibly stupid classic stupid ass.
