The first week of May, every year returns memories of the Holocaust through movies on television. Among the many films they showed, this was the one I did not see. The story is about Hilter's life and how he came to power. He begins with his childhood and ends up holding the highest position of power in Germany. The film was previously presented as a TV series, and later converted into a movie format. Scottish actor Robert Carlile plays Adolf Hitler with great courage, conviction and flame to give a true display of this man. to power, and also tries to demonstrate the likely psychological structure of Hitler. The film is the biased view of director Christian Dugoo? which shows Hitler as one path, threatening, angry and shouting a person? who had such a strong hold on the Germans and the people around him. Hitler is not portrayed as someone who has charishma and attraction, and the film does not succeed in persuading Hitler's portrait. main stream movie. Production value, sets, costumes, etc. They are perfect. There is a lot of criticism of this film, in the authenticity of the historical events that are being presented. But the movie still attracts, every engagement and entertainment. Robert Carlile overrides and dominates the screen like no one else. He's incredibly good? brilliant! I would like a more balanced view of Hitler's life, because I think Hitler managed to bring down the sleeping feelings of millions of Germans and not just to blame him for the Holocaust. Like I said several times, yes? very sad - our company likes to marry or prosecute one person, as a representative of a good or evil society.
