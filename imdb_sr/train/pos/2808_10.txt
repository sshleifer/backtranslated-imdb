This film is not morbid, nor depressed. That's - sad, because AIDS in the early 90's - was - sad. But his real message is love and perseverance. Mark and Tom were in long-term love. Their attachment to each other is obvious immediately, and how the destruction of AIDS escalates and becomes the focal point of their lives, you see the strength and dedication that are truly touching. Originally published, I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at the HIV / AIDS Clinic. The film told me that there was no other AIDS movie that day, because Mark and Tom were the right people, who lived exactly the same experiences I've seen everyday in real life. I knew firsthand how to look at how AIDS is wasting on once-living, young, healthy people; Watching how it happened to Mark and Tom in the movie was very similar to watching my real-life friends. He touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me.
