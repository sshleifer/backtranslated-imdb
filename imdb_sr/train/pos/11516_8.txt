I'm not John Clayes (although I thought that Favlity Tovers was brilliant), but I am a fan, and when I saw this session, neglected, on the shelf in my local Blockbuster, I decided to try. What I got was a wonderful surprise, and one of the funniest 50 minutes of viewing experience I've ever had. Writing is typical of English "goon shov" schtick. In fact, like audio skit, this would not be in place on the album "Firesign Theater ", but execution and timing are noticeable, and this raises" The Strange Case "to the kind of performance that can create lifelong British fanatics of comedy. The British have a gift to combine wide satirical lamps with carefully observed "teak" characters and timing, and the creators use both of them to have a good effect here. there is such a sense of physical comedy that more than its own, but an unexpected treat is Arthur Love, who plays Vatson as a genius, but an incomprehensibly incomprehensible imbecile with such a wonderful timing and delivery to become the best aspect of the film. I never heard about Love before (his background seems to be a guitar and a musical theater), but he justifies his career with this play as far as I'm concerned. Some people may not care about the "Strange Case ...", especially if the British capricorn is not their "cuppa tea". But I'm really glad I saw it before he disappeared from sight.
