I thought this was a wonderful movie. It touches every fiber of human being. Love in the movie is very intense. I thought that Vill's best performance so far. Great directing. I liked the editing. The music was great. Good use of flashback. This is a movie that everyone should see. I hope people will get something wonderful from this. All in all, a great movie. I think Hollivood should make more movie films with the substance. Even action movies can have a caring story. I love the fact that Vill was very subtle in his acting. He had a purpose and a commitment that rarely could be seen. I suggest you look at this yourself or with someone you really care about. For me, I discovered that the world stopped and I focused on the film. The outside world is suspended for a moment. It was a nice feeling with all that chaos that is happening in this world. And with this generation, it was great to see something (someone) who cares about other people more than myself.
