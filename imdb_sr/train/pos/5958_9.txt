Unlike some comments, it's my positive one. This movie is wrapped around dinner with a group of friends, some like you, some not. Several of them are related - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not one smooth, happy with everyone and everything, the type of life - just like real life. Some stories do not evolve, but they just happen. But like true families and good friends, they stick together. Parents who want to be babies are such holes! You're happy about the end. Poor Delmar is stuck between a rock and a rock that takes care of himself, his mom, his son, and tries to keep all his lives together. This does not end with a walk by sunset or a house in bugs and everyone lives in a dream world, but it is a very realistic view of people living day by day, month to month. All in all, this is a good story and a great movie !!
