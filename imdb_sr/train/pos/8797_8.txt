Great idea: 11 stories on September 11th. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach who talks about an immigrant (as usual) is just brilliant (as usual). The Frenchman is doing a very good job, while Burkina Faso was a good surprise. However, the film from Israel was a bit boring, and a Mexican guy, well, should stop working and working in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
