Almost every review of this film I saw was pretty bad. Not really bad, it's actually pretty good, but not great. Judy Garland's character could have been boring, but she did not allow it. Somewhere on the line, I became a fan, an imitation of Van Heflin, at least in the early 40's. Judy's singing is great, but the movie missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship. I gave him 7.
