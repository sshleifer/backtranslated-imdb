This film did not surprise me, as such, he became better and better. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well ... we'll see how he does it ..." Then I saw Peter Falk in it. I appreciate Colombo. Although I was never a big fan of the show, I always loved to watch Peter Falck. The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. So they played well for one another that I practically felt dizzy from enjoying! ... and I did not even drink! This film was so well made that I wanted to tell Paul and tell him how much I like him! but I could not find his number. It must not be on the list or something. This was one of those films about which I had no idea what to do or who is in it or something. He just came in and I thought, "Eh, why not? Let's see if I do not like it - I do not have to watch it ..." ... and finally I just loved it!
