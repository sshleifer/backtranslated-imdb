Like many here, I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many who did it, I love this show! I think it's done well and thoughtfully. Everything in it indicates that it is a spin-off that does not need to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons with one bad guy trying to get better than a good guy. Using the famous Shaggi and Scooby-Doo characters, it's much easier to engage viewers with parody humor from the beginning of every 30-minute episode. Always existed Scooby-Doo spin-offs that were annoyed by fans. The classic is the Scooby-Shaggi-Scrappi shorth of the 80's. These spin-offs had their place: they allowed new content to be sold, created new fans, and kept Scooby-Doo goods on shelves. I agree that "Shaggi & Scoobi-Doo: Get a Clue!" does not fit into this traditional role, but it's probably what I've always wanted to be Scooby-Shaggi-Scrappi panties: an action series that focuses on the best / funniest Scooby-Doo characters! Good emission characteristics: animation, voices, attention devoted to detail, bad guys, "Best Friend" relationship between Shaggy and Scooby Doo, constant humor! Bad Features: Nothing, even though the restored Mystery Machine is sometimes quite close. Well done Varner Bros. Animation! One of the smartest cartoons for a long time!
