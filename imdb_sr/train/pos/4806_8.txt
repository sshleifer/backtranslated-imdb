The new side of the story of Victoria and Albert is revived by director Jean-Marc Valle. Queen Victoria's endless thoughts on most people are women who ruled for decades and lived in grief. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the lead because she gives the audience a different perspective. She shows Victoria in her youth, ascending to the throne and early years. Blunt's Victoria is fresh and restrained throughout the film. Her strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettani). All actors are well-known, including Miranda Richardson in something that might be a rejection role. that it would be worth watching. There are several historical freedoms downloaded on the screen, the film attempts to maintain a faithful relationship between Victoria and Alberto and the social and royal structure of the time period. Scenography and costumes are extraordinary. This film will most appreciate those attracted by history, periods, Blunt and other actors. Sincerely recommend. Rating: A
