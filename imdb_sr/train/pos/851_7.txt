Pierce Brosnan sang his last Martini and returns, in an unheard of self-parody, as the old stinking drunken killer Julian Noble, who has a special affection for teenagers, bullfights and sticky clothes. During a business trip to Mexico City, he met Danny (Greg Kinnear), a business man from the Denver suburb of the right person, who is in the city to do his job at the hotel bar. Despite their totally different characters and Julian's gross and silent remarks, they become friends. Director Richard Shepard was largely derived from Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, but found that he had not written a film in mind Pierce Brosnan, but hardly I can imagine it without him. He proves he has a real talent for comedy and can be more than just a James Bond or a spy cold war. The scene in which the two meet in a brilliant hotel bar (stunning sets and beautifully photographed) is really a lock of acting. The scene lasts for almost fifteen minutes, and although she was probably carefully scribbled, the two actors greatly improvised, but they did a wonderful job! It almost feels like a new standard in display on the screen. Think about Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel at MEAN STEETS in improvisation and add one of the finest bases of many genre clich√©s and your own actors' typography (especially Brosnan's James Bond), and you've got one of the most beautiful couples in Hollywood's newest. Unfortunately, the story wears the tank after a while. After an hour, the film was left without money. However, and I can not exactly put my finger on it, I really enjoyed this. It simply feels very fresh and original, with imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some indications for Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. Other characters do not have much to do, but this movie offers something new, in that sense, almost effortlessly manages to unite all conventional genres into a pretty fun feat. Very entertaining. Camera Obscura --- 7/10
