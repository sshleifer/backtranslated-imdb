In 1958, Clarksberg was a famous castle castle town. Many of the revenues were generated by the Sheriff's department that captured the speedboards. Those who tried to escape the Sheriff? Well, that gave the sheriff the chance to push them off with the Klarksberg curve with his Plimouth cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the film, a few absentee soldiers who are trying to return to the base in time, are pushed to death, if I remember correctly. Then one day a stranger entered the city. Probably the coldest hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is the name of the car, as in McCord's seals. In possibly the ultimate hot rod. Black flame Ford '34 coupe. The colors of death, evil and hellfire. The Sheriff deliberately picked him up for speeding. Check the land. He is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. Government Clarksberg is for the sheriff. There is only one way to justify serving his brother's murder and to correct things so that "this will never happen to anyone": recreate pottery and resolve the style of competition to death. He comes out on the curve and practiced. The sheriff knows that McCord knows. The race starts ... This is a film that is remembered by all those who have ever tried to master the maneuvers on a particular path.
