Was Morgan Freeman more unusual than God than George Burns? This film was better than that boring, "Oh, God." I was completely preoccupied and LMAO all the way to the end. Carrei was perfect as an unusual leader, and Aniston took her role as a frustrated girl in a normally well-played performance. First, I do not consider it ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when Carrei opened a file cabinet thinking he would never be able to maintain his life history. See if you can spot a file in the cabinet where there are events from his humor in the bathroom. Well written and even better played, this comedy will fall as one of the best of this funny one.
