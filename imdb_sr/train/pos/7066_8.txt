This film is so old that I never figured out how young Rai Milland looked like in 1936, I remember playing in the great movie "Lost Veekend". Rai plays the role of Michael Stuart, a very wealthy banker. In this picture are three girls who are not very happy about separating their father and mother and revealing that their father will marry a young blonde who is a gold digger who only wants rich sugars. They hire a man to represent himself as a very rich countess, his name being Count Ariszted, (Misha Auer) who is constantly drunk and without money and gives many comic laughter through the picture. Deanna Durbin, (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked at the police station and told the police chief she was an opera star, and then Penny started singing with the most fantastic soprano voice I've heard, the entire police department and the prisoners began to clap , which was a very fun and enjoyable scene from this movie. This is the first debut of Deanne Durbin, which became successful overnight and became a great film star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
