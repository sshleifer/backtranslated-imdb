As if the film is not valuable in itself, this is a great way to get an overview of the novel as a prelude to reading it. In the summer of 1968 I saw a film in New York; In the autumn of graduation school, I first read the book. Some of the pleasure of reading the novel was my memory of a conscientiously detailed film. And for the better or worse - and now I'm reading and teaching the novel for more than three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
