I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11-year-old girl; and b) we showed her movies Bonita Granville Naci Drew from the 1930s, which she enjoyed completely. Personally, I did not think it was funny as it was in the thirties of the last century, but on the other hand, it was not a disgusting piece of intelligent heat that I was afraid it would be. It was a harmless, slightly fun movie. Although I'm glad they did not try to "upgrade" Nancy to the "hippo" of the 21st century (Veronica Mars holds the title as Moderna Nanci Drev), I think they did it a bit too high, that they did not do enough to develop Nancy Drev - a movie could be titled "Jane Doe, Girl Detective". I must blame the script: I think every actor did a good job with what they had to do. In this role I like Emma Roberts, but they gave her a TV, not a theater, a script ...
