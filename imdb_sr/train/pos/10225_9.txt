I had a good laugh and read all the idiotic comments for this film, as it is obvious that those who criticized the film have never seen, or were stupid enough to pay to see it. The best reason to watch was at the Elvira Show a few years ago. Elvira has delivered the film with as much laughter as possible. It's fine monster, compared to hundreds of scary American shifts. Much better!!!!
