So many educational films are nothing more than a dull mind, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" is rude ("Why learn industrial arts?"). "Hemo The Magnificent" is actually pretty well made. Everything is in the blood, the heart and the bloodstream. I admit I do not remember everything, but it works well, explaining everything, keeping it serious, but fun. I guess you can always count on June Forai (the most famous voice of Rocki The Skuirrel, here plays deer). The best place to watch is in "Gremlin": the class watches it while forming a gremlin.
