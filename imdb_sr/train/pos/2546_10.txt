This is only in the same league as the "Black Cat", although I would give this 9, not 9+. It's really a compliment to a movie that's so underrated that it's incredible! The "invisible air" is part of the horror, part of the drama and certainly part of sci-fi. For a film made in 1936, sci-fi elements were a good part of the time. A mixture of horror, drama and sci-fi is a perfect combination, while the performance of Lugoshi and Karloff can not be better. so often. What I'm saying is that this movie is creepy and well recorded. The scene with gargoyles outside Lugosi's room is a perfect example of mood. This is a remarkable moment in the film, which unfortunately is missing in today's films of this genre. the film has not yet been released on DVD. When you consider something of the garbage already transferred to DVD, it's much more mysterious. Anyway, watch this movie if you have a chance. When it's posted on a DVD, quickly grab it and put it in a slow place in your DVD library.
