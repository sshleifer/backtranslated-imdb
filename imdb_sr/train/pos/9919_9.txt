Surprisingly, astounding and scary, this beautiful film is "Apocalypse Now" without fiction. Slowly in the rhythm, quietly in the mood, gives good insights to the poisonous stains on Earth that may be signs of inevitable failure. In my mind there is no doubt - nature is burdened and we are a disease. Grief, the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress, has transformed us into something like cancer, on the path to consuming the host and dying together with it ... Produced landscapes are unforgettable watching Experience - at least never again I will not watch my toaster and iron in the same way.
