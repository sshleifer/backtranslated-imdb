I dug some old musicals out of the garage and this is one of my favorites. Written by Jai Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. He won two awards for Best Picture in 1951 and Best Screenplay. A story about an American painter in Paris trying to make him big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of money and is very interested in helping him, but soon finds out she loves this guy. In the meantime, Gene Kelly falls on a beautiful girl, Leslie Caron. His main dance partner, and I must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise. Also known is the French singer Georges Guietari. So, if you like good smooth dances and entertaining scenes filled with Oscar Levant's piano fingers, the songs of George Gershwin will live forever in this colorful gem. 8/10
