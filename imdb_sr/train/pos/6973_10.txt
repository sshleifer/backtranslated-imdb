BSG is one of my favorite TV shows. I was lucky to start watching how the series came to the final season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride was! As soon as I noticed a pilot on Hulu, I knew exactly what I was just heading - Caprica! Although, some things do not come together when you compare the two series and it's still pretty nice. There was no mention of Holobands in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds, but maybe I'm not far enough in the series to explain why. the universe, technology and alternative fantasy of our world. This show is very interesting and you will want to watch more!
