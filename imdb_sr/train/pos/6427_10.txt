If you're in the mood for a party ... and you just want to relax and enjoy ... bards Miian Chote Miian is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh started quite well ... but Govinda steals the show from her hands ... a great time for a good dialogue ... ... inspired by Bad Bois ... but it has Indian Masala. ... people think it could be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan directs and Govinda plays ... should not ask any questions ... other recommended movies in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo) ... are Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deevana Mastana, Collie no. 1, Jodi no. 1, Hero 1, Haseena Manjaiegi, Ek Aur Ek Giarah.
