One of the first OVA ("original video animations") I've ever purchased, this has to be one of my favorite anime titles. Comedy about cyberpunk sci-fi action against the incredible (for comedy, i.e.) the background of almost future pollution in a dystopian society. The "Heroes" Dominion are the Tank Police with "if we can not win crime, we get a bigger rifle" philosophy, and who, as the name suggests, patrol the city in tanks instead of patrol vehicles, and who actually much more dangerous than any criminal trying to capture. Most, if not all, of these policemen are borderline (?) Psychopaths and neurotics, giving a new meaning to the term "loose cannons". (vo) men, sisters Twin Cat, whose existence always includes turning the tanker police into a difficult situation. Animation is not the most up-to-date, but it's very nice otherwise; the colorful palette and the caricature look of characters and bellows fit well with the comical atmosphere of Dominion. English doubling is, again, a lot of fun. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album ... In any case, Dominion Tank Police is great. It's a Japanese ciberpunk SF with a lot of comedy, filled with completely over-the-top characters and situations, making sure it's never taken seriously. Recommended.
