Rai Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this exceptional example of fraternal love and dedication. Hulce plays Dominicka, (Nicki), a young mentor who is mentally handicapped and who puts her 12 minutes younger brother twin, Liott, who plays Eugene through a medical school. It is set up in Baltimore and deals with rivalry between brothers, an unbreakable bond of twins, abuse of children and good that always prevails evil. It's amazing and filled with laughter and tears. If you have not yet seen this movie, please rent it, I promise, you will be amazed that such a wonderful movie could remain unnoticed.
