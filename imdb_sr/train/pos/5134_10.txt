This short film was nominated for an Oscar and I want to win it! Basically, a movie session between very talented musicians, including Lester Jooun and Joe Jones, music is incredible! Hollywood often accepts Jazz (especially animation, believing it or not), but this is a rare look at the film in the improvisational jam. This has been added to the list of films and deserved. TCM does this as a filling periodically and runs it every March for its day of "31 Days of the Oscars". From the center of the city to the buzz, whistle, nothing but the net and the bullet is so smooth that the grid barely moved. Very solid and highly recommended !!!
