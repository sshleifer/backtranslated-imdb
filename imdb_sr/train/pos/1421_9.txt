This documentary makes you travel around the world. It contains rare and stunning wildlife tips. It shows you how diverse it is and how our planet is fragile. The future of the polar bear is highlighted at the beginning and at the end. After all, his dark future is closely linked to the consequences of global warming. This documentary, however, has simplified the access to such a serious issue of the environment. However, it can easily be seen in small children, as it generally remains descriptive. Scientists could be disappointed because this is not a remake of Al Gore's documentary "Unpleasant Truth", but honestly ... what a description !!! Then the question may arise: Is not it worth the preservation of the beauty of our world? Because this documentary proves that in 2007 such beauty still existed despite various pollution. Living in cities and towns, we forget that we are part of this nature. Everything considered to be a documentary film reminds us that we have a common treasure called "COUNTRY".
