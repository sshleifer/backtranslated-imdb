Eieliner was worn almost 6000 years ago in Egypt. Really not so much that it happened in the 12th century. I also did not realize that the series had failed. Now the second season is broadcast, is not it? It's amazing for me when comments are made by those who are either poorly informed or do not watch the show at all. It is the loss of space on the boards and the time of others. The first show of the series may have been a little painful because the actor began to fall into place, but this can be expected from any show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can not wait to start the second season in the United States.
