When I saw this movie I was stunned by that great movie. This is the only movie I think I would ever give 10 stars. I'm sure this film will always be in my top 5. The acting is great. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are the best. I do not think that nobody can have a better job than Kate. If there is a rainy day and you can not decide what to rent, well, this is one. You will love all the acting, special effects and more. If you have not seen this movie, rent it or buy it right away !!! You will not regret it. <br /> <br />
