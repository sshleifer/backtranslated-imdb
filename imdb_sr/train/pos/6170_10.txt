Last year I watched this movie at the Taos Film Festival, and I was overwhelmed with this film. It's a rich, warm novel brought on the screen, beautifully acting and well-directed. More than anything, she reminded me of David Lean's films, both in his ability to deal with a complex story, and in his ability to create powerful scenes that affect you at several different levels. The best movie I've seen for years.
