I enjoyed this movie, but I hated him because I wanted to help this guy! In the 1950s I have many friends in music business ... who are now trying to become adults ... there are no more fans, groups, money etc. ... and they are so hard to adapt to normal life ... how they see new bands, etc. how do they get spotlights ... almost as if they have to start over again ... this film is proof that many old rockers of the 70's and 80's are passing ... and here I find the film sad and depressing. But does it show life old rock star - abandoned and lost - in a convincing way. A young girl who comes to his old home reminds Hollis Maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she is a lady in a movie you will be cheering for. This film is certainly for people from their 50s who saw the rise and fall of bands, people who knew members, and watched them get hurt by age, and popularity fades. This is almost a perfect movie ... nowadays, but in a way positive ... because of whales. A MUST SEE!
