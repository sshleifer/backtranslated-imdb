Another Dovei must see! If you're obsessed with a fan like me, you have to watch this movie! He plays Alek Finch, a 22-year-old Iale city who realizes that life has just come to life left 26 years earlier. Alek is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a lawyer with no luck and who happily married Corrine (Cibil Sheppard). Louie was killed on an anniversary when hit by a car. He demands to return, only this time in the body of Alex Finch. Enter Robert Dovna Jr., a lot of confusion and a lot of laughter. Although this movie is 15 years old, it still asks you if there really is such a thing as re-incarnation. And if so, how often do you encounter the life of the same soul after life? I do not know the answer. But I know you need to see this movie. It's a rebellion, and Dovei looks so good at smoking. This movie makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. Just recycle.
