There are people who claim this is another "bad language" of the ultra-violent Mexican film. They are right, but more than that, this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become. The terrible truth is painful, or bored when you have already accepted the paradigm of the Third World as the only possible goal. One of the most important things "Cero and van cuatro" is an open call to deep thinking about our present identity. Are we all of us? Is that all we want to be? I am abroad and I realized how Mexican society was spoiled when Tlahuac came to light. I still do not understand the viewers who witness the mass transfer of the murder. I almost refused when I saw some of the pictures. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, only a tiny village near Mexico City, when rampage was carried out with the leniency of the media and the government. Repeating a similar situation in this movie has shocked me deeply. Other stories have well shown other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I consider "Tamales de Chivo" the best. The film is deeper than some "cabrons" and "shingles" scream. They are meaningless in comparison with the actions of people. With a few exceptions, they are all perfect examples of human rubbish. As in real life, sincerity is becoming an exception rather than a rule in our country. Moreover, sincerity is only rewarded.
