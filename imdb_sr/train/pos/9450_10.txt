As Peckinpah worked with STRAV DOGS, and Kubrick with CLOCKVORK ORANGE, director John Boorman brings an effective film about the violent side of a man in DELIVERY, an undoubtedly final horror film from the 1970s. Burt Reinolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cock show four Atlanta businessmen who opt for a canoe ride through the wild Cahulavassee River in northern Georgia before it turns into what Reinolds calls the "big, dead lake". /> But local mountain people have a painfully obvious view of these "townspeople" walking through their forests. And the following day, continuing along the river, Beatty and Voight were attacked and sexually abused (the film-known sequence "SKUEAL!") By two evil mountaineers (Bill McKinnei, Herbert "Covboi" Covard). So what began as nothing more than a joke through Appalachia has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see a thin line that exists between what we consider to be civilization and what we consider to be barbarism. /> James Dickei has adapted the script from his best-selling book, and the result is often an exciting and disturbing shock. Often known for its "SKUEAL!" and "Dueling Banjos" sequences, DELIVERANCE is also a rather pulsating temptation, with four leading men in their roles, and McKinney and Covard, making for two of the most horrible villains of all time. A film that must be seen for those who are willing to take risks.
