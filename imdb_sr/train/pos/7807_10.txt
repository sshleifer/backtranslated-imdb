The performance of each actor and actress (in the film) is extraordinary NATURE, and this is what should be film acting; and the artistic skill is so brilliantly addressed in every detail that I'm never tired of seeing again. However, I am quite surprised to see that this movie is not included in some of the actors and directors, Attenborough credits that confuse me: are they not proud to claim they have made such an excellent, long-lasting film for the audience? I hope to get some answers to my puzzles from somebody (maybe it's one of the "trained" staff (insiders) of the movie.
