Although this show since 1973 was in the air, after I looked at the DVD set I borrowed in our library, I felt the need to say something about it. I remember when it was the only color television show on the television of the sixties, and sometimes there was a little Sundai Night Parti with friends to watch this on NBC on one of several color TVs . I really enjoy the history of not so many names and dates, but how it affects us today and how much it can be so deeply based on the most recent actions of that time. Case: Virginia Citi, Nevada, which has become one of the richest cities in the world due to silver, was named after a figure called "Old Virgin", which left the salon in the early days, fell and broke a bottle of whiskey. Old Virginia did not want to spend this opportunity so that the precious liquid penetrated the dirt he decided to baptize the city of Virginia Town. The area became known as Comstock Lode because another figure, Henri Comstock, had a reputation to try to skip every request, and the area became known as Comstock Lode. I just watched an early episode with these two items. Other episodes dealt with Mark Twain's literary rise, while the reporter for the Territorial Enterprise ... It was a comprehensive (and often educational) family party. As anyone else noticed, each episode would really be considered a movie in its true extensive script and characters. One thing it distorted was the vicinity of Virginia Citi and Ponderos. For the truth, in order to drive away from Ponderosa (the entire North Lake Tahoe), he would ride his horse to 1,000 feet downstream to the top Spooner to the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) in the Carson valley, and then the other 30-40 miles to the city Virginia. Needless to say, Cartwright would have some painful back endings doing it regularly. But every writer should have some freedom in the truth. How I miss this show, even today.
