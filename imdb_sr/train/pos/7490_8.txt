To date, I've never seen this movie. It was filmed on the sets of the Old Dark House and Frankenstein, and it concerns a small Bavarian village in which allegedly huge blind mice sows the blood of villagers. and an actor who will not give up, Lionel Atvill, Dvight Frie, Faie Vrai and Melvin Douglas are playing a character named Brettschnieder who is of interest to me because it is my grandmother's maiden name. A carefully modulated film that has uncertainty and humor, which is slowly being built in a short time, just got lost when it was ten minutes before the end realized that they had a limited time for everyone. From that moment to the end, this is the right path to the goal with very little fun that preceded him. Leonard Maltin and IMDb report a 71-minute working time and warn of shorter prints. The trouble is that IMDb and Maltin may be wrong, and in this case I think they are from a source I believe to say more than 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Enciclopedia). which are available have a tendency to move about 60-63 minutes the amount of missing material is significantly lower if it is only 67 minutes long. Personally, I do not think it will be that much important than his five minutes, and I very much doubt that the film will be made or broken. Whatever it is, if you love the creaking old movies, Anyway, watch this movie, its big dark and stormy night movie.
