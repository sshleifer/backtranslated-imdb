MUÅ KARCI BEEVARE is remake of the classic shemp BRIDELESS GROOM. The new scene of cooking a movie at the beginning of the movie is great. Farmers are always funny when cooking. However, after the first few minutes of recording, we recorded the original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about these treatments from 1953 to 1956 is that they fit into a new story. They are working on the roll if the old story does not match. MUGS have a new end, but I will not give it to those who want to be surprised. > <br /> **** from 4 stars.
