The "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) squad is the former leading chess player trying to return to the tournament in Italy. His splendor is unquestionable, but his obsession with chess stops his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emili Vatson) is a beautiful successor who came to the same place with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James), to include possible marital partners. Faith relies on a handy number, but, astoundingly, Natalya is more fascinated by Sasha, whom she met in a walk. Sasha is also led by Natalia and suggests marriage at another meeting. But given the concentration Sascha must give to chess games and, with other events in his past that still cause problems, will he win the heart of Natalia? And can he become a chess champion? This is a wonderful film, based on the novel Nabokov. The acting is incredible, because Vatson is very good as a beautiful little rich girl and Turturro is completely perfection as a shy, inconvenient chess enthusiast. James gives a pretty good reversal, because both the mother and the other members of the band are wonderful. As for the film, it can not be better. The landscape is diverse, antique costumes are beautiful and cinema deserves a great applause. Yes, the story is unusual and told with flashbacks, sometimes, that is a movie that everyone will not appreciate. Then the ending is bitter-sweet. However, if you love romance, periodical pieces, great acting, knockout sceneries, or art of making movies, do not miss this. You will be helpless in resisting his multitude charms.
