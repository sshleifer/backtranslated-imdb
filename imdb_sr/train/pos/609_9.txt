A very cozy, very imaginative and film fairytale in one, Stardust tells the story of a young man who lives outside the fantasy world and enters it to find a little fallen star just to find the star alive, young and beautiful. . The kingdom whose king is ready to die said that the king freed the competition of his several sons to see who can first find the rubies to be king, while the three witches want the star to be divided and used to keep them young. These three themed strings are interwoven together in a whole picture with good acting, blinding special effects, and some solid feeling and humor. Stardust is a funny movie and has some fun performances like Claire Danes as a star (I could have been watching her for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I could watch her full of magical powers for even longer) playing the terrible witch that Robert Deniro is perfect for the game - The air pirates. Charlie Cock as the chief Tristan is courteous and credible and we get a very good job from a group of boys who play sons to be the king who constantly and constantly tries to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Fleming and Ruppert Everett play a good role in life and death (they also loved this whole thread). Peter O'Toole plays the dying dad's killer and looks at the funny man Ricky Gervais who smiled at me more than anything in the whole movie in his short five minutes. But the real power in the film is a novel by Neil Gaiman and a script from his creative and fruitful mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its world and functions.
