Ulisses, as a film, does not need to be compared with the novel in any way, because these are two completely different entities. However, as it has been said, the film still manages to maintain many elements that have made a book of work, but since it is a visual medium, it is more difficult to draw the course of consciousness. I think this is the best movie they could do with the material ... and that's from someone who routinely talks about films that are not like their literary colleagues. I recommend a book, but the movie is still fun.
