Peter Sollett created a dear portrait of real people living in poverty in Lover East Side in New York, or Loisaids, as the locals know. <br /> Mr. Sollett's heart is in the right place while examining this dysfunctional family, which is typical for the various 'inner cities' of the country. Mr. Sollett stresses positively in the story he represents. These are basically good children, the children of parents who left them and whose grandma took her under her wing. Instead of presenting your characters as losers, Mr. Sollett shows the positive side everyone has. These children do not deal with drugs or steal because they are poor. If this story was done by Hollywood, we would see a parade of stereotypes, instead of children who fight, but they are not deeply defeated in themselves. Viktor Rasuk, as Victor Vargas, was the Revelation. He's natural. Like Jul Marta. Her character shows us a stupid girl who will not be deceived or driven to do anything she does not want. Altagracia Guzman, as a grandmother, is great. She conveys her frustration that she was unable to direct her grandchildren to the things she believes in and which are so important to her. All in all, this was a great picture thanks to Peter Sollett.
