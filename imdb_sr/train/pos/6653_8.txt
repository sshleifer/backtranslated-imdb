Aside all political views, Feroz Khan and Anil Kapurov "Gandhi, My Father" is a good film that cleverly explores the confused side of the family Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the struggle of his eldest son Harilala Gandhi with society, the father of larger than life, and most importantly the demons in his head . One line of parallels with Gandhi is the father of the nation and the struggle that every son could have with his father. The acting is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan and sank Akshaie Khanna - strictly in that order - add color and pathos in this story of Harilal a heart that embraced only once and flee at the slightest touch of a finger. The regime of Feroz Khan and the production canvas are lavish and attractive, however, the scenario could have been even tougher. I saw a play a few years ago on a DVD of pirated video (it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi, I think) and it was definitely more influential. However, the film background results and moments of father-son, mother-son was just a great treat. This film could be great. That's the boundary to that. There is so great potential that it is only a story of differences between father and son or only Gandhi or even both. somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect the absolute content of emotions, nothing comes to you. It's worth comparing well with the other Gandhi. Certainly not a screened film like Kingsley's Gandhi, or abstract like Kamal Hasanov Hey Ram. The movie is just finding its way; however, it remains to ask "what if ..." is worth the clock. 7.5 / 10
