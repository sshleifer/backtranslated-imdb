"I moved here to get away from things like this!" A little city sheriff complains. "This is often happening in Chicago?" His deputy asks. Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians misinterprets the Night Rebroadcast of Orson Welles' War to the worlds as a report on the actual invasion of the Martians, and they conclude that they need to get involved in action! There follows a bunch of accidents involving Mars's random attempts to conquer the city of Big Bean, IL. Everyone concludes that children are really good costumes, except for the sheriff's daughter and her friend, a child in a duck suit. Martians are comical themselves, and you get the impression that they are not a threat to anyone but yourself rather early. It's a fun family movie.
