This film moves the story of Cinderella to the early 1950s and does well, if it is eccentric, using the Isle of Man as a background. Ugly sisters have become wild glamorous English girls of the higher class, and together with Kathleen Turner as a stepmother, they roam in different fabulous costumes. The story is slightly modified in relation to the traditional version: it's early in the mix, with the complication of "King of the Lire", and in the later stages of Cinderella is much more persistent than usual. It looks great and pretty good, but sometimes it goes over the top.
