This is a pretty strange movie. It happens as an exploitative film with excessive violence and unrealistic situations, but unusual for the construction of rural characters in a war with each other, in contrast to the invasion of 'others'. The movie is an exaggerated stereotype of Vietnamese veterans, in a long series of films portraying war veterans as dangerous psychopaths. Chris Christopherson's last lineup is 'I have not lost a war yet,' because he encounters his death after making a long trail of homicide and destruction, including the city's police chief and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly cold scene. However, Kristofferson is a good enough actor, and sufficiently charismatic, to bring that villain with a surprising depth. Vincent is obviously a golden boy, but with a sufficiently intense layer over his pure goodness. The film has some resemblance to Vinchester 73, where Jimmy Stevart attempts to tolerate a criminal brother until he is compelled to act against him. The film has b-film action, although Kristofferson, Vincent, Wonderful Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters give A-grade. I give her 7 for having been a long lost view of American psychiatric post-Vietnam / pre-Reagan introspection, paranoia, and confusion, and a film industry that was willing to deal with such topics at that time . Viewed on this channel, a large network that continues to play many old films from the 70's to the 90's, regardless of this political inclination.
