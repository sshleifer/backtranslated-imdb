Pineapple is one of the few films that really leaves a trail and makes it difficult to think. Set in India, this film shows the true reality of the division of India. Urmila gets full grades for her beautiful and deeply emotional picture of suffering that has no way to go. Her freedom, personal identity and family respect were taken overnight because of a tragic land dispute. Small bajpai is simply brilliant as her repentant. There are a few moments in a movie that is one to tear. The film at the points is deeply traumatic. Some of the scenes of the remodeling are spine, but Urmila's endurance and survival are remarkable. From a woman who was deprived of her freedom by a woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. An extraordinary movie that should be credited with intelligent characters and narration.
