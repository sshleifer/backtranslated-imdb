This movie is really good. The action that acts as a puzzle forces the viewer to think and guess, which will continue to happen. Such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes the viewer a truly rewarding solution to the puzzle. The battle scenes are very good. There are many different fighting styles (although one of the styles was a little unreal for me, but that's just my opinion) to watch and it's a fascinating shov. The only thing that can be irritating is the appearance of actors. A bit too feminized (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good at kung fu films, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, so "Five Venoms" (or other versions of it) are an excellent choice.
