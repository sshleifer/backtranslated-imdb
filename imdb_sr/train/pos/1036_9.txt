Vatch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films shot during the Second World War. Paul Lukas certainly deserves his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brilliantly as a great actress and beauty as she was. I would recommend this film to those who are interested in that era, and, of course, the fantastic films of the late, great, Mrs. Bette Davis.
