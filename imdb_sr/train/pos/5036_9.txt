Bill Pakton, from Aliens, Near Dark and Terminator, are surprised by my debut as director for Frailti. It strikes all the cylinders, but there's one incredible near-end that involves a FBI agent (Povers Booth) who takes a point from this cool cooler. In addition, this film was perfectly fine. Bill Pakton plays daddy. He was never given a name, but that's not the weakness of the film. It actually strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see it as some kind of symbol. One day he has a vision he sent from God by telling him that the world is nearing its end and that he and his two sons Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeari) and Adam Meiks (Jeremi Sumpter) must punish the demons and kill them. Demons look like normal people killing, and that makes the viewer wonder the question of whether Dad just lost his mind, or really does God's work. There are scenes that reflect both points that contribute to confusion and give the film uncertainty. The story is told in a flashback from one of the sons who are now raised (Matthev McConaughei) and talks with FBI Agent Povers Booth, who is very skeptical and right. After all, it's not daily that someone comes to your office to tell you who knows who the killer is. The film has a lot of reversals, and Bill Pakton greatly manages to hurt us without losing interest. The acting is incredible. The two young leaders and Pakton work great together, they look like a normal family, although they are all involved in murder. As I said, there is an incredible incredible character, which includes the character of the Povers Booth, but this is not really a big deal. This was a very well made movie that included faith and family.
