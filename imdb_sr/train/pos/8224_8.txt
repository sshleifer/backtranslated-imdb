"Toi le Venin" is a masterpiece by Robert Hossein and one of the great thrillers of the fifties. Based on the novel by Frederick Dard, the writer with whom the director often worked (see also "le Monte-Charge", which Hosein did not direct to what he was leading), the scenario welcomes you from the first pictures on the desert road at night where a beautiful blonde could be the strongest of the criminals in a mysterious house where she finds her femme fatale .. and her sister. One of the sisters is in a wheelchair. But is it really invalid? Who is the criminal who tried to kill the hero that night? Two actresses, Marina Vladi and the late Odile Versois, were sisters. Turn off all the lights before watching.
