Now, for all the cinema lovers there, this movie may not be high on the list of things you should see. But if you know about the development of the plot, the deep truth and the intentions of this film (series), you would understand my return. , which can not be expected to know what will happen at the end. But the film is biblically accurate and justifiably "scare" viewers to think about what could be. I am a Christian, not because of this film, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. A film and potential that something similar to the circumstances presented in them can scare somebody to think about their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God, but as a means of attracting your attention. I can look beyond this from the superficiality of fun, acting and budgeting films to appreciate the depth that the film can offer. This is a movie that you do not just need to see, but you feel with your heart and soul.
