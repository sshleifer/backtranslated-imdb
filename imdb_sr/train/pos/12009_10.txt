I really thought they were doing a great job, nothing was wrong with it, I do not know how the first commentator could say that it was terrible, he moved me to tears (I guess everything moved to tears), but I'm trying not to cry at because it's embarrassing, but this one got me. He was a good SOOO! I hope it will publish on DVD because I will buy a copy! I feel like she has restored my faith and gave me the hope that I can not explain it, it made me try to be a better person, they have gone through so much and we presume. Compared with this, I feel that our trials are nothing. Well, nothing, but they hardly fit into what they have to go through. I liked it. Who played Emma?!
