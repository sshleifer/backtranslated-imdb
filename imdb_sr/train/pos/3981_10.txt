This is my fourth short Joe McDoakes, which I've seen so far the most fun. In this, Joe takes voice lessons from the record that starring Charles Boier and Ronald Colman. When he went to Varner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, by accident), he asks Jack Carson for instructions that are confusing. Then he meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes) who speaks with his normal voice that is not far from his later Geroga Jetson and comes to a set where he automatically violates the director. I'll stop there and just say that it was funny to find the whole thing and I was fascinated by the movie stars at the end. The final scene was a special rattling so go to IouTube on that note if you want to watch it so you want to be in Picutres!
