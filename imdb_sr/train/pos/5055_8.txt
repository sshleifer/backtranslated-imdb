I did not expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan like a gray owl? Ah ... but then the story was going on, it took place in a beautiful photographic film. I was surprised and delighted with this (basically) true story. I wanted to read more about this fascinating character, which means that the director fulfilled his purpose, and the film was successful!
