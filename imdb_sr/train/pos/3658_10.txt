This film is like the allegory of the gospel. It has such direct sincerity and innocence that you can not believe that it was created after the World War when Italy was devastated and destroyed, and was filled with a huge homeless, poor population. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as the endless creative resources of that country of inspiration. Toto is a figure like the "Idiot" of the Domenech, modern Christ who finds his way in a big city. He is charity and purity determined by love, and his deeds change the people he encounters, as well as the miraculous dove. The story is told in a natural way and simple style, but it is pervaded by magic that is almost a surprise of Felini's surrealistic fantasies. It's one of the most inspiring films ever made.
