I love and admire the brothers Farrell! How come I only saw this big movie 3 years after its release? It made me smile, it cried and it warmed my heart. On big. It's hard to describe in my broken English - but I have to try it anyway: Actors are great - from leading to supporting roles, acting is excellent, the dialogue is great The film is perfectly focused and mounted. I think Farrelli brothers' movies are often underestimated - they are not easy comedies - they are deeeeeep! They talk about what life is (I will not tell you!). In my case, this movie has confirmed me all the links: You like someone: free them, let them - try to share passion and pain and always stay faithful one to others. I am not a sports hat but definitely a sports nex. . But in this film - vibrations get you. I could feel the baseball atmosphere. Finally, this film has explained to me what a sports fan can mean for you and which cool fan families have to be there. Thank you very much, Pete and Bob! PS / PS: If you did not see it - please look at KINGPIN!
