Pretty warm little film, not just for children. John Thav is brilliant as always (without any insight by Inspector Morse about him). The boy who played Villiam did a good job, although I did not consider him convincing in every scene. I loved the feeling of a small village and a slower pace of life in those times. I also felt that the scenes in London were historically accurate, as far as I could say. It reminded me of the Scandinavian film I had seen a few years ago called Mother of the Mines. In that film, the boy was evacuated from Finland to Sweden during the Second World War. The wife of the family that took him asked the girl because she (as it turned out) lost her daughter. Instead, she completely ignored him. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish complicates things. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed Goodnight g. Tom, it's the same feeling.
