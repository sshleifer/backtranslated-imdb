New York never looked so good! And nobody in this movie has anyone. While the script is a bit easy, you can not help but love this movie or any of the characters in it. You almost want such people to exist. The application of actors is what really turned it all around (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten are particularly good.) Go ahead and rent this movie that you will be glad to be.
