Although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of two shows: "Fire in the Universe" and "Live Legends", if you look at the original shows, you will see that the dialogue from this video edited. I found this video version much better because it added scenes and lines. I would say that if you want to see the show in its original version, see video versions on VHS. They have more to offer a fan than the original episodes now offered on DVD. Another good video was Conquest for Earth, which had more scenes from Galactica 1980 than it was in the show itself. All in all, I estimate this as 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what networks want to show in the time slot given to the manufacturers.
