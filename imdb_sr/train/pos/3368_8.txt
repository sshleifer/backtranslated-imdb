The visit of Hitler to Rome is the background of this gentle story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sofia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stay at home, while her entire family goes to a military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She must stay at home because the family can not afford a maid. He would like to go away while he is together with the entire residential complex in which lives a burning fan of Duce. However, there is one exception. Through the yard, Marcello Mastroianni sits on his chair thinking of suicide. Reason? He is a homosexual and has recently lost the job of the radio spiker. The film really starts when these two happen to meet. Mastroianni is desperate and he needs a hard friend. Loren, frustrated with her own husband's cheating, mistakenly understands Mastroiannia and in a masterly shot, directed and acting scene on the roof of the construction complex, offers her body to him only to be rejected. The initial wedge is soon replaced by its hunger for this man, this antifascist, this homosexual, this other world who is so ready to give her everything she wants. This is a beautifully made movie with two of the most talented actors ever. Loren proves she is a caliber actress when she is well-directed. This is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and what is the most important human condition. Despite his sad ending, there is a glimmer of hope in the outbreak, things will change, someone has realized.
