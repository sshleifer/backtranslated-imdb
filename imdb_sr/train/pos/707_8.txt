I have to be honest and say that I did not see many independent films, but I thought this was very well done. The regime and the cinema were involved without becoming a distraction. Corners, adjustments and lighting that were used successfully created a nightmare in which the main character was trapped. Many of the images from the movie and stunning images are kept in your mind long after it's over (it's always a good director's mark).
