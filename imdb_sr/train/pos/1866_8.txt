A great story, based on the true story of a young blacksmith and all the difficulties on the road. Since this is the first Denzel Vashington film to be directing myself, I must admit that I was a little skeptical, but who would not be ...? But again, he's a great actor with years of experience, and the end result was great. The story is told in a great way, making you have had difficulty in childhood and adolescence, to see yourself in such situations. So it strikes you, allowing you to know that it's not your only one who goes through hell. All in all, a touching story about a young man trying to fit into this world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of this film). 8/10
