A wonderful movie with enough baggage for a sack bag. Parker Posei plays Fai Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, beloved mother who may or may not be what she looks like. The story is a very tongue in the face, and the dialogue is skillfully underestimated. Tips for humor and intrigues, none of which overrides the characterization of Posei is so well withdrawn. Supporters are stellar. Mana? This film needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the movie and making notes. Posei has more sexual attraction in raising eyebrows than most actresses have in the whole body. It's worth your time, even if you do not understand the breakup.
