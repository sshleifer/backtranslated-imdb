Wow this was a movie that was completely enchanting. I could not believe I started awake so late to watch it, but it came to a late lady. Rubi Dee Forrest Vhittaker and James Earl Jones, and many more famous actors and actresses, it was more than an insight into the history that opening the eye to another part of a society that people do not know and perhaps even unpleasant to talk about. I've never heard of a book or a movie about this before, and it's something that black history never pays attention to down only because it was attracted to a mixed race, I recommend this film
