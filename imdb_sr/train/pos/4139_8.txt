I really wonder how this performance plays in UK and the rest of Europe. It's a suicide against an American (especially white Americans). This could be a great reason for some poison and vitriol that is expressed on this board. I love the show, but it's with some reservations and I feel it was easy from the Spoiler Spoiler: To hit and burn everything at the end of the second season. Julie slammed the door for the hope of reviving the show, unless her character fell to the haystack in the middle of a farm. Who knows? It was funny, rude, and occasionally, some sort of terrifying performance.
