Here it is lean, it seems that this is much older than I thought it was. But it's still cool. Cycling machines are cool and the story mostly works. There are some characteristic topics that I hope will be solved in Part 2 and my biggest remark is that it seems to be MACROSS. Not just the style of animation, but also a few characters. For example, all the girls in this film look like LIN MINMAI of MACROSS. The bellows look similar to MACROSS as other characters. This is not really done for young children, has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. To shorten the story, I give this a cool MACROSS knock-off 7 STARS.
