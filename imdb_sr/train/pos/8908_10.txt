First, I did not see "Blob" because I was 7 or 8 years old and watching as an adult was an incredible experience. The pages can be written about her influence on horror films today. And even more could be written on his social background with the 50th "teenage fear". But this simple story of interplanetary horror is still damn fine, horrifying movie if you let it go. Certainly, it looks like it's all raw in our modern world. But "The Blob" is packing into some truly frightening moments when a group of children follows an unstoppable being when adults do not believe it. In fact, there are even quite gloomy moments in the color world of sweets. And Steve McKueen gives much more than a story deserved on paper that viewers are really caught in the moment and believe in him. To sum up, if you can download your postmodern filter for irony, there is much more love than it seems.
