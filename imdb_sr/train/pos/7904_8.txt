If you have ever read and enjoyed the novel by Tom Robbins, you will appreciate this movie as a complete attempt to translate your unusual unconventional style of writing into the work of the big screen. The actors and direction of this film are good. The only trouble with the movie, as I can see, is that Robbins can combine ideas and feelings with their words that were still out of hollywood abilities at the time of this film. Considering the disrespect of today's movies, as well as the readiness and ability of today's audience to get acquainted with the bizarre, I think even Covgirls ... would get a better reception today than it was when it was originally released.
