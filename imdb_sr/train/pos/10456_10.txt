This movie does not deal with entertainment or even the movie you want to pass the time. This film is a true display of true love that can come only from God. A man can not help but he touches deeply by watching this movie. We have several dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this film. There is a divine love that is beautifully depicted. God's love transcends the heart and the mind and lasts and is eternal. There is love in marriage. While the main character is caught up with the pain of his wife, he through the love of God understands that he loves his wife more than he can imagine. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have love for your child and parent. Children in the family come together and realize that nothing is important except that love escapes fear. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know that you love them. Love does nothing good if not given to another. I beg this film to inspire and change the lives of all who see it. Amen !!
