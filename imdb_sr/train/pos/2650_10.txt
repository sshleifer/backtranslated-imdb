Apart from the fact that my list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighti 3) the rest ... this movie is actually better than a book (and TV miniseries, although this is an easy feat, given to the director). The impeccable style of recording, acting and (cricketing skills of all time) music - make it a masterpiece of horror. I watched a TV series a few years ago and I liked the story and I had my hopes about it when I got it. IT BLEV ME AVAI !!! It's much better than I ever imagined. It begins slow (Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime that creates uncertainty. The Intro scene is definitely a classic and I've been watching it about 20 times only for the shearing atmosphere that is causing the entire movie. Also, the movie does not offer much worse (there is enough and not least inexhaustible) trend that I hate in recent horror films. Just watch!
