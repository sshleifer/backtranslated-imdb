The first time I saw this "movie". When I was 11 years old, I was more interested in music and dance. As I grew old, I was increasingly interested in acting. While the first half was just a retrospective of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was still fun to watch. The "Badder" section could have been omitted, although the children were pretty good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were funny, especially when the policeman told Michael, "I need your autograph here," after stopping him for a dance in a dance-free zone. But it's "Smooth Criminal", it's a whip on a cake. Joe Pesci did a great job (and that hair was wild). Dance is perfect, as well as special effects. The only thing I could do without them were spiders. Every fan of Michael would have to see it, if you have not already. I give it 10+!
