Okay, I admit it. I think Kenny Doughty looks incredible in this film - but in spite of the good looks, the film is being transmitted by an sometimes predictable, but reasonable complication. Starting from that, we met with three female films. One director - very concerned about her image and never married. A police officer - with a child and a bad ex-husband to continue. Third - Doctor hungry power and status with a desire for recognition and three former. They are almost "The First Women's Club", and there are indeed many verbal blows of former ones involved as some "Abandoned credit card behavior." Placed characters - the movie continues. McDovell's figure, director, arrived late at the funeral - where the young organist, catching up with a regular player (Doughti), caught the eye. What will her two friends say about the troubles? Will they live happily ever after? Tissue or two recommended if you are a type of teary - the end that raises, but maybe not what you would expect. All in all, an excellent movie that stands out among current actions, special effects and horror horoscopes.
