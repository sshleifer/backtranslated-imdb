I loved this movie. First, because it's a family movie. Second, because it offers a refreshing reflection on dealing with HIV news in the family, with far less hysteria than what I otherwise saw in movies. Brothers are very close, but not condemned. Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble, but in the end it is not necessary. I understand that Leo's choice of how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular among people, but I believed it was the right choice for him. I can not believe this was a French television program. It had great production values. I gave this film ten, and I think you will, when you see it.
