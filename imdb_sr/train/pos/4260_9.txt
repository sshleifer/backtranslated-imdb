After the first work by Fatih Akins, "Im Juli", which was quite good, he created a truly wonderful Italian family epic. It's a German movie, which, unfortunately, is a bad prerequisite, because we rarely produce more moderate movies;). But this film makes some very good recordings of that time. "Solino" refers to an Italian immigrant who arrives in the "Ruhr" region of Germany during the sixties. The immigrant and his family then launched the first pizza restaurant in the region. The characters are great. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling you have. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not good. Well, you do not believe him in the role. But the character is well balanced and perfectly fits into this scenario. I feel the urgent need to compare the style of this film with the style of "Kuma". Many people will probably hate this movie, say its boring. Not much tension? - Yes, but an unheard of film. 9 of 10
