Like all environmental conscious films from the 1970s, SOILENT GREEN has a rather poor view of what ecological melting is. Excessive population means that there are too many people to eat? I had the impression that hunger was caused by a war or an unsuccessful economic policy. Stalin's policy in the Soviet Union in the 1930s left millions of dead for hunger, and to date, the greatest tragedy of man was Mao's rural policy in China, which in the 1950s led to 30 million deaths. And let's not forget the great hunger in the horn of Africa in the 1980s and 1990s, relating to conflicts, not overpopulation. You might also want to consider that the two most densely populated areas on Earth, Hong Kong and Macao have never suffered famine in modern times. Likewise, the expansion of barns around cities, as seen here, is not exclusively related to overpopulation - it is up to the economic factors in which people come to cities to find a better paid job than in the countryside (this is a symptom of industrial progress - not so that the image of the streets of the city of New York is too crowded to walk and people sleep on the stairs is a bit ridiculous. But do not be fooled thinking that the SOILENT GREEN bunch of hooked trees that rattle, because I think it's It's the best environmental film since the 70's a veto of a modern audience where Sol and Thorn are out of their joy of finding fruits, brandy and fresh flesh. Thorn looks at the ice in his whiskey, smokes a cigarette and delivers a classic line. "If I could afford it, I would have smoked two, three times a day. "But this is the vision of the Euthanasia Chamber that is remembered, because Thorn looks at pictures of wild animals, flowers, running water and snow covered mountains, the world's throne of Thorn. This is a very insightful scene that makes SOILENT GREEN a very memorable film, combined with the fact that it contains the ultimate screenplay of Edward G Robinson as a wise old Jew, Sol Roth.
