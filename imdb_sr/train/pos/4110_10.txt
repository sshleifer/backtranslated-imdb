This, and "Hidden Fortress" are the Kurosava that are my favorite. I do not share 10 as sweets, but it certainly deserved, if nothing else. Although it is rather long (as is all Kurosawa), he has tackled a problem that bother me with most of his films; the story is often too loose and slowly evolves, contains scenes that are unnecessary or too lengthy without any real purpose of the story or character's description. Dodessukaden delivered me the same experience as the "Hidden Fortress"; in spite of its length, I would not cut out for a minute. This is also a very unusual Kurosawa movie in a way, there is no story, but many small independent stories that are based on a character description than a story, unlike any other Kurosawa movie I have seen so far. He also rely heavily on a dialogue that brilliantly uses (especially in the story between a father and a son who plans his "new house"). However, what makes this a masterpiece is that an entity that is as tragic as it has been, has managed to be described so humane and compassionate, without finger-pointing at anyone at any time. From the beginning to the end she delivers an entire emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
