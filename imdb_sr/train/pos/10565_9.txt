In 1933, Dick Povell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced through three Varner Brother musicals that offered an audience of depression with the current distraction of their problems. The gold diggers from 1933, the 42nd parade of streets and legs were set up in the world of Broadway theater with the same emission theme. In addition to Keeler and Povella, the films featured Kaleidiskop choreography by Busby Berkelei, shows that stopped recording and many of the same players. All are undoubtedly the classics of their genre, but I must admit a clear propensity for Lighting for the energy and water of James Cagney. Varen Villiam in Gold Diggers and Varner Bakter in 42nd Street are miraculously recognized as the production heads of heads - especially Bakter as a burned Julian Marsh in search of the latest disturbances in the box office. Both of them lack the infectious energy of Cagnei, which perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of setting Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirlwind while dealing with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold-mining girl. Of course, Cagnei alone does not seem to be the Footlight Classic that is. Scenario of a crack with some sharp double sign that comes with a superlative acting set with Frank Mekhju, Hugh Herbert, Gaius Kibia, and especially Joan Blondel, all of which comes down to size. The Busby Berkeley dance numbers are surreal, suggestive, and risky only before the arrival of Hollywood code in 34. Unfortunately, thirty and sometimes would never have seen such a richly-made musical with the grill and foot of Footlight. again. Gentility and morality were sure of that.
