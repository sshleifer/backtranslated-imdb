I've seen this movie, and the show, and I must add that this was the most telling story I've ever seen. Until I saw this film, I was not aware of how terrible it was, and it is probably still for South African children and adults who were and are living in that era. She brought me tears in my eyes and a lot of sorrow in my heart that every human being should fight as if she only stayed alive and to bring children out of that area and to teach them to act and pretend to let them tell their story is simply incredible. This just goes beyond the five stars, I think it's ten. Thank you, Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such an amazing story. Although 12 years have passed since this story has been told, it is still one of the hardest in my heart. If there is a VHS, or a DVD out there on the show, please let me know as soon as possible. PS There was nothing wrong with the children wanting to draw the attention of other countries to their problems and conditions in the hope that someone would have the heart and offer help.
