Great movie about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macie is such a good actor. It was almost a pity to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, which looks like a part of a neurotic sexual object, but there are no pieces to work with him at the level the script was looking for. But he is such a good actor that he stopped by her level to make the scenes work. I very much welcome the throwing of Tracei Ullman as an abandoned woman. Who knew him? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his image higher (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. Macirava's picture of the only situation in which his character is not able to be careful is nothing else until complete mastering.
