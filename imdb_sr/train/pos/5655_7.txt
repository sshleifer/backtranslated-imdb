I watched this show based on what was said to resemble Twin Peaks David Linch - the show I adore. The show quickly begins to lead us into the main characters, and a rather unusual pilot episode is best for me, it is extremely dramatic and really pulls the whole evil side of the show ready for progress during the rest of the season. My biggest criticism was that I was a little disappointed before the performance - probably not because of my own fault, because it was canceled after just one season, it seemed to show great potential and deserved much better treatment than it got. The acting is great, and this show has some of the best characters (good and evil) in it that I have ever seen and which are well developed in a short period of time. There are a few weird effects for the first five or ten shows that are a bit dramatic, but this is corrected as the season progressed. It's worth watching, definitely something unusual!
