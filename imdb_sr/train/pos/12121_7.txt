The characters of Somerset Maugham were revived in RKO "Human Bondage"; but the film is too skeletal version of the novel, with the performances of the star Bette Davis that draws all the energy. Otherwise, this is the story of Leslie Howard (as Philip Carei); dreams of becoming a painter, but he was told that he had no talent for art. As the movie progresses, Mr Howard's fight, instead, becomes a doctor. His efforts seem to indicate some bad artistic advice; Although he was successful in medicine, his picture seemed easier - also, bear in mind the symbolism of his disability, "club leg" (explained in the film). By the way (right now, in this version) Howard gets in love with the waitress Davis (like Mildred Rogers). Davis's characterization of "Mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in spectacular speech, when she, among other things, tells Howard that she had "VIPs MY OUT!" after kissing him. Howard also works well, but the story does not explain his long-lasting fascination and love for Davis; So, their performances are futile. Still, movie to watch acting, including some good players. Characterization Bette Davis was famous for inspiring her writing campaign for the Best Actress Award from 1934. For the record, she was the third. The results were: 1. Claudette Colbert - "It Happened One Night" 2. Norm Shearer - "Barrets of Vimpole Street" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > 3. Bette Davis - "Of Human Bondage" 4. Grace Moore - "One Night of Love" ******* Of Human Bondage (6 / 28/34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
