As someone who has never been involved in sports, it seems to me that it would be hard for me to get into football (or how Americans call it unexplained, football) - "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say, this was a cool movie! Indian-born Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her VASP friend Juliette Pakton (Keira Knightlei) love to play football (yes, I'll say it's British - and internationally) and I love David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents do not approve (her mother offers a really confused description of the football early in the movie). Ok, maybe it was some clich√© in that sense, but you have to love this movie! And if you are like me, you go to this film without knowing the definition of the "band" in football ... do not worry, the movie explains (I also never heard of David Beckham before this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley hit him: a few months after "BILB" came out in America, she was playing in the equally cool "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl".
