Deliriousli romantic comedy with interlaced subplots that mesh nice and actors who bounce lines each other with precise comedy time, a feat that is nice to watch. When Sherin's homeless fianc√© asked to help him reconcile with his alienated, craving younger brother, no one could have dreamed of the consequences that followed. Operational symbolism, the confession of the Catholic Church, in love with love and falling snow ... "The moon" is timeless and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes to start the rhythm of the picture (there is an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs in a grave that is a bit rough and the next scene with Cosm and an old man at the gate that looks dizzy), but the patchwork plot is intertwined with skillful skill, and the clumsy tone of the film and the silly spirit are contagious. *** 1/2 from ****
