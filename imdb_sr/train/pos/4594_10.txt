The best martial arts movie ever made. This film is better than anything Bruce Lee ever did. Classic with a totally entertaining and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and is the real king of kung-fu. It is a pity that Bruce Lee was so overwhelmed that Jackie Chan needed the full eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie rules !!!!
