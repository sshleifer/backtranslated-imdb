This film could have been a mute movie; it certainly has the feeling of one. I was very happy to see this very rare version of this movie. Ektase is a 'symphony of love' and goes beyond all language versions. French, which is the ultimate romantic language, seems perfectly suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version. Young Hedi Lamarr illuminates the screen, in this film, which is almost as almost as a sexual fantasy; but definitely far from pornographic. Technical quality may have been a bit rough; but it does not diminish the magic spell that this movie is eating. Many early movie lovers would absolutely love this movie.
