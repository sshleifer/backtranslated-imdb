Another entry into the "Holidai Horror" category that fills the shelves of your local video store. The perpetrator who refuses to 'cool' children who hurt him will be known to those who have already seen it. And those who have already seen it will probably look at it again; those who expect Ingmar Bergman, who will later be bitter about their lost time, should skip this. Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl as an eye-catcher - go along with it and enjoy. Oh, and I loved a creepy mask.
