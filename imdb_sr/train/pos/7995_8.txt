This is a true story about the revenge of the bad guys with the inexorable and rude Denzel Washington. He's three personalities here: a down-abandoned-now drunk-an ex-mercenary, then a kind person of a little girl's father, and then a brutal maniac at liberty seeking answers and revenge. The story is about Washington who is engaged to be a bodyguard of a small American girl living in Mexico, where kidnapping of children (at least to the film) happens regularly. actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is abducted in front of him, Washington goes to responsible people and does not save anyone. Beware: this movie is not funny. This is a modern movie that is good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people thought it was too frenetic for their tastes, because working on the camera was one that could give you a headache. I thought it fit into a tense story and it's fascinating to watch, but it's (camouflaging camera) not for all tastes. Apart from the two stars, there is always interesting Christopher Valken, in the unusually low key role, as well as a great number of other fine actors. Film encourages basic emotions in all of us, but it works.
