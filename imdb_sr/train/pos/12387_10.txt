Of all the films of the seventies, none of them grasped the true essence of good against the evil battle, as Sentinel did. I think that there were films like exorcists and others; but none of them captured the human element of a protagonist like this one. If you have time, check this. You may not be able to go past dated devices as such, but this is a story worth following. Then there are all the stars and soon the future stars. My absolute favorite was Eli Volak, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are subtle traces leading to what is happening. Pay attention. I had to watch him four times to understand less and less strange statements such as 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. In addition, the books are really good. I'm just sorry that he will not turn the other book into a movie. It's so scary to outdo this movie.
