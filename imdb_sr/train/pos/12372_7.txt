Sentinel is a movie that my father recommended a few years ago, and since then I've seen him many times. He always succeeds in entertaining me, and at the same time he is creepy. The flashback scenarios are what really did for me. Father Cristine Raines ran around everywhere, with two lovely women, he always managed to send the cold down my spine. it's your typical good and evil thing, but at least it's just fun. A place that I consider to be one of the best in the history of horror. She has many shocks and uncertainties when she sees that Burgess Meredith has done her things like Chazen to put me on the edge of her seat. Sentinel has the perfect tension. We are never completely comfortable whenever Allison is on the screen. We know that something terrible is always waiting, and that made things even more tense. This movie is often ignored among horror fans, but I personally think it's one of the best out there, and certainly it's enough for all fans of Horror to be happy. Performances. Cristina Raines has her wooden moments, but she came, though in a great way, mostly. It's beautiful to watch, and her chemistry with Saranadon was natural. Chris Sarandon is great as a boy, Michael. He had the current presence of the screen and I could not but love him. Martin Balsam, Jose Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Silvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreifuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have unforgettable roles or small thumbnails. Burgess Meredith is as great as Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we've learned is absolutely terrifying. Eli Roljak and Christopher Fienne are working well, like messy detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has one cold scene, which I will not spoil. Bottom line. Sentinel is an effective movie about a horror that fans of the horror, unfortunately, ignore. It will give you the excitement and the fears you need to satisfy. Well worth a look. 7/10
