LES CONVOIEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt that I will see this year better. This beautiful tragicomedy of the Belgian director Benoit Mariage is in the industrial wilderness of Wallonia. Benoit Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to get a car (Lada!) For him. To do this, the son must break the door to open the board. What father really wants his son to be, because he never went further as a reporter for local newspapers, ironicly called L'Espoir (Hope). Of course, nothing works as planned. This film can best be compared with Aki Kaurismaki DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and humorous. Just like in this film, however, the tone is more melancholy than depressive and ultimate optimism, and it is not unrealistic to be happy. Humor is absurd, and the action does not seem incredible, and Mariage finds stunning images in dark settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about the LES CONVOIEURS ATTENDENT is Poelvoorde. This actor celebrated with the brilliant cult classic C'EST ARRIVE PRES DE CHEZ VOUS, in which he played the charismatic killer Ben. Since then, he has only played two small roles in films that have not been published in the Netherlands, because, as he said in the interview, he was not convinced of his own acting skills, and all the roles offered to him were replayed by Ben. With his return to the leading role in the LCA, there should no longer be any doubt about his performance. He is simply brilliant as a man stupid enough and vile to put his family in trouble, but smart enough to understand what he did and to disrupt it. She must see.
