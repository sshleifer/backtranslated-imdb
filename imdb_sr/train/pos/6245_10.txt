"Hundstage" is the first Seidle feature film (before that he directed large documentaries like "animal love" or "models"). Seidl has been working on this project for more than 3 years, but only cost about $ 2 million. actors are very good, especially unprofessional actors who almost played themselves. the entire movie is shockingly disturbing and some scenes can be too much for "ordinary" viewers. The film shows a lot of sex and violence, but also that people are lonely and unable to communicate with each other. I finally have to say that this is one of the best and most successful Austrian films in recent years. please forgive my bad English. <br /> <br />
