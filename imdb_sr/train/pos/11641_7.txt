I just grabbed an episode of Brad, a crack cocaine addict who, after his bicycle career, turned to the life of drug addicts on the streets that began to collapse. I must say that the story of his bicycle career was defeated by his drug addiction. Here is this young guy who wins the races left and right and is called to train with the training team for the Olympic Games for two weeks, and immediately after arriving, he offends Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes he has ever lived, and is generally impolite and hostile to everyone at all. Understandably, he was soon asked to leave. Much of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he regained his life, but what I wanted to know is what is wrong with him in the first place to make his act like that ass? In any case, I was confused about how the show was made, because it shows Breda at the height of her addiction. We see pictures of his pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and goats, and even smoking cocaine. I did not even know it was legal to show, but why would the cameramen just follow and record it? Do they do it in the hope that this guy will turn his life and give them some materials for a good TV episode? In any case, it is an enlightening performance, because it shows the effects of different addictions and complete control that can take on human lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch, because you really see how the family and friends are starving with the lack of interest of addicts, although I must admit that in the end it all seems to be too clean. There are moments in episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn the spoiler here, everything has a bit of a happy feeling at the end, and I have a feeling. that this is a very rare occurrence in real life. But still, it is a notion of people who are trying to help other people, and you can never overly complain about such things?
