I do not know which movie one of these people watched, but they certainly saw a different "Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration" than I've seen. I think the film was both well done and inspiring. I think it's worth watching. It is obvious from the very beginning that much attention was devoted to the creation of this film. The background scenario is wonderful. I think this film well describes Joseph Smith as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are presented with taste and respect. <br /> I would recommend that I watch this movie.
