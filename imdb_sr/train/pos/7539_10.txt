I really enjoy watching this movie. like most people who watched it. I was not sure I would get it. Vhoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and has made many funny films; ie. sister plays. However, this was not really a comedy. It's a drama with comical moments. So if you're looking for a mess of laughter then keep looking. This film is about a black family moving from a beautiful neighborhood in a city to a neighborhood of a higher middle class. I would say more, but I think it would spoil the film. this film deals not only with racial relations between whites and blacks, but also with relations with the black community. I think it's worth the chances. if you're not interested in another racial film, this movie is not for you
