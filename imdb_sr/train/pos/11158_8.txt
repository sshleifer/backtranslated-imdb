A shocking, well-built refrigerator is an underestimated story of terrible killings and evil forces. The Doctor from a small town is trying to discover who, or what, makes a series of violent sexual assassinations. <br /> <Incubus is a tight mystery, with some terrible sequences of murders, which are being built into an off-beat and a ghostly climatic twist. Scene killings are intense and bloody, so this is not a nasty movie! The regime of John Hollow, together with a bizarre music partner, combines to create a dark atmosphere of fear that passes through the film. It also carries some kind of Gothic vibration. Beautiful shooting locations and some modern camera work are also highlighted. No actors are bad. The great John Cassavetes works solidly as a new doctor in the city. Kerri Keane as a local reporter, Helen Hughes as a city historian, and Duncan McIntosh as a tortured teenager are also good performers. Everywhere around Incubus is a forgotten horror movie to be re-discovered and re-evaluated. *** from ****
