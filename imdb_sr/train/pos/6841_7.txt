This is probably one of the most famous films of Brian De Palme, but that's not the best thing for him. Be Double, Fury and Carrie are better movies, but this film is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very influenced by Hitchcock and this film is a flight to Psicho. Angie Dickinson is a boring housewife who is thinking of the affair and after her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, rejects the offer, Dickinson meets a man in the art gallery and she comes down with him. After this moment, it's best that you do not know what's going on, but there's a murder, and Nancy Alen is a girl calling for a killer look. Dennis Franz is a detective in a case that does not really trust Allen and she has to find the killer herself. It's a pretty good movie, but it's not one of the best in De Palma.
