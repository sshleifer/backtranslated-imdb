I only saw this show several times, but it will live in my memory. It is very frustrating that it's so hard to find it anywhere to buy, and there seems to be an endless replay of things like Friends! Especially harder to get in England, I suppose ..? They say it was a low grade or was it a complaint by the Bakersfield PD itself? Maybe it was too smart for some people? In any case, it's just about a comedy I'd like to see again, but it's almost impossible to find. Do I hear being heard or being repeated on another network? But, unfortunately, not here !! Summary: Genial.
