It was said that Deanna Durbin invented a teenager. This first film was one of the best. A funny story presented the beautiful 14-year-old Deanne, a little beauty with a beautiful voice, like Miss Fikit in a divorced family. For a summary, look at other IMDb entries, but quickly Deanna and her two older sisters are planning to go to America from Switzerland to prevent their father from getting married again. With great support, especially Barbara Read and Nan Grey as sisters, a good direction and erection, the movie manages to captivate even in subsequent shows. From Deann's three songs, only "Il Bacio" is from the classic repertoire, but when it sings on the scene of the police station, the place of the film in history is secured. At least for this viewer, who at 15 was impressed with his life with Dean and classical music. One of the many nice touches that go through THREE SMART GIRLS is a quick look at the drunk who stretches his neck for the last look at Dean while the cops are pushing him! The unfortunate result of the success of this film was that later writers for Durbin vehicles closed in the subject "Miss Fikit", which soon became obsolete. Deanna has never been alone. Her role as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me, like many other film personalities, to replace "naturalness" for the histrionic abilities that she missed. That job worked well for 21 feature films.
