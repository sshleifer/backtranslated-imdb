What are you doing with a 14-inch porn star that was involved in drugs and murders, and then died of AIDS? Make the movie, of course. The probable reason why this has not been done before is the fact that Eddie Nash would be on the way to his production. So it's no coincidence that the film was filmed just after Nash was sent to prison. The best thing in the movie is its fast pace. Do not waste time on unnecessary shit. And why would that be? There is too much material here that requires scenes of boring fill. Kilmer was central in a series of films, and finally it was quite suitable for him. Bosworth is cute, so it's irrelevant how she behaves (solid), and McDermott, who is otherwise quite boring, is pretty good, to a large extent because she wears so much hair on her face that I did not recognize it initially. (I wish they did it to Cruise in every movie so I would not have to watch his stupid face.) I completely failed to recognize Christina Applegate, and I would not know she was in her, if I had not seen her name the ultimate credits. Kudrov is charming as always, somewhat unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (BTV, "Friends" is the worst TV series of all time.) The only throw-away choices were early-conceived Carrie Fischer and completely absurd involvement of moron Janeane Garofalo. You thought I'd include Paris Hilton, would not you? No, I think Hilton is an ideal choice in his 10-second look like a dumb whore. Because the film is about decadence, among other things ?? and about the porn actor? it fits perfectly.
