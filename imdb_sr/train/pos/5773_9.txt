Since I'm so interested in lake monsters, I've really dug up this movie. This movie is worth seeing. If you like it so horrible, these are good types of movies. The effects are really good, as are "Land of the Lost". I originally watched this movie in the early 1990s, perhaps more like 89/90 at the local Morgus Presents show. I was not afraid, but I was eight years old and everything I felt B was like A. Years later I saw it on a DVD in the local Circuit Citia and immediately bought it so I could give it 9 because it has a personal place in my heart right there with Monster Squad and Gremlins. A good movie B is fun for all ages.
