I am a fan of Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen all of them and this is one of the best! It's funny, romantic and classical. I recommend this for all ages. It's great for little children because it's good, Cinderella and great for adults and teenagers because it's funny and not over the top. I watched him when I was a kid and I'm watching him now. It has big lines that I quote my family and me. The acting is great and never aging. If you love fairy tales and romance you will love this. I watched many Cinderella movies in their time and this is the best of all. (I'm sorry Disney) I recommend this film and all the shows from Faerie Tale. They all attract all ages and they are all unique and very fun.
