This film is without a doubt the perfect 10/10. For all of you who rated there low ratings there because there is no "good plot" or anything like that, it's ridiculous, saying that the movie, Jackie Chan is bad for his actions is like saying porn movie is bad, because there is no plot! You watch Jackie Chan for combat scenes, because the action is not so focused on a good story or something like that, if you look at how he is filming movies and comparing them with other American movies from that era, and later you will realize that Jackie Chan movies had the most scenes and not pretty good stories, while American films had good stories, but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at that time. Pornography is viewed for pornography, Jackie Chan is seen for ACTION, I think you've rated people poorly because there is no plot because you think it's how a smart movie critic reviews a good movie, but the way I see it is a good movie is a movie who can entertain me. Of course, the middle of the film was boring, VERY DARK, but so is the rest that all the action scenes and stops paid for a lot. This changed the way American animation films were produced, even had stolen scenes from this film. If you want a real man, a real entertainer, then watch this movie and much more from Jackie Chan, he's clean anyway. It literally makes American films look like a walk around the park, even in DANAS movies. American films rely heavily on special effects and security wires and pairs of couples and much more. The police story and many other films by Jackie Chan represent parts of a true entertainer who just go out and is very talented in what he can. masterpiece
