It turned out to be classical production with what was certainly a small budget. The diversity of characters is incredible, from dwarfs who hold axes to 7ft vampires! I enjoyed the relationship between tracks, not too sentimental, but romantic enough to keep interest. I also enjoyed a mixture of humor (which can be very easily misguided, too / insufficiently) which meant it did not become too dark or too fake. It was a big step from Eaves's other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of story and production. They have a great site worth checking out. I can not wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
