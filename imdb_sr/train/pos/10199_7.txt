As a child, I loved this game. In the spring of 1993, I played zillion times with my friend Andrew. I used to play Akela or Blaze, and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played him, we were never bored. Then the Streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that this existed. You play as former policemen Akel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who left the force to take the bad guys in their way. There are 8 levels to work in a worn and corrupt city headed by a foe. Level 4 (Most) was my fave, because you could throw the villains down the hole in the river. You even have the opportunity to become Mr. X's right hand at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to a 'bad end' in which you become the head of the union. As far as possible, the mystery is because you are destroying the union on the way to Mr. X, but it does not matter. Streets Rage also has really fantastic music. Composer Iuzo Koshiro has done absolute wonders with the limited technology Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss, are exceptional melodies. As the owner of Vii, I am proud to have this on my console forever. But with the Streets of Rage 2 also exists, the first seems to be a bit obsolete. panel progression that matches the tone of the game. Excellent ringtones. It's easy to get in and it's hard to get down. Cons: <br /> Very inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2. Bad AI enemies. Bad people often leave you instead of embarking on a fight. The lack of combined moves. Lack of decent weapon. Models of bad guys are repetitive far too often. Graphics B- Sound A- Game B- Permanent Appeal B-
