As an prototype of the classic adventure movie Errol Flinn and good stories, as well as two great co-actresses in Maureen O'Hara (which is remarkable beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, this film can be recommended only to those who even have the slightest taste for romance and adventure . Hollivood at its best!
