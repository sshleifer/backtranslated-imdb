Not at the same level as Ring (or Ring 2), but still a good Japanese horror. I wish that horror producers in North America would take a page from the Japanese form of horror and put more 'spooks' and less costly shocks in their shifts. Many good examples in this, the scenes in which the face is faded, the scene that looks behind the young actress, the photos on the wall suddenly appear smiling, for a moment and much more. It's worth checking if you like the genre.
