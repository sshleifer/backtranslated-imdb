In my honest opinion, everyone should see this film at least once. He really put things in perspective while I watched them. Although he was fictitious, this film talks about something that could happen to your children. It shows how easily two children can hide their hatred for their school and their plans for killing innocent students. This film would not work in any other format. Perfectly they pulled out the camera from the hand. Recalls us on April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dilan Klebold killed 12 students, and then them themselves. It also reminds us of the media storm that followed it. Everyone wanted to see Rampart video and everyone wanted to see cellars. This film is a fictional version of our dreams that is being realized. We see a kid behind the monster. The only bad thing about this movie is that it did not go well on the market, and few people know it existed. Had he had an overview on a single film, everyone would go to see what it was about, Zero Dai. I believe this is the best film adaptation of school shooting. of the few who really tried it. Recording only takes about ten minutes to an hour and a half of a long film, because it focuses mainly on Cala and Andrea, and what they did to that moment. If you have not seen this yet, rent it and watch it. I guarantee that when you're finished, you'll be left without a word.
