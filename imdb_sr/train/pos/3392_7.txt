This was a very thoughtful film, especially for 1973. After the 1970s it seemed to be forgotten, but its central messages were too important to completely disappear. It was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time ... no one ever heard of the greenhouse effect before 1985. The controversial subject of euthanasia is rarely worn out. Sets and special effects may look a little outdated, but big money for sci fi movies was gambling during that period. If you look at it better, you will see that everything usually makes sense. This is a movie about the message, not for star lovers with stars that can not go through a minute of stimulating thought if it does not contain millions of dollars worth of explosions. his famous dystopian sci-fi trilogy. After that everything was flooded with catastrophic epics, and the big budget audience was pleasant to the garbage. This may not be the most entertaining two-hour film ever made, and the ending can be creepy and depressing, but it's hard to find any movie producer with the courage to deal with such a topic.
