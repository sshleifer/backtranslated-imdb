When tradition requires the artist to transfer his great skills and magic to his successor, an old and very proud street performer, known to everyone as the "King of masks," becomes desperate for a young man who is adopted and nurtured. His warmth and humanity consider that he pays a few dollars for a small person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case, massive floods of the 1930s. He takes his new, 7 year old companion to his straw boat to live with his precious and beautiful monkey, "General", only to discover that the child is a child. His Life is currently transformed, because the love she feels towards this little girl becomes entangled in an enthused tradition that requires him to transfer his art to only a young man. In this book there are many stories. ... many people are touched, and Chinese culture opens for our western eye to observe. Thousands of years of inheritance are reduced to a drama school, and few will leave this DVD with a dry eye. The technical transfer itself is not as great as I found the sound levels of every meter, and I could see the video transmission lines in several parts of the movie. Highli recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
