Secret Kelsa is a movie I've been waiting for years after I saw some early recordings at the Cartoon Cartoon in Kilkenny. I'm here to tell you it was worth the wait. The cartoons are very stylized, but not boring, as I was afraid. The whole movie is a matter of beauty and great imagination, I especially love an animated, illuminated book in which small pages come alive on the page. The characterization is excellent, I love Brendan Gleeson's voice as a fodder, and I especially liked the voice of the Aisling sprite. Forest is a triumph, so a wonderful place. The story is well realized, a mixture of facts and fantasy. and really attracts the viewer to cheer Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book. I am already a fan of calligraphy and illumination, so the topic is close to the heart, but all the people I know, who have seen this and who are not fans of the craft, agree that this is a nice little movie. I will definitely buy a DVD when it's released, and I would like to say, well-made Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. Let them be much more. :) Going back here to say I bought several copies of DVDs as soon as I could and I gave them for Christmas, everyone loves him! And I wish them all the happiness in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nominated.
