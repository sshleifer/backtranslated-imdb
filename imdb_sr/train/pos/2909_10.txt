I love Paul Macartney. He is, in my opinion, the greatest of all times. However, I could not afford a ticket for his concert at Toulouse Cup during his return to the US tour. I was upset at the very least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as there. Paul is still a man and I will enjoy him for years. I have one complaint. I'd like to hear everything from Hey Jude. Paul is not dead either. One of the biggest concert DVD ever. ** ** from *****.
