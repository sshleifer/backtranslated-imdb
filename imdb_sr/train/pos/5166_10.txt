Indian Summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I thought it was funny, cordial and absolutely loved! Anyone who went to the camp as a child and wants to occasionally return to the "Good Ole Days" for a short time should really see this! It starts 20 years later, a group of old campers returns to "re-gathering". I will no longer comment on the action because you have to see it yourself. The actors were brilliant and contained all the actors of the stars. Everyone in it played a great role. You really felt like you were part of a movie watching him. Alan Arkin was particularly good in the role of Uncle Luo. He plays the kind that everyone wants in his life. This is also a good family movie. I would suggest this to everyone in a moment! Recommended!
