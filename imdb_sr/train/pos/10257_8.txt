What can I say about this film that has not already been told? So to tell the truth, much looks very fake as some of the blows and blows. like Charlie Sheen, although this really was not what I knew. I'm sure it will be hitting and hitting her much harder if she is. however, scattering scenes and hot oil look very realistic. and the last eye in the eye is incredibly made and probably the only thing on a movie that has ever shocked me.
