This is perhaps the best short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is great, especially Amanda Burton, whose character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad, and then ... She works an incredible job balancing Rachels / Carlas feelings and acting on the pain of someone who has lost a child, so it probably feels more as a real life story than a drama. Other actors, of course, are also great, which are usually in British TV / film. The ending, which I will not give, is fantastic mainly because you do not get it ... (you will get what I thought after you saw it). and again and if you do not touch, you are one cold heart.
