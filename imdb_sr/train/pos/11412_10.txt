It was beautifully and intelligently played by two young girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie, and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel, although the plot is quite developed with imagination. Young Hazel, who compete for the mayor, seems unreasonable to be honest. Though the acting is well done by all concerned, the film tends to miss the true drama atmosphere. Maybe we have become the expected big reality in movies, rather like to compare Polianna with Green My Valley! It does not matter, each one is good in his own way. I admire Joan Plovright even if her role here is somewhat dimmed. The center of travel is suitable for younger viewers, and as it's sometimes nice to be exposed to fine classical music, which is almost rare! I consider this film a welcome change because it reflects the quiet, thoughtful values ​​for years of growing up, and without violence we thank goodness. Warm family movie to enjoy.
