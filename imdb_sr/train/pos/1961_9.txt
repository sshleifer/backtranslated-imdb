I just got back from the first performance of Basic Instinct 2. I went into it thinking that it would be crazy based on critical reviews and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Instinct, I think you'll enjoy # 2 as much, if not more. A great story that always keeps you and thinks. Music is great, it is again the original theme. Do not expect Oscar material, go to see it for enjoyment and fun. That's what movies are designed for - escapism. I can not think of a better way to escape than to get away with Sharon Stone, which is as sexy as it used to be. I'm thinking about seeing him again this weekend. Go see!
