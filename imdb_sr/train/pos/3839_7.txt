Most people know Paul Verhoeven as directors of many good (and bad) science fiction films in Hollywood. But a long time ago, he performed generic thrillers in his home country. The story is the basic femme fatale premise, nothing new or enchanting. Verhoeven thinks he can better add to a series of dream sequences, which instead of defining our main character and his situation, serve only as a way to move forward predictable plots. The scenario was solid, a dialogue that helped alleviate the effects of a bland story. What made the movie at least good was great acting. Jereone Krabbe was incredible as a "tortured artist", and the fans were very good. Also, Jana De Bonta's cinema gives the film at least a bit of life, helping Verhoeven look the least capable as a director. 6.5 / 10 <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
