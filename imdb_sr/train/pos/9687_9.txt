Speaking parakeet is not an extremely imaginative idea for a new film, but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant, hearty movie that will delight the whole family. She manages to bridge the gap between sentimental rubbish and cruel roughness during Marie and Paulie's separation, and all of the events in the film lead to a very satisfying emotional conclusion. Animal training is well done - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads wings and flying for the first time. Paulie was a great character and was supposed to get more success, although this film was not the highlight of 1998, unlike Saving Private Rian. This hour and a half will surely be pleasant and the one you will remember. Paulie's story is mobile, sad, happy and interesting - from the moment he was first seen until he was united with his original owner, you will enjoy it and watch him learn about friendship and the dark reality of life. You do not miss anyone if you have any heart or emotion. 9/10
