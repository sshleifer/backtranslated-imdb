Faith and mortality ... viewed through the lens of an elderly Jewish-American Mr. Ashkenaz and the younger, African-American Jewish gentleman who wandered between the conflict and frank discussions about how their lives developed over the years. Mostell's figure is tailor with chronic back problems and incurably sick woman; Whitefonte's character is a career hysteria, never getting on a regular job, and a fatal traffic accident leaves him in an unusual purgatory - he must persuade Mostel to restore his faith, as he collapsed along with his wife's health (and his own health)) .. but Belafonte's Levine has her problems, still complaining about the girl he left behind. The belafonte character leaves the movie before it seems to be, so the ending is mysterious, and the movie is a bit of a ambiguous ending .. This is not a 'typical' an 'Hollywood movie about ethnic relations or a crisis of faith .. is worth watching multiple times and appreciating the excellent performance of the main actors ..
