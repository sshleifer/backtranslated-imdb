It should be unlawful not to experience this extremely funny stand up shov with Eddie Murphi. I've never seen anything like that. Murphy takes almost 70 minutes on dick, pickles, boobs and accidents by so many known people, including his "family". Among the people who receive it are Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brovn. I've never really laughed so much about anything in my life. I mean, when a person does not know who Mr. T is, but still laughs at Murphy as Mr. T, there is something about it. At the time I saw the show, I could not remember who Mr. T. he was, but he still laughed. Now I know who he is and it's just so much more fun. Because this is what Eddie does - he can make your impressions so good that it does not matter who is trying to do it, it's still funny. And on top of everything, we learn that Murphi is actually a good singer. Please watch him.
