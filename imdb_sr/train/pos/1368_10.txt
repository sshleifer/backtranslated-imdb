Okay. This has been a favorite since I was 14 years old. Permitted, I do not watch it anymore more than once a year, but ... This is not a movie for older generations that want a deeper meaning or a luminous message. This film is FUN. It's pretty outdated, almost passable, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's amazing. If you want to be fascinated by the 90's Breakfast in Tiffany, attended by ninety raves, or you like Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, do not be tormented.
