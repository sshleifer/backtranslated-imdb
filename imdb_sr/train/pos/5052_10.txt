This is a great movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural way of life, most of them know him, winter, canoeing, hunting, hunting, and so on. It's easy to get known as hello for almost, but after a few times I looked at this movie, it grew on me. to expand the story. Brosnan is well illustrated by a complex man, very fine performance. Annie Galipeau is awesome in her first big role. The rest of the plaster is solid.
