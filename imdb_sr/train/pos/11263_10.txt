This is a great show! I had a US history teacher in a high school that was like this. There are many "facts" in history that are not entirely accurate and Mr. Vuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable. even the public will appreciate a humorous way to discover some of the most famous misconceptions in the history of the world and try to impress them with the brains of their students. The use of live actors who perform "sketches" is also very fun. I recommend this series to all who are interested in having a history they have learned as a child.
