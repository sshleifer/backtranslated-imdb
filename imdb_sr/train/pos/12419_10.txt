I love this movie as nobody else. The second time I will try to explain his virtues to non-entrepreneurs, but for now let me quote a few parts of exceptional dialogue, which, remember, is the whole language in the face. Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else - well? (The title song lyrical) "he can sink a beer, he can choose kueer, in his latest double breasted Bondi equipment." > (Another song) "All rituals are bastards, bastards, or even worse, and England is the ** e-hole of the universe." (during the television interview "arti program"): Mr. Mackenzie, who were most impressed by your artists since you were in England? (Barri's answer) Flamin's bik-artists! (Speaking with a naive young girl's pomp): Mr. Mackenzie, I suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servicemen in Australia? (Barry's answer) Abos? I've never seen Abo in my life. Mum works most of the hard shafts (ie Heavy work) around our place. This is just a taste of the funny farce of this Aussie movie bonser. If you can get a copy, watch and enjoy.
