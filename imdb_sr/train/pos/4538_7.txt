I did not even want to watch this movie after I read Maltin's review and grade 1 1/2. In any case, I watched him on the advice of my son and found him much better than I expected. I would give her 2 1/2 stars from a 4-star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand everything. If you do not know much about religion, much will be missed. I graduated from high school in the year when the film was filmed, so it may be better to treat it. Yes, there are some pretensions in the film, and this is strange to some extent, but it was the seventies, so what do you expect? I can see why people do not like the movie; However, I can not understand people who say it's boring. The film is just not boring. Or you will hate him or love him. If you're bored, you're probably dead.
