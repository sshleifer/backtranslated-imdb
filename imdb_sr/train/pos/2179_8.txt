Prik de Beaute was made at the very top of the change from silence to sound, which came a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as inaudible, it was released with an acoustic background in France, with French actress Louise Brooks, but released as quiet in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was lucky enough to see the impeccable new restoration of the Italian German press Cineteca di Bologna at the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not yet seen the version of the talkie, but I think it's safe to assume that the silent version is much more satisfactory, because all the reports synchronize badly (Louise Brooks speaks English clearly, so there's no way her lips can be. Also, the movie was made in a quiet style, with few titles and little need for dialogue. Prik de Beaute speaks his story visually, with exciting, imaginative work with cameras. The opening is currently kinetic, with quickly cut out scenes of urban life and swimmers swimming on a public beach. The movie is highlighted visual detail, clothes, machinery, decoration and symbolic images such as a bird in a cage, a bunch of broken photographs, a diamond bracelet. This is a quiet film technique at its peak. Luiz Bruks is, of course, responsible for Keeping the film out of ambiguity, seeing it just heartbreaking to reflect that it was her last major role. Greatly beautiful, she dominates the film with her charisma and gives a perfectly natural but highly-filled performance. Her role here, more than in Pabst's films for which she is best known, is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with. The cast of Lucienne Garnier, a typist with a possessive fiancé, who eager to get out of life and secretly enter the beauty contest, with immediate success. She was then torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for a man who insists that she let herself or loose it. All the characters are drawn with a shade. Verenica inspires pity and is not only rude: he loves Lucienne, but he is a limited man who can not cope with his life separated from him or attract the attention of other men. Even the "other man" in the story is not a simple slimeball for which we first guide him, although his intentions can be equally as impressive as a fiancé. ********** *************** WARNING: SPOILERS YES ************* **** The film has many fine sets of pieces, including Lucienne's triumph at the Miss Europe competition, shown through the comical reactions of various members of the audience, who finish heroin with flowers; her misery as a housewife, the potato peeling while the cockle of the coward marks the time behind her; a night trip to the entertainment fair (in a silent version, this happens late in the film, after her marriage) when Lucienne, crushed between the low life and depressed by the husband's cat of antiquity, decides that she can not exist at her present existence; and especially the last scene in the projection room where she is watching her screen test. Louise Brooks may never have looked more beautiful than here, a beam of projectors flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders covered with white fur, and her face was under black hair while she watches her singing on the screen. The double shot of her extraordinary corpse and her still-on-screen image is particularly fierce: the image of Louise Brooks, as well as Lucienne, remains immortal despite her frustrating interrupted film career.
