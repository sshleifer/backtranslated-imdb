This short film that rewards the Oscars can be ranked among the greatest genres. Absolutely free of dialogue, it is a visual treat of a young man buying golden fish, lovingly places him in a bowl, then goes to school, leaving the golden fish unprotected and the window open-mindedly open. After a while, the neighboring orange tabs are piercing, entering the window and slowly entering the bowl. The fish obviously knows that something is happening and it gets very excited. As the cat approaches the vessel, the fish pops out. The cat catches the fish, throws it back into the bowl and comes out of the window that entered just as the boy, without knowing what happened, returns. This was incredibly captured by real animals; How Cousteau has led these animals to behave in this way is remarkable. I just want this film now available to people to see; I only saw it once, in 1959, when it was originally published, but it remained unforgettable.
