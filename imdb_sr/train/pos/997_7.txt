I have to agree with most other posts. Was it a comedy? drama? To me, it was a little relying on the comedy side. I could have been a great comedy without comedy and was terribly fictitious. Jamie is constantly running to Juliet and what's his name. In New York, how many times do you meet someone you know in downtown Cleveland? Again, comedy or drama? But it was still fun especially for the Sunday morning. I enjoyed the performance of Kimberly Elise, she is definitely a beautiful actress and she seems to take her craft seriously. She is a younger actress who will be sustainable.
