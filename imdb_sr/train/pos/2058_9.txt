This movie is interesting for the genre of a killer killer - incredibly manages to rise to become larger than the sum of its parts. The average montage scenes, thirty-year-olds who play teenagers, and some great facial expressions, are becoming one of the "new waves" of modern classics. As a spectator, I left the film with the same feeling of "shock and awe" as when I first saw Kuma in 1969. Tiffany Gardner was stunningly portrayed by the morally bankrupted Judy who deserved her nomination for Gramma, which was well documented and stolen by Ricky Martin and restless hips. Unfortunately, no continuation could support the expectation of the original (as opposed to the series Kumovi that have improved with each sequel and should culminate in 2012 with Kum 4: Eat Mi Rage.
