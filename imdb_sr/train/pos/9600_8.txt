This film is a touching story about the adventure made by 15-year-old Darius Veems. Darius has Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, a still not curable disease that seized his brother's life at the age of nineteen and killed number one in the United States. He and several close friends travel around the country in Los Angeles with the aim of adjusting the MTV wheelchair, Pimp Mi Ride, to one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The gang is moving west for a journey that all its participants will never forget. Darius rides for the first time in a boat, ride a hot air balloon, swim in the ocean, and visits the sights he has always wanted to see as Grand Canion and Nev Orleans. Film makers here obviously have an emotional connection with the material. They do not make money from selling $ 20 dvd. $ 17 goes to the study of illness and $ 3 goes to making multiple copies. The film has won over 25 awards at festivals and I agree with the quote given by Variety, "Safe to excite the heart".
