Leonard Maltin was surely watching another movie. (Although I think his Guide is a fairly valuable resource, please neglect his comments on this.) He says that "it starts well and then disappears" when it's really the other way around - "a young woman starts and then starts up." The action is simple. Happy mom, happy dad and happy son go on vacation on an isolated beach, dad is disabled in an accident, mom escapes to help, meet a dangerous convict. Mom tries to deceive the convict to help while his dad is waiting and holding for his dear life. The good white insect gave the electric jerk of Ralf Meeker, appearing suddenly (the director, John Sturges, shoots him in a smart way that will make you breathe about half way as a cunning, desperate criminal. Meeker is unusual dumb, reckless actor (at least here in the Kiss Me Deadli) and he happily snatches the keys to the narration of the film and accelerates from top to bottom. His character has the habit of laughing childishly and says: "Pretty neat, huh?" It's a weird pause in action when they get an empty tire and he's strictly referring to She's shooting back, "Where do I go?" (they are in the middle of nothing) and she sees the sitcom-hips "Yes, that's right." The friction between them is a rush. /> There are some minor, somewhat funny things. There is one scene in which the police, who have been hit by Meeker for some time, stopped Stanley's car and avoided the discovery of Meeker, leaning back on his shoulder as if he loved his husband, and pretending to be asleep while examining THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] It seems obviously non-male in this position and B. I think it's safe to say that every adult who seems to be sleeping during a meeting with the police would certainly cause suspicion. It is still a solid thriller that builds on an exciting and instructive conclusion. <br /> <br />
