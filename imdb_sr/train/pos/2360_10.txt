He felt that it was very balanced to show what Jehovah's witnesses did to protect American freedoms. She also showed the firm belief of two families who were first-generation witnesses. I also appreciated that he showed that by becoming a Witness of Jehovah affects family members who are not witnesses and that it is difficult for them to accept the fact that they do not celebrate holidays, the sad side is that non-Witness families are not thinking about their family's family's family dinners / visits or gifts at any other time, but for holidays or birthdays. When it comes to medical care, witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care, what people forget is that blood transfusions provide untidy medical care and surgical procedures, while bloodless treatments lead to the medical team being highly qualified and trained, They like to cure their loved ones? I recommend this video!
