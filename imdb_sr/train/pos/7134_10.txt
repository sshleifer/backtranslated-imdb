John Thav is an excellent actor. I have to admit that I was impressed by his reach in the role of a cruel old whore who reluctantly agrees to take an evacuated from the streets of London (the time of the Second World War). The movie is also great. A very touching story with a happy ending. Some characters are a little underdeveloped (especially a school teacher), but none of them is relevant to the plot. Basically, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the movie needs a little more.
