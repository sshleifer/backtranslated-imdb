Wonderful film that deals with temptations and troubles in World War I in England. What makes this film so good is the touch of the human element. This film is definitely in the tradition of such British classics as "Miss Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As with this film, we see the desperation of people in times of war. bombing in London. We will soon see why this baby wet her bed. He comes from a mad mother who terrorized him terribly. An old man leads a child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child returns to his mother, the old man goes to London and asks him only to find a tragedy. He literally takes away the boy and can persuade him that the child is better with him than in a boy's house.
