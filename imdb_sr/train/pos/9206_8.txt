We do not encounter movies about sister-sisters in Indian cinema, nor in any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects that are not exploited in movies or novels. Typically, the nurse is portrayed as a bunch that can be used for peak purchase. This film treats the topic in a completely different light. Inspired by George Eliot's novel "Mill on the Finish". Brother is a very prosaic, all-good, blond boy who is a conventionally good son and favored with his mother. The nurse is romantic, wild and defiant with the unwritten rules of society. Nevertheless, the victory is the love of a brother-sister. This film talks about the love of two brothers and sisters who are separated in childhood and reviving the same feelings when they meet years later. It is also the search of a humble brother to reunite with his sister who chose to be wild to confront the world. Although the film and novel are set about three centuries in two distant lands, however, the feelings are the same and still true.
