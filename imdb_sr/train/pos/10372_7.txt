ROLL is a wonderful little movie. Toby Malone plays a 18-year-old kid (he was acting very well, otherwise) who is in football. Malone's cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many turns and turns that include two gym bags, a master of drugs, some hard bikers, some policemen, and some prostitutes ... and the film is guessing us the characters are on which side of the law, which content was a cargo bag, and even which gender is a key biker. Parts reminded me of LOCATION STORAGE and TWO DIMIR BATTLES. For me, ROLL strengthened the three opinions I already held before I saw ROLL. These opinions are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. The country and the cities are beautiful and it looks like a cool place to rest. 2. Some of the best filmmakers are Australians. Especially impressive was the cinema in ROLL. I liked stylized colors and lighting in many scenes. 3. Australians are HOT!
