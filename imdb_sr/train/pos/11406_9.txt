This very unusual setting of Wagner's last opera has definitely grown on me. When I saw her for the first time, I was a bit disturbed by many surrealistic films of the movies, and I thought that too much was related to the story. However, if you can reconcile with a fairly large number of "tricks", I think you will see that the film is catching up with a very strange, different atmosphere of opera, and that there are moments that are particularly nice. Personally, I never understood the role of Kundra until I saw Edith Clever present. Its performance (synchronized mimic in the mouth of the singer's voice, Ivonne Minton) is no less than a glittering, end-to-end, and justifies the hours needed to film the film. Another reason Enjoying this movie is that it captures Robert Lloyd's spectacular interpretation of Gurnemanz's key role, the one Lloyd brought to sharp in opera houses around the world. I had the privilege of enjoying him several times in the role of Gurnemanz on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, and the sweetness of his voice and the warm, paternal interpretation of this noble character really should have been preserved, as well as his performance in the two main monologues of the character, Karfreitag scenes and the persuasion of prophecy in Act 1. The version I saw was a video made for America, so there were subtitles that, unfortunately, could not be removed. This is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and leads to a distinctively Christian interpretation of the film that already compels the layers of interpretation on the opera. To me this seemed quite the opposite of Wagner's Clear Emancipation of Christianity, and his very deliberate attempt to "generalize" the Christian elements of the story. (See the footage with the spoiler at the end of this review.) I think it's almost impossible, when I watch a movie with subtitles, not to absorb them, and I strongly recommend that, if you have a DVD version, you have the option to include the subtitles you do, and Instead, if your opera is unknown, carefully read the libretto in advance. Basically, there is a lot in the movie that I do not like, and as I soon saw differently ... but it was constantly increasing in my estimation over the years since I first saw it, and I find myself drawn to enjoy it again. __________________________________________________________________ NOTE THAT CONTAINS A SPOILER: A good example would be the famous line Kundra, "I saw him ... him ... and laughed." This is translated into subtitles, for reasons they avoid me, like "I've seen the Person of the Savior". He is especially irritated, because in the whole libretto, Vagner very consciously and carefully points to that invisible character who should not be the Biblical Jesus as "der Heiland", ie. German for "healer" - a reference to the Amfortas wound, and all wounds and diseases and the need for healing.
