I knew that I would see this when I saw the first review. Dennis Kuaid was one of the reasons, but the topic of keeping my dreams tells me. People talk about it as a movie for children, but I think it's a movie for baby boomers who are facing old, powerless parents, our own mortality, our children who grow up and leave us, and all other things we never thought would be happened to us. The film does not fall into trap trap; It's about what the life of your dreams means when you have real life. Kuaid is too small for a pitcher, but he seems to look good, and Rachel Griffiths makes a small part as a wife in an imaginary, layered performance. The camera is slow and cute. When they put together this movie, they left out everything they did not need. Very nice.
