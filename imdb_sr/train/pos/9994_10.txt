"Life smells" is the parody of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white are always present in our lives. The performance of Mel Brooks is brilliant as always, and other actors are fine. This movie has some Capra taste, so it's so good. There are some unforgettable gags like the one when Brooks tries to make money by dancing on the street, and to all the people who are passing just ignore him, or when he introduces a funny lunatic who believes that Paul Getti, and then begins to argue and charm each other. If you did not see it, you do not know what you missed me. This film tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. The only difference between this film and the reality is that this movie has a happy ending, and the reality is not. Yes, indeed, life stinks.
