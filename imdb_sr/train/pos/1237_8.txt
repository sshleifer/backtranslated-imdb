This was a very original decent movie and a brave move for all those involved. I do not care if it's not the most appropriate film of all time, the fact that Eddie Murphi does something informal, and I do not know what will happen next, it seems to me to be the favorite. I'd love to see more movies as imaginative as this one, not the same old formula for fun.
