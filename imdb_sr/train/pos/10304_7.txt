"Almighty Bruce" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailer. Still, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me more like this movie. Bruce (Jim Carrei) is angry with God and gives him the divine power to be God for a week to see if he can do better. Morgan Freeman plays the man who is symbolized here as God, and although this is not his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he works fine with what he is given to do. Although it was occasionally rude, the film has a lot of laughter, from Bruce, who cut his soup half as much as the Red Sea and the client's reaction to it, as well as Freemann's seemingly relaxed and wise image of God. Sometimes it is overly exaggerated, and there is some kind of rude humor, but it all makes a little ridiculous. There is decent support, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film proved to be very romantic and tearful, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and "to be a miracle." The film is far from perfect, but still pleasing, and far better than I would and many people probably expect, especially if we see a deeper message of the film. *** From ** **
