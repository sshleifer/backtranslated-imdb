I enjoyed capturing this movie on a very late late TV and kept my interest in the whole picture. This lovely creepy, but mysterious English house, with an evil look of decoration and veared furniture and rooms that wonder you just why anyone would want to rent this home or even own it. There are four (4) stories about this house, and each resident of the home meets all kinds of problems. You will notice a beautiful lake and pond around the house and a sweet birdwatching, but do not let it fool you, there is horror all over the place. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", 80 gives an excellent performance as one of the people who live in the house, and even Christopher Lee, "Curse of the Crimson Altar", 68 and his little daughter Chloe Franks, (Jane Reid) a wonderful exciting story Together, his daughter, for some reason, likes to read VITCHCRAFT BOOKS! If you like horrible, horrible and mysterious movies, with much surprise, this is a FILM FOR YOU !!!!
