I came across late last night TCM. I have not seen it since it came out originally, but I never forgot it. I totally forgot how great and talented Signe Hasso was while she was young, just like Shelley Vinters before she left the game. and HATED it. After I saw "Double Life", I read it again and finally understood what it was about. Gordon / Kanin writing team was at its peak when the script was made - <br /> <br Film well worth remembering and re-recording,
