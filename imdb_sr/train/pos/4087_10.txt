I must say, I thought I saw everything. I am an extremely exhausted film lover. This film did not shock me in any way. I'm far from that point. But that led me to certain emotional places that I did not know could go. I had no idea that I could ever find a (ick) idea of ​​beastiness. Never Never. Ever. Ever. But here it is. He did it. I have to give credit to the director. He pulled it. For the first 40 minutes this film is totally boring. We begin with very explicit footage of two horses having sex. After five minutes, I began to wonder if buying this movie was not a mistake. Then the old man in wheelchairs talks to another old man about two people who marry. Then some nervous guy shaves. Then we see (in short) the hot chick she got with the butler (but this is very short). At this moment, I cursed the film loudly while I was trying to stay awake. In fact, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes and forced him to finish the next night. We finally got good things when a girl (who knows who, or who is in this movie) has a dream about a Victorian-era gallery devastated by a beast in the forest. The scene lasts for quite a long time and really is the meat (heh-heh) of the whole work. It's beautifully shot, top-notch and delivering goods. They try to finish the plot in the end and it makes some sense, but somehow not. Oh well. I would certainly recommend this film. For the first 40 minutes, I was forced to kill myself (and my TV), but in the last 50 minutes it was completely redeemed.
