I grabbed the last half of this film on the cable of one night and I was wondering how morbid it is. Even when one of the two victims is the worst, the camera continues. the remains of his corpse were discovered and his concentration camp point in the body bag is both moving and depressing. Do not watch this movie if you're already depressed. then do not look again if it's really good.
