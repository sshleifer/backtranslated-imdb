I really liked this movie. I saw several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best. I would really put him above his famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems that the story is lost in the films of Gene Kelli on great numbers of dancing and songs, but not in this film. It's definitely worth renting.
