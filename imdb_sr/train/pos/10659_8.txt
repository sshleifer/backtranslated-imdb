"I prefer to love cheap perfumes, it does not take long ..." - Ralph Meeker's convicted character (Lavson) tells Helena, Barbara Stanvick after she breathed the perfume she chose with her husband in Tijuana ...! This line cracked me, and it also seemed to me as a metaphor for this movie - it's cheap is better than expensive, because it's a cheap perfume man who has a way with 2 to 4 better man for an eye in the long run! I agree with some other comments about Helen's attraction to Lavson. Although her story says that she wants Lavson to take it, she seems to be attracted to his fiery nature, and that passion she had caused in her would probably not have flushed the tide!
