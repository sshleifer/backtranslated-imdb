Actually, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a brand new actor, is just toned and sophisticated to do better than the English version (both American MGM production). Garbo is, if it's more commendable (or more beautiful than the presence of the screen), and its acting is more restrained. It looks sincerely more relaxed, probably for many reasons, but we can speculate that it did not rule out its first picture in the test, and it quickly adapted. Without comparing always one film to another, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill plays with too many words. His themes about a woman who wants love without loss of independence are here, but that anyway comes to an unusual old look. Some scenes are missing - the Conei Island section is shortened and not so good - but in general this is a direct echo of the first movie. The director, Jacques Fayder (Belgian-French), simply repeats what has already been done, which I suppose must be a frustrating experience. It's interesting to see both films one after the other because they are blocked exactly the same way (not just sets, but the images are the same). There is an occasional scene erected from an earlier film - some of the storms, an understandable, but also a short scene in which Marie Dressler (from the English version) walks with her friend on the board over the canal, drunk as it can be. But these are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see that German actors are taking their parts. There is certainly no substitute for Dressler, but for me the German father is more convincing and honest in his performance. It is clear that the themes are immigration, unbelieving fathers, daughters who turn to prostitution and troubles. finding true love - then they have strong currents, especially with European threads (Garbo, accordingly, plays a Swedish young woman).
