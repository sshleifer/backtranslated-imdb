I think this film is a very funny movie and one of the best films of 'National Lampoon', it also has a very attractive title, which basically sums up what's going on in the whole movie .... Men in white !!!! It's a story of many movies, including the Vill Smith movie, as you could guess, 'Men In Black'. I will not end, but it has a very good ending, it's very funny (Leslie Nielsen's style of humor) from the beginning to the end, especially when it's near the beginning when you're on the street collecting garbage cans (Garbage Cans). Also, in this scene, they have a pretty cool garbage truck (garbage truck). The acting is not great, in fact, it's not very good, but that's what makes the movie funny, it's a comedy, relax! I love the story, partly because it is so far removed and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (or should be Un-subtle) they tear off all the other films. I am a big fan of frivolous movies about bribery, but I am also a fan of the right things, and with these films, it is difficult to decide which one is better, the film is mostly scrapped (this review is mentioned earlier) or the actual film is, but also when you make a comedy comedy films, it actually makes it even harder, but this film successfully carries it. Two garbage bugs are so funny to remind me of a TV sketch in the UK called Little Britain. This film is required for your collection and is one of the best, funniest, funniest, best-selling stories, the national lamp film so far!
