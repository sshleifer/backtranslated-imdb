It's kind of disturbing to have a character named Gig Ioung in a movie ... played by Gig Ioung. But this film is the place where Gig got his name, and also a good career boost after playing small parts under another name. I'm going against most of the other comments and I claim that I really enjoyed this movie, mostly because of the lively performance of Barbara Stanvick as Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring and lively as the eldest of three daughters whose mother died in Lusitania, whose father was later killed during the War I War. As a "man" house, Fiona has stood steadfastly for years to reconcile her father's paternal will, which would allow Donald Trump, named Charles Barclay, to bring a family home. But Fiona keeps a secret about why Barclay hates so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is a middle-aged, flirting sister who is married to an Englishman, but she craves for her youngest sister Gig Ioung. If you are a Stanvick fan, this is no mistake.
