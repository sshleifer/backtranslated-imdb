Disney might have something to think about. First, they had "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a story based on the truth about sports and a small city in Central America. Now, with Kuaid and The Rookie ... another sports story based on the truth. Both films sometimes move you to tears, and both make you smile and heat after you see them. My wife and I took The Rookie and we expected it to be a great movie. We did not fail, when they asked if we would buy it on a DVD when it came out, it was not at all smart. Most definitely.
