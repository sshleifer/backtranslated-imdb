Another masterpiece of Voo! This is the best movie I've ever seen! Voo - RULEZ forever (except for Hollywood moments ...). John Voo is a bigger director of the century. It may not be more intellectual than many big directors ... But he is the lyrical and spiritual idol of all the people of the free mind! His films like great poetry! Voo is Movie Sheakspeare! Voo is Movie Biron! Voo is Mozart by Bloodshet !!!! IMHO violent in Voo movies is not the director of art, but the instrument of art. Voo movies are more humanistic than new films.
