The Rookie is based on a true story about a 40-year-old student in Grand Lake, Texas, who comes to large schools. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Kuaid) is a high school professor of natural science and a baseball coach. His team is terribly losing until the team finds that their coach has played in small leagues and can throw a height of 98 mph. After throwing out the training and betting, Jim agrees that, if his team wins the regional, try for the Major League. The film tells the story of Jimmy as a boy to play in his first game in major schools. It's a great story about a loss and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Kuaid makes the film a valuable time, providing an emotional performance and is supported by excellent support that includes: Brian Coke, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. The story takes a bit of time to develop and some scenes are a bit slow, but it works well all the way. Baseball scenes are fun, well recorded and perfectly displayed. The film is not actually a baseball but rather a search for one person to reach his dream. It's inspirational, it's emotional and funny. I liked it, I hope. Rookie. In the main roles: Dennis Kuaid, Brian Cock, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. 4 of 5 stars.
