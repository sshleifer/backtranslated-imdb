The last chapter in Hanzo's trilogy Razor provides a convenient closure for this fun series of self-exploration. Inoue replaces Iasuz Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Lesser) in the director's chair, but the style is almost the same, perhaps because Shintaro Katsu serves as a producer, except titular antihero. Hanzo reveals a female spirit that keeps treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo Hanzo is not delayed by the fact that he is a ghost, and continues to rape ... ah, to question, using the already known revolving network device. The action takes place through a series of blind monks who are also doubling as loans, corrupt officials, promiscuous women, and the necessary hack and candy. Hannes, the superior officer, Onishi, and his two officers, provide typical comic book notes, and generally, it's a job as usual. Significantly less complicated and easier to track than the first (which is everywhere around) and a bit of a mess), less stylized, dramatic and bloody than the other (probably the best in the Hanzo series), but still funny and worthwhile own merits. Together with the trademark training sequences, compulsory rape, sabers, and the mystery that Hanzo needs to explore, it will ultimately satisfy fans.
