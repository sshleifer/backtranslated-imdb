Amazingly good early effort by Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original scripts written by Hitchcock himself, this film shows the exceptional story structure. It starts with an exciting boxing match in which Carnival Champion Jack "One Round" loses from a challenger from an audience who is by chance a professional fighter for prizes. The film then slows down to develop characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack, his girlfriend and professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic revival of the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown. Even in this early film, Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinema and space. The bracelet bought by the boxer for a girl continues to appear through the film as a symbol of her unbelief. The only major critic of this film is that the art of shooting a boxing match has not been perfected in 1927. The last match, as a result, ended somewhat antichlimatically. The story, however, is what transmits this film.
