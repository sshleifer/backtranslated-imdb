At first glance, I expected this film to be crazy, because I thought the plot would be so overly feminist. But I made a mistake. As you may have read in earlier published comments, I agree that the feminist part in this film does not bother. I have never had the idea that the main character exaggerates his position as a woman. It's as if Guzman was portrayed as someone with a spine, unlike her classmates. So I was surprised by that story, in fact, I thought it was pretty good, except for the predictable end. Perhaps it would be better if the shop gets a radical turn, so the viewer is a bit more surprised. the way in which he rejected his character. I can not explain why, but especially in love scenes, she convinced me. I think it looked real. I gave him 7 out of 10, just for the past half an hour.
