Fantastic Arabian adventure. The former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu (who played Sabu from the Black Narcissus) is searching for Ahmad's love interest, stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). It's hard to be here. He always invents new adventures for heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a bit boring (no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is fourth in the credit). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, a real big criminal, and Sabu is very funny as a prince of thieves, who at one point finds a ghost in a bottle. I also really loved Miles Malleson as the sultan of Basra, the father of the princess. He collects incredible toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes him by the hand of his daughter with a mechanical flying horse. This would probably be considered one of the best children's movies of all time, but special effects are terribly obsolete today. Children will surely embarrass the images that are displayed on the screen when Abu and Genius are on the screen together. And the scene with a huge spider looks particularly terrible. Although most of the younger generation probably think that King Kong looks bad at this time, Villis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a wire that does not even look like a spider. 8/10.
