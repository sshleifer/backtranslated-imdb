Since Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in TV history, it was a conclusion that I would go to the movies and spend $ 15 on this. I think this is true for fans of Eva Longoria. The movie revolves around the leaks that secret agent service plans to kill the president. As the investigation proceeds, it seems that the only credible candidate is highly decorated by Pete (Michael Douglas). Speaking of innocence, Pete continues with a fun, refugee style, looking for the truth. It was a decent story, a decent story, but it left me a little empty, but you could certainly do much worse.
