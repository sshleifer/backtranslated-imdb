I really think this movie is great, personally. But there is a ni≈°an in every movie. Some of you might not have watched Hilari Duff, Raise Your Voice, but if you think about it, these two shows are very similar, if you know what I mean. In 'Brave Nev Girl', Holly wants so badly to get into the Haverta Conservatory. In 'Raise Your Voice', Terry wants to go to the conservatory in L. (I do not remember the name of the conservatory there). Both are on the music field and both have to sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two films are. I personally love 'Brave Nev Girl' better than 'Raise Iour Voice'.
