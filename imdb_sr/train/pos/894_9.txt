This, "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favorite Sammo Hung films. The fat dragon is thicker in this trip than he was in "Condor", but he is no less sure as a director or actor. He is, in fact, at the top of his form and brings a destructive, brutal action that can boast of half dozen incredible sequences and manages to tell a compassionate, sweet love story. Love and romance are not the priorities of the director, but they serve as curious additions to the action and ensure that viewers do not press the button to quickly move between physical conflicts. The starting scene, featuring a funny light duel of swords, sets up a solid but deceptive tone. The sequence in which Samm's pedicab hunts the car is beautifully set and sweetened with a sharp, comic tone. The fast and fierce battle between Sam and Lau Kar Leung is a model of brilliant choreography and a sharp, supreme direction, and is easily one of the best ever of this type. Violence in the film slowly escalates until, finally, when it comes to climax, we will not be subjected to some of the most brutal conflicts ever seen in Sammo production. The attack by the director / actor on Billy Chow and a house full of angry, threatening opponents is shooting bones, physically punishing delight. Excellent result, too.
