A good time working with Kuiroz Brothers, and the whole acting on this project as "Gui on the Bench". I was amazed how well they achieved catching all the recognizable features of a real "B" horror movie. I hope that in the future I will have the opportunity to work with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team. I moved to Detroit shortly after finishing and I was recognized many times by the public since publication. For a time, it was actually in the video and the girl almost lost her mind. It was pretty funny and it was my first real autographic moment while signing her account. One day I asked a girl in Blockbuster whether the movie is often rented, and she confirmed that she was looking at the computer. At the time he rented more than Ring2, which at the time was also a new edition ... The title really records the current interest in the urban markets. She also noticed on several occasions that the film was not returned by the buyer, which led me to believe that the movie is so good that people do not want to return it .... Beware of ZOMBILJE when it comes to chaos because it will get ia! Jaisun Barr (Gui on the Bench-2005)
