and I loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952 I was 5 years old and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was the one Marion Lorne played as a pretty stingy, unpleasant and very kind person "aunt." I can still remember her comments "kiss the bubbling mind," as she will try to say something important. And then when she came back and played Aunt Clara in Bevitched, it was great! It was the first time I remembered that I had seen Valter Matthau whose career had been watched as a fan for many years. title or end of music "Swedish Rhapsody" Huga Alfvena? Every time I hear it on my classical radio station in southern California, it returns memories of Mr. Peepers's image walking back to the camera. I'm not sure if the picture in my mind is correct.
