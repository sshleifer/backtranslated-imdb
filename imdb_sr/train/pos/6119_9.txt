Okay, but just stupid. Not bad for a horror movie. I read how people replaced Michael's version and it's a good trick in my opinion, because some of the grownups hate horror and when they see this they will be interested in horror movies like this one or maybe (they never saw it) Horror (maybe comedy) uncle Sam, I have to see about renting or buying this movie, but the other is much better than this, but I bought this movie on Amazon's VHS and got it on November 21, the day before Thanksgiving. worth four dollars, l.o.l. in this film. 9/10
