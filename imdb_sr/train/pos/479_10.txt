Natalia Emily Watson is absolutely the most favorite and most romantic character I've ever seen on the screen. She is the queen of this film without a doubt. Or is she transformed into a king? The inner weaving of chess games and the struggle of families for control, power and victory are astounding. Just like the chess masters in the film, the director is currently playing many simultaneous games with our mind at a time, but everything gets into big or smaller patterns. The period, costumes and paintings in Italy at the beginning of the 20th century were magnificently captured. Not a single square of space is lost. So many brilliant scenes have a lot, I can not repeat them all. I recommend that you have enough time to watch this movie twice, maybe a week, because you can not catch all the poetry within a 64-square, but multi-dimensional framework in one environment. I did not read the book of Nabakov, but to try my analogy, what I read reminds me of another romantic triumphant film about poetry as a play, Barri Levinson's The Natural. It completely rejected the ugly ending of the fatalist book Bernard Malamud in favor of romantic Impressionism that was uniquely American. Well, the director did it better by linking Russian and Italian morals and customs as the background of enlightenment. The real story is that games are zero-sums; there is a winner and a loser, unless both competitors pull out. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by those limitations and life conventions to the extent that we allow others to break our spirit. Pure love, as Natalya Emily Vatson personified, can transcend and allow all of us to improve at the same time his gifts. Only the barriers raised by our fears can separate us from this. This is a magnificent movie (10/10).
