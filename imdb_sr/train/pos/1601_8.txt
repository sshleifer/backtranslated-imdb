It's pretty simple, not really an active but very charming movie. There were moments in which I can see why Cher won the best actress award, but there were other moments when I wondered why Glenn Close did not win for Fatal Attraction. After all, Oscar and Golden Globe win, and BAFTA nominates Cher Loretta Castorini, a simple low-paying woman, whom Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danni Aiello) has asked to marry him. He promised to return in a month, because his mother was sick, and she thought she should get as much as possible from her family to attend a wedding. The only problem is when he finds Johnny's brother Ron (the Golden Globe nominated as Nicolas Cage), they begin to have a relationship, and there love goes to that Moonlight scene (from where the title comes from). Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia is also nominated as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe conqueror Olimpia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahonei as Perry. It ends without a wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronnie were happy together. He won the Oscars for Best Writing, script written directly for the screen, and was nominated for the Best Director for Norman Jevison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture, was nominated for BAFTA for Best Score for Dick Himan and Best Original Scenario and was nominated for Golden Globe for Best Film - Comedy / Music and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 for 100 years, 100 citations ("Snap out of him!"), Was number 17 for 100 years, 100 passions, and he was number 41 for 100 years, 100 laughs. Very good!
