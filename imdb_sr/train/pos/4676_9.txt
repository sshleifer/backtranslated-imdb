I found this film provoking thinking, and its ambiguity is refreshing in the world of fast-fixing movies where we are manipulated to love a "good guy" and hate the "bad guy". Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, works great on showing a black sheep in a family / a lost child who tries to get his father's love and respect, and that he is his widow, a sister in whom she has eyes. history. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual father picture as a father who triangles his sons and now remains with the one who has always refused. When I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was surprised by the wonderful way in which the sawdust was used to show family tradition, as the director explains. This is a suitable heir of the classic "Ordinary People". I just realized, Judd Hirsch was also in it!
