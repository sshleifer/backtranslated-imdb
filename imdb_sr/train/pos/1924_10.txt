This performance was great, it was not just for the kids I thought was at first, but for the whole family. The first season was mostly around the father who cares about two daughters and a son, unfortunately died in season 2, I could believe when I heard him. I'm dressed as they continued the show as if what really happened in real life and I need to mention the episode by goodbye. it was so well made, it must be so hard for them to take it, you could say that they were real tears in their eyes. I'm a 24-year-old man and this episode made me cry until I know how they felt when my father died when I was 13 years old just like Roi. Season 2 and the third season had a great comedy, and there were also some of my favorites like Freaky Fridai, Secrets, and the third season. I still think the show was strong enough to continue, I was disappointed that it was over, it was one of the best it was not the best Familie comedy shov ever since Home Improvement and could have been the next Friend. It should never end, but still loves to watch repetitions every day.
