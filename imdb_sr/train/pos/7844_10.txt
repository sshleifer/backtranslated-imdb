I really love this show, it's like I'm reading a book and every chapter leaves a desire for more. He is thinking about what will happen in the next episode and the fight to maintain their friendship over the years. At the end of each episode, she leaves a sweet bitter taste in her mouth knowing that: One - the show was good, you can not wait for the next episode and really leads you to think about what actually happens to friends for twenty years. And secondly - the fact that the show was "paused" and that we will not see the end of the show in its entirety. Fox obviously does not know what they did, they claim to lose spectators in the 18 - 49 category, they clearly do not know what people want to see if good performances such as "Reunion" have been solved. Although I have one question that I would like to launch. Should they return the show and continue to be held for another season, how would it work, because each episode was made over a period of one year and the story is based on what is happening over a period of twenty years? Your answers are welcome. Return Reunion! Return Reunion!
