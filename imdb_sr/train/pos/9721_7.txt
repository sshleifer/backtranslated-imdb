How to lose friends and alienate people is a decent comedy with a little romantic approach. It's actually a story about Sidney Ioung (Simon Pegg) that goes through the work of a journalist and magazine that is interpreted in a funny way. Simon Pegg made a good look, something worse than his usual one. The film is not funny or funny to the end or something, but it has its moments, and those moments are really funny. I recommend this fun and worthwhile observation to the Americans with English Cream Cream to all people just want to sit, relax and enjoy the movie for what it is. If you want to watch this critical film, you should go unless you want to be disappointed and begin to destroy it.
