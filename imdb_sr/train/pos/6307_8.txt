I have never heard of this film, despite being connected with George Cluni (whose company originated and appeared in a very funny backup bit) and the 11th director of his Ocean Steven Soderberg. Worse, we picked this up in the $ 4.99 discount diskette (Canadian dollars!) What a great and pleasant surprise. But then I consider that if Villiam H. Mace be in it, you can not be disappointed. This was very reminiscent of those Ealing comedies from England in the fifties. OK, with more curses. This is a weird and sometimes funny movie. The real robbery made me laugh so much that I was crying. Perhaps the most fun use of shorts in the history of the film. Perhaps it was a small expectation, but I was looking at a group of people and we had an explosion. The best 5 dollars I've spent years.
