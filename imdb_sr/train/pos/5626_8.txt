Marjorie, a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two roommates, Pat and Terry. One night gets in her car and an assault is a masked man with a knife. His plan is to rape her, but she manages to escape. The police can not help her, because rape did not happen. Then one day, when Marjorie's roommates are at work, her attacker comes there. His name is Joe. But then she manages to spray his eyes and mouth by refusing insects, things that will kill him if she will not get help soon. He binds him and makes Joe an object of the same kind of physical and mental attack. Extreme (1986) was directed by Robert M. Ioung. It is based on the controversial off-Broadway play from 1982 by Villiama Mastrosimone. James Russo, who played and the attacker in the show, is convincing like Joe. Alfred Voodard and Dia at Scarvid are great as Pat and Terri. James Avery is seen as Securiti Guard. She has a nomination for Golden Globe. This is not a movie that should to entertain you. The question is whether revenge is justified. , but I recommend.
