It is a shame that a few comments before me do not know the facts of this case. It is based on current events, a very popular case of disappearance and murder that took place in Wilmington, DE / Philadelphia, between 1996 and 2000. In fact, he was quite impressed with how close they were to the constant reporting of local news and news from Philadelphia Inquirer throughout the entire period. Of course, I immediately stressed that the actress (which I really liked in Cold Case) who played Fahei did not look like she (Anne Marie was actually more beautiful). I have to admit that Mark Harmon really pinned the type of personality that was discovered as Capan's and the behavior Capano exhibited during this period. The details of the case were true ... without departing from the dramatic effect ... even the carpet, pistol, furniture and refrigerators. In the end, I wanted to add that Tom Carper I met many times in various functions (a good man, despite being a politician) and I am so glad he has drawn the endings in the federal empire necessary to deal with this abominable crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see it finally put behind bars.
