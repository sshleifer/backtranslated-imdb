It's a very good movie, not just for lovers of Ladi Death comics, but for those who love animated films / series of adventure and fantasy. The film is about an innocent girl who was killed for something she did not, but because she is the daughter of the ruler of hell, I am Lucifer himself. Then look for revenge ... and the rest is better to see it from the movie. The movie I liked a lot, the characters are like the original comics, form Chaos. I have never had the opportunity to read the first parts of the story in the comic, only the last, after the passages in the film, so I can not say whether the events are completely similar to comics, but ... one way or the other is the story of Ladi Death!
