Do you remember the first days of pay-per-view? I know, and I can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent a movie on your so-called. As a child, we always wanted to rent a playboy, but that meant actually calling someone from the PPV and asking for a rental. And then you get the courage to do it and watch four hours of soft cores without shit. The reason I did this is that this film was on ppv. And I remember almost every scene that was in the appendix. I've been on my feet for the past several years to get all the great movies I use to see as a child, and this was one of them. That's when it's hard to turn off. All star actors are trying to make perfect bankruptcy, but nothing goes wrong. There are many bank cheats that are good and this must fall into that category. She has enough action and laughs to keep her. Check if you dare!
