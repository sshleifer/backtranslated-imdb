Finally, I saw this classic TV movie on an unofficial disc taken from an old VHS, it's a classic piece of horror. Her damage is even more neglected in terms of horror in terms of official editions on DVD and VHS ... a movie about horror TV. It is recommended for all lovers of 70 TV films like the trilogy of terror. Interested parties should get a book on the topic written by David Dale - Television film from the '70s. Send me an email for the chance to see him ... his fantastic to see him again. There are problems like many TV films that have to be pretty inventive in the effects and even it seems that 70 minutes can pull up probably we are all accustomed to more modern editing, but still great things and far better than many theatrical fears published today.
