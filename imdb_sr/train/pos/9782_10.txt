Peaches are truly a wonderful movie. I am writing this to refute the review from someone called Auscrit, who appeared on this site. First of all, the idea that Monahans is the first film 'Interview' somehow TV is an extraordinary statement. This is a film that has been widely praised around the world, because it is just one of the best Australian films ever filmed. He completely deserved to get the best picture. Peaches are a brave, brave and brave departure. For me it works at all levels and now I have seen it twice. Monahan is a director who shows great skill and incredible sensitivity. For 'Auscrit' to comment that this is another TV movie and so on. And that Hugo Veaving is not good, it just does not get a movie. Or rather he does not want to get it. Frankly, this is a type of comment that is expected from another director who is jealous or bitter or both. Or someone from industry or distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average punter, I only found that he does not write such comments. I also noticed other comments on the page and a reference to Sommersault. One needs to ask what people think to watch. Unfortunately, in Australia, at the time the SS was released, there was pushing, if you did not like it, then there was nothing with you, not a movie. This media manipulation is quite common. Reality is the only similarity between these two films that they are the real passing movies. Unfortunately, for me, the SS movie is nothing, which could have been said in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional film about anxiety. Peaches in comparison with them are masterpieces. I personally can not wait for Monahan to do the following because it is obviously far ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to the cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win all of the AFI and IF awards this year's prize, then it's a game. As far as Auscrit is concerned, please find something more constructive with your time
