In my opinion, the best movie ever. I love when people ask me what it is about. I usually laugh and say "life". They shrug their shoulders and probably never again think about it. The fact that anyone from each background can connect with some part of this movie makes it much more wonderful. It definitely has to be seen for everyone.
