We do not have to lose this film, this is one of the biggest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is incredible (more than usual) and the film is one of the most beautiful nouvelle vogue. Jean Eustache is no longer in this country, we only have black and white paintings that remember one of the greatest and most esteemed French directors. You just need to love this masterpiece. I'll never forget that. P.S.: I'm sorry for the English ...
