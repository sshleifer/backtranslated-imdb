I liked this movie, although I was halfway to be able to say who the secret admirer is. I wonder and whether this is based on a true story because she talked about the "real" people at the end of the movie. I guess I'll have to investigate it and let you know. Anyone remembers in what condition this happened? I believe they moved to North Carolina if I'm not mistaken. Of course, states could change to protect the innocent. You would think this man could understand it as easily as I did. Was he stupid or what?
