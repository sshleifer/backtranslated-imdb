It's hard to imagine that this movie is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to make a miracle, it's so exciting. Daniel Dai-Levis is a chameleon, it's hard to imagine how much effort he made to create this disability figure. Watching the screen is a shocking breath-taking experience. The film is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is a bit bright and intriguing. Christi is not despised by the normal, his life is also vivid and beautiful, although we can be aware of the loneliness and painful eye through his eyes. An important factor of Christi's success is the support of his mother. which looks more touching, and an unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar prize for this role, this fat, small, middle-aged woman uses everything to make Kristin's dream a reality. And Hugh O'Connor is also great as a young Christy, what a show for a child! The love story of Christ is very well made, faithful. Christi wants love and nothing can get him out of the right to love, in love with a beautiful dr. in this role is really beyond my mind, but in any case, every woman has her youth ...) is paranoid and insulting, I have sympathy for him, love is a two-faced sword, happiness and agony are just next to each other. On the other hand, the works of Jim Sheridan are good (In America, BOKSER, etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Triing, God knows why he decided to direct this shit! Really for him career, what a damn!
