As a habit, I always like to read 'hate' reviews of any movie. especially the one I would like to comment on. and this is not so much about a casual counterpoint; I like to see what people say on the opposite side. However, I want to look at one thing. many people who hated him called him, paraphrasing, "beautiful, but shallow," some even go so far as to say that the desire of this norm, and yet the inability to help his brother, was common, at best. As a brother of a brother who has a similar dysfunction, they can be linked. You watch them daily by abusing yourself, knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction. and it's not about the specifics of what they did; how and why Paul decided to deal with gambling and socializing with questionable people; this is actually the more way they are wired. On the one hand, they are a real genius; and, secondly, they are painfully self-destructive (similar to that of people like Howard, they are thrown by the same forces triggered by the same forces that separate them) and as long as you see this, you know this, and what else is Up, you realize that you can not do anything about it. The tragedy had to happen, and who was to blame. In the end, nobody is, and often, no reason. but it takes a lot of personal suffering to really come to this realization. Sometimes it's a whole lifetime. and sometimes it does not come at all.
