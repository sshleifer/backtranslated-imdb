I agree with what "veinbreaker" wrote about the "Ahhhh" feeling that you received at the end of this movie. I absolutely loved the locations they chose to record, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic soundtrack on which Hans Matheson sings. It's Tripp. Nighi was good in his role, Nail was "tugged", Beano was a typical drummer, and Rea held him together. Bruce Robinson was great. Helena was a wonderful girl. But I felt that the performance of Juliet Aubrei was wonderful. The scenes between Aubrei & Robinson killed me! It was perfectly played and the music behind the scene was in place! It's a shame that many musicians have not checked this movie! I told all my friends to musicians. a great quote from Jimmy Nail's character: "It should be a rock & roll, not a phantom of f ***** g opera!"
