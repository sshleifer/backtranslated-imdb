I enjoyed this film because it was a sincere honesty in acting. Writing was superb. James Arness is a great actor and he showed him here. Brian Keith was too old to be Dave Crockett, and could somebody really play Davy, but Fess Parker? Another great actor in this move was Raul Julia, who gave the depth of Santa Anna, a futile and complex person who led Mexico through turbulent times. While some think that the movie was slow, he recorded a battle that took place, a lot of boredom, and a few hours of terrible terror. What impressed me most in this movie is that it made you think about the cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. I think it was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you feel about the politics of that time.
