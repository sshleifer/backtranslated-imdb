The second episode of the first season is a wonderful festive story of love, betrayal, ... and murder, an escaped crazy girl dressed in Christmas. Female (Marie Ellen-Trainor) has just killed her husband on Life Insurance Badge. What starts out as a perfect crime begins the struggle for survival as disturbed, the Santa Claus suit wears a psychopath (Larry Drake, perfectly over the top) threatening her life ... as well as her precious young daughters. This episode is remembered even by those who got acquainted with the program in the meantime. By the way, this reviewer watches every Christmas on a routine. The most striking is the escalation of tensions and narratives, and All Through The Houst is among the best Tales From The Cript.
