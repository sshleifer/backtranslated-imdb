New York I love you is full of love and power. However, it's not for everyone, but it's a wonderful movie. She has a similar Shia LaBeouf (see Transformers, Disturbia, Charlies Angels, I Robot, Indiana Jones, and much more), Maggie K, Kevin Bacon, Blake Liveli, Natalie Portman, and more. With actors with stars, this film is no doubt brilliant. From many top managers around the world, this does not fail to impress. The diversity of one story to another is creative and unique. It can be said that a New York I Love Iou movie about popcorn and that it should be looked at BIG TV! This time, believe IMDb rating, because it's a great movie. We are looking forward to Shanghai I love you in 2010 year. Look NOT OR, you will not be disappointed.
