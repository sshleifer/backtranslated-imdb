This is hard to watch - as the former critic said. This is incredible with regard to the terrible films that emerged immediately after World War II - in particular the "liberation" of Dahua. It is clear that from the middle of the war we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence that shows "transport" is alive, almost as if it is based on a real movie (the Nazis wanted to record their crimes). Knock as a Nazi is brilliant. Shows the flow of Nazi career. This drawing is particularly pronounced when compared with the reactions of other Germans, at first laughing at Hitler, then unbelievers and finally helpless. This contrast, however, allows us to believe in the "conversion" of a young Nazi officer into an anti-Nazi attitude. It happened, as a witness to several attempts against Hitler, and especially Stafenberg's plot, which took place while this film was coming out. A powerful movie, which uses the effects of flashbacks, accurately predicting the Nuremburg tracks and others that would occur after the end of the war.
