This film and its sequel, Barri Mckenzie, holds his own, are the two biggest comedies ever produced. The great story a young Austrian guy travels to England to look for his legacy and meet with his friends, who are just as kind and innocent as he is. where else could anyone find someone who needs such a nasty drink that he is dry as a dead dingoes donger? great characters, top actors, and has great hair and even more Fosters consumes then any other three films together. Top. And some of the funniest songs you will ever hear, and they are full of great celebrities. Definitely my two favorite films of all time, I watch them at least once in two weeks.
