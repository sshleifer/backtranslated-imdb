I caught this film about 1990 on the video accidentally and not knowing what I was. Many horror fans may have missed this by thinking that this is a typical prison movie, and those who received it did not like it because that's not what they wanted to see. These factors are probably the reasons why they are low rated, but you ignore it and turn around if you are a fan of the genre. and the jail itself. Absolute diamond, a film I still have on a video today. Take a look at.
