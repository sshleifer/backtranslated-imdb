The best movie about Blaise's modesty I've ever seen. That's a good pilot for the TV series. I even think it's a little "cult", like with a little touch of magic Kuentin Tarantin, or something like that. They captured many characters of Modesty, but I admit that I missed Villa Garvin. Even if I read many comic books and books by Peter O'Donnell, I'm not disappointed with this film, quite the contrary. Positively surprised by this story of Modesty and her childhood. I did not expect so many expectations for the bad movie from 1966. I may have overestimated this film a bit. But if you like comics and other stories about Mods Blaise, you should definitely see this! I can not wait for tracking ...
