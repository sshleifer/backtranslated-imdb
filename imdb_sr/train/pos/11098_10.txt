Brendan Filone is absolutely the best character in Sopranos. He died by shooting him in the eye. This was the best and best orchestrated scene ever in Sopranos. Brendan Filon is too good. Brendan Filon will persecute Uncle Junior in her dreams, while Uncle Junior can no longer take it. Brendan Filone is the best character. Brendan Filone was killed in episode # 3, denial, rage, admission. But his legacy will live forever. Brendan Filone is the best character on Sopranos! Brendan Filon is the best figure ever. I recommend this show to anyone who loves a drama and wants to see good death scenes and excellent direction and production, because it can not be better than this series. Brendan Filone is the best.
