This is a really big movie. Perfect dialogue without typical cliches. This film rely on the actor's talent and was withdrawn. She even had a little comedy in her, but it was not too much. This is what a criminal drama should be, and not the typical special effects of garbage with sex inserted. Especially I liked the interracial aspects of all this. Laurence Fishburne was great at playing a petty criminal in his career. It is a pity that he is allowed to show his talent in his film. Titus Velliver was fantastic as Fishburne's drug addict. Eamonn Walker added flavor to a perfectly spicy movie. Paul Calderon was perfect as a fat / drug master. I loved his acting from "King of New York". But the best actors in this film are Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who are perfectly paired as two Calderon supporters. Once in a lifetime is a safe guard. **** 1/2 * from *****.
