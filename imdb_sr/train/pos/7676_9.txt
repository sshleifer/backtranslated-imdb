Brilliant! My wife and I joined a vast line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the movie, I can understand why there was such a long line. Holly is a moving story about an impossible link between two people. She is a young girl, a Western woman is worn out. The film touched every bone in our body. There are no graphic scenes or anything that is difficult to watch - his surrealism of normality that really hits you in the intestine. The movie is beautifully filmed. Among other things, we loved a scene in which Patrick teaches Holly to drive a small engine. The deficiency of Thui Ngoiena (she can not believe it was her first acting career) and the performance of Ron Livingston stayed with me for a couple of days. Recommended.
