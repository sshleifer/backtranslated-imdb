Welcome to Collinvood is a lot of things, but it's none of the following: George Cloonei's Vehicle Unfunny Un-Original And to know, the base for the movie is yet another Movie. But, as Hollywood is concerned, this can be categorized with their most potent results in this decade - for me it is. The film is from the beginning to the end, the absolute gas. Here's why. In the film there is no bad performance. Funny parts are funny. Sharp parts are nervous. The script contains, not a boring moment of dialogue. And it's not in line with the Hollywood standard (you'll see what I mean, when you see a movie) When I was a kid, I remember seeing commercials for the movie. This movie went under the radar after it did not make much money at the box office, and it is not even a cult classic. The reason why Transformers 2 were considered acceptable for average movie visitors is that they are accustomed to see Transformers 2. If the movie is genuine and fun as it is exhausted as often as millions of pieces with cinematic experience would be a much more cool place - When they say they do not make them as it used to, 'they' did not see Welcome to Collinwood. <br /> <br> Fun, mini-masterpiece of comedy, which refuses compromise. One of my favorites.
