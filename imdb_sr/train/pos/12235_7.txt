The "unbelievable muddy man" is a fantastic, brutal and energetic production of the Z-class that every self-confident freak from the horror camp simply has to see for himself / herself! The ideal way to describe this low cost budget gem is like a shammy copy of Hammer's "Kuatermass Experiment" ... just a thousand times dirtier! Astronaust Steve West is the only surviving catastrophic space mission, but it turns out to be the carrier of a terrible disease that makes it radioactive and ... causes it to dissolve! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve left the hospital, leaving a trace of sticky manure and fell off parts of the body behind him. Dr. Ted Nelson must find it urgent, because the disease also prompted Steve with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound totally stupid, but this film is incredibly fun and contains great effects of makeup from Rick Baker's hand. A melting face looks like a rotting pizza and its heavy breathing sound like Darth Vader! Another great advantage is that the script by Villiam Sachs does not waste time on boring scientific explanations or emotional speech. Oddness begins immediately and lasts until the last moment of the film. Just enjoy this stupid horror and try to exclude brain activity as much as you can, because if you start to think of many nonsense in the script, you will miss all the fun campaign!
