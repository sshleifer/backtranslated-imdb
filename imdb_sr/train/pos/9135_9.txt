I do not care how bad the comments are given by the violet rain, this film is rocking! Great movie, it has everything, great music (prince rude!), Romantic and drama. This is a really sad movie, very mobile. I do not want to say TO much more, I do not want to surrender the action, but I will say this - the movie is VERY real, there are so many romantic connections that go through these problems, so many families similar to those shown in the movie. I think it's very realistic and it's so realistic that the film is moving much more. My generation loved this movie as it grew up, so many of us loved the Prince and there are many things that apply to every teenager who has gone through similar problems. I recommend it to all age groups. And it's not all that dark, the film has great music, bands scene and a sexy fun scene between Prince and Appelonia.
