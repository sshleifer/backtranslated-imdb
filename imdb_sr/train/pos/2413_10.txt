I love TV show. I saw it for the first time. I wish I was there with them. It touches reality when you love someone and you think that you want to spend the rest of your life, then at an event that introduces you, and that person is the more people you want to be. You are in the situation that you have to choose one or the other. Someone will hurt, there is no stop. Making a decision is difficult, but do you want to continue to be unhappy when you could be. Why go further and live a life that you thought you wanted or think you are doing the right thing and that you are both unhappy. This other person will not wait for the waiting time, they have a good life. Making the decision you really want will be better at the end. Making the best of what you have is good for good. Money, cars, houses, etc. They do not make you happy because you have one person you really want to share with us.
