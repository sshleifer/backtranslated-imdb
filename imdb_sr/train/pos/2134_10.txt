Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to the American film is enormous. His heritage is an exceptional group of films that will live forever, as is the case with the "Corner Shop". This film has been redecorated in other less impressive films and a musical show, without the charm and elegance of its own and definitive version of the g. Lubitscha. Their characters in this film stand out as an example of how to be in a movie and almost never appear. Both stars are wonderful as friends who do not know each other, but who sent them fate in the same store in Budapest. The reason why these classic movies work so well is incredible supporters put together the study together in a picture by image. Here we have a wonderful Frank Morgan, who plays the shop owner. Also, we see Joseph Sildkraut, Feliks Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among other things, doing an impressive work on believing that they are in Budapest. !
