Although this movie has some weaknesses, it's worth a look at it. I chose it for actors and applauded Bonham Carter and Branagh because they chose roles that are different from those they took in the past. They both show very upset people, along with warts, but they make them sympathetic for their humanity. The story is touching, but these are rising images. "Jane" Bonham Carter is an extraordinary accomplishment, whose search for a romantic opened her eyes to aspects of disability that I have not thought before, but it was also interesting for other reasons. I felt that the film ended too abruptly, but better than that of an emotionally manipulated ending (see "Machey"). .
