This film was filmed at the Gerard Gardens in Liverpool and was the UK's response to films such as 'Blackboard Jungle'. The film goes through the test of time, with all the moral stories that are today (or even more) relevant today. The film shows the great performances of some prominent British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heivood. Baker plays a cop from Liverpool in charge of juvenile delinquency, assuming that if you catch children at an early age, they will be responsible adults. Significant cameos in the film include Freddie Starr (Fred Fovell) and Melvin Haies (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chov play their siblings (they are real-life siblings) who are caught in a netmaker's network. Tsai Chin still behaves and can be seen in Nicole Kidman's latest film The Interpretor. Violent playground has a siege gun in school, so it is unlikely to be shown on TV after similar events in Scotland / Russia. I lived in the Gerard Gardens where the film was filmed (although it was not born at that time), and have nice memories of this area. I recently completed a documentary about Gerard Gardens, which includes excerpts from 'Violent Plaiground' and a small British film 'Coast to Coast' starring Lenny Henry and Pete Postley. The apartments were demolished in 1987, and the films in some way maintained a lively memory. There were some complaints by residents when the film was released, while the film showed the area in bad light. Time helped to cure these wounds. A little jewel of a movie, I would recommend that you look for this
