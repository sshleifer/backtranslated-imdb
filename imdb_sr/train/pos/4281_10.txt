One of my favorite "domestic" films. I do not know if there is someone in our country who has not seen this movie! It's funny and sad in some moments ... I do not know how people around the world (who had the opportunity to watch it) accepted this film, because you need to know some moments in our Serbian history and the character of the Serbs in the first half of the 20th century, so you can understand this! But as I see here, someone from Canada looked at it ... and he liked it. I think I will try all the good quotes from the movie put on this site, but first find out how to do it ... Cheers.
