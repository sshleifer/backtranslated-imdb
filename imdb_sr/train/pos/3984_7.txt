As part of the Casino Roiale edition, this film with the new Bond is featured by director Roger Michelle (Notting Hill). I almost turned it off because I was a bit boring, but I'm glad I kept it. Mostly Mai (Anne Reid) is single mother Helen (Anna Vilson-Jones) who barely sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend for years. Her daughter says she could marry her new boyfriend, Darren (of course, Daniel Craig). After meeting only a few days, Mai and Darren have a secret affair. And in her age, with the 30th, and the new Bond?! In any case, they obviously want to keep it secret, but Mai has regrets and wonder if Helen will find out. When he does, Darren has less trouble since May. In fact, Helen asks her permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harri Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good!
