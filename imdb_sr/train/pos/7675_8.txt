After I watched the movie last night, I remained with the feeling of hopelessness faced by organizations trying to solve the problem that the film shows. The extent of prostitution looks so great that it is difficult to see how it can be won without major government changes in Cambodia. In any case, at review. Although it's a dark movie with an unpleasant central link, it's a very striking movie, and I would even go so far as to say it was pleasant. The film was well arranged during the performance and the performance of Thui Nguien was excellent. I also felt that Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. It would be nice to have a little more insight into why Patrick thinks he needs to help Holly, but maybe the reason is simple because he explains the character of Chris Penne. I'm not going to explain it here - go see the movie. This is a good movie that provokes thinking with obviously good intentions. I hope it will get enough wide audience to reach the audience of decent size and get more support for the K-11 project.
