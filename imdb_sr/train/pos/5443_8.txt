For what it is, this is a pretty good movie. I like both Johns-Stamos ("Full House") and Stockvell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both give strong performances. Love interest is fine, but this is more a movie character than a good movie. I love Harleys, and I hate to see them cover "14 hand-coated handkerchiefs" with a good old Drab's olive oil. There is a small lesson from the history in which Harlei-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in World War II. I do not know if the training was like this one! The film kept my interest all the way, without any slowdown, with good action sequences. I like to watch the demographics of voting - an 18-year-old gave it to movie 10 (a true bike lover, I suppose). I would not give 10, but I gave it 8. I do not measure every movie with the same scale. There are big-budget films, with great actors, who expect you to be good, so that when they fail, they collapse. (Star Vars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SV films, but I thought Episode I was weak in comparison. So he gets a lower rating than me from this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
