I loved that I was a fan of the original series, I always wondered what the story would be like in the background - it did not delight me. I also like the fact that besides Eric Stoltz I did not recognize any person - this is refreshing, just like the BSG. He introduced me with the full wealth of new talents - I can not wait for the series to start broadcasting. Well done Ronald D. Moore and the team - a great job. Special effects, dialogue and acting were visible, and I felt emotionally tied to the story. I know there are purges there who will probably disagree with my estimate, but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most Sci-Fi materials produced in the last decade.
