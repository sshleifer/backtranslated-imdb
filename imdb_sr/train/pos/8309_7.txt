It's always a nice surprise when a movie made for television turns out to be entertaining, such as Little Richard. This is a highly-watched film about the story of Rock and Roller, Little Richard, played by actor Leon, who had never seen before, but he does a very good job. Like most TV films, this is a little meek but if it's made to China is a shame because I'm sure we could see much about Little Richard who was controversial. Instead, we see a lot of religious nonsense that is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually ruined a very promising career. All in all, this movie is good and the acting is above the average TV movie. 7 of 10
