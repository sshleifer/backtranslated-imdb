Things to come are rarities of rarity, a film about ideas. Many films represent a vision of the future, but few try to show us how this future has come to be. The first part of the film, when the war comes to Everytin, is short, but powerful. (The irony is that the film audience, in its year of publication, laughed with reports that enemy airplanes attacked England - calm was at its peak. Vejs predictions soon appeared. The pair of work models is the most effective. Explaining the titles strongly resemble the German graphic design of expressionism. The artistic director was a great Villiam Cameron Menzies, and his set of ruins of Everytown are among his best works. Margaret Scott is very seductive as bosses of mistresses. Lifestyle of the 21st century is an equally striking design. The 21st Century story is not tempting - it may have been an attempt to counter the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970. it could be much better, even with the technology of the 30s. This is especially unfortunate because the scenes of gigantic planes are very convincing. This is bought by the magnificent speech of Raymond Massage, who ends the film - rarely has the ideal of scientific progress that is so well expressed. The latest Massey question is now more relevant than ever, in the era of serious limited flights in space. The scene is backed by the exciting music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose name I proudly share. Unfortunately, the VHS version of this movie is absolutely terrible, with serious technical problems. Most versions have changed the interesting installation of futuristic workers and machines that lead us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD of the whole movie.
