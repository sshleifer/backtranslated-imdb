This film may look dated today, but remember it was filmed in 1974 - before Saturdays Night Live, before Howard Sterne, when George Carlin just crossed Hippie Dippie Veatherman in heavy satirical humor. This film is the grandfather of all of them. Enjoy its historical significance, as well as its powerful entertainment value.
