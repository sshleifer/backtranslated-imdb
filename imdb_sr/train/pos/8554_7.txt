Wow, this was another good spin off of an original American pie, not as good as a camp camp, but definitely much better than naked miles. Dvight and Erik stifler lead this comedy in this, but I actually preferred a dialogue in this one to a bare mile. The script was written much better and the comedy went smoothly, but most of the comedy came from sex, but that's fine because that's the reason why we watch those movies anyway? The young wall also had a very good stamp, given the intense effort he gave in the bare mile, his scene with the sting was horrible and made me laugh when I saw him. /> Film is definitely an improvement in my opinion compared to a million miles, if you like some of the previous American movies for movies, you should like the beta house, unless you watch all American pies from waste money.
