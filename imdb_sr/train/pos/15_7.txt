I guess if the film has magic, I do not need to be fluid or sexy. Can skip background information, go too fast in some places, it is too slow in others, etc. Magic in this movie: a scene in the library. There are many minor disadvantages in Stanley & Iris, but they do not diminish the overall positive impact of looking at people helping one another in the areas of life that seem to be the most incredible, the most difficult to repulse. Both characters are smart. Still, Stanley can not understand enough to work because she can not read; she can not read because she has too many childhood adventures. Iris, though well educated, did not have enough adventures and so she could not figure out how to move along the reversal that took her life. And in their manners and forces, the characters are complementing each other. Perhaps it's a bit hard to accept that Iris would work year after year in the factory, or that Stanley never hide his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better paid job. And while these "mysteries" are explained during the story, their development seems to be somewhat fictitious. I guess no one took the time to think about the script. Still, is that a good movie? Imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would do on the screen if someone had it!
