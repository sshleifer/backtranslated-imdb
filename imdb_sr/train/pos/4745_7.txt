I can not understand why they decided to publish this film in order to introduce the Jet Li dynamo to the American audience. A handful of legends would be a much better choice. In any case, the black mask is not terrible, but certainly not great. The last row of the fight was well placed by Iuen Voo Ping who continued to coordinate Matrix. However, the English edition suffers from rough editing and duplication. Jet Li shows her characteristic charisma in the main role, and Francoise Iip has a cool but short role as a female 701. The mask has a strange Gothic style that adds interest, but is overburdened with fights and explosions of a pistol. The greater focus on Li's fantastic physical abilities was fine. The black mask is a decent movie, but do yourself a favor and pick up the Fist of Legend if you want to see a huge movie that really shows Li skills.
