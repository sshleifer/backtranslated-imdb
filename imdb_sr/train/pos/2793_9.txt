It is a pity that because of this title, this film will avoid people who hate football. Bend It Like Beckham is much more than a sweet sports movie. The line of the story is touching and intelligent, and not to be ridiculous, the jokes laughed loudly, and the characters acted well. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, performing great performances both on the field and outside. Anupam Kher is as diverse as Jess's worried father, and Jonathan Rhis-Meiers, who was so astoundingly evil in 'Ride in the Devil', finds himself as good as a handsome guy, once, taking full advantage of his lavish Irish accent! Even if you do not like football, take a look at this movie. If nothing else, it will make you laugh.
