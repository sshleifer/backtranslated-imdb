It's a good show, and it's funny for me. Finally, the bad Latin stereo types are over! Â¡Gracias, Senor Lopez! I love this show, and I just started to watch it three months ago. The whole concept of a Latin family TV show really amazed me. I'm surprised that in the end Latinos have a good chance to be on TV. This show is probably one of the best I've seen, funny, warm, tense and nice.
