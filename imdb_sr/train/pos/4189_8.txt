Richard Vidmar is infected with the character in this film. He's a professional pocketperson. He is in prison three times, but at the beginning of the film he is trying to be four. Thelma Ritter is a busy information about selling the body to almost everyone. Jean-Pierre is incredible as a girlfriend infuriated by Vimarka. This is a period that emerged in the time of McCarthy, when the red terror was a politician and quite well entered this plot. What is unusual in this movie is that Peters & Ritter is the victim of violent beating in an era where women in movies rarely have sex objects. This is what makes this film crazy because women often have different roles in this type of film. The film is only a mere 87 minutes long and is obviously made by Foca as a double-featured card in the theater. Sets show that film is a limited budget. The script made J Edgar Hoover crazy because patriotism was given a short effort. Hoover wanted to change that. Instead, it became a picture under the map B, which in 1953 was the hit of the sleeper. The script and acting in it are better than other great features of that year.
