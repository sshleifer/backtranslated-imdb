I know it's rough, and I know it's not a PC at all, but it's so funny. If you can put it in the perspective that it's been from the early 80's and carry all stereotypes of time - and the movie still makes you almost out of laughter - it's really a good comedy. In accordance with the tradition of comedies for thousands of years, the theme of this film is exaggerated. If you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half, just to make a full laugh, then please be watching it. P.S. Would someone please put this on a DVD, so it's hard to find on VHS anymore.
