I am not a fan of new films, but this was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children could look together - how unusual! Aunt liked me too. He had laughter, tears, love, adventures, special effects, good actors - and the parrot speaking. It reminded me of my favorite, The Wizard of Oz. The hero, Paulie, an intelligent parakeet, is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always keeping in mind his decision to find his friend, Marie. Recommended.
