Perhaps I am here in front of me, but even though the film was a kind of technical masterpiece for my time, I watched it a piece by piece last night, and the question arises: Why did they do it? endangering their lives, many of them were killed on the road, why would they go on such a life-threatening journey, only to find food for their animals (!) when they reached the "land of milk and honey," why they did not just stay there? Would you endanger your life, and the life of the whole community, just to find livestock feed? However dangerous it is only for this purpose, it shows the innate simplicity of these types of people. Risk for a cow? Better than them!
