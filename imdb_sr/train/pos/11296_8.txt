I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 years old and left high school, I was employed at 20th Century Fok as a member of the Association of Workers and Employers. At the end of the first day (sweeping the deck of the aircraft carrier) I was told to bring the suitcase the next morning with enough clothes, etc. One or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning the bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south to San Diego. We stopped a little in a military base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. When we got into bed, we went north for a couple of miles to Camp Pendleton, the great base of Marine. There, on the beach, we started building what was to be the base of the Japanese Pacific island. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water reservoir, a fence of pistols, trenches and a living room. It was all on a high level, sometimes 'golden', which tripled our regular schedule. Our food was also the first speed - top lunch rib, etc. - which was incredible because it was warlike and it was difficult to get good meat at home. a film went out, about eight or ten months later. Then I waited impatiently for two hours of film before my work finally came to the screen. Then there were no more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the hero of the film who threw the bomb on the base and blew into pieces. A bit disappointing, but still fun. Despite the disappointment I enjoyed the movie and since then I have not seen it. Later I learned that this film was signed by the government, and Fox was paid on the basis of cost plus, which may explain our extravagant paycheck and lifestyle there. Bob Veverka
