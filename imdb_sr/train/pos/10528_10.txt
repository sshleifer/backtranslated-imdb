I was so impressed with the movie version of Doug McGrath's novel Jane Austen "Emma", and I loved Rachel Portman's music score so much that when I went to a videotape one day, I discovered that the two of them reunited for "Nicholas Nickleby" I immediately got it rented without any other thinking. I read the book, and for those too critical fans of this adaptation, Jane Austin, I do not know what McGrath could still do to perfectly capture the spirit and main elements of the action of Miss Austen, especially given the limitations of the two-hour film (some have complained that they are too long!). As for the accent of Gwen Paltrow, I must admit that I was not too familiar with her when I first saw it in the theater, and then I was absolutely convinced she was an English actress! I am delighted by those who criticized the film for its lush landscapes. It's one of the things I enjoy and I'm looking forward to seeing in pieces set in an English village. The beautiful background of the film is a major contribution to his attractiveness and success. If your idea of ​​an escapist tariff is somewhat miserable, then you might need to rent something like "Death Vish III!" The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the actors, and they combine with a story and a sound pad for fun that does not keep you from repeating the reviews. McGrath is a miracle choreographed by the interaction of subtle expressions that are so important in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that appears in this story. This refreshing movie could also be a clinician how to enjoy a movie minus sex, violence or even a negative antagonist. The story is often fun, lovely, and sometimes quite touchy. I have seen many competent adaptations of the book Jane Austen, but this is no doubt my favorite.
