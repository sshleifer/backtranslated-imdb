Lili Povers works in speakeasa until her father dies. Then he goes to New York to work in a business building. There he notes that if he wants to get more, he must give the men what they want. Alfred E. Green's Babi Face (1933) is a high-sex movie. For the film of that era, anyway. This was one of the last pre-code movies that were made. Stanvick gives a very sexy performance like Lily. Other actors include George Brent (Courtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Ned Stevens), Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henri Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsai (Ann Carter) and Theresa Harris (Chico). Young John Vaine is seen as Jimmy McCoi Jr. This film deals with a brave topic and makes it good. Babi Face is a historically significant movie and therefore good to watch.
