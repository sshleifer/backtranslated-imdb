This is not just one of the biggest films of Jackie Chan, but one of the greatest kung-fu films of all time. We came to expect crazy acrobatics and fast, creative action in Chan movies, and this set a benchmark for others. Two hours of pure entertainment, which impresses to the end. Like top-ranked action, we have a sustainable story and convincing characters, and Chan takes what appears to be Western access writing, blending eastern methods of solving (for example, hitting your ass). All in all, it's funny, serious, fun and revolutionary. It is indispensable for every fan of kung-fu, while at the same time it remains available to a wider circle of the film community.
