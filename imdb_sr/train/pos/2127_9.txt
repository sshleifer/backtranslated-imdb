Calling this romantic comedy is true, but it's misleading today. Unfortunately, the genre exacerbated the clich√©s, too much focused on bringing the main couple together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formic and overly predictable. The shop around the corner does not suffer from these diseases: it manages to create a recognizable middle / eastern European atmosphere and has a strong role besides (also strong) nominal traces; I avoid using the words 'support cast' like, for example, Mr. Morgan (Frank Morgan) had a central role in the film and his story is equal, if not more important than romance. Film from 1998 You have a message that you borrowed from this movie and that's why it's charged as a remake. It's not true and in fact it's unfair to the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows the element of the plot, but that's all.
