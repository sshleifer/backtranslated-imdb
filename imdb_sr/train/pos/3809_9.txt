Did you hear the story of the heroes who were not willing, whom the king hired to kill the dragon? Oh, are you? Was this in a world made up of small islands floating above the clouds, and did the heroes have to make dangerous jumps from one island to another on their journey? Did the water flow up and the remains of large cities float on the horizon? I did not think so. I accidentally came across this movie and I'm really glad that I did it! It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Similar to Picard movies, it's part of the computer animation that's only possible in today's world. The animators have put thought into almost everything that appears on the screen, and that attention to detail is astonishing (a scene in which mushrooms in the foreground undermine the green smoke until the characters unconsciously walk in the background is one of my favorites). Monsters are also fully realized and wonderful for watching in action. Although the action may not be completely unique, the film has enough charm to make sure you keep looking. Our protagonists are cute and interesting, ensuring that the audience stands behind their almost impossible quest to reach the ends of the earth and destroy the dragon who would otherwise devour everything in its path. Of course, Hector is the person who will fall in love most. A little blue creature with a crazy smile and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and English, Hector gives a comedy in the way Jar Jar Binks could only dream. In short, I would recommend watching Dragon Hunters if you get a chance. Beware of incredible animation, breathtaking battles, and insights into a world that is not like anything you saw on a movie or television screen. At a minimum, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - whether you're nine or twenty-nine (which, in fact, I am)!
