** Warning! Spoilers Ahead! ** This short text is part one of two, which explains the short part of the "Matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the matrix has become. Since we already know the story, the story itself is not a surprise; and briefly not so much fun as informative. But it is so presented, as a file in historical archives. Visual effects are better than average, and usually cold colors help the goal of a short one. A few problems. Violence of the story is somewhat unreasonable and, combined with the occasional dose of political correctness (UN scene), diminishes a flat short story. In addition, it is necessary to see that the second part is complete. The Animatrix Concept is brilliant, and despite several problems, this short film continues to fulfill its purpose. It would not fit into the original movie in style, content or stream. This is the perfect method for discovering history. Bottom line: Good information. It could have been said a bit better, but still solid 7 out of 10.
