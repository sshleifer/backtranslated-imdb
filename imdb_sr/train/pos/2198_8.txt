The third film, Fred MacMurrai / Carole Lombard, is a bit more serious than a hand over a table and a princess. This is another adaptation of the play Burlesque, which was obviously popular at the time. The original drama Burleskue ran on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 plays and it was the role played by Carole Lombard by Barbara Stanvick on Broadway that brought her to Hollivood. The version was played by Nancy Carroll in the early days of the talkie, and later on Betty Grable and Dan Dailey published another version of it in the Vangu Mi Babi Smiles At Me. I actually have a vinyl album from the radio version made by Al Jolson and Rubi Keeler for the Luk Radio Theater. That's an interesting business, believe me. In any case, MacMurrai and Lombard are in good agreement with the old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer, and MacMurrai is a jazz trumpeter. Record the beautiful performance Dorothy Lamour as a Latin fox that fits between Fred and Carole. Also, Anthony Kuinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the mark for Lombard. Swing high, Swing Hunting looks good today and I would not be surprised if we see another version of Burlesque for the twenty-first century.
