The Prince plays 'Kid' in this semi-autobiographical film of a talented, but narcissistic young musician who has less than star-life. It's true that the actor leaves an awkward desire (except that Morris Dai, and especially Clarence Villiams who are both perfect), but the film is still excellent and among the best that emerge from the 1980s. It has the best soundtrack of BILO KOJEG film from the last 50 years, highly quoted lines, and the scene with the containers is HILARIOUS !! Apollonia is simply amazing. In an unrelated manner, when I saw Prince at the 2004 concert, he broke down the stadium. He's an expert shoemaker and it was one of the best concerts I've ever experienced.
