I saw this movie at midnight at the request of an evening, not knowing what to expect. I've heard of this movie, but I've never had any opinion about it. I must say, I was impressed by what I saw. I was sincerely scared in some parts and I definitely remember that I jumped several times to my seat. The blob looked intimidating. Now, I look at the jar of jelly and I wonder if it will cling to my own hand. Steve McKueen was really good as Steve Andrevs, the protagonist of the movie. And I liked the old man at the beginning. For a horror movie of the 50's, this was very well made even by today's standards. 8/10.
