I'm really aging, in the midst of watching this 40-year-old film, and wondering what my grandchildren will watch for 40 years, his old saying, but they do not do it anymore. ... it's not just a story, its music, acting and young and old ... actors, it seems, were born to play their roles, young oliver, old Fagin .. too much to mention, the role that Judge Oliver had before, I saw in other roles over the years .. skillful dodger, Ron Moody as Fagin ,, Mr and Mrs bumble ,, the film won not only 5 Oscars, but he also won several awards from the Golden Globe ... if you decide to watch this movie. Do yourself a favor, take a couple, if not all children, to see this masterpiece
