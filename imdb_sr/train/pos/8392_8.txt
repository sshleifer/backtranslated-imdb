This film shows artistic film techniques in which, instead of capturing the attention of the camera, the camera sees minute details of how someone appears, how a woman can wear a cocktail hat and wrap it in paper. How a husband may wear a hat and socks and shoes and underwear and both look so completely relaxed and comfortable. As the woman is provocative, she is another feature of the table that the director says to inform us that she is a sexually free spirit and aims to gain the pleasure she seeks without flirting directly or with any particular sensitivity to what a person feels. The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is open in which it does not hold anything, does not feel a particular shame on how it behaves and wants to share these facts with it because its primary focus is always on the fact of their marriage. Nothing and no one can come between them. Only chances for destiny can intervene - his detention during the war and what follows after his return. A very intriguing movie that absolutely absorbs.
