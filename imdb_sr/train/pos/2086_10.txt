Trusted in the work of Pearl S. Buck, who spent years in China as a child of the missionary parents who gave her deep insights into Chinese culture and her philosophy, this film adaptation is brilliantly done, both in technical skill and in acting. /> Vang Lung is a modest farmer who is grateful for the basics of life: to survive his country and to marry again with Olan, a servant of the rich and powerful family in the village. Despite Wang Lung and Olan's best efforts to cultivate the country, raising children and generating savings and wealth, hunger threatens to destroy everything they were doing. They decided not to sell their land, a traditional Asian conviction, instead traveling to the big city and waiting for hunger. While in town, they are reduced to begging and are just one of hundreds of other unhappy families of homeless people. Although not a robber, Olan is caught in a mob looting the rich man's home. The army was rounded to execution, but it is preserved at the last moment. Her good fortune, however, was that she found valuable precious jewels at the place of the robbery, which gave her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm and start over again. The newly discovered wealth is transformed by Vang Lung. He becomes selfish, selfish, and takes the merit of discovery. He becomes a very wealthy farmer, but it only aggravates things because he is increasingly becoming less and less appreciated, arrogant and difficult to understand. He loses contact with the basic things in life that money can not buy: loyalty, dedication, trust, honesty and honesty. As a punishment, nature once again turns the table to Wang Lung by sending the jar of the locusts to destroy everything he has. Taken to his knees, Vang Lung seeks help from all friends, ex-friends, workers and families. With all this help, he managed to save the farm. From that experience, he returns to humility and gratitude for the basics of life.
