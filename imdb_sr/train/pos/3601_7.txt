Michelle Rodriguez is the main actress who could be full force for other actresses. She has the daring to be in her early career (and withdraw), in the rarely seen role of a difficult girl, which is a venture to be recognized. Though her later films played the same role, this film was made for its robustness. Her character is a romantic student / fighter / lover, struggling to overcome his frustrated existence in projects, and this is a bit exaggerated in the film ... but not by the girl. This aspect of this film is not really genuine, but the story goes deep when warm relationships that this girl has to solve come to boil, and her primary anger takes over. I do not. I saw that the actress took such an aggressive attitude in filmmaking, and I'm glad she gets that original craft in Hollivood. This movie got 7 of me because of the average story about the young gay, but she has such a great actress that shows a rarely seen role in the film about the minimum budget. Great work.
