11 nominations for Oscars and zero win !!! I have yet to understand why - it's not as if the actors in the film did anything better after doing it by awarding rewards for trivial roles like that done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Vhoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover etc. - they were all incredible - I'm interested in getting the scripts of the Oscars on that year ... I should be in the Shoulda-villa-coulda category for judges ... <br /> <br> His amazing book - but the true style the writing of Alice Valker, has a way of looking like he exaggerates in his characters - p and I'm glad they've adapted the screen. Cinematography was incredible - African scenes live a lot to be desirable - the African part of the book should be set up in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - OR oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that I can not think of Africa outside Safari - so there must be a free scene of zebras and wild animals when we all know that there is no West Africa ---- and most of all why people who speak Swahili --- who speaks Swahili in West Africa? I just had to remove it ....... But as a story - an incredible, filmmaking - out of this world - CLASSIC yes! I have it and I watch it when my soul needs a little rejuvenation.
