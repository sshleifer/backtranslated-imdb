Cliffhanger is what looks like Slivester Stallone's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor. It's a hiker who has to help his friend after holding him as hostage takers who want to find three suitcases with a $ 100 million coin. It has a great action sequence, the edge of the seat and entertainment in movies.
