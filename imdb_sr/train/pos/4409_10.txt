This film is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave him 10 marks. The story is about the famous Bushvhackers from Missouri who fought on the south side during the war between states. The clothes they were wearing was authentic, the history and why they fought is very precise and well researched. It was actually one of the battles that did not play the way they described it ... but it's not bad for Hollywood. Actors acted well and were either the brightest actors or directors really know how to get the best out of them. I suppose it was a combination of great directing, super-casting to find the right people and great acting. Not just one or two ... this movie is really screwed! It has action, romance, uncertainty, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history in a single movie. There's even a future Spider-Man and a Jewel. And she is good!
