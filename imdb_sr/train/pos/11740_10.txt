I have no doubt that critics have watched this film, especially artistic fartsis that needs a laxative. This is a great movie about the Abbot & Costello tradition, or more recently Don Knotts. It will not shake the world or change movies forever. What it's gonna do is party. When everything is said and done, that is the most important thing. Watch this movie and forget about the problems. It even has a simple and good moral message without extra charge. I always loved Elvir's TV show when I lived in LA. She did not really steal Vampire's styles more than Vampire did from the original, Theda Bar. This type of mythical character belongs to one who works best; & Cassandra Peterson does it best. Elvira lived; we need more of these films. It's never enough. Zlikovac, Villiam Morgan Sheppard, was also great. He eats with a beautiful refined malice. I could not find technical errors. Execution is closest to the impeccable form. My deep praise to the director, James Signorell and his crew.
