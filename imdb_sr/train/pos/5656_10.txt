I can never remember the name of this show. When I was eight, I watched him. I remember I stayed late when I did not think I could just watch this show. That was my best performance. As far as I remember, it's still big. This showed that Lucas Black was playing the first guy I fell in love with. I am from the country, so my boys do not like the accent, but I would definitely make an exception for him. After seeing Crazi in Alabama, Friday Night Lights, and Tokyo Drift, you should see why. He is an excellent actor and has been since childhood. I miss this show and I want to come back. If anyone ever sees where they are selling the season, please send me an email. kivildflover16@hotmail.com
