Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) hosts a cheap horor show. After finding out that her dead aunt has left some things, Elvira goes to England to pick her up, hoping it will be some money. But to her horror, Elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her house, dog and cook. Elvira nevertheless decides to hide in the house, but with her striking dark look and her amazing features, she will not be able to live in peace. All neighbors are now turning the whole city against it, and with Elvir's uncanny behavior and appearance, you're better off, because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to watch how Elvira enters all these adventures, she's great. The whole movie puts you in a frenzied mood, of course, it's stupid and jokes are cheap, but it's a pleasure to watch it. I would give Elvira, Lord of the Darkness 8/10
