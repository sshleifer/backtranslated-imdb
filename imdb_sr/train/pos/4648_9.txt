Hilarious, challenging, confusing, brilliant film. It reminds me of Bunuel's L'Age D'Or or Jodorovsky's World Mountain - a lot of strange characters looking for ... what is it? I laughed almost all the way, as long as I kept the peripheral eye on the confused and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theater. Entertaining through and through, from the beginning to the intestine and poisonous internal parts to the end, if it was the end. I wish I could remember every detail. Sometimes I'm being persecuted. Honestly, however, I only have the most positive memories of this movie. Since it does not seem possible to take home and watch, I suppose I will have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover comes to my way with his Big Slide Shov (and the subsequent projection "What is it?"). ... I saw this film in Atlanta almost immediately after being involved in a rather devastating car accident, so I was a little bit stunned at that time, which may have been a very good state of mind to watch the prominent talkative arthropods and retards in superhero costumes and the divine Glover in his proper large K-environment, scarce dressed up of girls who come out of the floor as a magnificent DADAist's wet dream. Of course, EVERYTHING IS EXPECTING that art is exactly that. I prefer that the truth is more obvious in the absence and in the negative space. What you do not tell us is what we have to conclude, but it is more important than the lies that other people feed on us daily. Instead of one "WHAT IS IT?" from 5000 movies such as "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle" (trembling, gag, crying). Thanks, Mr. Glover (additional fun to watch on the screen or in his Big Slide Shovu) - smart, fun, weird and incredibly hot). Make more movies, write more books, live the nightmare.
