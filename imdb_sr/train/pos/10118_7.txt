I really like Miikes movies about Jacuzzi, what I saw two years ago and it really is my head. I've never seen such a sick and distorted thing before. The story is good and the actors do their job well. I did not see the version in the UK or Japan, but I must say that I believe the German DVD is a bit censored. If you have not already watched a movie and live in Germany, it may be better to watch the DVD from the Netherlands or Austria. The I-ON DVD contains a lot of very difficult and nasty scenes, but I felt that there was something missing around the one or two very short scenes. crazy characters and a high level of violence, that's what I like Miike for !!
