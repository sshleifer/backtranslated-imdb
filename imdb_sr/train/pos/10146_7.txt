As we all know, romantic comedy is a genre with a familiar ending. Two traces must always be collected. Later in the third act I was trying to figure out how this would end and how they would end up together. The trace is given from the very beginning, but you will never understand it completely. It's a simple hook, but it works. It needed to cover a lot of common terrain, but it is freshly spinning whenever possible. I liked all NI characters and I liked the sites. It's a postcard from New York. Also, it was nice to watch a movie and find nothing insulting in it. So, if you love a good old fashionable romantic movie ... then this is for you.
