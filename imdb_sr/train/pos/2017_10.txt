After reading here only two comments here, as a lifelong fan of Brontea, starting with Olivia Heathcliffe and supporting many versions of Charlotte's "Rochester", it's more than open to seeing that it is UNsung Bronte's sister who lied to the male-chauvinist period, the trio settled. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of the 19th-century British 19th-century household is that "girls" were all "spinsters" and their only real brushes with "men" were their waxing father and their bummer? Brother. In the end, ANNE Bronte proved, in her unique test, a "feminist" point, a path ahead of contemporary types, including rows of "voting franchises". However, history shows more than a few of those preceding, including Greek heterai and Sappho and similar to the ancient emperor Iang Kuei-fei. And what about "Eve" and her apple?
