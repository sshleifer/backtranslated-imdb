Nice Shireli Temple short. The children actors screaming their lines looked like a norm for that day and time. Maybe it should have been "seen and not heard". Besides, this is fun. Bearing in mind the film era, there are certain aspects of this thing, from a social point of view, which seem to me to be very progressive and liberal. I'm not going to enter these here, I'd rather not ruin it for you, but I would let you look at yourself and see if you'll notice those elements. As it was early, it was easy to see from this short time the fascination that was already developing for the Temple. Therefore, it is worth watching if you are a temple fan. For others it's a cool way to kill ten minutes while waiting for your night glass of milk to warm up on the stove.
