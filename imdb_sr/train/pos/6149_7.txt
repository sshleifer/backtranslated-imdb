I just bought a revamped version of the movie I remember with a lot of love from childhood and it's certainly made for an unusual afternoon party. Bedknobs definitely have more meaning in their complete form, the erased scenes (especially those with McDowall) connect events fairly neatly. What is a little worrying is the way the scenes are rearranged. It is clear that the soundtrack for this recording was lost or damaged, so some great spark in Disney decided to summon the scene with a new dialogue. What would be great except that half of the actors were not there to do it (some for better reasons than others) and the whole thing has a rather poor quality. Some of the synchronized lips are pretty bad, and the voice of David Tomlinson is named by the guy who sounds absolutely nothing like David Tomlinson (I think there are indications of German in it). However, it is good to hear full versions of all songs (although 'Step in the right direction' is still absent) and the magic moments in this film continue to shine. And I challenge you not to giggle when young Paul looks so innocent at Angela Lansbury and swearing, "but what does that have to do with my button?"
