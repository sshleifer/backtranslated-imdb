The first time I saw this movie here in the UK in December 1989 when it was broadcast by the Central Television. I still have a video cassette, although it's exhausted (over the years, many friends and family members lent it and they also cooled it down!). Anyway, I remember that night I came home, grabbed the Christmas pie, turned off the lights and watched what was advertised as 'The Story of the Christmas Spirit'. Even now I remember some scenes that still send the hair on my neck ... I saw some comments about the movie that say it's not that and it's not ... I think you guys were scared by Friday 13 and the like, stems and slash rammel, which are funny. This is the 'traditional' story of ghosts; there are no big budget actions or special effects ... without cursing, without blood, no free sex scenes, no motor chainsaws or pistols etc ... So how refreshing !!!! It's atmospheric. If you like horror horror, well written, well acting and really terrible atmosphere, this is a movie for you. I love original horror; I only saw the original Haunting last night and it's a wonderful movie. Again very atmospheric - like Woman in Black. The end of the movie is different from the book, but it's still very good. I recommend that. Try it ... you * will like it if you like traditional stories about ghosts ... So ... turn off the lights, boost the fire, lock the door, take a drink ... and enjoy ...:)
