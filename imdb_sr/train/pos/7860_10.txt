I've never seen a silent movie until July 24, 2005. I've never seen a movie with Mari Pickford. I've seen thousands of movies. There are not many who hypnotize me. I found Last of Mohicans and Unforgettable (Rai Liotta) to be hypnotic, so consider the source as you read this. I started to watch Tess of the Storm Countri at the TCM just to see who Mari Pickford is, which many have attributed to the launch of Hollivood. I had no idea what I was. Two hours later, I got out of it and realized that I was looking at one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen, playing the role perfectly adapted to her. Imagine a film fan in 1922, who has never seen anyone so beautiful and expressive before. You should see her again and again. The setting was perfect for a girl who is so expressive. She was a poor squirrel, she could not speak royal English, but you had to admire her. What a movie ... time to start my collection of Mari Pickford movies!
