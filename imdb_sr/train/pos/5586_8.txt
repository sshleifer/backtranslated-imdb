Eva (Hedi Lamarr) just married an elderly man and on a honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not want to. Her disappointment with marriage and the lack of love makes Eva return home to her father's farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, while bathing in the lake, her horse runs away with her clothes and the young worker returns and returns Eva. They fall in love with one another and become lovers. Later her husband is missing and trying to return Eva home. Eva refuses, and happiness leads the troika to the same place, finishing this thing in a tragic way. For the first time I watched "Ektase", and the first remark is in relation to the terrible quality of VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Netvork: the film has only 75 minutes of operation, and it seems that different films of the film have been used. Some parts are completely damaged, and other parts are very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the image is not achieved by a Brazilian viewer, if there is a chance to find this rare VHS for rent or for sale. The film is virtually silent, the story is very outdated and has only a few lines. Accordingly, characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very brave, with exposure to Hedi Lamarr with beautiful chest and bare body for the current standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphorical use of flowers, which symbolizes the relationship between Eve and her lover. The way the director performs scenes to show the needs and disadvantages of Eve is very clear. The unobtrusive end is also very unusual for the 1933 film. I liked this film, but I hope that one day I will have the opportunity to see the 87-minute restored version. My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): "ktase" ("ecstasy")
