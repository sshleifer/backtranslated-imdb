Greetings from the darkness. A stunning photo highlights this Disney documentary and provides insight into some of the roughness of animals living in the wild. For anyone over 40, Disnei and Mutual of Omaha's Vild Kingdom have provided much of our insights into wildlife since our childhood ... when there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. What always fascinates is how difficult the circumstances are for many of these magnificent beings. Watching the elephants that move for days, almost in delirium due to lack of water, is so painful. But their nightmare against the lions is exciting. Some underwater images are breathless. Mom and baby humpbacks are beautiful and watching large white sharks attack their prey is all as chilling as "Javs". The most unlikely landscape for me was a wonderful view of the Himalayas. I've never seen such a detail of space. Do not think that most young people today will be too excited about this, but it's certainly one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen.
