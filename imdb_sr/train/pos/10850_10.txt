What a good movie! Finally a picture that reveals an unknown side of the hand: the illusion of glory. Famous Rockers are old and forgotten, not music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock? Anyway, Still Crazi is probably the best movie about rock n'roll that I've ever seen. Much better than Spinal Tap. Why? For in Still Crazi, people are mature. They have a different view of the rock, the love and the life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth that they miss so much. Behind the story itself, we see characters with their personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like every one of us. Spend a good time watching this (listen to a great soundtrack!) And finally thinking about your future. Hello!
