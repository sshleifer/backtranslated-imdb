Freebird is the perfect marriage in comedy on the road, gangs, the "stoner" movie and the British movie. Brilliant main characters put this film next to other films in this genre. The stars Phil Daniels, Gari Stretch and Geoff Bell have great chemistry and make their characters extremely sympathetic and realistic. The main story is about their journey from London to Wales, as well as the adventures and accidents that happen along the way. This little movie also has a great heart - not just for bicycle lovers, because it is based on mutual relationships of the character, including dreams and regrets, as Fred Gary Stretch Fred longed for the family he left. Cinema is also great - a love letter for the Welsh landscape, as well as capturing the impressiveness of London streets and typical beer life in Welsh townships. funny things - I recommend Freebird in a moment!
