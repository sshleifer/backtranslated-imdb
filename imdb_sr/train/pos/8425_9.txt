I finally watched these episodes in 2008. and I had to keep coming back and check when they were actually created. They are absolutely terrifying because they have had fun in the future. Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed the idiocy of Gov Bush or they are strange, creepy people who pay attention to things. Boo, terrible! Bush's brothers who attacked the White House, dressed as Arabs who had guns? Bush 'accidentally' made someone? (No, wait. He did it somehow like a speech.) It may have seemed like a failure at that moment, but now it must be considered brilliant, though a frightful, pre-knowledge.
