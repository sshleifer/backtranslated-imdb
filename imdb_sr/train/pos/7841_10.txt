this is really a treat for every fan of Bolana, some might think it's a bit more than anything, and it's only about Ring and Marc's ego, but I think it's similar to any other concert video, except for the fact that Marc Bolan, Not any type! I especially liked the music video for the children of the revolution, with Elton John and Ring Star. this piston itself is worth the money, I can not believe they did not release this version as a single. The film is really great, especially for us today. I was not alive during the seventies. but today it is generally totally excluded from what was happening around them. The media then did not play or play popular music, including Marc Bolan and T.Rek, only played a little with The Doors, though only very popular songs. So, I know from my father, to see him, to give him a portion of his youth, never experienced him. I will not be doing this for too long, so ... the least fan of Mark Bolan, you have to see this. You may be bored or as you said before, a little above the top. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever, in action! The only thing that disappoints me a bit is that Ride A Vhite Svan is not on tape. but I'm sorry, as Jeepster and Get It He play so nicely.
