I have to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie is uber sweet and I think uber cute. He had all the "sex" content that most of Ivan Reitman's comics had, but with something extra, CHEMIJA. Mind and Luke both have this strange but convincing chemistry that seems to pass in every scene. It seems that both create this strange, distorted and interesting relationship with the strong "sexual" tension you laugh until you feel your face anymore. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting actors perfectly play each other's roles, and even the pretty small role of Vanda Sikes will keep you laughing. Although such comedies are not for everyone, but I have to say that I went with a person who does not usually enjoy these films and he laughed like crazy. This film is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children, because some moments are a little too ... so let's admire for younger viewers. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, hardly the end I found was a bit weaker than the rest of the film. (3 1/2 * of 5 *)
