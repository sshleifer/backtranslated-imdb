Good western recorded in rocky Arizona wildlife. Many hard guys; Cobner's character seemed to be moving forward and backward between an angry psyche and a relaxed guy. There were several holes in the picture, but not enough to make up for what was exciting and worthwhile. One really stupid scene shows that Heston empties .45 cases of their powder and collects it in a bag for the purpose of firing a fire. A. In order to collect so many bullets, he needed a mule to carry ammunition. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not just put a match on it and let it be cleavage?
