What about all the negative comments? After I first saw this film for the first time tonight, I can only say that this is a good comedy for a holiday that will definitely beautify every day a lonely person. When I saw that Ben Affleck could spend the holidays alone, I wanted to cry. You will see a movie if you want to know why. Also, although Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) liked me some time later, if you asked me, they were real snobs. However, this film made me laugh and I feel good inside. Before I finish this, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell has achieved a clean festive hit. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good comedy for a break that will surely beautify the day of every lonely man to everybody, Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate who has not seen him.
