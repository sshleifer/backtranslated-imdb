I think I really love this movie. "Prik de Beaute" was initially a silent film, but was later named in French in 1930. Despite the fact that a strange voice got its name, it remains a staggering tour of Louis Brooks. The fact that her singing voice was called by the legendary Edith Piaf helps us alleviate the purists about fooling duplication. This is the story of Lulu and the first time we see her at the resort with her cat boy, Andrea (Georges Charlia) and their friend Antonina (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame like a pair of legs: we see her in a car changing in a swimsuit. Lulu is very free to show his body and this does not sit well with boring Andre. When Lulu is considering to apply for the title 'Miss Europe', we know that a happy ending will not be at the end of Easi Street. It seems that the film focuses on men who like beautiful women. We see a lot of bathing beauty and reactions from men who stare at them. But in the center of everything is the magnificent Louise Brooks. If you do not mind watching the films from the past, think about watching this movie. Luiz Brooks is not the name that most average movie lovers can easily know, but as you can see, you will be hypnotized and want to know more. Also check in the 'Pandora Box' if you can find it. Be cautious with the American DVD release for Cinema. I do not know if the speed of their screening is correct. It seems that many scenes are displayed too fast. Maybe it's the way they are shot. I do not know. But since this is the only way to see this movie, it's worth swallowing this little bitter pill.
