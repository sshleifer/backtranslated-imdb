I used this film in the class of religion I taught. The goldfish swammerfully swam in his bowl in an apartment on the upper floor. The young man and his mother are away from home. The boy was given the money to buy milk. On his way home, he stops at the carnival to play the game. Next to him is a man in a black suit who looks a bit scary. The boy drops a bottle of milk. It breaks. The man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene changes with what is happening at home. The black cat climbs the fire stairs and enters the apartment. He (?) Reveals the fish bowl and looks at it. The fish swims energically and leaves the vessel. So far, a bunch of teenagers in my class, and I fell in love with the fish. The cat takes the fish into the mouth and we all hold our breath. The cat puts the fish in a bowl. A double story line includes a suspicious man in a black and suspicious black cat. Both are inspiring prejudices. They're both innocent. It was a great start to the debate in my class.
