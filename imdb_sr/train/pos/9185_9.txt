DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a huge surprise. Contains outstanding acting (especially from underrated Callan), fine cinema and a convincing story. In other words, this is one of the most beautiful efforts to emerge from the 1980s. (who is missing the arm and leg). When the models Callan dreams of killing actually become dead, the photographer begins to doubt his common sense ... but the picture has more than he sees. This film has never received praise deserves. Most critics and movie viewers insert it into hordes of slasher movies that are released at the same time, but stand high above most of that regret. He is smart and unique, which is not something that can be said comfortably about most films of this genre, but he was passionately made and performed. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a jewel of its kind.
