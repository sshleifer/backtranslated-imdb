The first time I saw it in the early 1990s on the UK TV, and then I liked it, but I missed the opportunity to record, many years have passed, but the film has always stuck with me and I lost hope of seeing TV again, the main thing who stayed with me was the end, part of the hole in the castle really touched me, he was watching it easily, he had a great story, great music, the list goes on and continues, OK tells me it's okay, but everyone will have their own tub They see that animation is superb and beautiful to watch, it shows its age in just a few parts, but now it's became part of her beauty, so I'm glad she came out on DVD because she is one of the top 10 films of all time. Buy or rent it just look at it, it's best to watch it at night, just with drinks and food at your fingertips, so you do not have to stop the movie. Enjoy
