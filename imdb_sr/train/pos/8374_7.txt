OK, this movie was cool. I do not think it was the best film ever made, but it was certainly fun. My brother and I are still updating our scenes once in a while and from time to time we will pull the film out of the closet, blow off the dust and push it. This is a movie that everyone has to forget about criticism and just enjoy. The verdict is the victory of Robot Joach.
