This is a pretty decent example of film noir. The setting was in the early 1950s, when the Communists tried to steal secret weapons from the US government. Richard Vidmark is a friendly pocket without scruples. He gives pretty decent performance, but he has nothing to do with it. Interestingly, he was not only an anti-hero, but also a large part of the film, an inflexible anti-hero. That's not normal. Jean Pierce gave such a performance as a whore with a golden heart. This great actress Thelma Ritter shines like a chair-pigeon. The store had its share of the plant, wisdom and hard story. At the end of the film (at the metro station) there is a battle scene that was quite rough and exciting. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a bit obsolete, and the whole Commie overstates the matter.
