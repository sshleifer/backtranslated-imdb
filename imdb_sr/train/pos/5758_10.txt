This, in my opinion, is one of the best action films of the seventies. Not only does it have a great team, it is also burdened with wild shootings and explosions that are still impressive today. The story is about Vietnam veteran (Chris Kristofferson) recruited by his brother Jan-Michael Vincent to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Chris starts to use his position and becomes so bad criminals he hired to get rid of it. It's great to see Chris play against the guy. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal provide great support as ladies of two male stars. Jan-Michael shows the real movie star in this movie. I do not think Vigilante Force is on the video, but it appears occasionally on TV. It's a great movie for guys who love movies.
