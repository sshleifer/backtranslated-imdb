The attraction of ancient movies like this is that you will see a real moving picture of life more than 100 years ago. There are many people leaving the factory, they are still dead and none of them are even aware of the size of the invention that they used to walk before. I was shocked when I read a reviewer who called this film boring as home videos today, and at least one else misidentified him as the first film ever made (it was the first movie shot at 16 frames per second, not then normally 46 frames per second). Of course, all you see is the many people who are returning from the building and passing in front of the cinema on the way home from work, but this is curiosity for dozens of reasons, not the least it is that it was the first movie Lumiere's brothers, who probably had a stronger impact on film development than any other individual or group of individuals in history.
