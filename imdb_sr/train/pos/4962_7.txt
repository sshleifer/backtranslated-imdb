Shov's marriage is good. Probably not at the same level as "Akua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast," but definitely has many brilliant moments. Basically it follows the life of Zorak and Brak who have a normal life and go to school, living in a 50-room sitcom neighborhood. The humor and animation of these performances are to a large extent "Akua Teen Hunger" (in one episode you can see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters. But that's good, it has funny parts. Some of the songs are great, others are not many, but I like this show. The most entertaining character is Father Braka. (this is a man, nobody knows why)
