My family and I watched this movie often over the years. It's pure, healthy, heartbreaking and heartbreaking. Showing sympathy between two families of two countries thousands of miles away and the most incredible coincidence, it's almost as if God's hand had to intervene. A tiny girl with a heart attack, doing a magnificent job playing her part, and for me she was Priam's choice for the lead role. All in all, 10 out of 10. No. the negative side of this sweet human story. The children of all ages will be tired, and then happily watch this and this will bring the watching family together with a smile and good feelings.
