Silly, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. The group down and off the network is teaming up with the "experienced" thief to rise from poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the factor that has locked you up. It's nice to see George Clooneia doing something honestly funny to change. The cast is perfect and high standards of acting. Although it can be said that the theme of the colorful crew is not new, I think this film has been processed in an interesting and unique way. Enough, so that it stands out from what was before. Very well-dressed guys.
