This is one of my favorite favorites. It's so simple and sweet - definitely romantic comedy. I really like a movie full of good quotes and that's it ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein tells Edu Valters "Do you think about what I think," and Ed says "What are the chances for it!" According to my Thinking, the movie is fantastic if you can watch it over and over and get the same amount of enjoyment from it, and with this, you can !! I also enjoyed the way Valter M. showed Einstein. I think all the characters fit well and the story runs well. So many times I smiled at the movie and cited my favorite lines while I watch it! I would recommend this film to anyone who has a heart and enjoys romantic comedy now and then!
