I watched this movie many years ago and I searched for it since, in my opinion, although very raw, it is very educational about what the future can sustain, I enjoyed it in the film, and on this day I am very sorry for all those who disagree, but the film should always be evaluated by each of them, and in my opinion this was of great importance for all the cloning and testing of babies that are happening today and that we are judging this movie, this can be a dramatic event of what you become, but you go there. All the horrors of today have been brought up even when I smile, but this brings me to thinking, and it scares me like my mother, what if I'm desperate, after watching this movie, I'd think twice sad, but I like the movie do not watch the movie - just figure out the story And ask yourself how far away you will go for a child?
