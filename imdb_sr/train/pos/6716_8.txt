Late, an excellent filmmaker from the class Z, which is used in the exploitation of par al eclectance, Al Adamson is truly outdone with this magnificently terrible musical comedy comedy that is tastefully dull and deep deep celluloid nonsense and stupidity. In the gloomy totalitarian future of 2047, sex was considered an illegal act of impotent and restless stupid idiots of controllers (fun stupid Ervin Fuller). However, a cute unpleasant Cinderella (a blonde blonde sweet cake Catherine Erhardt) remains determined to change things for the better. With the help of her feminine Fairy Tale (Jai B. Larson), Cinderella attends a big gala ball with a specific plan of seduction of the handsome pastor Thomas Vaughn Armstrong (Vaughn Armstrong) and teaching everyone that the pursuit of love is a positive, pleasant and fully acceptable activity. Adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with its usual incompetence, setting incredibly incredible songs and dance sequences with a totally absent lack of skill and talent. A thrilled unlimited number of "We All Need Love" with people in absurd animal costumes who clumsily joke about the forest is a hilarious terrible miracle; Likewise, the equally disgusting routine "Mechnical Man" contains a bunch of awkward robots. The raw, static cinema of Louise Horvat, the sticky plastic miniatures, the pulsing disco disco score of Sparki Sugerman, an abundant free nudity (a brutal black hottie Sherri Coile guarantees special praise in this particular department), attempts to embarrass childhood Robot policeman irritant), and the equally terrible performances (Renee Harmon's disgusting picture of Cinderella's broken-down little cops, a great reward here) adds to the delightful abundant sweetness to enjoy this delicious horrible dossier u.
