As an adult in my mid-forties, I'm not even close to any of the key demos of Nancy Drew, but I was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon; So, I could say, there were a couple of sixty silver hair ladies downstream from me. An elderly man who left the theater in front of me especially praised the film for twenty female servers (who said that the movie looked at the previous evening and she liked it very much). It's more for the point, however: right in front of me, there were nine - counts, nine to ten years old girls were arranged next to each other, passing popcorn and hot dogs and sweets back and forth and I'll be reviewing. After the film began, they immediately calmed down to watch .... </ br>> .... and not only looked to the final loan. he started rolling. This is not a perfect movie; It does not pay off with subgroups in high school, it is not confident enough in its own tone, and its bullys are only hair that is sometimes too critical to unusual. However, the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the action is fairly well connected, and it skillfully stretches between the sins of excessive cheeriness and excessive modernization. And last but not least, Emma Roberts carries a movie with astonishing grace - no matter what the wonderful timing of Josh Fletcher, this is Roberts' movie, and she pulls it out nicely. Her Dens is a very direct ancestor of Veronica Mars Kristen Bell, and the film is also a linear descendant of the early and underrated Jodie Foster "Candleshoe". In today's market, it's rare: a family film that respects the intelligence of viewers. As such, there will not be everyone's taste - but for what it is, it's the best movie of its kind in the last few decades.
