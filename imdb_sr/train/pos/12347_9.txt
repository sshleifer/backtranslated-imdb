This is a wonderful film about the brothel in a fishing village, which can best be described with the scenic constellations and directions of the old Kurosavin works, combined with the subjects of human psychology Dostoevsky (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), Shakespeare's drama and Hans Christian Andersen. tragic and buccaneer. The scenario is marvelous, the scenes are colored - and some beautiful scenes really remain impressed in my mind. The action is interesting and unpredictable - each character is very well developed and interesting - there is also a small action, so if you do not like all the feelings, your expenses would come too -. It's not about mysterious geysers and proud samurai with their Bushid who pours out everything from them, but about the life, work and types of people who are everywhere at any time. A wonderful and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa, certainly worth seeing.
