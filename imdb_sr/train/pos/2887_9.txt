Cinderella is one of Disney's best movies, one of those movies that I think you value more elderly. Disney creates a magical adaptation of classic fairy tales. I think the film was the biggest of his films at the time of his release. The characters became more dimensional than the earlier films, creating more depth to appreciate more characters. Cinderella itself, in my opinion, is one of the greatest characters Disney has ever created. With her kindness and dry humor, she is extremely cute; however, it is an inspiration that makes her unforgettable. Like many people, she is an endless dreamer, and she keeps her dreams, she never gives up. Even in the most unfavorable situations, her dreams suffer, and she does not allow anyone to take it away. Her example should serve as an inspiration to everyone, and encouragement never to get rid of your dreams.
