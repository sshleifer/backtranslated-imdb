Released in December 1957, Saionar earned eight nominations for the Oscars and won 4 victories. Red Buttons won Oscars for Best Supporting Actor in his role as flying Joe Kelly, who falls in love with a Japanese woman while stationed in Kobe during the Korean War. Oscar nominated for the best actor, Marlon Brando starring Major Lloyd Gruwer, a Korean flying ancestor transferred to Japan, who firmly supports the army's opposition to marriages between US soldiers and Japanese women and attempts to speak with his friend Joe Kellie for free. The ironic Marlon Brandos character soon finds his love in a woman of Japanese descent. This film highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of that time. Filmed in beautiful color and with stunning backgrounds, I found that this movie is worth watching just for those effects. Good movie, more ... GimmeClassics
