A wonderful gentle comedic gem, up to the last five minutes, which degenerates into the British TV farce race. The last five minutes cost 2 points in my rating. Despite the great lack of action and style, it's worth watching the acting and unique Cornwall's setting. Many fine things to enjoy, such as the tremendous amount we all wait for the bank's approval after the official wiped out the credit card ... has become more brilliant when we're not - quite - sure the card is not the maximum.
