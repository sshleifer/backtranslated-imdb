Very recommended !! Well written, fun movie that will appeal to everyone there with a sense of humor !!!. Try it, it's good to see Independent British film more than holding it against big established studies !! It's definitely worth adding to any movie collection. There are scenes in this film that I am sure many people will be able to connect. You laugh out loud and enjoy great music. I especially enjoyed Orb's version of the Vietnamese Jimmy Cliff and The Tover of London. Go on ............ you will not be disappointed.
