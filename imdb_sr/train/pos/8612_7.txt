I totally disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. For example, the film is based on a book and if the writer had a gaius character in it, then "Hollivood" could only insert the symbol into the gay film. In addition, there were two gay characters, and I thought they were mutually reflective. One was normal and the other more feminine, but he was not at the top. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the power to watch the whole movie, they would see her character develop through a movie interacting with other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to see the car that Sara shot in the dump, you could see her mother's side, and later in the film you saw that she was unbeatable. But I guess if you're too worried about gai characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad. But if you are more open and I do not know, in fact, there is something about what is good then you will enjoy this movie.
