The man can not enjoy this gem, the invisible Rai from 1936. But I can not forget. The story is elegant. Karlof, strict and indignant at his Carpathian mountain shelter, is Janos Rukh, a genius that reads the ancient rays of light to determine events in the great geological past, especially the drop in the radioactive meteor in Africa. He joined himself with the elegant Lugosi (as a rare hero), who studies "astro-chemistry". Frensis Drake is a beautiful, under-exploited young woman; Frank Lavton, a romantic temptation; and the divine purple Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh, in a performance worthy of Mary Ospensky. The story is fast moving bold episodes, with special effects that are still handy. It also contains some beautiful lines. One Rukh restores his mother's eyes, asks: "Mother, do you see, see?" "Yes, I see it clearer than ever. And what I see is scaring me." Even better, when Rukh's mother says: "He violated the first law of science." I am not alone among my acquaintances who for many years confused exactly what this first law of science is. This film is definitely a desert island material.
