This film is a great mocumentary. Following is the rap group, NVH, composed of Ice Cold, Tasti Taste and Tone Def through their unique path to the climax of gangster rap, lovs and back to highs. Through troubles with women, egoes, policemen and whites, this group comes to the top of the gangster rape of the world, as this film goes to the top of the documentaries. I know that they are all favorite mummies This is Spinal Tap, for very good reasons, but I think that if it is in the right mood, this film is simply better. Laughter never ends, even for someone who is not in the tail culture. I am a white man, who has no interest in rap music, culture or anything else associated with him, but I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the script, the songs and acted in it, showed great potential and the damage is that I have not seen him since the fear of a black hat. However, I've seen it once more than you have, and that is, I recommend you to be afraid of a black hat for a quick laugh. Remember, "Do not shoot at you to see the white! .... their eyes!" Do not shoot them to see the white ones. FIM and enjoy the movie.
