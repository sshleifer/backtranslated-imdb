But vice versa, forgive bud, I fully understand how you can be drawn into a movie because you are connected with the topic (and you have). This movie is awesome, the main character would give each character to Charlie Brovn a collision for his money, he just murmurs constantly, which is always laughing, most of the scenes just feel awkward with the characters who often look at each other with a look. Now it's your line, then I will react. The best British comedy? Please, comrade, have a strong word with your bad suicide ... at the end of the day ... the sun sets ... and this film is horrible. I mean well done to the people involved ... they made a movie ... and maybe they are enthusiastic motorcycles in it, but people who still live here on earth with a real sense of humor will fight it more than they dared to have a Christmas present who bought them ... was that too big? Sorry ...
