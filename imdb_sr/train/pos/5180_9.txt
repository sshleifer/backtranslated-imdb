In a private camp in Plimouth, Massachusetts, which has existed since 1959. My grandparents were among his founders, my parents started work in 1965, and my two brothers are now there. This has nothing to do with the film, it takes me.) I spent the summer in Blueberri Hill from when I was five years old until the eighteenth, and this is people like me who this film is talking about: those for whom the group the camp in the forest was, as my fiancée says, "a good and happy place". If you have never experienced a lifestyle, you probably will lose the Indian Summer; do not disturb. It's not fast, there are no quick cuts, the pitches are not even blurred, there are no explosions, so dramatic tension as it's present is mild, there are no A-list actors, there's no quick fire not only to show how smart script writers (except, Maybe, the lines of killer Kimberly Villiams about how her fiancé should not "topple her toys." That's not the least degree of what this movie is about, the Godfather is slasher flick just because there's a lot on the screen. < br /> But the Indian Year is the godfathers polar opposite. If you have experienced Lifestyle, watch this movie. Read more, just do it. For me, this is a movie of 9/10.
