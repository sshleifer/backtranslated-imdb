Inspector "Dirty" Harri Callahan once again angers his superiors with his unconcerned approach to police work. Refusing to go on vacation, he gets a simple case that leads him out of San Francisco. However, he soon reveals the link between a recent murder in the city and murders outside the city, which lead him to the trail of a murderer of revenge. As an entry into franchise, Dirty Harry begins with several very promising moments, including the legendary "Go Forward, Make My Day" which Eastwood delivers beautifully through the pressed teeth before one manually spoils the robbery. It's very bad and what fans can expect from him. However, the film quickly changes its speed and focuses on the mysterious killer of revenge. The problem is that this killer is not as mysterious as she is characterized as Harry is. This really diminishes the presence of the protagonist who ruled all his previous film appearances, forgiving the previous game, Magnum Force. Methods and gives their character a dramatic depth that was not previously present, but fans who were looking for another bad Harry excursion will more than likely be somewhat disappointed. However, the tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you do not mind something a bit different, it's a good movie for fans. --- 7/10 Estimated R for violence and rape scene
