'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is no romance, at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. Lorettine family. Loreta (Sher) will marry Johnny Aiello. She does not like him, but she is a cute and good man. When she goes to visit her dying mother in Italy, Loretta meets Johnny's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny did not talk in five years, and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they immediately fall for each other. How this story and love stories about Lorraine's parents and uncle and aunt develop something that you must see yourself. Every sight is a pleasure to watch, while Cher is a great star in the middle of everything. She won and really earned an Oscar that year. The cage is pretty good and stupid, and Olimpia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are excellent. This film is funny, charming and therefore very pleasant.
