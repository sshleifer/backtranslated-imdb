An occasional surrealist thriller that will push the buttons of most people. The Fourth Man will surely offend anyone who loves politically correct ones. The main character of the story is a bisexual Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a seriously distorted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers up Gerard has an example of everything that's wrong with a modern man. He is careless, deceived, incapable of controlling his instincts, afraid to commit to meaningful relationships and completely apathetic in terms of life in general. As I figure at one point says, he is a professional liar, you can not remember the truth. The film opens with Gerard, dreaming of spiders who consume Christ, and then wakes up to start a long march until his walk. own destruction. He rejects one man (probably a boy) and then runs another at the train station. Later, at the lecture, he met a woman who seems to want to help him, or may have more evil plans. Quickly grabs Gerard into his net, lets him sex and money both. There are secrets, like three dead men. Is she lonely and sincerely seeking someone to nurture - or is she a deadly black widow who harms Gerard for his death? Will Garard be the fourth man he kills? The wife is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does everything in her power to guess what she wants. This is an interesting movie with lots of sex and intrigue. This is similar to Verhoeven's <basic> instinct </ em>, but it has much more depth and is certainly more shocking. There are many very gay gay contents, which can tell some viewers to turn around. It is recommended for lovers of intelligent psychological thrillers, or for those who are looking for something completely new.
