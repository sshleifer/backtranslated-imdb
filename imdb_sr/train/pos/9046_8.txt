I saw Jake Gillenhaal in Jarhead (2005) for the first time, and since then I have watched his every film that comes to my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has intensity (and even somewhat resembles Owen) that just ejects from the screen. I'm sure that if you get some fleshy roles, one day you will break the Oscars ... It does not obstruct this movie at all. A fine story, with very convincing people (well, it's based on the author's early flair with rocket techniques), a big cast? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list ?? with an appropriate mixture of humor, pathos, excitement ... and a great soundtrack with so many hundred rock n rolls in order to listen to the foot. : 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; Like him, I looked up at night stars to watch Sputnik as he crossed the blackness; like Homer, I experimented with rockets in my yard and used even the same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, and I've had most of my attempts to end up with an explosive disaster! What was fun ... <br /> <br /> Although I did not achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights. But that's what you'll find out when you see this movie. Of course, this is the basic family movie, but it seems to be a dying species today. Take the time to see it, with the kids: you'll all laugh a lot.
