A wonderful, free, often lyrical movie that whispers you, is always smiling, even if there are truly shocking incidents on the road. One of them takes in the way the women are treated, but nevertheless, it seems that they eventually went through very well, and it is the merit of all who are concerned that so many potentially catastrophic scenes work so well. This may be the best Depardieu performance, certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau performed extraordinarily in what was certainly a very difficult role, including strong sex scenes with a couple of guys at least a half of her age. Miou-Miou is beautiful and has a very difficult scene. At first it seems to be a bad and dirty misogyny, but as the story and characters reveal a much more gentle and sincere picture. In the end, this uncompromising and brave movie requires respect.
