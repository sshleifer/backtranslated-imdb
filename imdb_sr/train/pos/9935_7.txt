My name is Domino Harveri. {EDIT * HEAVY * CHOP} My - mine - my name is Domino Harvei. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {FIX UP. CUT. Reproduction} I've never seen a director who liked his style so far. So far, it's obvious that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's thrilling, eye-catching, dizzy montage technique. If I have to choose between loving him and hating him, I would say that I love her. It was sometimes disturbing, but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see the director with the creative hand of his style and some originality (even if he borrows a lot from MTV videos). This stylistic edge is manifested as Keira Knightley in the role of a tainted poor hunter on the head of the Domino Harveia, and even her dialogue seems strangely bustling. Otherwise she plays badly, because I mostly hated her character and I did not sympathize with her, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domina through her life as she joins fellow hunters on Mickey Rourke, Rizvan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew clung to the FBI and suddenly signed a realistic shove deal with the TV production company Christopher Valken (what Christopher Valken does in every movie, by the way?). I suppose it is a smart film technique, because now Toni Scott is free to use as many brilliant MTV / Realty Shov videos as he likes. At this moment it becomes a pastime of MTV culture. It follows that the story is told with incredibly fast pace, with a lot of rude language and armed violence violent. There are some funny jokes; Everything is both modern and over-the-top. It's a mess, but it's a pretty fun mess. In the end it is in many ways flawed (actors are trying too hard to make their characters "cool", but once). I give her a weak 7/10 which can look generous compared to the general consensus of those who watch the movie that rated this film? but I feel that he had some good ideas and he did them well. 7 of 10
