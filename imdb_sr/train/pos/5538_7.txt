Couple (Janet and Richard) go camping in the woods near the giant swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple took refuge in what they thought was an abandoned farmhouse. Soon, two escaped convicts appeared and, after a lot of delaying the inevitable, continued to rape Janet and lock Richard in a bird cage. one of the most horrified horror films ever recorded. It's one of the better and twisted shooters in the early 70's. Moreover, I found it to be quite enchanting and beautiful in its perverse tone. I love CAGED TERROR. Music definitely helps to give the film a sense of personality, as well as a lot of beauty. I thought the film was pretty nasty. Cracks are mainly related to pacing movies, which means that the film is rather slow and wrinkle. Although I did not mind pacing because of the beauty and uncertainty of the film in question, I think it will be most people. The acting is not too good or a dialogue, at least in the early stages. This film takes a little more patience than usual, and it's not for everyone. In short, this was a good movie. Not the biggest horror movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly fun. It's not the easiest movie ever. It is possible to find in the USED section of many stores if you look good enough. Not for everyone, but if you are a fan of the trash kin then it's definitely worth a look.
