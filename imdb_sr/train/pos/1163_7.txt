This film was released by Roger Corman, so you know that the filmmakers did not have much money to work. Although, some viewers can miss the subtlety of this film due to the very typical "obsessed" "kill" type of marketing approach, there are unique differences regarding this film. AMANDA, played by obviously talented Justine Priestlei, is a complex character. Some people love these movies precisely because violence can seem accidental, but here the consequences of abuse in the past (resolved in a realistic, but tasteful way) are what shapes the psychosis of AMANDA. Surprisingly, Amanda is eventually redeemed with an act of love, where most of these films turn into a typical, all struggle to death, and the evil character dies as the evil at the end, as at the beginning. Some rough edges in this image, but I have to give her 7 out of 10 stars based on his thoughts and that, originality compared to the usual - especially in the budget.
