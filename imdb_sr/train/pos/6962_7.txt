My Super Ek Girlfriend proved to be a pleasant surprise for me, I really expected a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? Was! But this film had so many great laughs and fun complications that everyone could get a blow. I know this was a very syrus film, but Uma and Anna were so cool and Steve was a great addition to the great role that seemed to have been so much fun and that's what the film really did. Jenny Johnson (terribly, that's the real name of my best friend) is not a typical average woman looking for a library, when Matt, your average male, asks if it's more than he expected. to a meeting, a super hero of the world! But when she finds out how jealous and crazy a girl really decides it's a good idea to spend some time apart, but Jenni will not have it because she fell to another girl, Hannah, and she will make his life a real hell, I mean, let's we face this, he could not choose a better girl with whom he would break. and they pretended that the story really worked and I loved Mind in this movie, it was such a step from Prime. My Super Ek Girlfriend is a fun movie that you should not take seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy that I think I could laugh from, anyone. 7/10
