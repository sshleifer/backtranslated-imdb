Through her dead body she was a fine little movie. It was fun and fun, while it was still pretty fun. There were a few clich√©s, but most of my things were fresh. First I did not think it would be good when it started out.If you can get past the first 20 minutes however, the film starts to become more interesting.This movie was not burst in laughs ridiculous, and it was not OH my GOSH lovely.It was just a movie who can not see how this movie was bad. The rating is a bit too low. I could deal with 5.5, but with 4.8? 1 is shameful. It was pretty good, and it was not terrible enough to be 1, which most people gave.
