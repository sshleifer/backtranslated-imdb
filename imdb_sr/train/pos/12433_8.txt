This is a good movie, although people who are not familiar with comics and books about modesty Blaise are a bit slower and insufficient in action. For the lover of modesty, the film will be very pleasant, especially because it is very faithful in presenting the "history" of modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell is listed in credits as "Creative Consultant", and filmmakers really paid attention to him because the action pretty well follows the details that have been featured in comics over the years (although the events are transformed into modern days). The only thing that a real fan can be disappointing is that there is no Villie Garvin in the story. This lack of Villie is merely a true chronology of the Modesty of Blaise since the film takes place in the early days of Modesty's career. Alekandra Staden makes a very convincing young Modesti that actually looks like Modesti. A welcome change from the Monica Vitti's Travesti portrayal of Modesty.
