From the writer "What has happened to baby Jane ever?" and "Hush .. Hush, Sveet Charlotte," this end of the sixtieth horror has some fun and fun. Micheal Macliammoir works with Victor Buono, but too often film totters are dangerous near a bad musical ... there is a particularly terrible children's recital halfway. Debbie celebrates, tangs and tricks for Harlow, while Vinters' religious fanatic has a lesbian edge to her. Agnes Moorehead appears as a evangelist. Veaver has nothing to do - and even has to pay a gigolo to play with Debbie.
