I found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way! I felt that the script had transferred all the things that I felt physically and emotionally when I came back from work and watched. This is a tribute to the movie in its highest form and format. Holy Guacamole! how would I like your days to come again? I tried to put a bubble window on my car side (honda civic 1984), but vacuum-formed cake cookies did not cut it completely. also in my civic, sexual positions are limited and not supported by a water bed as brilliantly displayed in the 'van'. 'Combi' is an extreme separation of joy and can even replace pornography if you are watching some scenes privately. I hope that Sam Grossman (Director) has achieved his opus.
