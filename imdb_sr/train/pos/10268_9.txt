This typical Mamet film provides a calm, balanced insight into what makes man's trust (Joe Mantegna) good. Investigated as a psychological study by a well-known psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), it slowly enters the world with commonly unpleasant consequences. The cast includes a number of players he has found, several Mamet's films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Vallace, Ricky Jai, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, Villiam H. Maci). In this film I liked Lindsay Crouse and I often wondered why she did not become a more noticeable player than she became. Maybe I'm not looking at the right places! The film runs at a slow pace, with flat dialogue, but nevertheless maintains the level of tension that logically leads to the end of the blow. I would expect a real downturn in the end, but I realized it was exciting and satisfying. I love this movie!
