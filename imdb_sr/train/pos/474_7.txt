Since I did not read Nabokov, and I do not know anything about chess, I could watch "Luzin's defense" as a movie. It works well as one of my favorite genres of "sport romance". The chess revives itself as a fierce competition much more than in, they say "In Search of Bobby Fischer", showing how difficult the mental work the game can be, requiring thinking, preparation, endurance and planning. I especially liked the special effects on the chessboard as alternative performances. Through feminist director Maureen Gorris (from "Antonia"), Emili Vatson with his big blue eyes gradually strengthens through his transformative relationship. John Turturro has a rather unidentified absent intelligent chess genius. The settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written on February 27, 2001)
