Several posters cited Renoir as expressing a desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling at the camera. The short answer is that we do not all, while the harsh reality is that only a handful of chosen ones did it. At this stage of his career Bergman could not be arrested; In 1949 she left Hollivood to make a picture in Europe, fell for director Robert Rossellini and never looked ahead. After five nights in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but during the year, after doing this for Renoir, she returned to where she belonged and with Oscar for Anastasia. This is one of the three films that Renoir painted at this time and in the end is better than the Golden Coach, which is not difficult, and even with the French Can Can. Renoir probably understood that Bergman would be able to get out with so many hard-core men, and Renoir chose two doozies in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, a solid mahogany in both cases. The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history, but Renoir is pleased to transfer it once too strongly and concentrate on replicating his father's pictures in post-setup. In pastel colors, she recalls a second film from the Les Grandes Manouvres, which is not a bad thing. All in all, there is a pleasant little thing that shows a beautiful and charismatic actress.
