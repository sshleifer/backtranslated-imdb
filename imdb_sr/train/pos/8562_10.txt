I loved it! The plot was weird, Drew Barrimore and DC were uncomfortable for both of them. The Drew's acting was strange in places, but it could have been all the way to her life at the time. Dennis Christopher as a psychiatrist was pretty cool, and as he always does his best - I'm a big fan of Dennis anyway, so I bought a DVD. I have not finished! this strange thing of the animatronic red skeleton looked just like it was outside the film school, which is fine, but I suppose it could have been more. ... and the whole thing with a knife - if it was so embarrassing why they simply did not get rid of it? It was very confusing when it was weird for Doppelganger or when it was DC - or was Denis all the time? Because Doppelganger agreed with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenes with Patrick whether it was Dennis like Doppelganger, I think Patrick would notice. The music was fine, but intrusive in places, the entire orchestral party seemed to be about to revolve around the topic, but this topic was exaggerated. Great blend of lots of blood and free photos of the trees offer. All in all a little GPM-Guilti Pleasure Movie. Do not read too much in it, do not look for secret messages and a fantastic script, because you will not find it. There are some diamond moments and abundant jokes.
