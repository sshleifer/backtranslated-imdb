A beautiful little thriller opens with Trevor Howard in his Jag cabriolet and ends up at the docks in Liverpool. That's all excitement and spill, because the former spy has to start a career just as he got serious butterfly catalogs (how is the British?). Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons are playing from London to Nevcastle-upon-Tine in Liverpool (via Ullsvater) - just been thrown out of MI5 or something like that, and she, you assume, is on the run, is wrongly charged with murder. There are stupid docks, rolling lake ponds, sheep, village pubs, lost cops, waterfalls, a bunch of amateur bikers, hunt for rooftops, and many Chinese (do not ask), and all of it is very Hitchcock and Hannaieskue ... And the incredible example of the British Noir ...
