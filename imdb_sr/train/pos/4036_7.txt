I saw a release in the early '70s, was lucky enough to capture it through the preservation of the American cinema, and there are still some tangible moments that have remained with me thirty years. No reason to repeat rvint correct comments here. As an incoming director soon after the tremendous success of Five Lightweight Parts, for Dzh. . But it's also an unforgettable icon for the time: all the very intense conflicts of the late 60s college sports, student movements, sexual revolution and much more. Why watch this movie? It was probably a switch in some scenes: short-term male bonding in showers after a match; The scenes Karen Black with Teper in the car will catch you a little reluctantly - but this is the first use of a word I did not see in the movie before; and relaxed and unexpected use of the nostalgia as a whole. Probably others missed. Look for a nice surprise young Cindi Villiams in one of her first films; Slim David Ogend Stiers; Mike Varren freshly emerged from his powder-blue UCLA uniform and prepared himself for a dark blue TV uniform; Robert Tovne - actor; and a lot of people who simply play alone. Now: Any relationship between the surnames Harry Git, Robert Tuna and a certain character in the Chinese district and Two Jake? He gets "7" based on Karen Black. You'll see why.
