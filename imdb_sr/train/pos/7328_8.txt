I loved this movie a lot. I rent this out by expecting something not bad to spend the evening. It turned out to be a particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were hilarious and they managed to be so in a movie that did not intend to be just stupid comedy, but with some sense and moral values. I've never seen any of these actors, but they were cute and made me worry about what's happening to them in the end that talked a lot. . I do not think you'll be disappointed to watch this.
