I was a little afraid to watch this film because of his footsteps. But life in Italy, like this one, never encounters and I love so much that I decided to try. And how surprised I was! The story differs from any other dance film I have seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just a "victory." It's touching and well written and well-directed. Raja is so strong, I adore the fact that she has never doubted her, she is so mature and focused and aware of her TALENT (and what is the talent of Rutina Veslea, my jaw fell on the final dance scene). The way she spends her dream and refuses to stop her is, honestly, inspiring. Also, the fact that it is not a typical super hot fish (see Jessica Alba, Brian Evigan, Jenna Devan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes it really appealing and real. Seriously, why is this film rated so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that this is a good job. Really good. I even cried at the end of the film. And dance routines are just sick.
