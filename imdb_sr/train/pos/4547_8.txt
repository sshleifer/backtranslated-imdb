That could be 10 if there was no predictable and Hollywood scenario. Daniel Dai-Levis confirms his position as one of the leading actors of our time (why I can not ask the leading actors), and the rest of the actors stand at a very high level. Personally, I was impressed by Hugh O'Connor who played Christie Brovn as a child. The first scene I was watching was very strong. Vov.
