Villiam Hurt may not be an American Matinean idol anymore, but he still has a pretty good taste in B-film projects. Here, he plays a specialist for cleaning hazardous waste with a tragic past looking for a long-term loser in the game - played by former beauty Veller - who was polluted by a deadly poison. The current admirer Hardi Kruger Jr - probably more handsome than his father - is portrayed as Veller's arrogant boss in a terrible sequence at the chemical-producing factory that launches the story. Natasha McElhone is a somewhat shy government agent who looks at an incident that provides an inevitable and high interest in the hero Hurt. Michael Brendon appeared to play a slick-type prisoner who can not wait for compensation. Coca-Cola received the Product Placement Award for 2000, while a soft drink was presented during production, with love captured at the location in the winter postcard Hungary.
