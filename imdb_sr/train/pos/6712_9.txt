I love Sabrina! One of my favorite shows !! My favorite episodes are; the one in which Libby turns into a geek, the first episode, a real love episode and most of the rest of the first series. I think faculty episodes were not as good as those in high school, but they were better than the last series that was terrible. Valerie had a good character because she was rounded by Jenni, but Jenni was in some great episodes. Hilda and Zelda were incredible, and there seemed to be no explanation of where they left! Libi also had a good character. I never liked Morgan or Rocky, they were not as good as her other friends.
