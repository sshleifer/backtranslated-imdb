This movie was a great concept. She was original, smartly written and very attractive to those who are not really 'conformists'. Do not misunderstand me - there are some great movies that have wide appeal, but when you go to watch a movie based on "everyone else watches him" - you know that you are either dead or you do not really have an opinion. This had a wonderful subtle humor - despite the fact that most people probably only look at it obviously. The actors displayed their characters with apromobes and I thought that there was a lot more "personal" personality in this film. Appeals to children, as well as adults. Esp. it's nice to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual references and insinuations! A great movie, which should not be overlooked on the basis of public spending. This must buy.
