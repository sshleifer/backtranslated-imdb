This is a very well-made movie, carefully directed and with a great character that sometimes moves deep - for example, a scene with a loyal but unfaithful cop and his wife. The action is convincingly elaborate and exciting. The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero. It is clear that the cops are as rough and ready as the characters from the underworld. Several smaller reserves: I found an endless one because it celebrates the successful integration of the hero into the structure of the police and justice system, which is destroying the ambiguity of the police signs that were held up to that moment. I also found a leading female figure somewhat weak: a bit more than a catalyst for saving heroes, all that makes her cry and fainting as the powerful guys fight.
