I loved this film for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful about it. He plays the role of a modern balloon wizard. (And it's absolutely wonderful.) 2) The film helped inspire playing the role I fully enjoy, Mage: The Avakening. I showed it on various LARP sites, and it's always a big hit. D & D love and Jeff-skueeing on the side, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well made and completely comfortable. The action moves quickly and deals with its simplicity, special effects are pretty good for such a low budget, and the scenario, while nothing was great, was not too bad, and cheesy in all the right places. A good way to spend the evening.
