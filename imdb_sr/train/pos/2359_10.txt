I think if you ask most of the JVs whether they are expecting a miraculous cure because of their faith, you will find that they do not. I know I do not know. What you will find instead is that they believe in the promises Christ gave on the resurrection. So, even if the worst happens, and we die as we stick to our integrity, Jehovah can and will correct that. Is this all you believe? If he is real, and you trust him, you will follow his instructions regardless of the short-term outcome. I had a heart attack a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in capital letters over my ticket. I thought with her that if I were in a position that only blood transfusions would save my life, would it be a good moment for anger that could only bring me back to life when the time came? He did not realize - God is not enough for her. A pity. I wish there could be a comfort that gives strong faith.
