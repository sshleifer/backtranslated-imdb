I can only repeat the praise of other reviews here. It is a beautiful film with a good factor that is achieved without crossing the border into a lavish sentimentality. Of course sweet - no added sugar. One small thing: it seems to me that mild objections about Ustinov's character Pendleton who is able to enter and overcome systemic security ignore the fact that Pendleton is obviously a genius / savant in these things. Yes, the film was pretty computer-illiterate, but he showed that Pendleton 'is studying computers' in his apartment, and I believe that the implication was that his gifts enabled him to simply swallow the whole topic, practically overnight. There were a few strange moments when in some scenes Gnatpole appeared who was trying to test Pendleton's knowledge and called it a bluff. I'm not sure if we should have believed that Pendleton craftily rejected the way out of these situations, or was actually educated enough to pass the tests - it was a little unclear. Surely he had to know enough to set up false accounts. I assume that Vallach and Ustinov relied on their rather foggy notions about how computers worked at the time, and to understand in detail what they came up, it is necessary to know what their concept was. They knew there was something about the "procedures" that mattered; they thought that a 'smart light' could actually control security, not just indicating its state; they thought that the (stupid) user terminal characteristics would have a powerful impact on what can be done on the mainframe itself - although I do not see it except for things like graphics. Basically, I think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as they could, and they did it pretty well. By allowing them a little art license, I do not think that their efforts had some defective remarks. CD
