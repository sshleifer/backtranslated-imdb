This one grew on me. I love music R. Burman and in spite of the tougher elements of the story, I found a lot of things that I could run as I watched the movie again. The brother-sister line is powerful, I thought; There are probably compulsory things, such as battleships, crazy criminal stories, etc. which only disturb. (Although it is not clumsy from a certain point of view.) Also, the English translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit, and as crazy as it is, I am grateful to him for doing it. Like many of Bollivood's films I've seen, this is melodramatic and operatic, including in particular a song singed by a young boy first to cheer up his abused and unfortunate sister, and then the same song sang. or so years later, the man who traveled to Kathmandu, seeking to reconnect with that girl, grew up and upset (told her her brother and mother were dead), stunning her pain for drugs. The great thing about this 1971 movie is that it is a hippie movement that brought hordes of a seeker to India from an Indian point of view who sees them as people driven into India from a spiritual hunger caused by disadvantages to their own societies, but nevertheless, in India , living only for the pleasures of the moment. Hippie singing-drugstores are really wonderful and accurate in their tone (I'm old enough to remember), and I feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zon children are real hippie addicts, as I recall listening to children on a caravan in the east, getting this is a job in Bolivia. (This is not a real Hare Krishna movement, even though the movie hippies sing Krishna / Rama popev, as well as a group of real Indian devotees who are not related to hippies at the introductory scene of the film.
