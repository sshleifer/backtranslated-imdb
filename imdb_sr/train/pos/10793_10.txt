There are several spoilers in this comment! In contrast to the comments I just read nativet4 and several others, I really liked the movie and I would like to see it as a weekly series. /> I am a fan of Judson Mills, but also a great fan of Chuck Norris and while I admit that several action scenes may have slightly expanded the line, the story fitted with other weekly series. The opening of fifteen minutes with Deke who ran from bad guys after firing their missiles was very active. I do not see how many "professionals" were unable to hit the moving target, but the action was definitely there and Deca, as a hero, had to survive. As for the comments on "need a movie in the office to fill the time after the playoffs". This film was not originally scheduled by CBS for January recording, and the recording was completed in May 2001, just four months before the terrorist attacks on the United States. If the commentator paid attention to the film, instead of trying to avoid it, they might understand the plot's story: Rashid, the figure of Bin Laden, who planned to launch a nuclear device in the United States. The president's man is called to locate and fix the problem. Perhaps the writer should watch the movie before attempting to comment on it. <br /> <br />
