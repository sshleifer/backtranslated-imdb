I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic cartoon "Casper the Friendli Ghost". I thought it was too early since Casper did not look good, in the same way Porki Pig does not look good in old cartoons from the 1930s. But I digress ... In any case, this episode in the grave life of a friendly phantom refers to a friendship with a young fox called Ferdi. I remember being happy to see Casper having a friend, because those who watched caricatures know that most people run away from him, shouting "The Spirit!" Casper and Ferdie are having fun until someone else appears ... I hate to leave you with a half spoiler, but the cartoon takes only seven minutes, so you can not be too ambiguous. In addition, anyone reading the IMDb synopsis of a cartoon film can conclude what is going on ... The finale is a little heartbreaking. In fact, it's probably the saddest thing I've ever felt by watching a cartoon. But that just means it started me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on this cartoon and not many others. Or, the fact that I actually remember these cartoons is due to her emotional effect on me - since then I have not seen her. But the cartoon ends with an optimistic note, and I was glad to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. I would give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. Second, only on the cartoon Varner Bros. "Peace on Earth", this is the most I've ever started an animated short film.
