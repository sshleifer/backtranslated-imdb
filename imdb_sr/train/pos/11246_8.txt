Breaking Glass is a movie that everyone who wants to be in the music industry is seeing many times. It's a very dark story about how the publishing house manipulates the singer to do things in his own way and to get as much money out of him. Looking at some of today's 'old-fashioned' search, TV shows in the UK and abroad are always reminiscent of this film. Although they are not experts for this topic, the winners of these shows tend to have a very big initial hit, and then descend from there. This film precedes these shows, although the effect looks the same. After getting rid of her manager, who Phil Daniels played pretty brilliant, the publishing house slowly but surely changed the texts and placed it on stimulus and finally it was completely burned down. You potential stars of tomorrow.
