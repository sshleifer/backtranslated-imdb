Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a raw sci-fi TV series. There are no facts to escape. How much are you trying to apologize or explain to Stargate SG-1 is still a cheaper sci-fi TV series. Stargate SG-1 borrows and quickly steals ideas. Special FKS are not nearly as impressive as they could be and the action will not let you out of the chair. Or couch for that thing. But, and this is where I really think the SG-1 Star Gate deserves all the credit they can get, for every episode or stolen idea that I think you can count on at least one sirast-sci-fi a movie that actually burns one hour of television episode. In fact, some episodes could actually last 90 minutes and they are still better than most movies. And being able to keep this quality throughout the show and continue to deliver and push the story further is what Stargate SG-1 makes special. I am very picky with my choice. Perhaps I am following perhaps one or two TV series and I hold quite high standards which made me even more surprised when I found myself caught. So, for those who still decide to clean the Stargate SG-1 another flies sci-fi broadcast, do not. Hold on to it and see what I'm talking about.
