Another quiet love triangle from Hitchcock, not a mystery, but very English, very well-timed and photographed. Smooth boxer Bob Corbi (Ian Hunter) recruited Circus boxer One Circle Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be his sparring partner, partly to keep the beautiful, but rolling Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby. At the wedding of Jack and Mabel there are many art actors and grotesques, and the thunderbolt, which stands in the passage of the church, records a shock when he sees very high and very short men, a thick lady, united twins who, of course, discuss which side passes to sit The wedding feast is fun. The rest of the movie is that Jack loses Mabel and boxing his way back to his heart, or something like that. It was another era, with the crowd in the evening dress, and boxers who were dressed, too, when they came out of the ring. Camera angles, tempo, symbol use, cutting is all very stylish and crafty. Working with cameras and editing the last box are very attractive. The good looks of Brisons are well used in this; his smile is not so unconcerned about what is happening around him, as he is in Hitchcock Manxman, and it's not unpleasant. But can boxers have such holes?
