Wow! So much fun! Probably a bit more for normal American children, and it's really hard to call it a movie for kids, this movie reminded me of Bandit's time - very Terri Gilliam to the end. While the entire narration is fairly straightforward, Miike continues to throw lots of surreal and Bunuel-esquire moments in LOT. The whole first act violently opposes itself from the scene to the scene of the normal family life of the main kid / hero, with the spiritual world and the evil that has arisen in it. And while the ending has a little ambiguous aspect that is common to Miike's work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, especially the anti-war / anti-human message of human stupidity, is quite damn touching. As a manic and imaginatively funny, like other great Miike movies, only instead of top-tricks and bloody, it gives us an infinite amount of monsters and iokai from a Japanese folklore show creatively imagined through CG and puppetry wrapped in a imaginative multifaceted adventure. F'n work, and one of Miike's best!
