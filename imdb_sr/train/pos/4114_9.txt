The title of this movie does not make much sense until you see it in the operation, because it is the sound a retarded young man makes while managing his imaginary wheelchairs, which is what works all day. And he is just one of many unusual characters in this surreal and casual, tragic story about a group of people in poorer settlements in Japan. Be an architect, and his young son sending him to pray for food. There is a wise old man who looks like a pillar of common sense in everything that is happening around him, and there is also a businessman with a heavy nervous tick who has a woman who treats him (and all others) as dirt. There is no specific conspiracy for this, in fact, it's a bunch of stories that are returning to one another, sometimes ridiculous, sometimes tragic. All in all, I thought it worked well, and I was dying to see it for a long time only based on its description. I'm not even the least disappointed, and I would certainly recommend this. 9 of 10
