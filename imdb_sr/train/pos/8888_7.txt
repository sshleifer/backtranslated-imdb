This film started slowly, and then it got a swing towards the middle. However, the fact that the movie had crossed over two nights broke this momentum at its peak. The second part really became interesting, but then he gave way to a simply pathetic ending. Playing football in the yard? Really, could it be still sweet and more silly? Now I hear plans for a similar film based on the '70s. I will not make big efforts to agree with this if it's something like "The 60s".
