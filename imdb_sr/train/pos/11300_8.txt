Ossessione Debutant film Luchina Visconti, this Italian noir generally deserves to launch a Neo-Reality movement - well, it says on the back of the box - and sometimes it is a prodigious, sometimes defiant portrait of lonely individuals in a moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, a range of supporting characters - including an imaginary luther that supports Communism's virtues - embodies the country's distant despair in search of its identity from the outside, the floating fantasy that longs for the soul. Although Visconti's compassion for disenfranchised people and his ability to express his sad conditions, but well developed, the spider's network of deception is weak-although noir wearing to put the protagonist manipulated by fate and femme fatale, so you begin to fear that he deserves it - cosmic irony is too didactic, an unlawful connection is strained by a bath. Nevertheless, it is sharp and important, although its real impact on film history is certainly controversial.
