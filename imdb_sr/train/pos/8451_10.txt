How I got into this: When I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I must say that I never saw anything similar and that it was the best. But when I started collecting a series on VHS, and years later on a DVD, part of Bandai's Anime Legends collection. It was incredible, and really worth watching. He had a lot of explosive actions that would blow you out of your seat. And of course, the songs of the theme "Just Communication", and Rhithm Emotions were the best. Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters in the show were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Ladi Und, Noin, and Zechs My favorite Gundams in the show I liked most is Ving Zero, and Epion, and of course Altron, and Deathscithe I, and II. They show: What this series tells us is that in real life wars are very difficult and sometimes we can win or lose, but peace is also hard to get, and I believe Gundam pilots are doing the right thing and trying to get peace in the world. But, however, this show is really the best of the best, so at the end of this review, after you look at this show, watch the movie Endless Valtz.
