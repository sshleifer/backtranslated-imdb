I saw this film when I was about eight years old and I liked it, but it was not until I was looking at it at the age of 13, that I really understood it for what it was; a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real golden heart "adopts" a little girl to use for her talents to talk to animals. Star Dogs, Charlie B. Barkin, was killed by his formal business partner, Carface (which is absolutely devilish). His soul then goes to where there is the only other than Heaven just to find the golden watch that is truly his life time, which Charlie was bruised, but sympathetic when he stole and rewind, and sent him back to Earth. When he returns to Earth, Charlie goes for a vengeance on the evil Carface. So comes to the young Anne-Marie, a lonely little orphan who can talk to animals that Charlie plans to deceive for his talents to return to his hostile Carface. But Nicole Charlie is actually coming to care about young Anne-Marie and his plans, because he has to decide to do what is right after Anne-Marie finds out what her "best friend" is really using to earn money for the new and Better cube belt. Now he has to save himself from the scary Carface. I still love this film, even at age 22. The idea and the action are completely different and original than those in many other animated films. I especially like the idea that a dog once plays the role of a villain. Carface was even better than he was in All Dogs going to the continuation of Heaven. In this picture, he looked rather suspicious of his role as a villain.
