What if Marilin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy gathered in the evening relativity? vows and sharply reveal not only to individuals who had to be, but also to what they represented over time. If you are confused by allegory, or if you love your movies that are served with preheated and mushy, this movie will not appeal to you. It is a demanding opus that at many levels rewards viewers with intelligence to value it. At this point, when strictly avoiding the use of the real names of characters, we see that Einstein is ready to hold a pacifist speech at the United Nations for nuclear bombs visited by Marilyn Monroe, after recording the infamous scene Seven years of itching , some say she led her to the end of her marriage with Joe Dimaggi. They have a wonderful interaction in which Einstein stumbles with an appropriate professor's clumsiness about the innocence of perhaps the greatest sexual symbol of the modern age. Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is Red. He is determined to draw Einstein's guarantee that he will support the activities of the UN Committee on Homes while delivering ultimate weapons in the name of peace. Add Joe, a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person who may not be perfectly acted as Garry Busei, who hates Marilyn's exhibitionism and believes that Einstein became her lover, even though Marilyn just wants to show Einstein to understand the Special Theory of Relativity. But there are more. Just like each of us, these characters have their deepest fears, which they discover one by one in haunted flashbacks. These weaknesses, in the end, give humanity figures that we can not but see almost exclusively today. Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision, and the film's statement becomes clear. It's a powerful and memorable moment. The negligence is one of the five best movies of all time. It's extremely incredible.
