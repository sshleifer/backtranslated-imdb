"Dick Tracy" is one of the favorites of our family - the actors are great - the art direction is remarkable - the music is magical. It should not be "to kill a bird crook" - it's a fun experience. Stephen Sondheim's songs are incredible: "The Return to Business" is energetic, "Sooner or later" is just fine "What You Can Lose" is stagnating - even ringtones like "Live Alone and Like It" "add a story I have to love the gigantic over-the-top performances by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Middleton, Charlie Korsmo, Mandi Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dike, supporting the criminals ... The list is too long. And, yes - even Madonna and Varren Beatty are great. Written with a smile on the minute (how many times we looked and said, "Wait a minute - I think it's gone!"). However, one of the most important things in this movie is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time - and this mostly contributes to the enjoyment of spectators. So, if you have not already done so, why not give "Duck Tracy" a chance - accept it for what is - the weekly comic is revived - and in a wonderful way !!
