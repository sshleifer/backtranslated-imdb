Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the chambre genre. Successful, not in different degrees. The Buddhist monk has a vision to kill the legendary (and very active) demon on the Goyoe Bridge to achieve enlightenment. Although not in the foreground, Buddhist thought is at the heart of this film, just like Kurosavin "Ran". Probably it's what made me the most interesting film even though it is now near the "Ranove" league. Modern visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie most interesting for two hours and eighteen minutes. The main actors are as excellent. Music is really good. Two weaknesses are also the story of the fighting scenes. The film is pulled in the middle, which could have been repaired by some prudent editing. And the scene of the fight is mostly recorded in murky, large-scale plans. This works for most movies, but the finale feels like a cheat. Another newer film, such as "Seven Swords" Tsui Harka, an excellent movie, but the promised battle scenes are disappointing. Asano does not really move like a demon who acts like a sword, his acting is great, but would be an addition to the traditional battle scene in Chambara. Do not expect traditional sword fighting.
