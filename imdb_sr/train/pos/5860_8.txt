An enjoyable game that offers fun and easy play and the ability of fair repetition. Staying true to the comic and offering a low learning curve gives this game something that is not seen today in most of the action cartridges. Also, narrations used and animated scenes (although long animations replaced by slides on the Nintendo 64 version) use all platform capabilities.
