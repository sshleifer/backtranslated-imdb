... so what's in those missing ten minutes that were so horrible that they had to cut them out of the original movie? We were three years old in the film production code ... Barbara Stanvick acted in the original show, but here, Carole Lombard starring Maggie King. The star of cooperation Fred MacMurrai is probably best known for "Double Indemnity", with Stanvick, as well as with his hit TV show "Mi Three Sons". Look out for the young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope films) and the beautiful Franklin Pangborne, who spiced almost every movie on the tape. Of course he works in a cosmetic salon on board! Add sublime Charles Buttervorth and Anthony Kuinn. A good timing and clever joke at the beginning. Maggie's friend Ella is playing Jean Dicon, who was the best friend of Holidai and Mi Man Godfrey. In "Swing High", Maggie tourist meets a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie missed her boat when she left the port and clashed with a soldier. Kuinn has a 20th event with a small scene at a local bar in Panama where Johnson (MacMurrai) played a trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Buttervorth), and Skid Band together and trying to figure out how to return to the United States. Good singing from Lamour. Good (but short) acting performance by Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", a wise, beneficial owner of a local salon in Panama. While others complained about how bad it was, it was not so terrible, and even a little exotic, with false settings for Central America for the first half of the film.
