Another hit from Norman Lear, which describes the problems that Afro-Americans had to undergo in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. With Esther Rolle and husband along with three children living in a Chicago-based high school project in a predominantly black color in the neighborhood, the show shows what the blacks passed with the owner (black agent, Mr. Bookman), as well as the prices and everyday problems of the only existing. 3 children showed how people seem to face their problems in a different way - from comedic JJ to militant Ralph Carter, to their daughter who also sought to achieve success, this show was a perfect description of Afro-American life.
