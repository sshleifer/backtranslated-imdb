The world is a terrible city. But this film is a farce and it's fun. And if you do not like ... you do not get it ... and if you do not get it ... it does not matter. It's up to you to play. Every actor in this party was having fun. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Birne is invaluable. Birne and Paul Anka work MI VAI, as Vic says, "... the best version ever." Okay ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. They warned me not to see him, but I'm sure I'm glad ...
