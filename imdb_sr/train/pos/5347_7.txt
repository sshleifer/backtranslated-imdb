Another Spanish film about the Civil War in 1936. This time, we have been told a story about Carol (a wonderful game by debutante Clara Lago), a girl who comes to live in a little Spanish village from Nev Iork. It is such an initiating journey, and soon it will learn about the injustices of the human race, their stupid struggles and conflicts, their contradictions. 1994) with such a sober pulse, beautiful photography and a beautiful scenario. He is trying to not participate in the conflict, he only shows us some facts and decides (OK, the facts are clear enough to decide who we are in the band) and he has a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of young actors: Clara Lago and Juan Jose Ballesta. Well-processed production. My price: 7/10
