I enjoyed this movie. It was funny, sweet, funny and fun. I had a great role, and indeed some critics have pointed me out for reasons I really do not understand. No, it was not a "Grape Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even a "Moonlight", but it was a nice movie. The story is a little silly to be sure, but it's not a big drama, folks. I accidentally saw a review of the film, probably the only good I got, and then I ran into one night when I was looking for a movie. I never heard that it should stink until I see it, and I'm glad to see it. In the end, he bought a VHS tape for purchase, and I watch it several times a year.
