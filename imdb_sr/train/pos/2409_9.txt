This film has problems in its presentation, it can even be offensive to people who seek temporal and cultural fidelity, but it causes the viewer to think about different issues. One of them is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. The second is the historical nature of the Bible and religion. And third, Jesus' humanity. The tension of the relationship of the Christ-traitor is developed and maintained through the film. Judas' passion is portrayed as a darker parallel with Christ. When Judas takes his life, the viewer can feel anxiety. Peter's denial and guilt, however much they moved, are not so strongly portrayed as the Jude drama. Chris Sarandon offers a novel and provocative Christ, whether it is convincing or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even in VHS, to use it in studio or discussion groups.
