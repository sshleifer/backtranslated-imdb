Shall Ve Dance is a great movie because it shows how something, like dancing, can rejuvenate the flow of life in the human spirit. This is certainly the case with Aoki. At work she is a modest clerk, but puts him on a dance floor and all of her intensified intensity is released. Surprisingly, this edition is indeterminate in Japan due to a rigid culture of conformity. At the beginning of the film, all the characters are ashamed or afraid of their desire for dance. They will be ignored or considered perverted for expressing their passion through dance. This film is worth watching to be a witness to the re-birth of human emotions and passions. You will leave a smile on your face for days.
