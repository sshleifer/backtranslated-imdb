New York, I Love Iou is the collective work of eleven short films, each segment takes about 10 minutes. Shorts do not coincide, but they all have something in common, love. Every short story is about finding love, whether it's a couple or just two foreigners who are reading. The cast includes the ensemble including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Haiden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Vright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Havke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Ielchin. With such a great acting and such an interesting premise, I expected an enormous film; The problem is in New York I love you does not add up. The sum of his parts remains. Some of the segments are funny, original and interesting, but others are so meaningless (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Havke / Maggie K segments) that this is terrible. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. The story, it seems like something some students could put together. Saying this, the film also has some great moments, one of the best is the old couple, played by Eli Valjak and Chloris Litchman, going to Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. And these moments, which made me look at the viewer, want the film to be more consistent, because there is a lot of potential here. But, as unsatisfactory, as the whole story ended, for me, cinema and soundtrack all saved. The editing was perfect, the way the film was filmed was very impressive and ethereal music can not be more appropriate. In the end, Nev Iork I Love Iou feels like an experimental film, and as in most experiences there are climbs and falls. This is how a movie is viewed in its entirety, which will determine whether it is enjoying it or not. It might be useful for some and wasting time for others. 7/10
