In Mexico City, a former CIA killer and current alcoholic decadent man John Cruz (Denzel Washington) was hired by industrialists Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthoni), on the recommendation of his old friend, Christopher Valken, to be the bodyguard for his young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the behavior of Cold Creasy, making it alive and funny, and feels great love for her. When the girl was abducted and Creasy was informed that she was killed by criminals, he was kneeling to kill anyone responsible for the kidnapping. "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece, and will surely become a classic in the future. The story is excellent, it's never run out and even though it's 146 minutes, the viewer does not feel the time passes. Actors are made up of great actors and actresses, their performances are remarkable, pointing out Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. Cinema has wonderful moments, and the script has stunning lines. I personally liked the character of Christopher Valken explain Manzan (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasei's specialty is death, and he is preparing his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best film of the year in this genre. My voice is ten.
