Anyone who has lived through the years of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpover will appreciate this film. It's one of those films that deliver everything you want in the "spring break" of PLUS, which mocks the film's genre in college. It's funny for the actors to die (Ami Pohler, Rachel Dratch, Sophie Monk, Parker Posei, Jane Linch, Amber Tamblin, Rachel Dratch, Rachel Dratch, comic genius, and Sophie Monk is such a great loser. (Just now I repeat ...) It will continue with the girls who love Miranda Juli, but they feel like they are eating ice cream and pretend they are stupid.
