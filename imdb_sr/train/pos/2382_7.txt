For a long time, 'Menagerie' was my favorite episode of 'Star Trek', although it has been suppressed in recent years by 'Citi on the Edge of Forever'. What I liked about Menagerie was Star Trek with this fascinating background story compared to the then Trek story. I still think it's a pretty ingenious way for Gene Roddenberge to include the original pilot in a two-part episode. Although the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea that Spock is a military court is smart. If you want, you can break through the holes in the plot. For example, given the talosian ability to control the mind and Captain Pike's condition, why is it necessary to physically bring Pike to their planet? There are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... it's best not to think too much about the details and just enjoy ST in just two partners.
