Now this show seems like most other shows of this type since the mid-1990s, but the only thing about this is different, they use a lot of comedy and action in this and maybe a little drama too. Personally I thought it was a good show, I do not understand why it would be canceled. The good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive from 1997 to the present. I hope that SB will return the show or even make a movie, which I know will be impossible to do, but hey does not hurt to dream, right? Anyway, I would recommend that you have not seen him find a DVD of all 13 episodes, because the characters are great, the stories are good, the comedy is good and the whole performance is great.
