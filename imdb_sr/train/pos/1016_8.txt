I would give this otherwise great series of full 10 votes if Claudia Black did not continue in that! Her inclusion as a foolish 'Vela' brought the series to my estimation. It was introduced as regular at the same time as Ben Brovder replacing RDA was a mistake. Unfortunately, we just withdrew from the loss of 'Jack' and really did not need such a big series turned into new episodes of 'Farscape'. I was a big fan of the "Stargate," and when the series was first released, I had the reserves to be able to live up to the film, but watching the first episode I must admit, I was hooked. I always enjoyed new episodes with great expectations
