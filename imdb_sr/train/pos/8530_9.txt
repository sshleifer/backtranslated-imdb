I'm not sure why he does not play in Peoria, obviously, but this is a very fun, smart British comedy. It was installed at the end of the 'sixties. Peter Sellars is fantastic as a rich, forty-something serial female. The perfect sweet Goldie Havn, who plays the 19-year-old American girl in London, is at the beginning of Sellars's "catch of the day". But an urban TV critic can not be prevented from falling into a dizzying American blonde. > It's a great movie, and the best gag is the last line. Try it, you will love it.
