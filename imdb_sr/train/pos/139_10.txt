First of all, Riget is wonderful. Good comedy and mysterious thriller at the same time. A nice combination of the strange 'dogma' style of telling stories together with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there is no 'end'. As far as I'm concerned, this is unacceptable. I was thinking ... how would it be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have some idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure the third part without Helmer would not be the same. Here's my suggestion. Maible is a little stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. Why not make a little experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution is to make an animation led by a doll (such as "Team America" ​​of Trey Parker) or even 3D animation. I know it's not the same as real actors, but in principle I believe it could work ... only in this way it is possible to make actors alive again. For Riget's fans, this should not be such a big difference - if the animation is done in a good way, the average "observer" will consider it normal only after the first few movie footage. Now is the most important story. It is quite understandable that it is not possible to create Riget 3 with the actors today. Why not play with animation? And ... look for the opportunities that it gives you! Even marketing! The great director ends his trilogy after 10 years with the help of a puppet animation. Just dreams? I hope that one day I will see Riget 3 ... or even see only the script. I wonder how the story ends ... and as I expect - everyone here is working. Hello, slay ps: I'm not talking about the "kingdom" of the hospital "Stephen King ;-)
