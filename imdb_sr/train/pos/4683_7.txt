(Question) How do you call 100 film critics buried at the door in the sand? (Answer) A good start. Well, I do not know Peter Mattei of Adam, but if he is the author of his filmography, "Love in Time of Money" is "a good start". A classic video clip with music music in the music box, this movie moves a chain of bad connections as it moves from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and ends again with people A and B in a carousel mode. The movie gently checks the unfortunate circumstances of nine people with fine-colored shadows that begin and end with a street whore and her client. The disadvantage of this film is the lack of a story that may have something to do with the many critical slums it has received. Last night I watched behemoth "Angels in America" ​​and in the end I was bored, while this little unification of character studies kept me in touch. Be careful. Maybe I'm the only person who really liked this movie. (B)
