Kate Beckinsale is good, if not better than Gvineth Paltrow as Emma in this film, although Gwineth Paltrow really liked me in the second version of Emma. Both are good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale, although Emma looks more interesting, almost. And I liked the woman who better acted Harriet Smith in this movie ... she was more cute and sentimental. There are some things I like more about Gwyneth Paltrow's version, as the witty side is more obvious.
