The very fact that I still think of the film ten years later is what really is about the film. For me this confirms the Grand Canion as a movie that will touch you one way or another. I honestly believe that before the movie Crash was Grand Canion. The main difference between these two films is, in my opinion, the time of their release. I will not argue about who is better, but I will fight for the idea of ​​sharing the same message. I would like to hear from those who have an opinion on this topic. I'll start a comment that you can find at http: //vvv.mispace.com/62229249. Maybe you'll find me there to post other topics about movies that we can share, because I have a real love for the movie.
