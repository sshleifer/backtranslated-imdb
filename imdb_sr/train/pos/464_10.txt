I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Vaves, and then even more fascinated by her reach and skills in Hilary and Jackie. Now comes this stunning portrait of a rich girl who despises breeding and convention in favor of the mother of the tortured soul of a child of obviously needy motherhood. Her eyes are the mirror of his soul - and what kind of gentle and beautiful eyes. Those who take things literally will find the poetic and allegorical direction of Marleen Gorris very frustrating. Romantics who are willing to go with incredible kinetic energy, this recorded allegory song will be well rewarded.
