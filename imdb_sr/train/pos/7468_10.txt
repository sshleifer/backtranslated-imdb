As she writes in one line, the two films left such an objection to me when I left the theater. One was "Blend Echoes" with Kevin Bacon, and the other was "Vanilla Ski". It's one of those movies you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you, stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the movie to take you where it wants ... Walking It was a bit strange from the cinema, like the feeling you got when you're sick and you can not think of anything. One of those movies that you become one with the guy, and you feel that nothing else moves around you from the things in the movie. One thing is certain. Actors are great, sound recording is great, and everything in the movie is 9+. Surely one of the best movies I've ever seen, and a movie that made the best and most shocking awakening of my life and my purpose in this world.
