This film was great ... it smiled at me, made a noise, and most of all, it is what animals say in it !! this movie should be seen by all people! It's one of my favorite movies, and I love it so much that I just had to comment on it !!! it rock! it's such a feeling of heart and a wonderful story that makes a big and honest movie! My favorite character is a shadow. that's because I think he's the most interesting and charming. I used to have a golden retriever like a shadow, I miss it so much! he was my best friend and I knew that when he died he would be happier, but I miss all my heart !! this movie is the best and I love it and everyone should! Love your pets no matter what they do, keep them forever !!!
