The release is a fascinating, boring, and sometimes disturbing story by James Dickey, turned into John Boorman's brilliant film. These are four businessmen, led by masculinity and macho-behavior, who spend a weekend on a canoe high in the mountains. Up there, they are confronted with every faintest side of man and every worst form of human misery ... poverty, buggeria, and even physical harassment! The four intended to travel down the river because of adventure and excitement, but their journey soon turned into odyssey through a violent mountainous land, completely alienated from all forms of civilization. All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. Just about everything that happens to these people, pray that you will never find yourself in a similar situation. A pure speaker movie, Deliverance is also a very important movie. The best John John Boorman (followed by Zardoz and Ekcalibur) was - and still is - a very influential movie and contains several unforgettable scenes that have already been included in countless other films. Just think about the great "Dueling Banjos" scorecards and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual scene of rape. All actors deliver (haha) perfect performing actors. Especially Jon Voight. Must see a movie!
