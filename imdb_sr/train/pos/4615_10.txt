I think people estimate this incredible movie. People see this as a typical horror film that is deliberately scared and prevents us from getting some sleep. What if he tried to do it then deservedly got 1/10, but I watched this movie with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and although it was a good movie, it still has Stephanie Beaton. That's why I think it deserves a 10/10 for a clean movie entertainment. The general view of this movie is that it has a bad acting, a simple script that 10 years old could produce and that can not be seriously understood and because of it people rated it low. But I see it as a totally entertaining masterpiece ... that has a hilariously funny script that actors even more entertaining and although not very serious, it's very fun.
