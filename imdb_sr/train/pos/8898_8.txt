The Sixties are a great movie (I saw it completely in one night) about a hippie movement in the late 60's. Although the title will be different, the first five years of the sixties are not really relevant in this film. The main character of the film is Michael, a political activist who goes on a trip to the United States against the Vietnam War. There, she met her girlfriend, brother SarahMichael, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). His father is a type of pro-Vietnamese war (what a surprise!) Michael's sister Kate becomes pregnant with rock'n'roll artists and escapes from home and goes to San Francisco during the summer of love. The ending is very bad (the father becomes liberal, and everyone is happy), but I allowed this voice to move away (the rest of the film is very good!). The performances of the actors are quite good, and the music from the film is absolutely brilliant. All the major events of the sixties are in the film, such as the murders of JFK and Martin Luther King, as well as the big hippie protests, the year of love and Voodstock! Look carefully at the wavy "Voodstock Speaker" Gravi (what we have in mind is a breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As a first aid employee at the Voodstock Festival! a film about a wonderful decade! 10/10
