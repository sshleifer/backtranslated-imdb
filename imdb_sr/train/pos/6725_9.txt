Nollov's comfortable way to uncover a blunt commentary, often with explanations, to describe things that are more familiar to the majority, is quite refreshing. There is another feature in a movie that is constantly trying to verbalize complicated questions, using more than necessary languages. This guy should never get thesaurus. Cut to Noll and you know that you are for a treat! The way the large-wave surfing pioneers are portrayed is very reminiscent of the "lost era". Regardless of the fact that no one knows how these people earned a living, and even less that they were concerned about issues such as medical care. The use of old movie clips was masterfully performed.
