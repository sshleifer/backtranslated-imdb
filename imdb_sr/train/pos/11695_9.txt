This is a great movie! It does not matter the low grade here. I really have no idea where it came from, they must then discuss the other film. Because I absolutely loved him and found that it was a little hidden treasure. The story was so original and charming. I really can not remember anything bad to say about it. Maybe it must be "your type of thing", but, I saw it with my sister and mother, and we all were busy with it. The acting was also very good, which is hard to do in this kind of film. But I found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic. I've always been very fond of Dougrai Scott and found my new "dark" role very interesting. It's really hard for me to make a bad guy, but this time I absolutely did not have any problems. Moreover, I adored him. Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy, should certainly look at this film, no doubt about it! Anyone who wants to see a movie with 80% of bloodshed, should still rent something else, but ... I suppose the title already gives it somehow. This is a love story, not a Sav 3. I give this movie 4 of 5 stars !!! Good job! KKK Enjoy!
