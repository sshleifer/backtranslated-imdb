I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and I was completely blown away. The structure and performance of the movie was fantastic ... I know it will not, but it really deserves Oscar. Cal and Andre were phenomenal as well as two upset grades. Yes, the film is very controversial and I see a lot of people who have a lot of problems with it, because it deals with shooting at school, and in particular it makes you identify yourself with the killers. However, despite rough and blunt topics, Zero Dai is so worth watching. I'm looking forward to seeing it on the video so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the orderly end of the recording leaves you without text because it is almost too realistic. Their insecurity, "tapes", footage and panic of students, are totally indescribable. I really hope he gets the attention he deserves. It was done in the same format as The Blair Vitch Project, a handheld camera, made to appear as a real documentary video, but God is INFINITELY better. Very impressive, caps for everyone involved. If you have a chance, you should really see it.
