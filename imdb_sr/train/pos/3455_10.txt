Steven Spielberg (at age 24) has already directed two great episodes of the 1971 series entitled "Psychiatrist", starring Roi Thinnes. One episode was about an emotional upset twelve year old boy, and the second about a lively young man (Clu Gulager at his best performance) who is dying of cancer. Both episodes were astounding, visually similar to anything else on TV, both emotionally complex and adult. The creators of "Psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and Villiam Link, who created "Columbo" and also produced the first season. Peter Falk insisted on the first place, experienced TV directors for the first season of "Columbo", such as Bernard Kovalsky and Jack Smight. But Falk agreed with Spielberg after he looked at Clu Gulagher's episode "Psychiatrist". Spielberg says on the DVD "Duel" he likes Steven Bochc's "Murder by the Book" script (based on Levinson / Link story), and he tried to make a production of $ 1 million, even though he had much less money to work. This episode "Columbo" is far more visually stylish and better used soundtrack and background music than almost any other "Columbo" episodes, although the series was always used by top-level executives. Spielberg manages to prevent big Falk and Cassidy from laughing too much, but both actors are still fun. Spielberg receives the fine support of Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsith and Barbara Colby. All the perceptions about them have freshness and vitality. The only "Columbo" episode that was close to being well-directed was an episode "Until Early Light" with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). I think the two episodes "Psychiatrist" and this episode "Columba" suggest that Spielberg has not technically developed so well as a director, he was excellent from the beginning. "Combat!" DVD guest commentary from 1962, in which he plays Albert Salmi, Robert Altman says the episode was as good as he ever had as a director. Perhaps the same applies to Spielberg.
