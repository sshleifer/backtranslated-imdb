For the first time I saw this movie as a pre-teenager, about the years when kids are beginning to think about their identity. I was under the strong influence of the scene of a man and children he raised as his own. The oldest boy was ridiculous that his mother was a prostitute and none of his brothers and sisters had no same biological father (which makes Kurosawa obvious because he has children who do not look like anything). A man still assures the boy that he is their father with the only definition that counts. A man is recognized as a father for all children except one, who still prefers his brother. Each of the vignettes is also tempting for its own stories and conclusions. It's a great movie, even if it's not the biggest Kurosawa movie.
