Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbland may not be for anyone other than Linch, and that's what makes him funny and collective. Violent? Yes. Profanity? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of garbage? Never. Dumbland is a beautiful picture of some Americans who have no brains and hit women and children out of fun. I can say from Mekica that I love him! My favorite episodes are: 1 - My teeth are bleeding, all noise and violence make me scream and put me behind the bed. 2 - Take the rod! Yes, the baby takes it and learns the lesson: some people are never grateful for your actions. 3- Ants. More Linch episodes of everything, music, surrealism and very sweet revenge ...
