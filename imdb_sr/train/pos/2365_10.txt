Jeff Vincott is not just cunning, he can kick his ass! This film has some of the best martial arts movements I have seen in a very long time. Ok, maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I would hire to play a merciless politician, but she did a great job! And let's not forget that Vincott has a partner in this movie starring martial arts expert / stuntman Karen Sheperd. So she's not Cinthia Rothrock, who cares ?! It's just as good, if not better! (just check its fight scene at the end of the movie, one word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you did not see it, there really is some big action of martial arts missing.
