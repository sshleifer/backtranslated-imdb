Burlinson and Thornton give a remarkable performance in this film, along with Dennehi. Although at first glance it is only thought of love, it really goes deeper than that. The beauty of nature is filming this film, sorting it among the best I've ever seen. Horse scenes are absolutely fantastic !! All horse lovers love this movie! <br /> <br />
