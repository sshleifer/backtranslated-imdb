This is the first movie I've ever seen from John Singleton and he's a pretty good director. The film begins with a bunch of incoming freshmen and shows what is happening with a few of them. Omar Epps plays a star with a partial scholarship and is hard to follow his job. He is a friend of Ice Cube and creatures from Tire Banks. Kristi Swanson is a rich girl who is raped and becomes a friend of Jennifer Connelli, a lesbian, and is not sure how. Michael Rapaport is a Idaho kid who falls into a group of neo-Nazis and their leader is Cole Hauser. These are three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a political science professor who is trying to help them. It's a great movie and it's sad that the studio had to make several cuts in the movie.
