With all the films of the recent, British monarchy, is it real time for another? Answer: You bet! Young Victoria is another contributor to the British movie wave that deals with the royal family. In this case, she deals with the early life of Princess Victoria and the events that led to crowning that she became Queen of England, as well as her romance and eventual wedding to Prince Albert. The film also deals with the turbulent life and career of the English queen and prince, as well as several other events that take place (political turmoil, etc.). Emili Blunt plays glittering Victoria at her young age, while Rupert Friend is her beloved and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the actors are rounded off with Miranda Richardson, like Dutchess of Kent, and are always welcome on the screen, Jim Broadbent as King of Villiam, as well as actors who shine on the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.I., Loser Love), directed by Jullian Felloves (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I absolutely got out of the head for the visual appearance of the film (cameraman Hagen Bogdansker), who gave each painting frame a painting look (with the help of the production designer, Patrice Vermette), as well as some rigorous editing (Jill Bilcock) and Matt Garner. What I appreciated in Fellows' script is the use of chess as a metaphor for some of the political motives of the film (characters in the film move like a piece on a chessboard). This is a smart, well written, directed, recorded, edited and acting (and enlightening) entertainment that makes a good evening in the cinema. Evaluated PG by MPAA for several scenes of sensuality, short violence (a bit bloody, though nothing too bloody), a rude drop of language, and some on the screen
