Well, what can I say, except these people are great in every way. I really love Sharon Mcreedi, I enjoy this pure Nostalgic series and I have a box of 9 discs of 30 episodes, I did not realize that they made so much, I also think that it's a big shame that they are no more. I wish I were given this power, imagine me, I got off the cycle, somewhere I fainted, and then I woke up in a special hospital. Later I discover that my body has been improved. Just like Richard Barratt. These stories are 50 minutes of clean action and uncertainty all the way, you can not fight these three people, because they would defeat you in all forms of weapons. Music is well written, and for me, it represents a beautiful picture of 3 superpowers in my head. Such powers that have champions are the same as our domestic dog or cats, Improved vision, improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 people for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women for Sharon. For whom I thought she was beautiful and intelligent. When I was a boy, I had a great love in it !!!! Now I can see why, on my DVD set. The box is very nice and comes with a free booklet about the series. I also thought that Trimane was a good boss, solid, but he did things!
