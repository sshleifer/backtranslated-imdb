I have enjoyed this film completely, but it's nothing new. Everyone here bundles him with other war films, this movie is wrongly categorized! Her war film is nothing more than "One Flocked Cow Nest" is a film about asylum or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison movie. This is a film about individuality, disagreement, self-confidence and the cost of that type of personality. in a good company, and has its own. His films should be kept up-to-date and compared, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Vod". Erik
