Before I start, I should point out that I know the editor of this film. We never met, but we belong to the same fan (those things that appeared before the announcement boards), and we talked over the phone, so I have a bias here. In any case ... It's kind of ironic that the culture of the "Rat Pack" of the late 50's and early to mid-60's returned in the mid-1990s, this film, from the son of one of the original Rat Pack, which was made in a similar way, was a flop. And not only that, it was a critical failure; I believe Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not play this (he gave me a mixed review, as far as I remember). And while I do not think this is the biggest movie in the world, and I am not a fan of Rat Pack, or a "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth watching. First of all, this looks elegant and moving right. On the other hand, basic performance is good. Richard Dreifus is surprisingly restrained here as the main gangster who returns from the sanatorium, and has a hole for him. Jeff Goldblum returns to the quiet irony performances he has given in his pre-block days such as THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin is only obliged to vamp in this movie, she does it fun. However, this is not a great movie; The dialogue is mostly made up of games, and many of them do not work (such as the entire "Zen of Ben" speech). And Gabriel Birne and Kyle MacLachlan are terrible here. Still, I was having fun, and if you like gangsters, you may be.
