The assumption for this film is simple, as well as the scenario: an older Muslim gets his son's teenager driving him in similar old wagon cars from France to a hajj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so he can fulfill his worldly Muslim obligation before that he dies. The father is obviously piously religious, but his son is not impressed; he accepts from his obligations to his father, and not to religion, he would rather be with his (non-Muslim) girl. The father is stubborn in many things that his son does not understand, and among them is the disgusting device that maintains the drama, although it is often quite boring. However, like any good movie on the road, miraculous characters meet on the road; for example, a woman in the last part of Croatia, who, after asking her a question for a trip to Belgrade, simply enters the last seat and shows her hand by saying one word they assume is a place, but she can not be found on the map. In Bulgaria, another man looking for a course confirms that he can speak French, but then he provides extensive comments in the Bulgarian language. There is also occasional humor - in one country, the son of a rubber guy to eat sandwiches with eggs and wants meat - they get a goat, but unfortunately (maybe fortunately for the viewer) runs away before the father can perform the Muslim ritual slaughterhouse. They eventually reach Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For Westerners, it's all bizarre or fascinating. The film is not sophisticated, but charming in its own way, a sort of National Geographica with a soul.
