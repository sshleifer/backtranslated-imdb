The Police Story is one of the classic films by Jackie Chan who helped shape the cinema in Hong Kong. It's a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan. From the beginning, it is obvious that Jackie Chan's stuntman team literally risked his life to make this film. Both action and acrobatics are extremely realistic and innovative. Even today, no movie has surpassed the police story in dangerous acrobatics. Many people have been hospitalized in a police case, including Jacks Chan. Fighting is not so indisputably exceptional as acrobatics, but the fight in this movie helped to change and define the use of the props for Jackie Chan. During the movie, Chan uses an unusual object to stop the attackers and constantly throws attackers through thick glass. The action feels real, because the stuntmen give the film everything they need to give, and the coordination of Jackie Chan is remarkable. fan. Chan not only plays a compelling risk of getting a cop, but also shows the strong changes his character goes through as he falls into escalating despair. The action is powerful, but the contemporary viewer is sometimes tedious. While the comedy will provide a good number of laughter, it does not divert the audience from the lack of action. However, for the time period in which it is made, the driving aspects of the action are fun. There are a number of interesting and well-played characters scattered throughout the film. The total police story is no doubt one of the best action movies ever taken. Not even Hollywood should ignore the influence of this film.
