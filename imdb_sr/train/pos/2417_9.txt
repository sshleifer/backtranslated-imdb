"Going Berserk" is actually one of the funniest Candi films I've ever seen. Of course, it's kind of a small budget, but it's non-stop comedy. There are many unforgettable quotes. For example, when his mother-in-law, who will soon become, asks how much she earns, Candy says: "Oh, I'm withdrawing between thirty and eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Of course, it's Candi's delivery. Just classic things. Eugene Levi also turns into a hilarious performance as a dreary film maker. The clip of his terrible film with a low budget "Kung Fu U" will blur you. So, if you are a Candi fan and want to re-discover the forgotten gem, I can not recommend this film enough.
