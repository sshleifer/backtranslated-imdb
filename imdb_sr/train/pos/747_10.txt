Although I was born in the year when this film came out and I never heard about it until the younger year of high school (1996), when I saw it, I became completely preoccupied with laughter and crying and feeling along with the characters because I and my friends Their hair , clothes and speech were outdated, but the emotions and despair of every situation were so familiar! I remember thinking about how it was real and how I wanted to continue making such films. In fact, I saw this movie the night after I was in a crazy party (not as much as the one in Jai's house) that was knocked down by what we considered losers who stayed at the edge of our crowd. World class BS'er and "responsible" mother identity type I identified immediately with Jeanie (I was the one with the car) even though I had a little Madge insecurity floating there. My best friend was Deidre, and her good friend from childhood was our Annie. Watching the scene when Jeanie is at school or in which she and her boyfriend are falling apart, and then Madge says how much she loved him as conversations and situations I personally had. Now that I was 27 years old, I again saw the movie and felt the impulse of emotions because it was like watching my young (although none of my friends died). I think this is for all girls 13 and more.
