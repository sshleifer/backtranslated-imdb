This movie is SOOOO funny !!! The acting is beautiful, the Ramones are sexy, jokes are subtle, and the plot is exactly what every high school student dreams about doing in his school. I absolutely loved the sound surface, as well as carefully set cynicism. If you like monti pithon, you will love this movie. This film is then a little "fat" esk (without all boring songs). Singing songs are nice; You might even find yourself singing these songs when the movie is over. This musical is my second in musicals (the second is next to blues brothers). But please, do not think about it as a musical word; Watching how the songs are so cute, it's hard to say a carefully choreographed scene. I think of this film more as a comedy with romantic tones. You will recall how it was to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say you will remember your old school days after you've seen this movie. It is recommended for the family (because it is very young, but also for adults, because there are many jokes that are funnier with years and experience.
