I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was as brilliant as the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he has been recognized. The only part of this film that I'd changed was the end. The death of the creature was far more terrible for the Sci Fi Channel. In this film there were some interesting religious messages. Jeff Combs obviously played the Messiah's figure, and the creature (or shark, if you prefer) was anti-Chirst. There were some particularly scary scenes that had this "end of the world". I noticed this only after the third review of this classic creature. I know that many people will not get references to Christianity, but if you look close, you will get it.
