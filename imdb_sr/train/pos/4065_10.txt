I saw the original English version of the video. Disney's choice of actors looks very promising. I can not believe I'm saying that. The story is about a boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his. Two were thrown into one of the funniest and most interesting stories in any animated film. The quality of animation is great! If you've seen Disney's Kick's Delivery Service, you can see the quality of their production. She is almost redeemed for stealing the story of Kimba, a white lion. (but not completely!) Finally, Miyazaki's movies are published correctly! I can not wait to see the unmasked English version of Nausica!
