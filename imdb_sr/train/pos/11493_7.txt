Unborn is a pretty good low budget horror movie that uses fears related to pregnancy. Very good actors were always good Brooke Adams and b-movie James Karen, although the auxiliary cast is quite average for b-graders. Music, of Garry Numan of all people, is also good. The script of Henry Dominica is pretty intelligent for such things, although there is an indication of misogyny about it. The direction of Rodman Fender is only adequate, and there are some unnecessary cheap fears. If you are an admirer of Adams, whose film career is not nearly as glorious as it should be, check; It's great, as always.
