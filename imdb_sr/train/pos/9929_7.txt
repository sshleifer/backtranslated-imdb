I doubt this film is based on a true story. At first it says that it is based on a true story. I bet the only truth is that the former model has become a head hunter and may have been called Domino. Domino is questioning what he knows about theft of $ 10 million. Through flashbacks we see Domina as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in being a blackbird hunter. She basically says that other blackmailers are Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. She is tough, can use any kind of weapon, and will use her good looks if necessary. By the way, the group begins to realize the TV show, and it includes Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green. They are kind of hosts and they certainly desperately wanted to appear in this. I thought the story was fun and laughing. The arrangement did not bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mainly with the use of weapons and blood. It could be a little shorter. EXCLUSIVE VERDICT: Good enough to watch.
