In any way, Wind Blovs is Tom Barmans (also known as the frontman debutant rock 'dEUS'). Filmed in Antwerp (Belgium), the film begins on sunny Friday morning and quite superficially skips between events that populate a dozen major characters. When the film is over, you have a lot to consider, because most of the different stories are left open wide. The film has a (purely instrumental) sound track that will snap you off socks. In most scenes, music really improves the general atmosphere and feeling, it really makes a movie hallucinating to watch at certain time points. The main scene in the movie, the fun, is very well recorded. The director did not hesitate to use video clip techniques, while his main characters danced on one of the best soundtracks lately. The scenario is a great thing. Camera angles and colors are very well selected. 'Costumes' are very hot and very 'seventies'. I loved (mostly) acting. What I liked most in the movie is the subtle touch of absurd, surreal, very dry, or even cynical humor that intertwines. Without the claim that comedy (this film is certainly not a comedy, but an alternative artwork), it still succeeds in the audience laughing and sometimes laughing. This is another direct debut that should not be the end. I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future because I have had a good time. Cheers.
