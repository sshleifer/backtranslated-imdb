I do not know what the previous reviewer was looking at, but I guess these are reviews, personal tastes. Missed in this film was a depth, a very deep film, many layers of emotions that influenced. The disadvantages of deprivation of love for obedience to social beliefs, taboos of time and classes, racial relations are not in a very good state of equality, guilt, longing, hatred, confusion, very dark and emotional. to subordinate to her film, in the course of the film, which is not slow, as already said, free from the stream of film, emotions will be shown, the characters reveal their faults, their nasty innards, excellent and actually very cruel!
