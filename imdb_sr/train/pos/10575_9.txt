Fast, fun, sexy and spectacular. Cagnei is always great. Blondel enchants you with your wit and energy. Obviously, this is a pre-censorship movie by the script, costumes and the way they touch it. And bikini before they were bikinis! This is not fun for everyone. I do not understand John Garfield's question. Does it matter whether or not it is in this movie? If so, then the screen is so short that it is basically a backing. You need to look at him in a frame by frame to even find him if he is there. I'm a big Cagnei fan, but I've never seen this before. I found it on Turner Classics. I found him a miracle accident. Sit and enjoy the ride!
