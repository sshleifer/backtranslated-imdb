A great movie, one of the best horror films of the seventies. It is a realistic setting and atmosphere. As usual, there were inevitable common negative comments. I noticed that most horror films from a certain period of time fail to reach even sufficient. Obviously because most of the horror films are old and must be denigrated, it's like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potentials of music critics here. It's a good gift in the movie because it's really well made. Raines reads well and the movie as the way it's created reminds me of Kubrick's films. Real impression. Excellent movie. I consider film anthology in '70.
