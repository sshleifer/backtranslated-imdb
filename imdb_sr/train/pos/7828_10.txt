I present this film to university students in the law of speech and media because his lessons are timeless: Why is exposure to injustice important and can lead to changes that the underprivileged are seeking. Why is freedom of press and freedom of speech essential to democracy? This is an indispensable story of how apartheid attracted the attention of the world through the activism of Steven Bick and journalism by Donald Woods. She also gives an important lesson about free speech: "You can blow a candle, but you can not blow a fire. When the flame starts to catch, the wind will increase it." (From Biko, Peter Gabriel, on Shaking the Tree).
