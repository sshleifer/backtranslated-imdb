I remember I liked this more than Nausicae in the valley of the wind at the time when that tone of the story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title influenced his release in the United States to avoid confusion in a broad Latin American audience, has a caricature in Conan's directing debut. In fact, Pazu has dense bones and the immortal vitality of Konan - who jumped with a thousand stories carrying his girlfriend in his arms and stepping on his feet, and then he began to run. It makes it the most picturesque and pleasant face to watch. Fans of Science in Science can be disappointed with flying insects and retro technology through Laput - the only exception can be a robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and the Valley of the Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly related to ecology. If it's a topic at all, it's anti-warfare. The importance of natural life - it is connected with the flying castle, is soon discussed, and in fact it is not tracked. All in all, I now think that the piece is at a crossroads between the feelings of a good and grunted.
