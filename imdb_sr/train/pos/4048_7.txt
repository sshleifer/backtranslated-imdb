Rohmer goes from his usual portraits of the French middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of the aristocratic lady during the French Revolution. What's even more attractive about "La Anglaise ..." (except for the story itself) is the incredible aesthetics Rohmer has achieved. The images are digitally arranged and make them look like baroque images. At some moments you can not say whether you're watching a movie or a series of images in Louvre Musseum. Each clip is like an artwork. * My Price: 7.5 / 10 ---------------- --- --- ----------- - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - --------- ---------
