This series is premiered on the cable TV station "Comedi Central" in the United States. She was chopped to death, and turned out to be irregular. This was sad for the audience it was supposed to attract, it did not fail. Fortunately, at the same time my cable company became digital and I got the BBC myself. Thank God I had to see "Gentlemen's Gentleman" in a row, complete and uncircumcised. "League gentlemen" of the troupe is up there with English "Monti Pithon Fliing Circus" and Canadian "Children in the Hall". But .. a warning. The "League of Gentlemen" is a step further. It's not just about dressing up and restoring cultural illnesses, it goes deeper and much, much, darker. Now I can say to many of you that they will offend certain groups of people, that will make others angry. But remember, his only comedy ... a dark, dark comedy. If it's not your thing, do not look. If you think you know the dark comedy, look at this - if you get upset and upset, then you do not know exactly DARK COMEDY. These guys fixed it, and the right button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I enjoyed every character's creation. There is a complete story that has been told here from the episode to the end. You can not watch this episode at the same time, reluctantly, it's one of the charms of this series. Watch your turn. See how creative and modern they are and deeply upset. Nobody and nothing are out of bounds. That is, my dear, "dark humor". Well done!
