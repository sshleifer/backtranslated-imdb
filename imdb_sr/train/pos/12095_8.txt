When American writer Edgar Alan Po visits London, British journalist Alan Foster comes to him, who becomes a target of unusual bets. Not believing that Poova's claim that all his freaky stories are based on real experience, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he can not spend the whole night in Blackwood's haunted castle. Once installed in an abandoned castle, Foster reveals that he is not alone, as he approaches various beautiful women and handsome men, and a doctor of metaphysics - which explains that all those lost souls are cursed to repeat the stories of their death anniversary of their death! The first time I watched this magnificent classic of horror, I was hypnotized all the time. I thought that the film was truly creepy and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is undoubtedly beautiful. The music party makes the atmosphere twice heavier than terror. The toples scene threw me on the loop, because I did not expect it. It seems that Sinapse has done a great job with improving the image, because this movie looks damn good for his age, which is the Uncut International launch version. This film is responsible for launching the collection of Babs Steele and Klaus Kinsky.
