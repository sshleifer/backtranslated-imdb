I went through the list of Oscar winners and I was surprised when I saw this film beat Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid for the best picture in 1969. It was far ahead of its time in terms of its style, cinema and the use of flashback to help develop Joe Buck's character. short film. I think Voight captured naivety and rudeness - when challenged. The two scenes that really caught me were after having been smoking in a theater and when an older man searches for it. I think that when he looks into the mirror he is trying to see if he is the one who did - or will do it - something terrible. . Otherwise, he may have been enrolled after graduation. In any case, this was considered to be excellent all the time for some reason.
