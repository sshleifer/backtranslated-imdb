I saw this film after I saw Blue Crush and other Michelle's films, I thought it had a dazzling future in this business. fighter, but also warrior. In this film, the way she faces her father about the treatment of her and her brother, the way she passes anger when she gets a hit. Her characters in the movie about her can not always put a wall and hide from love, or that just because she has the power she will not win. I believe that this role perfectly fit for Michelle, although she did not have previous experience, the director saw talent, I criticize myself because I did not see the talent in it.
