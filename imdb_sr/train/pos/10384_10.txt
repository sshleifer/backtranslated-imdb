Almost 30 years later, I remember this original PBS movie as an almost unbearable competition. Occasionally I check here on the IMDb, hoping that someone had a good sense of buying rights and putting them on a DVD. September 2004, and I hope - a deep sigh. One of the two main actors went into a small career primarily in the evening soap in the shocking term; The second, Frances Lee McCain, was seen in small roles here and there for several years. But nothing they did before or after, did not coincide with this small movie that was produced, as far as I remember, on the short-lived PBS series that featured the original scenarios of new and advanced playwrights. I watched him every time he was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. It was before the era of a video recorder, so I have no record of it, except in my head. 31.12.2006. This awesome movie is finally available on DVD at ladislipper.org. As far as I understand, DVDs are burned from a personal copy of the writer.
