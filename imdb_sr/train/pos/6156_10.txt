This film has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then 11/21/01 I saw the 30th anniversary of this DVD. VOV I remember why I love this movie. The DVD is so great, it has an extra 30 minutes that the original did not have. I did not know when I started to watch. Since then, the film has made a lot more. The music they cut was supposed to be left. You did not see this movie until you saw the Full 131 min version. Many people say that music is forgetful. I remember every song in this film by heart, every song has its own charm, and it comes together like a hole. I remember when I was younger I had the song "Eglantine" in my head for days. Like "Brini Sea" (this song was intended for marriages, but it's cut out of the movie). That's what it really is.
