his great and I loved him because I love dinosaurs they are the biggest animals but I loved shov because he was not copied from another show and was original he has a good story and great for young children (if they like dinosaurs it is) I have a few falls too It's not all that the big cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated, so I should have, but 7, but right now it's a little late for that iai 4 more lines to go it is great for the fantasy shov although the warning this can spoil the part for in so If you do not want to spoil it, you do not read it in plz near the end is somehow a strange cause of everything they need to do is get the dang I forgot what is so nvm I guess it's not a spoiler, so I'm not glad I loved it and my opinion and I'm sorry for all missed words written if they have them
