When scientist and family man, Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepts a call to work in the Micro-Digitech Corporation in a space suit project, he moves with his beloved wife, Joanna Cassidi, and their son, Robbie (Barret Oliver) and daughter Chrissi (Soleil Moon Frie) to a huge modern home in the corporation. Meet their friend Tom Petersen (Joe Regalbuto) and his family, completely adapted to the new way of life, and Tom invites Wilslow's family to join the Counting Club Steaming Springs. Tom tries to seduce the Meta by telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional climb in Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted with the offer. Later, he met with club director Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci) who is getting along with Patricia and convinced her to join the club with her children. Matt feels a change in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club, finding the evil secret about Jessica and members. In the eighties, when I saw "Call to hell," I loved this film that partly remembers "The Stepford Vives," with people who changed their behavior in a suburban neighborhood. I just saw him today, and I found a big metaphorical message against big corporations, when people literally sold the soul of a devil to climb to positions and earn a higher salary. I'm not sure whether the author wanted to give this interpretation of the story, but I believe it fits perfectly. My voice is seven. Address (Brazil): "Convite Para About Inferno" ("Call to Hell")
