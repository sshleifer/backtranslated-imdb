Fire and Ice is an animated film set in the fantasy world. The film talks about a village that has destroyed a giant glacier that is home to the slaughter of a master of ice called Necron. The only survivor from the village is a young man named Larn who is about to retaliate those who were killed by glaciers. The glacial glacier moves through the land of fire, and the princess of Teegra is abducted by evil creatures. Larn hopes to find her and will also find and kill Necron. Fire And Ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite adult animators. He brought us such animated masterpieces as the movie version of Fritz Cat and some of the films he wrote himself, such as the great Heavi Traffic movie. I did not like Fire and Ice almost like I have another job by Ralph Bakshi, but I still thought the movie was pleasant. He had a very nice animation in the parts and the story was fun enough. The only basic complaint I have is that I want to have more stories about the movie because the story it uses is very thin and there is not much. I'd like the movie to be a bit longer because it's less than 80 minutes. Still, fun action adventure films that, unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavi Traffica, are suitable for children aged 8 years. I just wish that there was a more developed story and that it took something longer than it was.
