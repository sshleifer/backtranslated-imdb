I captured this film about IFC and I enjoyed it, although I felt that the editing work was a bit rough, although it might have been deliberate. I had a little hard time to figure out what was going on in the beginning because they looked like they were going to play a non-linear Pulp Fiction style. Still, it seemed a little compulsory. I definitely think that the movie is worth watching, but I think it's a little used for cleaning. Some scenes simply do not make sense after others. I'm surprised at the rating here so low. It's not remarkable, but there are no serious problems. I gave her 7/10. The film at least showed that Laurence Fishburne could act whenever he wanted to. Must have just told him that this does not work in Matrix movies.
