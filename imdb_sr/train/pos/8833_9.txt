I am interested in the title so that during a small attack of insomnia (stimulated by my curiosity ...) I stay awake and watched him. Then I checked my TV lists and I watched them again! There is one very clear knowledge that happened to me when I saw this film - despite politics, tradition, culture, etc. Teenagers are practically the same everywhere. The characters of children from Belgrade could have been transported to, say, somewhere in the middle-west of America in the same time period, and differences in language, in addition, would be impossible to discern except for any local teenager of that time. They certainly showed the same pain and preoccupation, politics to the side: music, sex, movie idols, music, drinks, sports, music ... In fact, many of my time-consuming things grew up in southern California. This was a bitter-sweet story, but the joy of youth made it very pleasant. The characters, especially the young actors, were also completely convincing. I would not say that it was Yugoslav "American graffiti", but I will say that it fits nicely with other films from the 1950s.
