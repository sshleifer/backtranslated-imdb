This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and laughs loudly again. In other places, I read complaints about racism and sexism from consecrated, politically correct attempts. There is neither here, unless you define sexism as a woman as a housewife and racism as a family that uses a colored maid. The lines are hilarious, and all the tracks have never been better. Melvin Douglas is particularly brilliant. If you've ever thought or tried to build a new house, it will be easier for you to know that no matter how lame the process is, no matter how much lamb has wolves you might feel, you are not alone!
