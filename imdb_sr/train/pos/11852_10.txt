The spirit is a unique and original look at Western life from the point of wild horses and Americans. The film focuses on friendships and the dangers that the wild horse, the Spirit, encounters during his lifetime. and realism. The music is fantastic, with the songs of Brian Adams and the music by Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the extremely popular music from Disney's hit 1994, The Lion King. The story is not very deep, but the fact that it's not as deep as some films do not, in my opinion, diminish the film as a whole. An excellent movie that I enjoyed immensely and which is suitable for the whole family. No one would have missed it. (10/10)
