I resisted watching this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in cinemas. The "October sky" feels and it seems so familiar. And that's it. All the dots and emotions have already been explored in other films - and perhaps even better. But despite being well-known and resistant to all formulas in Hollywood, this film is winning and sympathetic at every step. Sputnik is an inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind, and soul. Just as the characters of Steven Sondheim's music, MERRILLI VE ROLL, stood agape on the roof of their apartments, hoping to launch their new generation ("What do you call it? You call it a miracle.") Sputnik has a similar impact on the young. rocket boys of this real story. As the townspeople from the city from the 1950s mined out of the mine, dismissing the event, Homer Hikam sees Sputnik as his ticket from mining life. Powerful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy Homer and his friends. fresh and new. Especially affecting the surfaces of Homer's little teacher. Exceptional restraint is shown in their delicate relationship. It is also incredible that the father / son is a subblot that anchors the film. Perfect play all around. Even Homer's mom gets his moment without clich√©s or intrusion. Her ultimatum to her husband is at the same time dignified and dark. Myrtle Beach is talking. A big video chain that I despise has a mark next to this movie that says you will like this movie or will pay you back. Once I agree with them. You will never look at the October sky again. <br /> <br />
