this film is not pornography, it did not mean to be pornography, and unless my uncle is a candidate for the president of the world, he should never be considered pornography. I strongly recommend this film because its problems are still widely available. It's funny, the acting is great and provokes serious (curious) questions. I can not fully understand why this film is so maltreated. Lena is the real pioneer of the modern rebellion movement, confusion, curiosity and savvy are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but are not we all?
