Simply well written, directed and acting ... Voody is the best since the 2000s, if not his best since the 80s! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his game. The scarf Scarlett Johansson with Voody proves how rounded the actress she has become. It is refreshing that you are not in the romantic on the screen with the leading lady. He plays the perfect irrepressible magician. There have been several reviews that malignant this film. Do not let them stop you from seeing a great movie. The people in the crowd with whom I watched were laughing so loudly on some lines that I missed the next line. If you like Voodoo Allen's 70s movies, you will regret that you missed this one. I suggest you watch this movie with an open mind, if you do, you may smile.
