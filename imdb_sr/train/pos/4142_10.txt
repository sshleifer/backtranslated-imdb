FATTI DRIVES BUS is simply the most entertaining, most original and fun work I've ever had to see. This film is by no means incompatible with Hollywood standards, or even that straight-to-video movie, a fluff comedy starring "hulk" hogan, in terms of working with cameras, editing, acting, budget, or anything else. What this movie has, is a very original and pleasant story, and it's obvious that people who love it are doing it, and the enthusiasm of all the actors and team really breaks through all of its budget and creeps down. This movie proves that you can not need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need are some original ideas and a passion for what you are doing. Just the best movie ever. I do not care how to get, rent, order, steal, download, just watch this movie. Now I just hope to make a DVD version.
