Critics are stupid. This film is funny and smart. I loved this movie very much. Why everyone hates this movie so much. I wish people like this movie more than they do not. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and they have invested a lot of work to make this movie. I do not see people making movies like them. So people just need to watch it and not comment. I like this movie. Everything is fine. The parts were stupid, but at least they succeeded. Jerry Stiller would love this because this movie has an act just like shov King Of Kueens. But this is better than that. I can not believe this is rated so low.
