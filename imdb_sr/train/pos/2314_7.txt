I heard good things about this movie and I was, I guess, a bit disappointed. Reese Vitherspoon, as promised, is surprisingly good, surprisingly safe, at a young age; Indeed, all (small) actors are quite solid, in their simple American settings. The reason why I did not evaluate this movie was mainly that at the end of the sorrow shown by the older sister did not make it so real and it took me a little out of the film. Perhaps we are expected to fill the plot, or maybe the film should be a little longer. I think Maureen's character is underdeveloped. It is understandable that Dani (Reese V., younger) would be traumatized and angry, but why did her sister appear more upset? Because it's a couple of years older? Did the end not undermine the rest of the film? The pace of the film seems to have been that Maureen and the Court just met, when they received training (a warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, it seems retrospectively that it may have been trying to shock a bit. It works well!). Depends on what you want - if you want a happy girlfriend's story of young love, it seems you will get a surprise. The Man on the Moon is also a weird and dreamy and sharp movie that comes in years? A rather unpleasant combination? I liked the character of the court, but I see what girls watch watching. And I loved that they had the courage to let him hurt the younger sister (most would do it, most films would not) and that she would be killed. For some reason, I found Jason London on a tractor ridiculously.
