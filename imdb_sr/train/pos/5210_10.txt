Too bad she did not get the screen award, she did it very well in the movie that the girl on the cross is the best part of the movie. She had much more influence than Avril, or anyone else in the movie. . S / M almost looked fun! She was really convinced that the S / M model frightened her situation. Although it seems that this dreamy feeling of looking for a bad guy really flashed, these sets were very well built, but they just kind of jumped on the surface of what was shot. This is a movie that should be available. It seems that they omitted a lot of what was shot, and almost all really dark things that make the film much more demented. Something like they stopped in the vicinity of the mark they were going on during the shooting. What was shot would not be rated R probably NC-17 or Ks, but that's what it takes to make the movie the way it should be.
