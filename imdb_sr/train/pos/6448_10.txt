Kei Polak (the man behind this movie) is a real big man who is trying to share his life philosophy in different ways. He wrote a bunch of good and well-written books on how to control his senses and keep his soul happy. The message in most of his books and this movie is that your thoughts are actually what causes your problems and that the cause of your anger is hardly ever challenged by what you think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy, but you will never do it. To watch this movie and learn something very important about life, you have to keep your mind very open and listen to all the "hidden messages" (or guidelines for life) that most of the parts of this movie contain if you listen and watch . Watch him with your ears. You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live and get the maximum out of it ... So, while watching, keep in mind: <br /> <br /> /> "The mind is like a parachute, it does not work if it is not open!"
