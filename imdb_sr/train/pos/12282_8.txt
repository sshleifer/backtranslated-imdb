At first I did not like that much, although I did. They did not include the third generation of Trueba, the love between Blance and Pedro was not well explained, and some actors were too different from what I imagined. more loyal books, it would be like five o'clock and it would be a bit tiring. Now I like it very much, because my favorite characters are here while I portrayed them. Clara really looks like an Angel in her life, and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the film was fantastic, loyal and brief. Glenn Close is Ferula. I just imagined it, but not sad in the whole thing. Esteban is enough. I never liked his character, and although I was interested, I hated him very much, especially when he hit Clara. As in the book, the last part is most exciting and has a true history. The film is really good, especially since it was a gringo movie based on a Latin book. It's amazing how many famous stars are there, right?
