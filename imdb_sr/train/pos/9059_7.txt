This is a good movie, a good family movie to watch if you do not have anything else to do. If you expect this movie to be a word from the book, you will be very disappointed. I was a bit disappointed because I read the book several times while I was in elementary school. This is about a new boy in a city named Billy. He bet with a school bully and the bet is not like most bets. Billy must eat 10 worms in one day or winner. The act is fine, probably the worst part of the movie. Children's actors exaggerate in many things. They think it's apocalypse if Billy does not eat worms. However, Hallie Eisenberg performed a magnificent job. The line of action is good as a movie, but it's shit like a book adaptation. I was able to watch this movie without looking at time ... sometimes. All in all, this was a good family movie with weak points. I estimate this film 7/10.
