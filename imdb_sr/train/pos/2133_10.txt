I've lost the number of times I've seen this movie - I probably know the whole dialogue backwards - and yet it's been attracting that time again. Set up in Hungary, young Jimmy Stevart plays a qualified queen "King" who becomes a secret admirer of the innocent "Clara" Margaret Sullavan. The queen is secretly becoming a friend of Clarin, and at work Clara enters the King about the content of his (Royal) letters. It is obvious that King is obsessed with Clara - but he is not able to realize his feelings while competing with his "friend". Confused? Well, you will not - this story has a sweet, almost sweet end - but we all know it's the end we all want. Other characters worthy of importance are Frank Morgan who plays his usual role, this time as the owner of the Hugo Matusek store, Felix Bressart as "Pirovic", the Royal Trustee. Joseph Schildkraut as a female arrogant "Vadas" - so well played that you can not hate him right from the start. from the junior store "Pepi Katona". Recently re-made as "I've Got Mail" starring Tom Hanks & Meg Rian for me is not as good as the original - although I doubt the younger audience I would not agree. If this film is in your area before Christmas, I suggest you pour a nice glass of wine, put a log on fire and have a box of Kleeneka at hand.
