This was a top movie with a top-notch actor. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Christopher Lloied are good actors in this charming film about real-life angels who help the Angels baseball team. You never know, it could happen. I loved Lloyd's role in it. He was ridiculous. The story is about turning your life around, because the child's belief in Angels has helped turn the angry, hardened and outraged manager Glover sees the best in people. The film was well recorded, as well as watching the best in people and reaching your dreams. It was funny, charming, touching and sad, all pretty and beautiful. You will love (or love). I guarantee. *** from ****
