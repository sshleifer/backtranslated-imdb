It's a very good movie and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points: - story level has a large spectrum. some scenes are very large, and some are just boring. - many stories are not self-sufficient (if you compare coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, message, punchline or whatever you want), but well, most of the story is really good, some great and overall is one of the best movies this year safe! Boring, I have to fill 10 rows to a minimum, I have no more say, and I do not want to start analyzing individual sequences ... Well, I think that's it!
