Full House is a great family performance. However, after watching some episodes over and over, I realized that they are incredibly boring and seem to hide much from the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it's incredible cheesy. It's not that I hate it, but do not watch them all over again because I'm old. Probably the best season is the first. Full House is about the widow Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sveetin) and Michelle (Mari-Kate and Ashlei). When Dana's wife dies, she needs help. So, his best friend, Joei (Dave Coulier), and his uncle Jesse (John Stamos), move in with them. Once they live together, they see that they can not live without themselves. Full House reminds you how important the family is and you can always return home.
