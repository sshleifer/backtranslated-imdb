When I first saw the title, I had already drawn the topic of the film - it was obviously not a reference to the British currency, so it had to be Shakespeare and about a kilogram of meat - getting them or giving them. Vill Smith is a good actor, so serial killers came out. It can only be about giving them a man, so it must be somehow wrong. I smacked the whole thing for myself by looking at it and getting to know the story before I looked, while the beauty of the upgrade is the way the parts of the background of the protagonist cling to slowly illuminating the audience about who is and Why he does what he is doing. Guilty is a very difficult thing for simply because it is deeply embarrassing and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping to ride a slide - you know it will be unpleasant. I would not say that the movie glorifies suicide; it is condensed into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. It is also full of symbolism everywhere, which is a sure sign of warning that writing is cleverly thought out and thoroughly guided. more meaning and deep reflexive nature. The most prominent theme that inspired me was that he not only gave his heart to a girl she likes emotionally and metaphorically, but also physically gave her the greatest gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan is impeded by falling in love - what is the complication of another act. Absolutely masterful. Yes, it's very slow, but I'm unwilling whether it would be better to insert into a smaller timeframe. I did not feel tension and his terrible inner turmoil as much as I could, but perhaps I ruined it myself. Speaking about all this, it's a deeply moving and original movie that is an incredibly powerful and thoughtful tragedy that deserves rewards that will inevitably get.
