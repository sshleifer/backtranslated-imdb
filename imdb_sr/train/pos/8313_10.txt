First, I think the following comment is inappropriate for a site like this one. Obviously you do not have taste and do not respect the taste of others. If I did not give you a lesson from history, but I think that's what to do. Black actors there are only, if not more, successful as others. If you are not a part of the "black" race, you can not understand the quality, creativity and vigor of old movies such as Sparkle and Mahogany and Coolei High. Unfortunately, you are not Black, you do not have the pleasure to feel what we feel when you watch these classics, so you must hold your mouth and hold your non-dance race. Thank you.
