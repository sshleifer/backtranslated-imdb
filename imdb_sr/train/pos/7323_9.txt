Brutal, impotent Michael Miers killed his sister in the sixth year of Halloween in 1963; On October 30, 1978, he escaped from a mental institution and established a new reign of terror in his hometown, Haddonfield, Illinois. He is being treated all the time by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how evil this young man is. many slasher paintings helped her to inspire. It's subtle compared to the bloody bloodshed, many of those later films; subtle and terrifying. She retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated examinations. How many movies do, indeed, can still be daunting even after someone has seen them before? Not much. Satisfaction is great in what is probably the definitive role of his career; Jamie Li Curtis, in her film debut, became a credible queen of screaming after she starred in The Night of Witches, as well as a few later paintings, and she is an intentional victim for whom she needs to endure. John Carpenter knows what he is doing in this movie, he uses the shadows and dark skies perfectly; Notice how most movies are set after a dusk. With this picture, he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created a franchise that produced seven sequences, many imitators and an upcoming "re-imagination". Speech by Loomis (Pleasence) describing Michael Miers sheriff (Charles Ciphers, a reliable player in several earlier works by Carpenter)? It is fantastic and worth the search. This is my favorite film of John Carpenter of all time. It's not completely unmistakable - there are holes for scripts, but overall it makes a solid impact. 9/10
