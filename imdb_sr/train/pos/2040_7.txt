CREEP is a real serious horror movie set up in real time that does not want anything more than just show people that they are attacked by a mutant on an empty underground platform for 85 minutes. And that's exactly what it does. Nothing more. Director Christopher Smith draws the drama as far as possible by introducing a series of characters who would actually have a reason to be in the subway after being locked. It also leaves the origin of the titular Creep intentionally unclear (it's about illegal experiments that take place in the underworld of the 60's) and this small part of the mystery works mostly. Unfortunately, it is undermined by the fact that it actually refrains from overturning in which more genetic malformations appear (and they are indicated). Yes, you heard me well - I wanted to finish the cliche! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is as good as a terrorized female preference and the rest of the actors are fine.
