It's a little easy. That is all. The graphics are pure and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but this is farewell. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are magnificent. Everything from talking to SFKS is pleasant and realistic. The angle of the camera is sometimes frustrated, but it is the same for every platform game, such as Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. /> I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997 and i Since then I obeyed 120 stars over 10 times.
