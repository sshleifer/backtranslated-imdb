Can such ambient production break down its primary goal, and is it proper to adjust Allend's novel? Obviously yes. Bille August managed to make a superficial, shallow film in which the basic elements of the South American mentality were presented simply as accompanying events, resulting in total imbalance. I can not believe there was an entire production team that could not understand the book! Of course, there is technical quality in this film and I think the actors did the best they had in their hands, but something is missing. And this is something most important.
