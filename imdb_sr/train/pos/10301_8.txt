Bruce Almighty, one of Carri's best paintings since ... well ... for a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I have seen for a long time ... Morgan Freeman plays well God, and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring, but over all the great movie with funny scenes. The best scene in which Jim dashed the voice of an anchored man. My Rating: 8/10
