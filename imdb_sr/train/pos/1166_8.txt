The ice and deadly assassin, Tony Arzenta (Alain Delon's divine acting and command performance) wants to leave the assassination job, but dangerous mobsters he does not allow for. After the murder of his wife and child, Arzenta announces the open season for all those responsible for death. Director Duccio Tessari connects the absorbing story with a constant fast pace, maintains a fairly serious and non-pointless tone throughout the stage, arouses exciting shootings and exciting car loves with a significant rip-erasing bruise, and a narrative with an explosive explosion of explosive bloody violence. Delon's lovely and charismatic presence adds an extra class to stunning procedures. This film additionally benefits the British actor, praising the valuable contributions of Richard Conte as the wise king of the mob, Nicka Gusta, Carla Gravini as friend Arzente, Sandra, Marc Porel as Arzentine's faithful friend Domenica Maggia, Anton Diffring as merciless, calculating capo Grunwald, and Lino Troisi as the poison gangster Rocco Cutitta. The great cinema of Silvan Ipolitia has several graceful vessels. The role of Gianni Ferrio hit the groove spot. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly in elegant parts. Better yet, there is no filling in to speak and even we get a decent gift of a delicious free naked nudity. A stunning conclusion combines a wicked and long run straight into the stomach. A good and solid winner.
