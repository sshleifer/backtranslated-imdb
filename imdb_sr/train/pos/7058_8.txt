Immediately after I saw the movie, the real magical feeling of Walt Disney movies appeared in me and I realized that he had seen real magic in the movie long ago. The combination of true music, speech and magical effects again brings Disney into your body. The very special things I've seen where the unknown effects in the film began with a disney's logo that transformed into the Cinderella Castle and ended up as an antique story of fairy tales and grandfathers. Magic has returned to me. I estimate this film 8 out of 10.
