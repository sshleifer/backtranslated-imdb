Wrapped in beautiful English lands, Emma is a delicious treat for enjoying dreamy departures. Emma (Gwineth Paltrow) is a gracious, intelligent young woman who just married her governess - and her trustee - in a marriage that Emma takes on merit in joining. Desiring to exploit her talent in arranging things for people around her, she decides to compare vicar, Alan Cummings with her beautiful young friend, Harriet (Tony Collette). The result is a series of mixed signals and erroneous interpretations that end, and Emma finds out that there is not so much control over events as she thought. The film is full of lenient and complicated Jane Austen curve characterization. Gwinneth Paltrow is at its best, describing this girl of a restrained, polite society with spirit and ease. Her growing romance with the incomparable Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is the heart of this film. G. Knightlei is one of the biggest romantic guiding people in films. He is incredibly handsome, in a modest, relaxed way that is overwhelming. He is certainly well-matched with Gwyneth Paltrow. Their charming friendship, which began when she was 16 years old, and she was also a newborn baby, blossomed as he, a family friend, met her in an older brotherly way that grew into something more. With a distorted look or underestimation at Emma, ​​Northam's Knightlei is delighted to watch. Other great features include the comic strip Juliet Stevenson, Gretu Scacchi, Evan McGregor, Polly Walker and a talkable anchor person, Miss Missing. Bates, who's very funny. It seems to be shorter and heavier than most adaptations by Jane Austin, Emma has a comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment.
