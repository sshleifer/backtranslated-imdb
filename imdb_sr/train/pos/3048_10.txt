demonicus was swinging, you guys have to figure out how hard it's shaken, unfortunately, the words that need to explain the volume of swing are not revealed. for a small idea, a pop like 50 hits from E, watch the death factory while on the phone with Jesus, wait, Jesus is on hold, you have telephone sex with Vill Smith on the primary line. Seriously, this movie ... so good. you need to watch it at least 4 times to capture all the subtlety ... well, not so much subtlety as the length of the movie, the 4 times, to consider why A people live on the full moon, live, and B, play. What is our world coming to?
