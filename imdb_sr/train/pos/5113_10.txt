This film was a classic. I should say that this movie has captured the best of a working man who learns about his mistakes. if we all could get along and learn the way everyone in this movie is. He had an important part to show that the family is an important part of life, and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find the "GREAT Throat" and swallow pride.
