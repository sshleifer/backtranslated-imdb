This is one of the most interesting, relaxing and beautifully made animated films I've ever seen. With wonderful music during film, sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie! This movie is not only great for children, but for adults as well. She teaches you lessons, as you never forget who you are, you can do everything you do, bravely and boldly. This movie can make you cry, which is always a good touch in movies. This movie is funny, sad, cute and keeps you on the edge of your place! Some movies really make you feel unclear after you see them, and the movie "Ghost" is definitely one of them! With my voice of 9/10 stars for animation, music and a wonderful idea for a movie, it gave me a lot of Spirit!
