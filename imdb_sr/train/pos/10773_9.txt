I would recommend this film to everyone. Not only for the fans of the rocker Luciano Ligabue, but also for all film lovers. Because it's sincere, mobile, fun and true. Because Ligabue is a born story teller and movie lover, and every one of his films is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and are asked to be loved. Because most Italian debut films are bad and this, made by an outsider, is a pleasure to watch and listen to. Because Stefano Accorsi is wonderful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who, like Freccia, was beautiful and talented and good and lost her life for heroin, which Ligabue shows as some kind of, uninteresting and ugly, without giving up easy morality. Because it is a movie that speaks to our heart, our ears, our souls. And because I lived with the experience of the FM radio, it was just that. Thank you, Luciano!
