I never thought that the old dash would cause tears in my eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I so wanted to see the first Casper cartoon called The Friendli Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, Good Good Boos To (1948) made me I break! I could not believe it was sad and tragic after seeing Casper's fox that she was killed! I've never seen anything similar in Casper's other cartoons! This is the most horrible of all! It was so depressing, I could not watch it again. It's like seeing Lassie dying at the end of the movie. I know it's a classic, but it's too much for us old cartoon lovers to cope with me! If I want to look something old and classic, I'd rather watch something happier and fun! But when I think about Casper cartoon, I mean my cats!
