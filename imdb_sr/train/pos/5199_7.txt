Not only is this a great African-American classic comedy, but also one of many great American cult classics. I recently bought a collection of Rudi Rai Moore. They no longer make such films. My entire family is film lovers, so this site is an extreme help in solving many debates. I am currently in Iraq. It helps me stay connected with the world I know in the countries. Thank you IMDb.I recommend this site to all my friends. Dolemite rules! Do not just take my word, check it out for yourself. Ten lines are a lot to comment on a movie, but if I get a point, I'm for it!
