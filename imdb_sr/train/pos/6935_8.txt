James Stewart plays a classic western story of a revenge that connects with the fate of other stars Vinchester Rifle. Stevart undoubtedly added some cold, heavy obsessions to his usual casual cowboy. The story follows the fate of Vinchester and its owners after our hero won the competition and was stolen by the man he hunted. We introduce a selection of gamblers, pistols, Indian retailers. and touring the banks as we follow the route through rifles through Indian battles, bank robberies, etc. Supporting actors are solid with Dan Durie, who stands out as Vaco Johnny Dean, a wired revolver with a finger that caused itching. Also, as a trivia, notice the early appearance of Rock Hudson as an Indian boss. The final calculation is a classical tense battle that has run on a great range in and around the rocky coast. Include some good old Western campaigns, first battles, shootings and horseback rides that will give you an incredible western adventure. 8/10
