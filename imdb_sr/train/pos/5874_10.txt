this move was friggin hilarious !!! The funniest I've seen for some time, akshai and john kick ass as always, and the girls are also hot. The story is terrible, many great jokes, and whoever has examined this before me is an idiot. I tell him that you are not an Indian origin, so you would not understand the humor in the moron. Do not judge the films you do not understand. what did you watch, the subtitle version where most of the joke is lost in translation? That's what I thought. Akshai Kumar is the best actor ever and once again proves his diversity, he can not only work, but also comedy, and is excellent. John proved to be good, that's his first comedy role and he was great at it.
