I watched him a few years ago. I remember it as a very mysterious situation, and a mixture of melancholy things, such as the fate of Dorothy and the personal future of Bogdanovich. I turn to watch my VHS copy and then I have reviewed it more and more. Today I am waiting for the DVD version, at any cost, please! Earth and easy listening to music is very well chosen from the first second, somewhat blond, but also happy. All characters are great to me, with funny situations, great acting and lots of dialogues that turned me into a cult film and a lot of people I met on the internet or at cinema clubs. This may not be a victim. I think the title of hope is about life! You need to be happy and laugh as much as possible I know this can be a special comment for a movie, but the fact is that I really like it, I think the film has tagged me and I will never forget it.
