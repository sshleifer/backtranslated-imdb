This film was one of the most entertaining films I've been watching for years, and the laughter of the audience members supports me. From my Great Greco Wedding (2002), laughter was spontaneous and intense. He is as easy as last year, Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) in the use of parody (espionage in Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex in Mi Super Ek-Girlfriend). John Reitman's directorial balance between comedy and drama, between crazy and extremely funny, is great. Never a shock and a dramatic serious crack do not make the comedy rule. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance. In a way, it's so obvious that it's great to see how it's going. Just like in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that you can not see it. It's easy for eight out of ten stars to rank there with Tootsie (1982). Probably nine (depends on how it appears in the second display).
