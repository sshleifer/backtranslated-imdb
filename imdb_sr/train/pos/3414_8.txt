This interesting documentary speaks of the incredible story of the expedition to the blind Tibetan children shaking the Himalayas; but also the conflict of personality between two exceptional nations. On the one hand, there is Erik Veihenmeier, the first blind man climbing Everest, and a team of (visionary) mountaineers who lead children. On the other hand, there is Sabriie Tenberken, a blind woman who leads the first school for blind Tibetans, who agrees with the expedition, but after that there are doubts about how she is progressing. At some level, Sabine simply does not understand the philosophy of a mountaineer (with an emphasis on summit); she is probably right when she identifies a mismatch between the hiking goals and the wishes of the children, but her certainty in her own righteousness makes her a hard person with whom she is sympathetic, especially because she has an effective veto. In the background of this (reasonably good) conflict, we get an insight into the lives of the children themselves. I enjoyed the film, although it brings a message that is clearly designed to be exciting - although it describes a quarrel in detail, the film somewhat reluctantly claims that all those in it are astounding. However, it is difficult to argue with this assessment, even if it is somewhat unusual to the viewer.
