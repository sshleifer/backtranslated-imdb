I thought Ice Age was a great movie! As a 30-year-old woman, without children, I seem to really enjoy these witty, witty animated films. Sid is the best character I've seen for a while, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really funny and I did not think his character could match or even win) and even more nasty than Melman in Madagascar. I saw a movie at least 15 times (obviously I own it) and I quote a movie at work (on several occasions ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part Sid says: "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to understand what the squirrels are trying to tell them about "tigers" ... "Pack of wolves, bear pack, pack of fleas, mustache packs, nose packs, pack of durm" packs of lies, troop of trouble, pack a blossom, pack a bird , a flying flying fish ... "or how it goes! It's the funniest part of the entire movie, although I really enjoyed the humor behind the" putting lazivas on the map "and many other parts. The only animated film that can be compared to the Ice Age is "Brother Bear".
