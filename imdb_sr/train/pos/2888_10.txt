Every child old enough to sit in front of the screen will be absolutely enchanted with beautiful pictures and beautiful music in this sincere and witty rewriting of the Grimm fairy tale. They will sing 'Bibbiti-Bobbiti-Boo' before they even can formulate a complete sentence and continue to sing until they die. It's a classic for all children, especially those adults who are young at heart.
