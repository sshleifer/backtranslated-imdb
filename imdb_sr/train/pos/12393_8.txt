For those who were interested in knowing how true humanity came to the great red pods that make me eager for the nakedness, there is a duo of "Other Renaissance" short trousers. I'm not sure why they are divided into two parts, especially because they are attributed as one on a DVD (and are these short films seen in any other format other than DVD?), But they are informative even if they have A few voids. What really makes this first part highlights, from the second part and other animations, also parallels that emerge between the rise of robots and civil rights. Graphic affections for slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the March million man and the human complex of God. In fact, "God" is never really mentioned by these short films, instead of being replaced by "Man's Image". As for the short pants in the collection, "The Second Renaissance: The First Part" is far more effective in expressing emotions. Distressed and disturbing look at the potential of mankind to become "the architect of his own destruction." Some of these concepts can be excluded from this short rhythm directly from the previously established science fiction literature, but again, this is basically what most Matrix series did, and that was the driving force behind its success. > <br /> - PolarDiB
