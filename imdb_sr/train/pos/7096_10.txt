I had the privilege to watch this movie for a review a few years ago, and outside the theatrical performance I was faced with a cameraman from a local TV station who asked for comments on the film. At that time, the only words that came out of my mouth were: "Great, just terrible." I like to think that I can articulate a bit better than that, but at the time I was somewhat incapable of doing it. principals. This film was the first one that Terri Gilliam had indicated that he did not have a share in the writing. Returning to Universe after his long, arduous battle with them over "Brazil," Terri achieved what he wanted most; the last cut. "Terry is a master craftsman, and every shot is like a beautifully conceived image that has been carefully designed and convinced. It is only justice that such an individual is unhappy in his attempts to convey the concept. Unfortunately, such arrangements still contain limitations. The DVD's universal collector edition of this movie is simply amazing, although most bonus options are not listed on the box. It includes, among other things, a sound comment by the director / producer and an informative and extremely interesting 90-minute documentary c about filming a movie called "Hamster Factor and Other Stories of 12 Monkeys." She talks about some of the creative pitfalls in the movie, including the enthusiasm test when the screenings are badly tested, guessing the team with a sense of suspicion of self and despair. All of us, decided to change the film a little and let it have a huge success. <br />
