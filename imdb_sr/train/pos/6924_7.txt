This complicated western was a milestone in the career of JAMES STEVART after returning from the war service, seeking to change his image by making Westerners, which is largely considered the reason for Westerna's influx in the 1950s because he is very impressive. Too bad it was not filmed in Technicolor. Stevart won the first prize for a "pistol that won the West," but then he must spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when stolen. SHELLEI VINTERS is a suspicious girl with an unpleasant reputation and STEPHEN McNALLI is a local attacker of a bad boy in Dodge Citia. VILL GEER is Viatt Earp and DAN DURIEA is Shelley's bad guy. And would not you know that Universal-International, TONI CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both pretty much unknown at that time) have important roles. An interesting sequence is the first Indian attack, with CHARLES DRAKE discovering that the coward is leaving, leaving Shelley alone in a horse wagon. Later it is being redeemed, but it is just one of the plants that the pistol goes from one unpleasant hand to another - but finally ends up with the right owner. STEPHEN McNALLI and JAMES STEVART have a pretty final shot that is almost as melodramatic (but not completely) as the DUEL IN SUN final. McNalli makes a perfect criminal, and DAN DURIEA is equally treacherous in the type of criminal role he played during the 40's as a low shooter. It's fun to see ROCK HUDSON (attributed to Ioung Bull) in Indian warfare and TONI CURTIS as a young soldier casting eager looks at the then slender and attractive Shellei Vinters. Worth to look and certainly above average stories.
