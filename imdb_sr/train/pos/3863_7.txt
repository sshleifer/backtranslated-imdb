This is an interesting series that takes people from real life (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes part of their true story with the continuing character of the series that takes part in this story. Matt Clark Detective - takes on the role of finding well-known exorcists from the Old West in stories that are at least partly based on genuine accounts. In this sense, it's almost an anthological series, and as someone else pointed out, this strange structure is a time conflict with real events, but it's a fun series with lots of action to satisfy a hungry crowd in 1950, another 55 years later . Clark casts a powerful personality in his western equipment while confronting some of the most horrified criminals in history. And his girlfriend Frankie's a good dish. If you are a fan from the West, be sure to check it if you have a chance.
