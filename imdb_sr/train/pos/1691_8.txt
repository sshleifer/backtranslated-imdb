This film is funny and suitable for any age. It's definitely a family game type. Actors do a good job by playing people in the middle western city of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we must assume that nothing never happens, because the excitement (pre-invasion) of a decade is the new (and only) outbound ramp from the Interstate. The location likes to be suitable boring and completely incredible for invading Martians on the ground. But these Martians are completely incapacitated, despite being well equipped with an arsenal of perfectly terrible and deadly weapons ... including one set to eradicate Martians! Martians calm their lines and throw real accents in order for the viewers and local people to help us ... to leave the country. J. J. Anderson plays a very young carnival duck, Halloween, only has great lines. See this movie for laughter and fun; provoking thought is not. But it's subtle and cozy.
