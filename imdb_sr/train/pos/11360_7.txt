Chris Gerolmo made sure that we simply did not give Jack-the-stripper a list of killed people: he got into psychological characterization with convincing results. Probably mainly due to the excellent performance by Stephen Rea who played against Donald Sutherland with good empathy. That was playing these two? above all ?? which made the film more than a morbid display of Rostov's history in the butcher. Supporting actors, especially Mak von Sidov, performed very well their parts. Good directing. And the photo was good. Needless to say, the fact that the film taken in Hungary had to produce several deviations, but, frankly, given the depth of storytelling and interpretation, we can completely forget these small trivia. Once made for a TV movie from HBO came to the trump card. It is recommended, especially if you like to analyze features and forget some morbid scenes? which, I am grateful to add, are never exaggerated.
