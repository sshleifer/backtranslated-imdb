In prison, four prisoners occupy a cell: Carrere (Gerald Laroche), who used her company to commit fraud and was issued by his wife; Drag Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protégé, retarded Pakuerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate a six-month-old sister; and intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrere finds an ancient diary hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and that it was a black magic. They decide to read and use his content to escape from prison when they find the truth about Danver's fate. "Malefikue" is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic French horror movie. The story is practically on the same site, there are no clichés and attracts the audience's attention to the last scene. I am a great fan of French cinema, usually romance, drama and police stories, but I noticed that I recently saw some good French horror films, such as "Un Jeu d Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End". My voice is seven. Title (Brazil): "Sinais to Mal" ("Signs of Evil")
