This show is unlikely to appeal to everyone. Sara does what she wants; she does not seek permission and does not apologize. This is a zombie sitcom, robot dinosaurs, flying cars and a team of male thieves thieves. The star of the show is not a hero, it is a spoiled, intolerable pervert. If you can not appreciate the unusual humor it offers, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give a chance to this show. Comes with the comic style Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (Comedy Comedians), Jai Johnstona (Mr Shov), Steve Agee ('Stai') and the creative energy of Rob Schraub and Dana Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, House of Monsters also shows the best talents of burgeoning online community, channel101.com. (If you are involved in this show, watch out for the "Odds Admissible Media" on vh1 in March of this year, this will be a drawing from the same group of talents.) Watch the show Sarah Silverman. This kind of thing is the future of fun.
