Partially, from the perceived need, it is felt to include a conventional love story into a plot to make the film more accessible to the 1950s movie audience. The film begins with some strangely funny features of higher-class bureaucrats run by the foreign ministry - the British are embarrassed in a way that only the British can suicide. But after that, the film loses its course on a conventional pharcyic plot. Terri-Thomas can be tracked as always, but the great talent in the acting team (Peter Sellers and associates) is largely futile. Redirecting, but not excellent film.
