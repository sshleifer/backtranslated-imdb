This Italian-French remake of the same name from 1946 suddenly increases the heat and does not allow us to get into the air. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can not shift from a mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenomenon Maru≈°a Detmers) who lives in the neighborhood of the school. One day he follows, and his persistence pays off. There is only one problem: she is engaged with a sketchy figure (Riccardo De Torrebruna) who could or did not commit a horrible crime, and if he repents, he will probably be fired by a slap on his hand. Also, a young woman is a bit "fun in the head", and this is confirmed when we found out that she saw her boyfriend's father, who is a psychiatrist. Julia's emotional instability only equals her immense sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, word-of-mouth, with handsome leaders and performance of the Detmers bomb, which plays us as io-io (and a boy) from scene to scene, with enough uncertainty to guess all the way - and even after - end. Available in versions R and Ks (!).
