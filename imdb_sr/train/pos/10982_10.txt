I discovered that Grey Garden was a captivating movie, an incredibly intimate look at too many eccentricities that basically have the right idea: forget society and live in a house without heating and a huge litter of cats and raccoons, convinced of their own interests pretty <br /> <br / > all the while playing in the camera. Great Edie and Little Edie are two crazy ones who are Mazle Bros. They decided to document. They look like characters from Fellini's film, only an alien, if that makes sense. Old Edie is almost totally attached to the bed, a bunch of paper, clothes and dirty dishes grow around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She prances around the house, always wearing baboushka-like Head around her head, completely covering her hair. We never see her hair during the entire film, nor will we ever get the advice that she still has a lot. However, at the age of fifty eight, she is still beautiful and full of life. In Graya Gardens, we have the feeling that both of these women are <br /> <. lives have become much smaller than they used to be. Little Edie is probably the saddest of these two. While her mother, in her earlier years, married, made a family, lived luxuriously, and even recorded some footage (the scene in which she, at the age of 77, sang <<br /> along with the video "Tea for Two", which made for decades, one of the best movie scenes, Edie left her career as thought-out as a Model to take care of her sick mother. At 58, she still longed for her to find her Prince. If anything is small, Edie is still a girl, full of dreams about glamor and fame, and domestic and romantic bliss that you still need The most important thing in the movie include the opening moments, where Edie explains her camera clothes, the "tea for two" sequence, birthday party, the top argument, the store delivers a scene, and the scene on the attic.The whole thing is incredibly sincere and unknown. Since it's all real. I suggest to see Grey Gardens in the background with Kenneth <br /> < br /> Anger short Puce Moment. The DVD criterion is $ 35.00, but worth every penny.
