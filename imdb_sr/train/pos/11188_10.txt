I'm a big fan of Stephen King, and this film has made me even bigger King's fan. Five Sematars is about the Creed family. They just moved into a new house and look happy. But behind their house is a cemetery for pets. The new neighbor of Creed Jud (played by Fred Gwyn) explains the cemetery behind the cemetery for pets. This graveyard is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when a human being (or any kind of pet) buries in a cemetery, they will return to life. The only problem is that when they return, they are NOT the same person, they are evil. Soon after Jud explains everything about the Five Sematars, everything begins to go to hell. I will no longer explain, because I do not want to share some of the main parts of the film. The play that the Five Sematars was pretty good, but it took a little bit of work. The story was one of the main parts of this film, mostly because it was so original and appealing. This film contains a variety of makeup effects that make the film more spooky and frightening. One of the most basic reasons for this film to send the winter on the back, in fact, was the effects of makeup. In this film there is one character that is really weird. This character is "Zelda". This particular character appears in the movie about three times to be precise. Zelda is sister Rachel Creed, who died many years ago, but Rachel is still persecuted. The first time Zelda appears in the movie is not scary at all, because he does not speak or something else, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the other one is afraid of me living ****. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it's almost perfect. Five Sematars delivers great fears, some pretty good acting, first-class action and enchanting makeup. This is really one of the most popular horror films of all time. 10 of 10
