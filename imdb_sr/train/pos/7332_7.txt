I watched the clips of this as a kid, but as I bought the Blue Underground set right now because the Limited Edition, I just fitted it into my viewing schedule now - and this is mainly because Bakshi's American POP (1981) just appeared in late Italian Television (see my review of this movie below)! In any case, I found that the movie was pretty good with a sword and a wizard animated epic with particularly impressive backgrounds (pretty casual rotoscopic characters were, however, less) with excitement if it was a derivative score. The plot, on the other hand, was not very genuine, but proved to be indisputably engaged at the level of the minor, and the leading figures were sufficiently developed - especially the negative Ledenik Nekron and the enigmatic warrior Darkwolf; hero and heroine are, however, fairly rude stereotypes - but it is difficult to regret when Bakshi and Frazeta show a girl who is well-endowed (her bra can be cut off at any time) and half naked to get up (her tiny panties are gone forever ass!) However, it is obvious that this is an action and it certainly brings on this front (Darkvolf was particularly wild); The final calculation, although short, is also well processed and sees our heroes as paternoctails attacking the lair of villains in the cave. This film for me is now his nostalgic factor because he returned me to the days of his childhood watching not only films such as CONAN BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982), but also animated TV series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and HE-MAN AND MASTERS OF UNIVERSE (1983-85). In regard to the accompanying MAKING OF "FIRE AND ICE" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: Vintage features on the sword and magic animated film which is only available through the RDS Vapor Printed Ralph Bakshi! She deals with details of the rotoscopic technique and also shows several examples of "performances" (in the studio) of live parts in the scenario segment - which will then be followed, blended into the background and recorded. Still, looking at several such stunt films about art animation (for example, Disnei Tins and Loonei Tunes), this does not mean that this is a very striking thing ...
