As a popular sport, surfing loved many people. Immediately after watching the documentary, I realized how dangerous it was. In fact, the surfers were afraid of great waves. Even someone was killed. But they still surfed and enjoyed. Only brave people can do it. According to what the surfers say, we can clearly know what they felt when a great wave came. You have to adapt to your best and avoid a direct blow from a great wave. When you conquer it, it will obviously bring you great satisfaction. Amazing cinema can not be overlooked. It is absolutely visual pleasure. Excellent sports documentary. 8/10
