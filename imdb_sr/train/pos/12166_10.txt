A very strange and tempting movie. It's a very awkward and firmly wounded man who is trying to manage his life as a fundraiser / doorkeeper. The director was able to catch a very disturbing tone that served the story well. Original and disturbing, and at the same time finds a great amount of humor in the pain accompanying life. There is one sequence in a testing facility that really stands out and it makes me laugh out loud that it's not something I do as long as it takes. One of the most beautiful movies I've seen for a long time. I did not leave my mind and I look forward to the future efforts of Bronstein. Fantastic performances all around. Simple line "I really appreciate that." is now an icon for me.
