Successful self-styled businessman Harri Mitchell (top actor Roia Scheider) has an adulterer, cute sexy young stripper Cina (beautiful Kelly Preston). Harry has blackmailed three modest low-life hoods - the pornographic theater manager Raimi (superbly slippered John Glover), the antsi strip owner Leo (played well by Robert Trebor) and crazy pimp Bobbi Shi (terribly intense Clarence Villiams III) - who recorded his affair with It makes. When Harry refuses to pay, the hoods kill Cina and make it seem like Harry did it. This in turn fights a dangerous battle of wit and will between Harry and the hood. The director John Frankenheimer, adopting a tough script based on the novel of the crime thriller Elmore Leonard, professionally maintains a constant strong rhythm, provides enough tension and effectively creates a striking atmosphere. The guides are equally excellent, with Ann-Margret, while Harry's bitterly despised wife Barbara, Vanity as a drunken prostitute Doreen, and Lonnie Chapman as Harry's loyal business partner Jim O'Boyle. A solid shop does not keep the viewers on their toes. The wicked profane dialogue, the brilliant cinema Jost Vacan, the exciting Gary Chang's, the sharp amorous tone and the exciting conclusion are also on the money. As an extra bonus, Vanity and Preston are being removed. A very strong and satisfying small number that is worth checking out.
