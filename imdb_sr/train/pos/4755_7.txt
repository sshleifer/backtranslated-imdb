A bus full of passengers was stuck during a snowstorm. The police closed the bridge - saying it was uncertain and that they were stuck in a small cafe until the road was cleared. However, after a while, their boredom is so disturbed that it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and can only be an alien !! This leads to the conclusion that this is ironic, but also quite fun in low forms. This is another fun episode of Twilight Zone. Instead of typical reversals or social commentary, this does not contain a permanent message. However, it is also very visible, so who cares ?! Just what's going on you'll have to see yourself. By the way, this star is John Hoit - the face that most of you will recognize from countless old TV shows and movies. Almost in any case, he played a real grouch (like Charles Lane during the same period), but the boy liked to see him - how he perfected a mournful person and was a little funny at the same time.
