This film is another horror anthology. It's pretty good, but it could have been a bit more to use. I compile it with the "Terror Doctor's Home of Terror", although it fits in this title. It has four floors, which are some houses connected. The first story is that the writer and his wife are moving. He creates a killer for his latest novel, and then begins to see the killer in his house. This species is predictable, but in the end throws several plants. The next story is a little unpredictable, and you really do not know where that's happening. This is Peter Cushing and he was probably my favorite. This type buys a house, but it's not a house that is in the center of attention, but rather a weird wax museum. The third story starts pretty well and contains Kristofer Liy. He has him as a pretty bizarre father who looks terribly protective to his daughter. The problem is that once you know what's happening, the story does not end soon enough. Takes a little, which leads to a very predictable conclusion. Then the last story relates to an actor who buys a coat from a strange little shop. The actor really gets what he paid. Then, there is a small story about a policeman who was seen during an attempt to find out what happened to the actor, and then explain why these things happened. Although I was not very pleased with the explanation, I do not think that explains Cushing's story at all. I think they needed more stories for that. All in all, it was an interesting story.
