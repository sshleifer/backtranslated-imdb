I really enjoyed this movie. Humor was sometimes absent, but I enjoyed how the story was moving between the dramatic and the serious course of the entire film. This is the only other film in which I watched Verdone (the second was 'Un sacco bello'), and I see why the Italians got tired, but he thinks he played his role as a loving father. My only drawback to this film was that I knew it happened in Italy - somewhere in the center or in the south, I guess, but I felt like there was no room for the show. This film could be held in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Delhi ... I always think it's important that movies have a place where viewers can connect. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, I think you will enjoy this. It's not Fellini or Rossellini - it's not realism or neo-realism. It's a comic story with serious moments that could really happen to any of us.
