I found 'Time At The Top' a fun and stimulating experience. The act, although generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. As a film that is obviously focused on younger demographics, it is certainly one of the better works in the genre (Children's Science Film). Normally, I would say that Canada, Great Britain and Australia produce the best movies and television shows for children, and 'Time At The Top' does nothing to reject this theory! I think that continuity and great acting are not important for younger people. A good plot and imaginative script for them are more important. Both films are abundant. Special effects are good, not diminishing from the story, or closing the viewers from their own imagination. It would be very easy to get an overload of SFKS into this movie, but it would completely destroy its entire "Raison D'etre". Adjustments and operation of the cameras are of a very high standard in this film, complementing fine wardrobe and historical precision. All in all, this film is very satisfying and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through children's eyes, or those who try, like me! Now, I need to read the original book as soon as possible.
