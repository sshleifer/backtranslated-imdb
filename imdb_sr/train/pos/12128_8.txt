The first time I saw "Of Human Bondage" a few days ago and VOV! What a mysterious and almost obscene film. I loved how music goes along with every step of Phil's feet. He gave me a fever for some reason ... One of the biggest aspects of this movie is to see Bette Davis getting in front of your eyes. She is brilliant, not necessarily because this is her best work, but because it was so unusual to be so wicked, big and steadfast as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was a risky person, always wanting to be different It's true when she began to realize that she could be so nasty and bold as she wanted and people would love her for it. If you are a true movie lover, it's amazing to see ... Just had a way to deliver a line that made a role, and the film belongs to her in that case. Like "Mass of music and fire. It's me ... old kazoo and some sprinklers" or "But you are Blanche, you're in that chair!" or "WITH ALL MY HEART, I WANT THE MAN WHO HAS KILLED !!" ... These are from several of her films, but you get my enthusiasm. She was so brave, daring and exotic about these beautiful big eyes. After I've seen this, I can not believe that it has been redecorated twice ... Leslie Howard was beautiful ... so calm and persistent, that he should be loved. I thought he was wonderful and he could not understand how not everyone was falling on him, but again, everyone was ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... The only thing that I did not like was something that was common with writing in early movies. They would make such a disgusting character that it is almost unbelievable that someone would fall in love with them at all. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would never have been interested in Mildred. It's just a simple truth ... See!
