I love this movie. It's one of those that I can constantly watch. Good actor was a good actor who does not try to be a star. The premise of a new widowed housewife who is turning to sell pots to put an end to an Americanized piece of a single movie or action thriller. Or the film would have completely killed. The film appears as a comedy Ealing with a brilliant factor that feels well. Worth watching only for the scene of two old ladies and a corn cereal box ... (it's not a spoiler!)
