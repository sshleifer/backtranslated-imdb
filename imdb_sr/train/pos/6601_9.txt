This film is absolutely stunning. New Blade Runner - future noir in the clearest way. The vision of Paris is remarkable, recognizable and visionary, with wide visions, grunted pieces and futuristic virtual reality. about the film. It's a visual delicacy. Made in 3D and shown in black and white (without gray tones!) with just one short color, it's less difficult to see than it sounds. There are many "arti" camera shots - big plans and unusual views - but it only increases the temperament of the film. All in all, you get the impression of a graphic novel in the form of footage. At first, I had the impression that the film was rotoscopic, such as the level of animation and high detail in the face expression. But unlike the "A Scanner Darkly" - which suffers from (or really intensifies) inconsistent character definitions (just watch some hair change shape!) - The Renaissance is consistent and precise throughout the entire period. When the figure is in close-up, you can see the added details and textures, but when in the middle of the image or more, details are omitted, but not at the expense of character definition. For me, the only side of the movie is that in one comment we were told that this is a one-time project. It's a pity, because I would like to see more of this futuristic film noir story, especially in this top-notch graphic style. Oh, and English dub is also excellent. All in all, a great movie and it is recommended.
