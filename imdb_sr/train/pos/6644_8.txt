After many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons noticed the 1979 book "The House Nekt Door". The result is a bit of a novel that, especially in the first story of a trilogy, is understandable if it is dissatisfied because it is a TV movie, which is absorbing and actually very good, not just as great as a book, one of Stephen. King's favorites and one of mine. With more running time and fewer restrictions such as theater play, all the wealth inherent to the original three-part story of an evil ultramodern house could be explored and neglected, especially the climatic discovery near the very end. However, the entire acting setting goes well in this thoughtful story of meaningless malice. There are several unnecessary cheap shocks, but the growing atmosphere of fear is well developed. In fact, one of the most exciting scenes includes the abstract painting of a house by an amateur-amateur neighbor who is trying to visualize his corruption on the canvas. Surely read the great novel.
