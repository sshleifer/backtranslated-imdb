This is an oriental fantasy of "thousands and one Arab night," incredible adventure, sorcery and sorcery. Maligni Vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidta) with powerful magic faculties closes Prince Ahamad from Baghdad (attractive John Justin) who loses his throne and then escapes thanks to a small thief named Abu (fond Saba). They arrive in Basra where Ahamad and Princess (the magnificent Jun Duprez) fall in love. But the prince and thief were persecuted by the Jaffa, Ahamd became blind, and Abu became a dog. The story gathers several fantastic ingredients such as the transformation of the acting, a flying mechanical horse, a magic bow, a flying carpet and, of course, a colossal genius (exaggerated by Rek Ingram) that gives three wishes to Sabuu, the magic eye, the goddess Kali with several hands others. This extraordinary image is ranked in one of the best fantastic movies of all time. Produced by London's Alexander Cordeau and the director definitely attributed to Ludwig Berger, Michael Povell and Tim Vhelan with the stunning scripts of Liais Bureau and Miles Malleson, and the dialogue writer and actor as Sultan likes mechanical games. The beginning of the Second World War caused a paralyzing shootout, then three Corda brothers and associates traveled to the United States and continued shooting there in a special movie Grand Cannon Colorado. Menzies and Vincent Korda, Cinematographs by George Perinal and Special effects would be Osmond Borradaile although they are dated today and urgent remastering is required because the colors are worn out. In addition, one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score of Miklos Rosse. This colorful story with enormous amounts of imagination likes fans of fantasy and movie classic lovers
