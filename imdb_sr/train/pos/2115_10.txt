After I saw I Got Mail and disappointed, I decided to look at the original film that inspired this, The Shop Around the Corner. I was amazed with this film. It's a real gem and from now on one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful that if you have not seen it, I want to encourage you to see it today. I am not against re-made, and sometimes I like the new version more than original, but this time I must admit that Got Mail is a bad adaptation of this classic. Do not miss this, go to your video store and rent a store around the corner today!
