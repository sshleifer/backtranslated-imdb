I was watching Ice Age at the cinema and I loved the movie. Despite the fact that the 'Ice Age' has many drawbacks and scientific errors, such as people, swords, dinosaurs and mammoths that live in the same period, and even the place where the story passes (it looks like North America but has some characteristics from Iceland) example) we can have fun even so. (unless you are very strict!) The planet enters ICE AGE, and many animals move to the south where it is warmer. Sid is a stupid idleness left by his family, who can no longer bear it. Walking on his way, he sees Manfred, or what he calls "Manny" a strange mammoth who does not care for extinction or immigration and goes north. Concerned that he can easily catch him, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the middle of their journey they have found a human mother with their baby. Mother dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to take it and return the baby to people. Diego, one of the swordsmen, decides to follow them and help them get to the shortcut to the human camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know is that Diego is a sniper clown who hates people and wants to kill a baby, and also pretends to betray both of them in order to make them become sweets. What will happen depends on Diego's behavior and conscience ... aka "Era do Gelo" - Brazil
