If you like adult comics, such as South Park, then this is almost the same format for the little adventures of three teenagers at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina gave explosive sweets and behaved like bats, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories with school teachers. There is an idiot director, Mr. Bip, nervous math teacher and many others. The acting is also fantastic, Lenin Henry is Gina Iashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Traci-Ann Oberman, Smack Pony Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers Mark Perry and Blunder Nina Conti. I did not know that this came from Canada, but it's very good. Very good!
