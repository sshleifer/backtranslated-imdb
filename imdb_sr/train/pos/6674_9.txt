The first thing I thought after watching "Mystery Men" was how could this film be so unpopular? I thought this film was so wonderful and fun that the status of the bomb was defiant in the logic. I hope that in the future it will become a cult hit, and you can count me among your fans. Simply put, and without too much, this movie makes for comics what the Princess Bride "did for fairy tales and" Who laid Roger Rabbit? "for classic caricatures, which should give you a more accurate idea of ​​the film's tone, but the marketing board is unfortunately signed (this is one of those cases, such as" Iron Giant "in which the studio had no idea what's on its hands). next time you're in the mood for something a little unusual. You will not listen to BeeGees again in the same light.
