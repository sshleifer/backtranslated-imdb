Is it a good idea to use live animals for exhibitions at department stores? No, and here's why .... In "Hare Conditioned" sales that Bugs help promotion is completed and the director of the store (Nelson) shifts it to the new department: takidermi. Natural, Bugs and Fun begins. By using almost every department in the store (children's clothes, sports, shoes, costumes, women's nightgowns - do not ask.), Bugs goes to the top every step, even when it comes to a manager like "Big GilderSNEEZE ". Even when trapped in an elevator, Bugs makes the best situation. Director Jones is at the top of his pictorials as always, as Blanc (like Bugs, Natch) and Nelson (the manager - who sounds like the Gildersleeves radio station - ask your grandmother and your parents). Check her ears. Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner", the best argument for animal welfare laws.
