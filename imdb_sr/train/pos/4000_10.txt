Vov. I saw this last night and I was still withdrawing from what was good. Every character felt so real (though most of them were small, selfish ** holes), and a bizarre story - a middle-aged widow began to catch the stupid boy of his daughter - she felt quite convincing. Top performances of all circles, but hats Anne Reid and Our Friends in the North, Daniel Craig (the other came as the next David Thevlis). And director Roger Michell? This is far from Notting Hill as possible. Thank God. See this movie !!!
