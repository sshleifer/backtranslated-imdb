Dirty Sanchez is the extreme, British version of Jackass in which four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joicei and Pancho) go to great powers to hurt and humiliate. The reason that this show is better than Jackass is that most stuntmen are not planned, which makes the reaction even more entertaining. There are 3 series of shows, the first to watch them around and watch their lives for a long time, e.g. there is an episode about their love lives, jobs, etc. The second series sends boys to try different occupations. The third follows their European tour. Boys seem to be getting brighter as the series continues. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but believe me when I say, if you have a stomach a week, do not look at it, as you are gently seeing a lot of blood and vomiting in each episode.
