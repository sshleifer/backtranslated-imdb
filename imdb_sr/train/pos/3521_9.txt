Other reviewers have taken a good picture of this film noir. I just wanted to add "Wow!" Comment by one reviewer about Elise's hip, apparently broadcast on drums. I must say this was incredible. Cook deserved praise for his frenzied performance. Little bit of the things I think about: Cook appeared as a waiter in Barbara Stanvick from 1941, Ball of Fire. He was a waitress at a nightclub where Barbara sang, and the legendary drummer Gene Krupa was drummer, the most energetic. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's insights into the drummer in a later film, "The Fantomatic Lady", was very inspired by Krupa's work, what is Cook testifying about three years earlier? If you are looking at Krupa in the "Ball of Fire", I think you will notice some clearly similar movements of the body. We hope, of course, that HE was not under the influence of any drugs at the time!
