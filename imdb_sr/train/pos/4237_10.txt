Charlotte Heston wore one, James Franciscus wore one, but Mark Wahlberg decided not to put on a traditional fabric. I hope no one throws him like Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 films of the Planet, but Estrella Varren barely shows her neckline - her hair is always on the way. Tim Burton could separate this saga and see adults in the audience. Even pure Helena Bonham Carter never comes out of bones that look like a big curtain. She is cute, but all love things are limited to an anxiety look and a little kiss at the end. As in artificial intelligence that talks about cross-sectoral sex between robots and humans, but never delivers - Planet Monkey suggests interethnic romance between humans and monkeys, but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only monkey to dare to be sexy. This film features three great actors Tim Roth, Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti, who chew the landscape as a trio of monkeys and they are entertaining to watch. Top make-ups (certain Oscar) costumes, sets, music make this hit summer film from 2001.
