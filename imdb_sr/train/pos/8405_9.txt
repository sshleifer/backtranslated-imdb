I am proud to say that I have an uncut copy of this elective piece of the Crovn International series on DVD. It's a really stupid and ungainful move with a pleasant atmosphere. It is an attempt to sincerely say that true love and friendship are more important in life than a cold set of wheels and a quick tail. Of course, this is essentially an obvious adolescent male fantasy painting - the main teenager Bobby Hamilton gets girls, the respect of his friends and the chance to show local van-runners - but it's too stupid and bold to hate. Stuart Getz as our stupid protagonist makes a dear lead, Debora Vhite as the main subject of Getz's love is a definitive cutie, Connie Lisa Marie is also pretty cute as a beautiful blonde baby and nonbelieving Stephan Oliver (bicycle movie perennial) is beautifully hateful as brutal Dugan Hicks . In particular, Danny DeVito is an absolute rebellion when Getz is a throbbing boss of the owner of the auto-wash Andy, a kindly fearless unmanner who wears very ugly loud Hawaiian shirts and suffers from heavy gambling habits. Especially I love a scene in which two bandits brutally hit Danny - one is holding his hands behind his back while another guy working over Danny's torso! Sammi Johns' bumblebeat an attractive thematic song that will appear will jump around your skull for at least a week. In short, it's great groove retro-70 gamers!
