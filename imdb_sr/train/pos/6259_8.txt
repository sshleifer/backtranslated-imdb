In fact, I am bitter about the comments I read, stating that this film is "boring" and that the beautiful landscape was distorted by black and white footage. It was made in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely incredible for the time! The journey through which these people had to pass was extremely unusual. It took them only a week to cross the river. Women wore their children in heavy wooden cribs on their backs climbing on a solid rock, sometimes struggling in the snow. I'd like to see that anyone does it now! I thought it was a wonderful movie with some truly incredible footage and incredible story.
