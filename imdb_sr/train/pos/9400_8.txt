If a man in a white suit was in America, can not you see Danny Kaie or Jerry Levis trying on the size of Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton? This is one of the best in Alec Ginis movies and certainly one of the best Ealing Studios in the UK ever dropped. It fits perfectly into the timeline of the new Labor government and the society it was trying to build. It is astounding how capital and labor can be agreed upon during the crisis. Alec Guinness, this little little man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothes that will never need cleaning, which actually refuses. all kinds of foreign matter at the moment it touches the clothes. He is a persistent dick and thrives. Of course, the implications are not really thought up about the type of impact that clothing has on society. In the end, everyone is being persecuted as if they were fugitives, almost like Peter Lorre of M or Orson Welles at The Stranger or even Robert Nevton in Oliver Twist. It is a sign of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation such as this chase, as described in some of the serious films I have mentioned, can play for laughter. The poor Guinness suit is not just white and reflects the stain, but shines like a neon sign. Apart from Guinness, the best performances are from Cecil Parker as another pompous nonsense, Joan Greenvood as his daughter siren and Ernest Thesiger the largest clothing manufacturer in the UK> <br /> <br /> I think if Paramount borrowed that suit from Ealing and was it given by John Travolti for the fever of Saturday night?
