I went to this film at the acting and representative fair because a friend of mine, a producer of the film, called me. Forget what you saw in commercials, forget what you've heard, watch this movie for yourself. I was more than surprised. In the world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, The 6th Dai, Unbreakable, comes a movie worth your hard earned money! Famous scenes, wonderful cinema and an actor who want to eat with your heart. I found this one of the most organized movie films and for a reason. Robert Deniro deserves oscillation. If you could give oscar to anyone involved as a package, it would be a movie.
