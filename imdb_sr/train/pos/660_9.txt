9 / 10-30 minutes of pure festive terror. Okay, it's not that bad. But it's definitely fun. Guardian Crypts (John Kasir) tells the story of the FEAR holiday, giving us all the Christmas goose ... GosseBUMPS That's it. Bvahahahahha. You really should be careful about what you are AKS Santa. Have a terrific Christmas and a happy new fear. Okay, in a story, a greedy woman (the best scout in the world, Marie Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bel, a trainer who gets a towel that is killed to death). in ANOES 2) for money. OR, her plan was ruined when a crazy killer dressed in Santa suit (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) came in his way. If you look at it on iouTube, you can watch it for free, but most of you have already seen this (my third viewing). But if you did not see him, I suggest to you.
