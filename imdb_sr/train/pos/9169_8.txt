Timothy Dalton really liked me, although he was a little young and handsome for Mr. R., but I thought Zelah Clarke was too full and short. However, this version was very true for the novel and was very well recorded. I've seen 4 versions, Orson Velles is still my favorite g. R, although George C Scott was very good, and it was a coup between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah Iork, although both were a little too old for that role. Recently I saw a great TV version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emily Fox. I'd like to see those two people, Jane Eire. While watching the version of Ciarin Hinds, I think I was Jane Eired, but I will never get tired of the first few minutes when I heard Joan Fontaine's voice opening the first version I've ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
