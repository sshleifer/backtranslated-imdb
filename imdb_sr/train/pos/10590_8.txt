This series was a cut in relation to the rest of the television detective series of the day, but somehow it did not find the audience. The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be completely new, but she added a lot of things to do. And who could forget the Pax, the beautiful dog guide in the series! While stories may not have been better than average series, settings, in Nev-Orleans, starring and music (note the commentary on the music party in other comments ... I remember it's clear) everyone works how a good TV series would be even better! So you never know ... one day Paramount could just dig into your archives and post them on DVD!
