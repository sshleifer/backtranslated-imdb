Fooling a starring star that is so impressive that she looks like "Mad Mad Mad Mad Vorld" from horror images, "The Sentinel" (1977) is an effective creepy movie that focuses on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines. In this, she plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, who moves into the brown lavender of Brooklyn Heights, which (and I do not think I give up too late on this late date), very close to the Hell Gate. And as a tenant in this building, she suffers much worse conditions from leaking waterworks and occasional water insects, to put it mildly! Indeed, the scene that Alison meets with her noisy neighbor on the floor is really scary, and certainly should send ice water that runs down the throats of most viewers. Despite the appeals of many critics in connection with Raines's acting ability, I thought it was all right, more than able to hold her in the scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Vallach. The image is being upgraded to an effectively dashing conclusion, and although some partial points are unexplained, I have remained a feeling more than satisfied. As the book "DVD Delirium" says, "Any film with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as cannes cannibal lesbians in leotards can not be bad"! On the side, yesterday I went to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to look at the Sentinel House. Yes, it is still there, and although it is cut off from a heavy ivy and there is no blind priest / nun in the window on the highest floor, it looks the same as in this picture. If this house really sits on top of the entrance to hell, I guess it's hell ... Brooklin Kueens Ekpressvai. But we, New Yorkers, have known that for some time now!
