"Cute is never so sweet without acidity." This quote is essentially a theme for the film in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who's got everything in his life. He takes things for granted and comes in full swing in this great movie with a great twist. This movie will keep you in the plot and you will not be able to stop it to make a break in the bathroom. You can not really appreciate better things in life (sweet), like love, until you experience bad (sour). The topic will really make you "open your eyes". The only remark is that the film is very rotating and difficult to understand. I think the end is perfect. I recommend that you watch it and see for yourself.
