The first installment of this notorious horror series was presented as if it was a movie that was detected by producers and set up as an amateur camera, along with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. It represents a woman who was kidnapped by a band of black-clad men who tortured her a few days before she finally killed her. The unfortunate victim is savagely beaten and plundered with raw meat before her nails are pulled out with tongs, her hand is broken with a hammer, an eye-punctured needle and so on. scenes, women who have captured it are burned with hot water and throw live worms into burns. The series got a lot of publicity when American actor Charlie Shin, believing the series contained a real murder, tried to ban his distribution in the United States. A FBI investigation revealed that the films were just what seems to be the majority of viewers - sick reconstructions that use nasty, but apparent special effects. Shamefully placed by famous Japanese comic artist Hideshi Hino, who directed the third and fourth episode, this film is a sure way to clean everything except the most tolerant rooms. But, you probably will not find anything special.
