I just watched a movie that was afraid that it would disappoint me. I was pretty surprised at the end. The American pie franchise is still in my favorite films of all time. yes, it will not be true if I say I enjoyed porridge because I enjoyed the original ones. The beta house together with the previous two pies definitely lost something the first two pips had. but what the hell is - it's still funny with a lot of good times and I think it should be the first movie to choose if you want to have fun and relax after a busy day at work or at school. The beta house deserves 6/10, but I gave it 7/10 just because it is another part of the PIE.
