Some of those who watch movies and complain about them forget something: the DVD menu system. I tell you, I watched the main screen repeat in this about 35 times. It was great. A cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that led me where it was, which was the very beginning. Many times the sum and Bam! I was hired. Over and over again and again. And more. "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." And it's just a soundtrack! I'm left in bed, cluttered with my Vai. Rain is in a flat roof, and tonight soft is soft again. The cat is comfortable and the ankle that crosses me has already rested. I opened the DVD. I was hypnotized. Through the night. "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." Blob. Look at him. Steve Kueen, two policemen and one girl in a dress. Two thumbs up!
