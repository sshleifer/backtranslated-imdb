The Sixties TV series Bevitched owes its idea from this film. This is a film that Jimmy Stevart & Kim Novak made immediately after Vortoglav played Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as obsessed as that, but Novak is equally impressive. This was the 10th film of Jack Lemons and he is good at supporting, as well as Ernie Kovacs. The film has a lot of good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this movie, almost as good in support here as it was in The Music Man. The actors are very solid. This film has a sense in New York from the late 1950s and a cat that is as equally asxical as any cat in any movie. Worth to watch because it's a love story with all the emotions of any, and a little magic boots. It's not Vertigo, but I think that because it was following this movie, the viewers did not evaluate him as good as he deserved - of course I'm glad that Villiam Asher saw it, so the series from the 1960s was created. I'm not really pleased that Vill Ferrell did it on the big screen, this film is much better than that.
