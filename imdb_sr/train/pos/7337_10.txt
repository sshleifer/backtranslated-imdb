Good story and great animation. The influence of Fraset and Bakshi is obvious, and that is a good thing. Anyone who enjoys the Conan barbar or in the game Dungeons and Dragons should enjoy it. The battle between good and evil is clear, although it seems that our hero is sometimes neutral. Most often in fantastic movies, elves are usually shown to have white skin and blond hair, while goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone who is familiar with Frazetin, Bakshi or even Tolki's work knows that they are not racists. Anyone who enjoys movies from fantasy, this film should like him. This is not for small children because of violence and sexual allusions. Casting is well done, and scenes and music are the first. I hope someone will soon put this jewel on DVD. I feel happy that I have a VHS copy in good condition.
