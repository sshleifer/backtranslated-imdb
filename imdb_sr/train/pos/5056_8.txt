The radio was not 24-hour 7 days a week when I grew up in England in the 1930s, so the Children's Time was a treat for me when we had batteries and an accumulator that was sufficient for energy. Several of the programs I heard gave a great impression to my young mind, and the three that I still remember are "Toit's," one about all the animals in the zoo, and --- a Gray Owl, which talks about animals that knew who he was called her "brothers." It's only recently that I learned that the Gray Owl is not a real "Indian", but the bust that the boss Siouk pays has a great sense for me "A man becomes what he dreams of." Could we all dream like a changing world and useful as Archie Grae Ovl Belanei. In order for a new gray owl to affect world leaders to cleanse the environment.
