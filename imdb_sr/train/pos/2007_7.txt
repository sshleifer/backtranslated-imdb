My personal opinion is that this film had no real story for the first John joinery vampires, but I do not care. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this film. He really made me angry that I believed he was a person I would never have thought of being the famous Rockstar. There were some bad things about this movie. Like the story, it was supposed to be more on the movie. It should have been a continuation of the film that followed the film story and that they should keep the same main characters in all three vampire films. I really liked the clothes people were wearing and the environment they choose in Mexico. I liked the old Mexico, not the new Mexico. with clay houses and old fashion churches. I was a bit confused with the vampires and how they could walk around the churches, but it was cool that they did not follow the Dracula Vampire rules.
