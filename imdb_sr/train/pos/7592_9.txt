I just finished watching the movie and I wanted to give my opinion (and justice) to the movie. First of all, in order to get things fixed, this movie does not pretend to be anything else to a solid action comedy movie. He does not aim to revolutionize the film industry and collect critical praise, nor does he want to be considered once. If you really want to enjoy this movie completely, I suggest you throw away your criticism and your craving for a good complication, because here you will find nothing. With that established, let us go further into the film. I had low expectations for this movie simply because it did not have a powerful plot (Yes, cinema viewers, I underestimated this movie too), but I never expected to enjoy this movie so much. I even enjoyed this more than Stephen Chov flicks (which I think Kung Fu Hustle is his best effort and that he would give his grade 9). The action is narrow and epic, while comedy is dumbfounded in the right places. SPOILERS warns, I think the action could be unreal, but why would I want to watch a serious basketball movie at all? There are many other sports movies (drama) that have already done well, why create another? SPOILERS end I'm not even sure why you read this. Go ahead and watch. Just remember, do not think - just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh, and </ i> Every little one, they (film industry) create masterpieces like "Pulp Fiction" or "Godfather" and sometimes they create films that are better at the bunch of dumps. I do not say that Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition that previous examples have, and again, if we are talking about comedy Stephen Chov-ish, this is the top ten. Very recommended if love: -I can not watch movies with really good action -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy-what is it, watch this. You will be well done. 9/10 for you is Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
