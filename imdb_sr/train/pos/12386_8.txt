"Sentinel" is one of the best horror films already filmed in the film industry! I think this is very scary because there are actually few movies. Alison Parker is a little slave model. She comes out with a lawyer named Michael Lerman, and has a best friend, another model called Jennifer. Everything was great in her life, until she decided to live alone for a while and rent a beautiful and old apartment. The problem is her neighbors, which are very, very strange. Suddenly, Alison begins to suffer from health problems and weaknesses with frequency; She recalls some painful facts about her past that she has nightmares or illusions. But everything has reason, and it has to do with the new home in which he lives ... I personally find "Sentinel" a very creepy movie, and together with "Exorcist", these are two from the most terrible films I've already watched. When we discover that Alison's house is occupied by the priest alone, my blood is frozen! It is also terrible to see that she should blindly blind at the end of the movie to be a new guard to keep the monsters of our world.
