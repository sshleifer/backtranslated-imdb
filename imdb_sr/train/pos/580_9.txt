When I first saw this film I was with my dad. He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, he immediately became one of my favorites. The river goes through this is about two brothers who each take a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is older than two brothers and he is on his way to education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is a rebellious younger brother who travels along the path of a hurdle. The film follows these characters as each of them follows his own way. This film has no negative side. You will have fun all the way. The acting, direction and script are perfect. Two things that are exceptional are cinema and scorecards. Both of you who capture you in the world that Robert Redford creates for you. This is a great movie that is destined to be a classic. It must be in my book. If you have not seen this movie, be sure to watch it as soon as it will remain forever.
