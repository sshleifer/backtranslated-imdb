The danger has the feeling that it is some type of film fund - one of the films that the studies have pumped out between large budget / office. It's only 70 minutes and there are not many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanvick. But what a star, of course. Stanvick is again a tough lady as she encounters a fugitive prisoner while seeking help for her captured husband in the Mexican desert. Most movies focus on how she deals with her catcher, who wants to be subjected to him in exchange for his help. Some psychological fighting out there. It's a surprisingly effective small movie - its short length makes it tense, and Stanvick's excellent should not be mentioned (but I'll still boast it).
