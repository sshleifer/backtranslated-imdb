I watched this movie over 100-200 times, and I adore it every time I watched it. Yes, it can be very loose, but it's also very funny and enjoyable. The campsite shown in the movie is the real camp I actually attended for 7 years and is shown as a camp really, a great place to spend the summer. Everyone who ever went to the camp, wanted to go to the campsite, or send a child to the campsite, should see this movie because it will bring you nice memories for you and your children.
