Early career Abe Lincoln was beautifully presented by Ford. It's not that anyone has seen the footage of a real Lincoln, but the Fonda, carrying a false nose, is as strange as Lincoln, with voice, delivery, walking, and other manners - just as one might imagine that Lincoln was. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films he filmed with the Fund, is at the top of his form, perfectly appealing to America at the beginning of the 19th century. The story focuses on a couple of defendants for the murder that Lincoln defends, and the courtroom scenes are pretty well made. The supports are comprised of many Ford's regular vehicles. This was Alice Brady's latest film, when she died several months after her release.
