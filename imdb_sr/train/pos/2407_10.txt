The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. It was different. I am a Christian (Bible Belief). I'm not going with a bunch of faithful right wingers. I got out of this atmosphere. In my attempts to take over our government, I do what Judas tried. I call him Judas' syndrome. Judas did not understand it, although Jesus said that his kingdom was not from this world. I also liked what Jesus enjoyed in the simple pleasure of playing games and a joke with his students. It's a movie that monitors and monitors. Very satisfied.
