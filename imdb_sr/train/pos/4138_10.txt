The other reason for watching this beautiful film is Florence Rice. Florence, who? That was my first reaction when the credits on the screen opened. Soon I found out who Florence Rice is, a real beauty that turns into a simply beautiful performance. Like everyone in this tiny piece. Since 1939, it's a different time, but there's a charm in it. It transfers you to another world. It starts as a light comedy, but then it becomes very serious. Florence Rice launches a scale from a comedian to heroin. She is absolutely beautiful, at the same time strong, vulnerable that develops from girl to woman. Look at her face expressions at the end of the movie. She has made over forty films, and I will look for the other thirty-nine. Alan Marshal is in the Flinn / Gable mode and proves the perfect match for Florence. Buddi Ebsen and Una Merkel provide great comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of the 30's / 40's, Do not Miss This!
