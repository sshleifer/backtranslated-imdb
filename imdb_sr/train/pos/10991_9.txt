Cipher is a movie worth watching, because it's not a moving Sci-Fi movie. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a type of macro overview of what is happening. A close-up view is how the director holds the action of illusions. The sci-fi aspect of the film is secondary to the complicated film. The technology used in the movie is not too impressive, however, the director uses the props well. Character development is deliberately shallow. The main character, Jeremy Nortam, decides to plunge into the world of espionage. It is up to the public to understand his mysterious character, and this is a puzzle that interests the audience to the very end.
