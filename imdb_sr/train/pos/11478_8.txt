Chris and Andre are two average, ordinary teenagers. Some were misunderstood and others chose. But they stand together and everyone will pay. Together they form the "Army of Two". They plan and plan "Zero Day". That day is when they decide to get into high school and kill 14 people in cold blood. Said through the tapes that they made "Zero Day," it's a barely fictionalized story of Columbine's tragedy. "Zero Day" is one of those films that will then mess with your head. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) are doing such a good job that their characters look like almost every disadvantaged teenager walking on the street. Their performances were very convincing, you somehow liked these guys, and that was scary. Filmed on the video almost entirely from the perspective of teenagers, "Zero Day" is very real and authentic, as if you were right there. These kids try to rationalize their actions towards the viewer, and actors sell it to you. But be warned that it traces the tragedy from start to finish, and the end for some is shocking and uncomfortable.
