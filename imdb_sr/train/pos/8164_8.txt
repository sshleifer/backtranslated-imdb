This movie was very pleasant, but you will only like it if: - you hate going to the dentist, but do not be afraid of the movie in which one of them goes to the disadvantage - you love horror films I especially liked the fact that some attention is devoted to explaining the brutal actions of the protagonist. The fact that she is completely obsessed with cleanliness (especially in her mouth), and then caught her wife, providing satisfaction in the mud pool, is a pretty convincing reason for exaggeration. <br /> <br />. I'm giving him 8.
