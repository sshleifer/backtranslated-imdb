"Once in a lifetime" is a very good movie. However, this is not good for everyone, due to the widespread use of vulgar language and the violence of some situations. The film is able to present an "unhealthy" life in the neighborhoods of New York where the drug problems are important in an anecdotal, convincing way. This display is used as a d√©cor for a very imaginative and uncertain drama supported by powerful dialogues (however, it was hard for me to understand some of them because English is not my native language. The video is OK). Sometimes it's a little exaggerated, but I think that pretty much fits into the general orientation that Fishburne gave to the movie, which gives a reflection theme more than just a good workout style, especially in time / action management. Characters, although not simple, are easy to connect and actors do their job well. By the way, I enjoyed the soundtrack (B. Marsalis) a lot. If you are not exaggerated, you should enjoy watching this movie once, twice, three times. I rated film 9/10.
