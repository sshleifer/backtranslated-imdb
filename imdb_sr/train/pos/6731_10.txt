I rate this 10 out of 10. Why? * Provides insight into something that I hardly understand - surfers surf because it's all they want; It seems that nothing else matters to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys. * Filmed in the film is a great history of surfing; I've never surfed, but I like surfing movies, and I've seen many. Nobody taught me what this film did * The film was very well arranged. He was running well. Interviews were extraordinary * It's interesting from start to finish. In short, it's a good document as I've seen, so I have to evaluate it. So 10/10
