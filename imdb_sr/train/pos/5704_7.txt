To be honest, I expected that the car would be hunted in this movie. There was only one, but in addition, 'Freevai' was an excellent movie that I'm glad to have on a DVD. The only really big names in the acting team are Richard Belzer as a radio psychiatrist and criminal B-Movie par-eckclance, Billi Drago, as a killer on Revelation Highway. But the rest of the actors generally give good performances. I particularly liked Darlanne Fluegel's character, Sunni, a little courage. She could have been a helpless victim, but she was completely rounded up while searching for Drage with the help of a hunter on the head of James Russ. Ruso, I'm afraid, it is encountered as a pretty wooden, but then again, the character that plays, Frank, is not well executed, except for the back story given by his former commanding officer. The danger tone is maintained perfectly throughout the film, and the atmosphere of a lonely LA highway at night with a killer that runs through its length in its gray sedan is a great way to build tension, and the music used to emphasize the film is appropriately assembled. I do not know why some people hate this movie. Different moves for different people, I suppose. But I absolutely enjoyed the 'highway' and I recommend it.
