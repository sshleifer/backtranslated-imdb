This is a fantasy movie for children based on the legendary book Boggi Creek, although I do not know why they called it Back in Boggy Creek as if it was a continuation. Dawn Vells plays the mother of three children who are lost in a swamp around Boggy Cree with two other men and a monster came to them. Yes, it's very stupid, and the action is gone, but this type of film is perfect for the group of 8 to 12 years it has targeted. It's a harmless G-rated kiddie fare and at least you do not have to worry about leaving your children alone while they watch it. Strictly for a set of 8-12 years, older children will get bored and think that it is chrome.
