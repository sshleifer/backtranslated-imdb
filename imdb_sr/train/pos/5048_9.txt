This is a very dark and intriguing horror thriller based on the idea of ​​religious killings. The story focuses on a disturbed man who lives in Texas, USA, who suddenly goes to kill with his two young sons after God ordered him to redeem the world of bad people. this film plays a disturbed father known as the hand of the murderer of God while Matthev McConaughei performs his best performances so far as the eldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides he can no longer bear the burden of his murderous childhood and uses retrospect to tell the story to the FBI agent, Vesely Doyle (played by Povers Boothe). I can not think of many movies that literally keep the viewer attached to their headquarters from start to finish and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you will not be able to do it because of the power of this movie. The directors have recorded this film very well, and they help to tackle the plot through a good scene. The acting in this movie is great, but if there are any drawbacks, it's that some parts are very powerful and can interfere with some people. Although the concept of this movie is very dark, small children help to present the idea through a brilliant acting. This is a really kitschy movie and it's guaranteed that you are at the edge of your place. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys horror, disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who wants to see something else. 8/10
