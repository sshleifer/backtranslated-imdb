I was only the first to watch this for a long time - I forgot how the pictures were imaginative and how witty the film was. I have not forgotten, however, the open scenes that (with a scene in the Club Candles on the Waterloo Bridge) are among the most romantic ever recorded. Anyone who is interested in politics or history will love film recommendations - anyone interested in romance will be relocated by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who loves visual images will enjoy the view of the accompanying world. My favorite movie remains "Odd Man Out" recorded at the same time - but this one is great. <br /> <br />
