I do not understand why other comments focus on McConaugheia. He has never been a very interesting film actor. The best part of this film is writing and savvy. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGav make an unusual comic duo, definitely not a kind of stock. Although it can not be said that their characters are well developed, which makes them no less funny. issue. The use of Spanish gives more authenticity. A very undervalued film, judging by the unusually low results given by members of the IMDB. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth at least 7. A lot of smooth movies with higher results and big cash at the box office are much less interesting.
