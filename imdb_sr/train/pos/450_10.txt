I am frustrated with any film that paints a gorgeous image of Italy - in my opinion, the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was rather short, unusual for some time, and a little scarce on the film aspect. However, this is a great story. The four ladies move to a much needed relaxing holiday with problems in mind. During the film, they understand their problems and begin to repair them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle in which they reside, has an enchanting effect on people. "It's a bathtub of love," says Lottie Wilkins. You can observe their gradual change from an unhappy to a lush, because the Italian seaside creates their magic on them. The actresses were great. Background music seemed very convenient for a romantic Italian localization. All in all, the 10/10 movie for me.
