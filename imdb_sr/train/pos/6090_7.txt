Envy is not as funny as I thought it would be at the beginning, but after some reviews I read, I discovered that it was much more entertaining than people gave props for, now to test their not a gag minute movie like a zoolander or dodgeball, but Ben Stiller and Jack Black work well with each other and Christopher Valken is as big as ever, so it's a story of the Jack Black character that invents the spray that makes the Pooh go missing, revolting Ben does not want a piece of it, but when the product makes jack black rich bener begins to see envy, not really soup r, and ben stiller and jack black have funny and better movies underneath the belt, but if your fan or I recommend this as an even funny movie and I laughed several times, as a big fan of a ben stiller, I have to say this Less calm but still fun, give her an hour
