What can you say about the performance of this size? "Sopranos" literally redefined the television as we know it. She violated all the rules and set new standards for the excellence of television. Everything is flawless, writing, directing and for me, above all, acting. Looking at this show, you will realize that these characters are NOT real. The acting makes you think that there is a real Toni Soprano, or any character. This show is also very varied. Some people do not watch the show because it is violent, not everything is about violence, but about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan, see. For me, I do not like when people are calling for a show, a mafia show. For me, it's a show of family. A family that, for generations, is different from the mafia. All in all, this is the masterpiece of the performance. It should be television. Right here. Complex figures of stunning acting, magnificent tales of brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? An emission that defines excellence and dares to be different.
