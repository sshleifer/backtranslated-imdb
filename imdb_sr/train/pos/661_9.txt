Ho, ho, killer maniac! This powerful adaptation of the great comic story of EC Comics is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of a series of cable television ever made. Director Robert ("Back to the Future") Zemeckis most of the time uses the humorous scenario Fred ("The Night of the Creeps", "The Monster Skuad") A girlfriend who focuses on a ruthless two-time housewife (starring Marie Ellen Trainor married to Zemeckis when she acted in this episode) that kills her abandoned husband's husband (beautiful Marshall Bell's) on Christmas Eve, tormenting him upside down in the head of a fire. Complications come when a distracted killer craze dressed in joy Kris Kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Train train a hostile visit. The terrifying, exciting result of Alan Silvestri and the typically polished cinema Dean Cundei adds to the frenzy of entertainment. And Larry Drake (sweet gentle ben Benni on "L.A. Lav"!), With his ghastly shouting, crazy glittering in his shiny green eyes, and an endless, really wicked smile, makes the sensational Sanguine Saint Nick.
