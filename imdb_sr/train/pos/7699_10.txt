FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF films. His influence has been felt for more than a decade. However, certain elements related to the way this wide-screen entertainment was directed at a mid-fifty-year-old audience that has now disappeared, this is rather outdated, and sometimes the slow pace of the film does not help. But the tempting central idea of ​​a story that includes the ancient, extinct Creed civilization and "monsters from Id" has not lost its appeal and continues to make this film with the relevant "must see" movie. What I'm most interested in is that the current DVD for this movie is horrible. The film never looked so good on a home video and its elements are greatly needed for restoration. I hope this will happen soon and we will get a special edition of this SF classic.
