This film reminded me that some of the old black and white films are definitely worth a look. In the beginning I had some reserves, but from the beginning of the movie to the end I was fascinated. I was VERY impressed by the mixture of drama, uncertainty and comedy. Arthur Askei (Tommy Gander) is HILARIOUS and has been sewing me all the time. film into your movie night for a bit of relief from sometimes depressing and "too" powerful or excessively "funny" movies of today.
