that I have a copy on VHS uncut in excellent condition that I have switched to DVD and if anyone wants to return memories to the Christmas classic please emil me to dmd2222@verizon.net.i searched everywhere and did not find this and I thought that I can not be the only one This planet that has this classic on the tape has to be other people and if I fit into them it's very little that has this classic so I consider myself lucky and I have all muppets Christmas except for one that John Denver did with muppets again thinking Their called Smoki Mountain Vacation is not sure to them, but its close.
