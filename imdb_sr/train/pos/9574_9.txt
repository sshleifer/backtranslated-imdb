This must have been one of the best movies that came out of HK in the long run, I was eager to wait for this film to be seen just by looking at the title. A lot of fantastic actors in this show, and I was particularly impressed by the incredibly convincing behavior of Sam Lee and Edison's view of the killer machine, which completely changed his normal idol image. I would definitely recommend it to those who are looking for a stylish and action movie. However, I must warn you, this is also an equally depressing film, because every character in a movie is in a kind of dead end and trouble that is struggling and battling to breathe. You mean what life really is.
