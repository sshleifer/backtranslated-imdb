Complete detection: I am a cynic. I like that my endings are sad, and my hankies are dry. I did not cry when Bambi's mother was shot. The new Smile Happiness movie looks like a pity for the Oscars. Mostly I was born without an artistic soul. So why did I then like "10 items or less?" Maybe it was a double espresso that I shot down before the show. Or (more likely) it may have been that even the hottest movie fans can use an occasional cute photo. And it's sweet. From the moment He meets Him with "Scarlet" (the event is far from Nora Ephron's "Sweet Encounter"), the view is taken on an intimate journey with two foreigners who learn to take care of where their lives move. (He was very helpful in the cinema-real-life cinema of Phedon Papamichael's cinema.) The main argument about the film is that he is too preoccupied. Is the movie far removed? I do not know. You tell me. I still have not met Adriano Brodi on the market. (However, not due to lack of experience). Do I enjoy discussing adventures that might arise if this important event occurs? Damn, I'm doing it. . That's where most reviews of "10 items or less" fall. . . I missed the fact that even my cynics have fantasies. And hell, sometimes it's worth the price for a reception to live, 82 minutes.
