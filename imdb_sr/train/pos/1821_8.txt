When I was a girl (and my dad was the owner of a video store), this was one of my favorite films. Since then, I have not heard much about it, nor did I really remember it because I'm forgotten in the light of other, probably better, Don Blut movies. However, I managed to find it a few weeks ago and again I was pleasantly surprised. Set in New Orleans in the 1930s, the animation is beautiful and the songs are unforgettable. There are a few nonsense in continuity if you look hard enough, but they do not diminish the story, which leaves you laughing (and maybe even slightly foggy if you are an animal lover). The characters are convincing (maybe even too grown up for younger observers), too. Two paws above, and for those who have not seen it for a while, it's definitely worth a look again.
