Why am I so convinced that there is another film version of this novel? I saw this film this year as I am teaching a novel and I think that the changes in the film are boring - the boy does not appear in the novel, and the ending has changed. They kill him in the film, but the point is that he is being persecuted for the Mars Marsh home for many years, but he gets married again and eventually puts things behind him. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic figure in a novel, a scene in a movie in which Kips burns the office is obvious, and the constant appearance of toy soldiers to mark the presence of a child is truly creepy but meaningless Kippa is persecuted by a woman seeking revenge rather than a child. I'm sure I've seen a movie that's better and closer to a novel and it's actually more terrible. Am I just imagining this?
