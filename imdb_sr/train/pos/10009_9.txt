When I first read the story of Armistead Maupins, I met the human drama shown by Gabriel Niko and those who care and love him. In view of this, now we have got a movie version of a great story and we are expected to see Hollywood's past ... Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner really did it! With just as many limitations Robin Villiams catches the fragile essence of Gabriel and allows us to see his struggle with the questions of trust both in his personal life (Jess) and in the world around him (Donna). As we introduced the players in this drama, we recall that nothing is as it seems and that the smallest event can irreversibly change our life. The request for a review of a book written by a young man turns into an event that changes his life and helps Gabriel find the power to continue and move forward. It's bad that most people will avoid this movie. Robin Villiams touches the darkness that we all have to find and go through in order to be better people. Like his One Hour Photo movie, he says, "It's just a matter of time," he said. he became an actor and made another quality artwork. Oh, and before I forget, I believe that Bobbi Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he is in. The main man from the 1940s looks like a screen This is that he could take his movie right now! S ~
