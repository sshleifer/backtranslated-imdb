That was great! I've never read Chester-Gould-comics, but I do not need to know them. Maybe there were some jokes I did not realize, but what the eye does not see, the heart can not grieve. This is so ironic, a colorful movie, and the actors are all benevolent. The setting is similar to that of Batman's films, but not as dark and gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but there is a plot (which is not obvious) and a more or less surprising ending. Watch him with your friends. Do not look at the points at the beginning and then look at who is the fastest to find out who the famous actors are under their makeup!
