These days, Spielberg's "Color Purple" is largely remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and Winners. What is even more alarming is that Spielberg was not even nominated for the best director. Needless to say, filmmakers deserved more praise than they were granted. father, then her husband. The film stretches for several years and mainly focuses on Celie's relationships with women around her. It's said from a particularly female perspective, but you do not have to be afraid that it's freshwater "chicken". The story is interesting, sometimes vivid, although the central character's struggles are the most important. Some may not appreciate the change of tone towards the end of the film, but I did not mind, although similar content in the smaller film would probably lead me to turn my eyes. The film won three nominations for the Academy Award for acting. : Vhoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Vinfrei certainly deserved, and Danny Glover was inexplicably stiff. As already mentioned, Spielberg did not receive a nomination for the best director for his efforts. Such a failure does not believe, since Spielberg's direction is top-notch. I'm not particularly crazy about the result of Kuinci Jones, but it's not even under average in any way. In the end, the story is satisfying, well told by the film master who works from Pulitzer's award-winning material. Try and you'll probably be confused as I am about how it could be so badly treated at the Oscars night.
