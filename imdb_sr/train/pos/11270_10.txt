Do not make a mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is the most lovable Jane ever, and will never be wonderful anymore. It is visually stunning. On the side, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. This is a great movie. Not only does it have a classic Tarzan aura, but also a sense of continuous saga. We joined two white hunters looking for ivory, one of them in love with Jane and the other for a mafia catalyst whose character may be one of the best-defined and best explored in film history. big action movie stands out as a classic. There is an unpleasant racism that is shown. However, Africans are shown as individuals, and in the end two become even more heroic than white hunters and stand out as such. In fact, the one who is not called evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters. The final is also one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The great lion's attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implicated with character reactions more than a modern film about the above would have done with a graphic display. If I left something out, it's because I do not want to blur the image for those who have not seen it. But that's all you can want in a movie.
