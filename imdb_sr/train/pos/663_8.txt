I watched this episode more often than any other episode of the TFTC, which is so pleasant. And it's pretty scary, but it's all in a good, nasty party. A woman kills her other husband, but finds the problem when she escapes the maniac in the undressed clothes of Santa Claus decides to pay her and her girlfriend at that moment. Mari Trainor, which seems to me to remember from the SNL or some other television comedy, is evil, and Larry Drake plays lunatics in the dirty Santa suit. I forgot the Santa Claus Drake played over the years. His Santa Claus is an unstoppable force and sometimes scary. You can probably guess how Santa got into the house finally. This episode is a laugh game, but it can sometimes be quite intense.
