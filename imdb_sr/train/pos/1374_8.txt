French movie Esther Williams would love. But synchronized swimming was just a hook for the story of three girls from the Parisian exhibition who found themselves. There is no doubt where Sciamina's sympathy lies because all the boys are shown as "animauk," but in fact they are just three girls in focus, all the time, with several adults and other adolescents who are mostly in the background. Marie is a girl's stick, unattractive, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and force Floriane (the beauty of Renascence quality by one reviewer) and she is also a friend of Ana: not unattractive, but for her time the perfection of her body was short, and now she is a teenager in the female body. What follows is a journey towards self-realization without road maps, but there is a gloom around three non-natural things: where is the joy and the foolish chatter of the young? While disinfection was taking breath, with Florian's self-perception beautifully depicted, as well as the equally beautiful compound of Marie and Anne, it all seemed abstract, Sciammine dolls.
