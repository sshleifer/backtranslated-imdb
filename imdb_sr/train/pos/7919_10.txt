There is no doubt that it is conceived as a totally joking joke, "Full Moon High" depicts a teenager from the fifties of Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) who follows his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Of course, Toni bites and grows fur and teeth every time she has a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect of this film is that it can not grow old as long as it has a curse on the insect, and that it must fulfill its destiny - even if it lasts for twenty years. But otherwise, the movie is simply funny when it starts up. Ed McMahon's character is an overly patriotic right-hand man (he thinks everyone should have been listening to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars's coach is tense, and then there's more. One of the most memorable members of the film is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont at "Sanford and Son" - as a bus driver who gets a great surprise. But probably the funniest scene is the change of the president; then gag with Gerald Ford really summed it up! In any case, it's a real treat. Given that Alan Arkin - who works with a psychiatrist - just won the Oscars on Sunday evening and thanked his sons, I wonder if he remembers co-acting with two of them in this film (except Adam, his son Anthony also has small role). Pretty funny. Also starring Elizabeth Hartman. PS: director Larry Cohen is probably best known for the killing of the baby "It's Alive".
