THREE SERIES - BLACKADDER THE THIRD "If you want to do something right, kill Baldrick before you start" Hot on the heels of the second show, the show returned with the current owner of the famous name of happiness and service as a butler for Prince Regent, a vain and stupid foil for poison Blackadders, played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in his hand, as is another comedic puzzle. The format is similar to the previous show, because they nevertheless found the winning formula for changing things. We see that Blackadder is trying to get rich from the hands of gullible vendors in much more ingenious ways, trying to make Bladric's M.P. or trying to find a suitable bride for the prince. In many ways, this is one of the most accurate historical series, Prince Regent took control of the throne during his madness of fathers, and some of the characters talked much about time. Samuel Johnson, Villiam Pit and Wellington are going through all the events and they all manage to steal their scenes, which is not easy with such a great acting team
