Think about Pierce Brosnan and you think he's a stunning, intelligent James Bond. In this film, Brosnan plays against the guy - and there's lots of fun in it (as well as the audience). This is a movie about a hired killer who gets involved with a businessman ... and works! This is a fun movie, with very good scenes (riveting, on the edge of Brosnan and good, compatible "off" -in-Kinnear has some good lines). My only joke is that Hope Davis, playing such a tolerant wife ("Can I see your gun?") Does not appear more often: it could have been a beautiful film for these people. This movie is like a matador: it plays with the audience, while "goes for killing". The ending is awesome because there is a story (with a positive morale!): This is a frenetic, angry and fun movie that deserves a wide audience.
