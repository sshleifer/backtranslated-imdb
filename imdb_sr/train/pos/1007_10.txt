OK, let's make it clear. I'm really not in science fiction, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. Jack O'Neil leads his SG-1 team through the Gate. A circular device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the opportunity to travel to distant worlds. It may sound like your usual sci-fi series, but it's not! The action was set not today in a long millennium, as did many other science-fiction series. I think that's great. It gives you things, events and things that you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without the need to learn many new terms and names of all devices. They have, of course, some, but thanks to O'Neill who loves to keep a simple terminology, there are not many. The series has a nice mix of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy special effects, you will not find it here. They do not use many bad, but limited amounts of well-made special effects.
