My mom took me to see this movie when it came out around Christmas in 1976. I loved him then and I love him now. I know everyone's having fun with Barbara's hair in this, but I think it looks great and sounds great! ... And it seems to me that I remember several women who copied that view of time! Also, the bathroom scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is so sexy! And the music is great. This is the groove of 70's Babs at its best!
