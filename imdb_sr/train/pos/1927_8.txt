With the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought of this most interesting program, which, although it was only a short deadline, was a huge idea with good stories. Generally unseen for more than 40 years, it's worth looking again. The initial credits featured many different images, one of which was the passage of COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, who drove his famous rocket snippets at the site where he was often called "The Fastest Man Alive".
