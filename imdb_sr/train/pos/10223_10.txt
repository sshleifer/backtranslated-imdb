* Some spoilers * I was pleasantly surprised with the harsh criticism (acting, dated dialogue, vague story) unfounded. Belafonte is brilliant as Brandoeskue, a threatening, cursing spirit that must earn its wings, but is really poorly equipped since its past life. He finds out too late how empty his hustling, materialistic life is without love. Mostel is as brilliant as a tortured man with his dying wife, Fannie. Despite his prayers for the miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) into one. The two social worlds that represent the characters alternate and complement each other, the result is ridiculous and touchingly sad. The puzzling ending is actually quite in keeping with the rest of the film. Observing all over Belafonte, Mostel sees he sees falling feathers, and he arrives wildly behind him as if he is finally ready to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonteu was not allowed to finish his miracle (or to restore Fannin's health or Mostel's faith), so he never got his wings. The pen feels tense from Mostel's intervention, the metaphor for the lives of both men: it's too late and you will not get a second chance. As "This Is A Wonderful Life", this film is magical, wonderful, fun, but terribly tragic.
