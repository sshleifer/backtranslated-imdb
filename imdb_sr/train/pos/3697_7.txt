I caught this movie on the Sundance channel at the cable afternoon. It could be said that "Who Loves the Sun" is the perfect casual fun of the story, why never. You can hang out with the trio: Lukas Haas is Vill (back after a sudden left all those years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we learn that she is a very part of the family Bloom) and Adam Scott Daniel (whether friend or an enemy or a fianc√©), alongside the picturesque Lake Falcon, Manitoba in Canada, trapped in graphic compositions set in vivid summer colors against the sun and shadows. And Trio's support is two more family members in the detective mix: Wendy Crevson is Marie Bloom's mother, and R. Thomson is Dad Arthur Bloom. Writer-director Matt Bissonnette delivered ingenious development of the story-line and its various tentacles - do not worry, Haas might have "casually" feature, or humor will come when Parker and Scott join the circle of friends who reunite, pause and expertly pleasures. Dialogues can be short or even zero, yet you will get the taste of what is cooking, having fun or wondering. Yes, "Who Loves the Sun" can very well be categorized as a gem for sleeping. Chemistry between all five principals is secure in gels and 'burns out', giving an energetic ensemble. After all, it's all in the family, and the film certainly does not take too seriously. It seems that the official site is still available on "vholovesthesun.com" and there are information about Mac McCaughan soundtrack (Portastatik with guitar tunes and strings) where extracts of the score are played, and behind scenic notes of production, interview with writer-director-producer Bissonnette about how the film and the concept arose, casting and more. Always appreciate Molly Parker since its long-standing, but captivating performance in 1996. "Kissed" Linne Stopkevich, and she is married to Bissonnette, who "wrote Maggie part Molli".
