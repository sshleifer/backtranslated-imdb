It did not seem to me that this film was so smart as it seemed to have enjoyed it anyway. It's original, though it reminded me a little about two other French films, Vidock and Citi of Lost Children, mostly due to coloring, but also because of the sharp quality of proximity characters. /> Place yourself in a prison cell, but do not let it turn you away, this movie seems to go away from the numerous blockbusters. good at first glance and very good characterization making some just too convincing! Scare with someone up this is good worth watching.
