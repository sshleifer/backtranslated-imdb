Why are you looking at this? There are certainly no reasons why you should not look! Great and fun at the direction of Alberto and David Maisles, Grey Gardens was originally intended to be a gentrification film for East Hampton, but it turns out that it would be more interesting to have a study on the eccentric life of two Edith Bouvier Beales, aunt and cousin Jackueline Kennedy Onassis. Their life was certainly fun (Edith spent most of her day in singing operas, Edie performed pirated and big balls with her many cats, one named Ted Z. Kennedy). Edith died shortly after the film was released (February 1977), 82 years after experiencing something of the fame she and Edie received after the film (she danced and sang in the night club Edie Beale Jr was born in 1925 and more he always lives in Miami). This film is appealing and enchanting.
