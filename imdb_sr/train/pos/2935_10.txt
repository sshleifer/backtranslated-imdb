Eddie Murphi Delirious is by far the happiest thing you'll ever see in your life. You can compare it with any movie, and I garuntee that you will decide that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This film is about 1 hour. 45 minutes, and during that time, there was hardly a moment when I did not laugh. You will laugh at hours after it's over, repeating the impact lines over and over again and again in your head. Eddie Murphi gave so many funny performances during his career (48 hours, merchant places, Beverly Hills police officer, raw, coming to America, Professor Shut, etc.), But this is by far his MAXIMUM moment. I've seen this movie so many times and it's more fun every time. Never loses its advantage. From this day, every big stand up performance will be emulated by Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
