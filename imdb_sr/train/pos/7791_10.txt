Another of those movies you hear from friends (... or read about IMDb). There are not many false notes in this. I could see almost everything that is happening here with a young girl running from a dead home in Tennessee, Florida, with all her world estates in the old car. Heracle, Ruby, makes some false starts, but learns from them. I wondered why she did not rely on Mike's shoulder, but ... she has her reasons, as it turns out. Just fine film. The only thing I do not like about it is, I mean, the title.
