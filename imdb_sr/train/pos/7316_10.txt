This film is one of the best in all times, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is remarkable, the music is as good as the movie, and the killer is as angry as it can be! Actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic like Dr. Loomis, the film made it even better. Without it, the film would be missing a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also great as our beloved queen of screaming! Her innocence makes her not aware of the real evil that follows her until she finds her friends in the house, which is, of course, one of the best scenes of the film. She gives a huge performance. I loved this film because it scared me when I saw it in the early 80's and I'm still watching it to date, because it's a wonderful movie that just brings you to this world that you could be thrown out like a fish at every step! The fact that this is a simple format of crazy men who escaped from mental asylum and are ready to kill anyone in the eyes without having any idea of ​​it being there is just shockingly scary and even more likely to get you into the movie as events though fiction could be easily accomplished. We all know that unfortunately evil exists in this world, and a crazy man with a knife is certainly not an unusual, very disturbing deep fear for all this. Death to any reversal. The witch's night, of course, shows it in the most horrible way. Horror should be convincing, and that's what makes the movie pleasing. It's just a simple story made in a great and scary atmosphere. Like Psicho's great story, which I both adore, I believe that the formats are the best horor. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I've ever seen and I will watch them all my life and I will never wear them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
