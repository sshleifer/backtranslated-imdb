I've never commented on a movie before. Last night I watched this movie with my girlfriend. I've read comments that this movie stays with you. That is. It's been almost 24 hours and I'm completely hit. This film allowed me to examine myself. How can I compare myself with a character like Ben who is completely unselfish. I loved this movie. I love movies that guess me and they are wondering until the end. I feel two emotions mostly, happiness and sorrow. Incredible good movie and very sad. So I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end, forever. If you have not seen this movie, take it and watch it. Just make sure you have no interference. You will want to see every shade in this picture. One for my library.
