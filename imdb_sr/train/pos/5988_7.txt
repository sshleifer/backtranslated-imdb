This 1939 film attempted to exploit Michael Curtiz's much better "Angels with dirty faces". As Ray Enriyte directed, the only interesting thing is how these kids tackled what is happening to young people in today's American cities. The film is worth visiting just because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that they were well paired. Children with a dead end have larger parts because the shop concentrates on them, not the elderly. In a way, it is strange that the fire was used in the same way as some scrupulous landlords were working in New York later in the year. It was the quickest way to turn a property around and never take into account the social problems it has created. In today's climate with so many pistols in the surrounding area there is a new reality. The young children of the stories looked more like a joke than criminals. How times change!
