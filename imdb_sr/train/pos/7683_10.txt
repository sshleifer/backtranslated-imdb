Florida and kids actually get out of projects and even become neighbors with Villon (Vilnona) And so the last performance is completed. All children have realized their dreams and have found a chance in every dream. It was a wonderful end and I cried because I was happy about them and the show seemed so realistic that I really believed in their fate. I hope that this end will end true for many. Brilliant performance and many other great performances, including Benson and The Jeffersons. This was a terrible period for Afro-American television, and the best writers were great at that time. TV COUNTRY is phenomenal for memories and I just love it because they can not protect the garbage we are seeing today. SOME ... quickly return the seventies and eighties ... your intelligent viewers are a dying species here and we need better material. Love, TV LAND original sitcom narco in the 70's and 80's (while singing "ALL IN THE FAMILY" ... these were the days ......
