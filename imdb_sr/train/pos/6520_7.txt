The original DeMille film was shot in 1938 with Frederic March. A really good movie. Hollywood's love for the treats brings us a pretty interesting movie starring Iul Brinner. He, of course, was brilliant, because he was almost always in all his films. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a brilliant move. However, the film had a tendency to keep it in place. It does not start at the pace of the 1938 version. Still, it's about a fun movie that needs to be seen at least once.
