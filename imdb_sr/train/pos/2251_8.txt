I think Alan Jacobs's review is very precise about the film, but I had the opportunity to rent a DVD from a hit block with a commentary on the BIU curator, James D'Arc's film archive. Then the prophet LDS Heber J. Grant approved the film to understand deviations from historical content for dramatic expression and telescopic events. For example, the film showed Joseph Smith in the trial. despite the great speech of Brigham Young in defense of Joseph Smith, he has already been convicted. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith was never convicted of anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hirum, where both were killed before the trial.
