I enjoyed Joice's complex novel, so I was ready to be disappointed with the scenarios of Joseph Strick and Fred Haines, in view of the incredible complexity of the original text. However, it turned out that the film was a very well made and fine translation of the tone, naturalism and light-heartedness of the book. Certainly it helps you read the original text before watching a movie. I suppose this other would seem unconnected, with very unusual episodes that were randomly merged without previously reading the text to help capture the plot. It's incredible to see that it's a "dirty" movie, since it was filmed in Dublin in 1967. Irish film censors finally banned him from watching the general public in Ireland in 2000 (shown to a limited audience in a private cinema club, the Irish Film Theater, in the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism is not only natural and rude, he offers many wild "perverted" episodes. It does not matter that many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still completely taboo when the film was shot in 1967. It is astounding and encouraging to watch cream Ireland's acting profession in the sixties of the last century, all respected players, dare to say and adopt Joice's extremely transgressive text with such enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
