I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought he had a theatrical feeling and Collora could make a fine movie. This trailer did not give me the same impression. The story line, or the potential story line, was pretty good, but due to acting and special effects, I left the feeling that this would make a good TV movie or TV show. First, Michael O'Hearn is not such a good Superman. In fact, I thought that in his short look, he made a decent Clark Kent. I'm sorry, I just do not think about SuperMan about it. The suit Kent worn disguised his size. Batman can have a bodybuilder body, but not Superman. The soup is no doubt tinted, but not expensive. In any case, I did not care about his posing, and his transformation from Kent to Superman seemed hopeless. Now this may not be just O'Hearn's mistake, Collora may have to take a little credit for bad writing and direction. Second, special effects for flying were cheezi. Superman flies through the sky. If it was obvious that this Superman flew close to the ground, and telephone cables and buildings were visible above him. I do not think there were any shootings of the full body of Superman. Obviously, O'Hearn's hub and fence was located on his lower torso. All in all, it was a good trailer. I would probably pay to watch a movie, if I ever make it, and I would definitely catch it on TV. The story line, the alliance between Lequor and Vaine Industries, Superman jealous of Lois's attraction to Vaine, Lek and Tvoface to win the Superman, and joining forces between Batman and Superman is good. I'm sure that with a higher budget and the approval of full Collor and the company, even O'Hearn can deliver a decent movie. Surely one is better than most comic films coming from Hollywood in recent times.
