Billy Wilder is credited with this story, and his non-sensory touch is noticeable in this rather original story about writers who write about the ghosts that both work for the burned musical legend Oliver Courtney. The apparent misunderstandings were quickly removed, thanks to the heavens, and what remains is a witty and cool fabrication with some fine songs (and some more unforgettable), Crosby in their most charming, big turn from the Broadway legend Mari Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant provide the majority cynic barbus (Levant is in rare form and his dad is not dated at all). Wonderful surprise and is recommended for all fans of the genre.
