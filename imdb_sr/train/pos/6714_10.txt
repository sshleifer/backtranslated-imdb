Why did I enjoy the show until the last episode? Due to the true talent that Melissa Joan Hart and her auxiliary actress had to demonstrate this piece, comedy, carefree humor and deep thought, I can actually coexist. I enjoyed the most I could come home from a busy day, and get revenge ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to see how this magical person was so happy as she helped others. Sabrina, in my opinion, was a hero ... although she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from ours ... to very different ones; she had the power on her finger, desire and command that can be used for good or bad that can exist only in many of our fantasies. Most of what we see, we have, we know, own, or even want ... we can use for good or bad, and as we decide to define it, we define a person as we are. She traveled with the globe and other areas with these constant and undesirable ideas in mind ... to teach, live, laugh and love. She has always taught how to improve her skills for the benefit of everyone around her; she sinned while living a life, going through various ways of growth, such as her, her aunt and Salem (an underestimated, yet imperfect hero) have shown well that even through mistakes, you can still be noble, gifted, and beautiful. She also showed many unselfish, teaching and love affairs as she walked her way. If this is not a sufficient reason for the 10 stars in this war-torn world where people are so hostile to each other, not realizing the differences of spice of life, and not the reason for killing ... then I do not know what it is. This show was certainly a trip to a better world, as well as an inspiration to be better and donated to smash a smile on our chops ... from the doctor I heard that all that I mentioned above led to a healthy "heart" ... and it was not is that what we all need? :)
