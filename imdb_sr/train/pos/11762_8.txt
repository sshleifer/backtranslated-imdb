Have you ever in your life, went to sports, tried the best you could, and then you found yourself in his important segment, where for a short moment you had the opportunity to be a hero and a champion. . . failed? I believe that many of us had this moment in our lives. This is the movie premise, "The Best of Times". In this story, a middle-aged banker named Jack Dundee (Robin Villiams) suffers from a deep melancholy of a football mistake, which happened several years ago, inspired to play the game again. . again. To achieve this, he must persuade a former football footballer, Reno Hightover (Kurt Russell), to return. For Reno, who is pleased with his current party in life, he sees that there is no need to change the previous records, which are getting better as old. Along with both, their problem is the fact that last year despite this, both of their marriage are working hard and need to be re-vamped. It's not easy when his candlestick (Donald Moffat) usually reminds him of the greatest fall. Despite this, Dundee is persistent and will do everything to try to correct the biggest mistake of his life. Great fun for all who want to enjoy their youth again. ***
