We saw this at one of the local film theaters in Montrose area of ​​Houston, TKS. It was a complete surprise compared to writing in the newsletter, but both of us are delighted with art. It was beautifully made and (apparently) photographed in a whipped cream somewhere in the Munich area. It is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relations of a group of twenty men and women isolated from everyday restrictions. It's fantastic on a number of levels than I can think of. We returned home after the film and talked and talked until 4 am the next morning. film in (probably the original) German version. I was looking for a version of the video tape, but I never came up with anything. Would you absolutely love to have a VHS or a DVD version of this. It explores relationships at the fundamental level and is also a great guide on how to treat your partner. If someone knows the writer / director, please convince him to let go again, preferably on DVD these days. I can not even imagine that I'm tired of seeing the honest performances of actors who are now probably all in their forties. Please, bring him back.
