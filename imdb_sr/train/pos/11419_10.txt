Debbie Claire Denis is brave and self-confident. In this depiction of life to the end of the French colonial Cameroon, she explores the relationships between men and women, black and white. , the film enters a taboo territory from the very beginning. Denis is building a picture of life through a series of characteristic relationships held by informers on the screen. The mood of the film is perfectly rounded up by the camera's operation and (lack of) lighting. Great discourse.
