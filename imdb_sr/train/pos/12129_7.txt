This is a well-directed film by John Cromwell, who was not a great director, but made some fine films, including the 1937 Prsoer of Zend. Situated in London, which Hollivood can only endure, atmospheric, but nothing like the real thing, it's a story of obsession and bereaved love, from Somerset Maughan. on DVD, as I had never seen before, and as a great fan of Bette Davis, I wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early big ones. I bought it. Well, she looked good, but I'm sorry to point out that lactone in London is laughing. Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors, she did not make a mistake, but she made one here. It was impossible to seriously grasp her character. It was not as creepy as Dick Van Dike 'Mari Poppins' cocktail accent, but close. In the second main role was Leslie Howard and he did it top-notch. He was a subtle and intelligent actor. Worth looking in despite the gymnastics of Mrs. Davis.
