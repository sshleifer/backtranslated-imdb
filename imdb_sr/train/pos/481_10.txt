This is one of the strange cases in which the film and the novel on which it is based is great. Perhaps this is because Gorris takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation. The last consequence is a look at Luzin who loves him more than Nabokov. The only thing I do not like in the movie is the influence of Valentine on Luigi's fate. I can not imagine that Nabokov creates a person like Valentin and gives him so much influence on the arguments of the novel.
