What percentage of movies people go to see these days and let them wonder what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: HELP! This film is not like that. It's a story of real people who are sometimes a combination both sympathetic and unacceptable. Upside: Bring viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their lives. Good acting: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Corte. It contains good and carefree humor.
