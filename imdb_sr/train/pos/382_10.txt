One of the best movies ever made! Why he only got 7.6 marks is a mystery. This film is a window into the world of black experience in America. It should be mandatory to watch for all whites and all children over 10 years. If you think that the work of Vhoopi Goldberg's "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollivood Skuares", think again. Do not miss this movie, which was supposed to win an Oscar. (And read the book!)
