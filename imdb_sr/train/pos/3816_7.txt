"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better movie. She portrays super-religious Korean Christians in the provincial capital of Korea, and experiences the main character in interacting with them at the time of a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a single mother who moves to the city of Miliang ('The Secret Sun in Chinese') from Seoul with her young son. She chose Miliang because her late husband was born there (he died in a car accident) and felt that he had to start a new life in a new place. She does not respond well to the Uverters of local Christian fanatics, one of whom tried to persuade her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially non-religious and erases these people as much as possible. Actually, she starts to play almost everything in Millian, but some of them are persistent in trying to attack her world, and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more would be to take the film, but it should be noted that the performance of women in the main role (Jeon Do-tion) is enormous. Reading that she won the best actress award in Cannes in 2007, I expected her to get a decent job. But Ms. Jeon is enchanting and it's impossible to take her eyes off her on the screen. The film is some sort of tedious part of Evelyn Vaugh-esquire, which shows how Destiny can feel crazy as unusually inevitable.
