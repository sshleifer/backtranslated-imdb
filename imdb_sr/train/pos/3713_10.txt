With this film, everything is in style, atmosphere and acting. True, I did not believe in all the developments of the action, but it did not matter - great acting, an unexpected plot in the store and a wonderful atmosphere sucked me, and they took me on a ride, and I had a great time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents, and this proves once again with the impeccable accent of Georgia. He is surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles (Robert Dovei, Jr., Embeth Davidtz from Schindler's List and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Darryl Hannah and Robert Duvall) that I was simply fired. I recently bought a copy of this film, and I never tired of watching. Simply one of the best trillers of the year. If you ignored this movie (and you have a chance), then I suggest you look at it.
