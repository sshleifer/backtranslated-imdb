I watched this movie not knowing anything about it and I found it similar to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on the father / son problem. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dream of a better life away from his hometown. Both sons are confronted with mockery by their colleagues, and both have a strong female role model that teaches them. The main difference I found between the movies was that the October sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching movie. Laura Dern is in a moving show and Chris Cooper plays a father who dismisses very well, as he did at American Beauti (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle direction, very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
