For me personally this film belongs to my four best. No exceptions. James Cameron proved himself again and again as a narrator's master. Through films such as Aliens, The Abiss and both Terminators, it is clear that he was a brilliant and reliable director in the field of action and science fiction. He sees the story and adds a strange quality to the movie. But Titanic is so different from all his great shots. The movie is extremely mobile and leaves room for surprises, tangles and interesting developments in an instant everyone knows. The story of a famous traveler who sank on her first journey is a legend so the challenge was that Cameron make a true, interesting and funny movie about it. The actress is as beautiful as Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose as a superstar overnight with the release of this film, and in most of the films I got upset when the support signs do not work much, but in this film it's more purposeful, because as an older Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story, it's quick to see that it's only Rose's and Jack's story, no one else. Emotional is completely satisfying and can not leave any dry eyes in the theater or home. Music has become legendary and legendary. This is the best music background of composer James Horner ever inviting from the film and audience. The song after so much time has become boring, but I still appreciate it because of the phenomenon that this film also has. Just one problem, the usual problem of James Cameron, is a dialogue that is unforgettable, but in a bad way as if it's sirast, but all this aside. James Cameron has released a masterpiece and a romantic epic that takes you on a journey of life. My heart will not go further than this.
