In order to evaluate this film fairly, you need to consider the genre that should be: the child. They had several guidelines to follow in order to make this film (which means it could not be pulled out with some humor or tongue from the first), making it all funny and enjoyable in this movie. Sequences usually make me nervous, but this was pretty good for myself. Knowing that it did not have the star of Fraiser like George, they capitalized humor and I believe that Shoveman was quite good at running. An action that is easy to follow and maybe sometimes suitable for a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and hope for the Academy Awards, it's not that, but if you want to watch a simple, fun, energically fulfilled movie you would make a good choice with this.
