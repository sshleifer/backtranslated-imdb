This is so exciting! After I saw "La Roue" this afternoon, short, light film, I consider this a real delicacy! This is absolutely wonderful and one of the most charming images I've seen this year. It's even more amazing because it's early talkie and embarrassing some great images from the 30's for the innovative use of sound in the cinema. It is simply filled with music and wonderful mood, which is truly optimistic and, ultimately, it made me happy! Obviously, it would not have been so hard to get the lottery card that a man wanted, but the rhythm was so exciting and the movie was so spectacularly fun that I did not even think about it twice. Comedy is hilarious many times and I think it is even superior to Marx's brothers, perhaps the greatest comic force of that time. This is pretty perfect.
