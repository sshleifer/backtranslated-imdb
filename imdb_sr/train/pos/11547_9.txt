And laughing funny in many scenes. The basic action of the movie is well displayed, the story of the opposites that they are trying to find a way to survive one another in the immediate vicinity. This is undoubtedly the best film of Lemmon and Matheau as a co-star, and the interaction between the disorderly Oscar and OCD Felik is a classic. and returning to find Felix and the two girls that everyone cries is pricelessly funny. For every lover of intelligent comedy, The Incredible Couple is a movie "Go On The Road To See It".
