This must be one of my favorite episodes of the Tvilight Zone, primarily for showing two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. In this way, the dusk zone is best behaved. While the parable can be a little burdened with today's dramatic standards, it is excellent - using the setting to make a statement relevant to human experience, as well as geopolitics, in a timeless manner. The whole drama rests solely on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Mrs. Montgomery, who do not disappoint. (Let both both rest in peace.) Real classical.
