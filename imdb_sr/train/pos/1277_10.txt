I think this film is best for Mike Hammer, with the performance of Biff Eliot, the definitive Mike Hammer. Harry Esseck's script is excellent and contains many improvements in Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and he is well using light and shadow. John Altona's camera is top-notch, as is the result of Frank Wakman. The cast includes many veterans, as well as Peggie Castle in their unforgettable performance like Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the best private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haari Essek should have been given more opportunities. I've always appreciated this movie.
