I gave this film not because it is a film that is very consistent, but because it is a pure ability to cause emotions in its audience. The story of a woman - fighting-against-all-chance is an old clich√© so far, but very few films have taken him with so much warmth and sincerity as Color Purple. They showed a different side of the African-American experience - indicating that after the slaves had gained freedom, many fell on the path of an impotent 'white man' and were offensive to their own people. I think this is an important point because it opposes the trend of showing - white on black - violence and victory - Oscar. Also, the acting performances are great - especially Oprah who now have a new respect for you. Good worth watching - but hold a little tissue at hand.
