People tend to complain about the number of films about mentally disabled people. I do not see this as a valid critic, nothing more than a complaint to too many films about any kind of people. Jaco van Dormael is doing a great job with the script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work perfectly together, and Duquenne basically plays herself. The film covers a surprisingly great event, and it is not only a pleasure to cross what is seen in the "Rain Man". The ending is rather depressing, but it does not destroy the wonderful story that preceded it. 7.8 from 10
