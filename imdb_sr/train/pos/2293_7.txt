This is a very, very early cartoon Bugs Bunny. As a result, the character is still in the transitional period - he was not drawn out as elongated as he was later and his voice was not quite right. In addition, chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a little unusual. Elmer is some poor juice that buys Bugs from the pet store - there is no pistol on his side or the desire to blow the bunny! However, in spite of this, this is still a very pleasant film. Early Bugs was definitely more cruel and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films, he became embarrassed with Elmer, Iosimite Sam and others, as they began - they were messing with the cord. But, in this film, he is much more like Daffi Duck in the late 30s and early 40s - a jerk that just loves to irritate others !! A real "anarchist" instead of the hero of later cartoons. Although this is not among the best cartoon films about Bug Bunny, it's definitely fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much it has changed over the years.
