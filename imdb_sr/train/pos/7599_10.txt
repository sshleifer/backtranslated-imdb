Before everything lost on the TV was lost, it was predictable. You could have predicted who would die or who would find something, but in the Lost you can foresee NISHT. Everything was so surprisingly amazing, and it was really a mystery not because there are so many secrets, but because there was nothing like it before everything was so big. I literally became addicted to it. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something that rejoices every week. It's genius. The environment is brilliant, calm and warm on the beach and so scary in the jungle. The characters are the genius of each of them, especially those already on the island. The trash are so dramatic, but we can never foresee their death, because they have much more to do and much more to say and have secrets that affect other apostates who die with them.
