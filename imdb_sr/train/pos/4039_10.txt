Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie are really down to one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, the actors and the team are essentially the same. Yes, Kitamura rehashed several shots in battle scenes that come in the second half movie, but that's where the similarities end. Versus takes place in essence everywhere, showing Kitamur's ability to create an interesting B-movie in natural locations. For Alive, almost everything happens inside. In small, cramped spaces. Here is an art design stitched in your face, and WHAT is an art design! We are treated with several very complex and interesting spaces, and our characters are mostly limited to these spaces. Also, the key difference is that we do not do much to the end of the movie here. On the contrary, everything was about action and cool, here a much more emphasis was put on the characters and the situation and messed with your mind. Therefore, Alive is a far more interesting film than Versus. You may not appear and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cold bloodshed zombies, but you will sit glued to the screen for almost two hours looking at the interaction of several truly interesting characters. Now I'm thrilled to order a DVD in spite of some non-content. You should also! But be sure you understand that this is a different animal from Versus - it's often slow and requires little thoughts to get the most out of it. I hope Media Blasters will pick up for the titled edition of R1 DVDs!
