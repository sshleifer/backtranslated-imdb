Great Voodi Allen? Good Voodi Allen? Definitely. I found myself, together with the audience, how I am very laughable and often on some of the best Voodi Allen lines we've heard for a while. Staren Allen created an appropriate role for himself as "Father" Scarlett Johansson ... well, somehow. Some have said that Johansson plays "young Dianne Keaton". I beg to differ. She plays Voodi's dialogue, which in his comedy always has a very similar feeling ... like, for example, Voody Allen's comedy. That's good for us. She certainly made the Voodoo dialogue much better than the young actor of his latest comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some may consider Voodi humor tired, but for those of us who love him when this happens, we look forward to the next one.
