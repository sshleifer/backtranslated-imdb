Sarah Silverman's program ... is better than other shows. No trace of laughter, no painful jokes, just a program. Program Sarah Silverman. If you are like me, and you love comedy, this is probably a play for you. Sarah Silverman leads to fun things and fun at the table with ease. A mix of different styles, which makes it their own. This program is not something you want to start to compare the war, seeing it has absolutely nothing to do with it (other shows). This show is its own entity, and I think it will be good for most comedy actors. Go watch and see.
