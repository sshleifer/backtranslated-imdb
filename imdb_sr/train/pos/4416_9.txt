The best result of Harvei Keital so far in the modern age. Very beautifully photographed, beautiful recording of pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the nephews of a local minor criminal boss who develops friendship with an American with Hollywood connections. This is really the moment when the boy is awakening to the fact that a small circle of people he knows actually lives in a much larger, more complex world that still does not understand. It's crispy. After all, a really professional job that fits well into the tradition of Latin American cinema. The only weakness is the decision to record synchronized English, not Spanish - likely to improve sales in the United States. Unfortunately, this only makes the film less convincing. But if you can see beyond that, you will find a sincere journey to another world. Recommended.
