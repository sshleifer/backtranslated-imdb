For those who commented The Patriot as accurate, (which essentially satanized the English language), it was interesting to see this film. In all likelihood, it was the bloodiest war in which Americans were ever involved, and they were the only national presence. It was therefore very refreshing to see something similar to the historical accuracy that came from that side of the Atlantic, which did not color America either as a martyr or as a rescuer. All in all, what brought this film home was the genuine horror of every conflict, and that everything that the war crimes made brought only a burning act, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. This was not a movie in which you cheered, but you pitied and despised everything.
