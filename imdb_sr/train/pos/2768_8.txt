In addition to the wood delivery, Susan Haivard in this film was as good as any other Bible film. Henry King is processing this film with respect to the epic in all small scenes, and Peck is, as always, flawless. The sound hit of Alfred Nevman, with the twenty-third psalm, is unforgettable even after these many years. The Goliath scene is a bit on the side of the hockey, but not everything that was badly done in the era in which this movie was shot. This goes well with the less biblical epics of that day, the "Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King." It's worth watching, and Raimond Massi is as good as Prophet Nathan. The film is rounded up by always good James Robertson Justice like Abishai and Jaine Meadovs like Michol, David's alienated first wife.
