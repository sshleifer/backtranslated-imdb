The thief in the night must be the best of all the thrillers at the end of time. I have no idea what people complain about what people are complaining about when they say that these movies were scared of accepting God. They just had to find an excuse and blame the thief in the night. Do not listen! These films do not just talk about one of many troubles, but they are also fun to watch in their simplicity. They are in fact low-budget and this is a little obvious, but not too obvious at first sight. I had no idea because I really assumed that many films like the ones made in the 70s included a low budget all the time. The thief in the night talks about the young and cynical Patti Miers, who lives for what comes her way, as long as her husband, and almost all of her friends do not disappear in the prophetic enthusiasm that everyone warned her about. Initially, the film is not based on it until an enchantment occurs. What leads to this is to show that all others around her become Christians and believe in Christ, which is common to many people. All around them who once knew and loved, will forever disappear, and the one left behind is the one who blames all but himself. No one can blame himself for being always right. Just like those who complain about the movie. These people must be adult adults. I am thirteen, and you can not see me crying, especially since I was just like Patti before I again accepted Christ into my heart. For those who have not seen him, if you want something that is inserted into a Christian movie instead of stereo-typical, everyone else is the wrong movie, but you will enjoy the Thief In The Night. Do not knock before you try. Something new is always good. Believe in your instincts.
