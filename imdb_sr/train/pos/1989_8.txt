I admit I do not like Oliver! As a little child - it's been a long time, and the story is a bit slower due to all the music numbers. As a teenager, I discovered that the fun of this movie is just an experience. Instead of thinking about it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, imagine it as a celebration of a classic story. Adaptation is at best loose, but really, if you are watching a musical, there is no story. The music is the core of this film, and the vast majority are starred and very attractive. Most or all of the actors were included in the musical scenes, and this is shown in their performances - and I consider it a plus. All appearances are in a "scenic" style of acting that is typical of much older films, and are very entertaining. The exception is the kid who plays Oliver, whose job looked sweet and he stayed out of the right performers. Fagin and Dodger are the true stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job keeping the scary presence on the screen as threatening Bill Sikes. Even Sikes's Bullseye dog gives a good performance. This film is not for everyone. People who hate the musical are despised by him, as well as those who take the musicals seriously. Nitpicking due to incorrect historical details or misinterpretation of an exaggerated stage type that behaves in bad behavior will destroy any enjoyment. Just sit and enjoy the party - it's much better if you remember that it's like a musical fantasy loosely organized around the book, not a strict adaptation.
