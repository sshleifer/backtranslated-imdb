After Chicago, I started losing all respect to Ricardo Giro, and then Flock came. So far, there is a beautiful smile and a couple of facial gestures can bring you, but he showed me that he finally grabbed his craft and could work with the best of them. Clara Today was also great as his "trainee / substitute." Some claimed that there was too much unnecessary violence, but I do not see it that way. Nothing I saw did not diminish the power of this movie. I was really shocked that I did not hear that he was released in the movies and came across him in Blockbuster. A truly remarkable film with the right mix of action, uncertainty, excitement and social consciousness. Good as a 7even? So maybe. And you'll see that you're better off Gerea than anyone ever pulled out of Pitt.
