This is a low-budget movie, with unknowns and a minimum number of recordings on the site. The Philippines is replacing Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong. The Cathai Pacific jumbo jet jumping on the old airport makes the perfect pass. This film proves that you do not need a mega-budget, nor a star-headliner for making a great movie. It does not contain even the gaffes or excesses in which young filmmakers often stumble. A solid creation from people who know all aspects of film creativity and understand the compromises between art and office. Great job!
