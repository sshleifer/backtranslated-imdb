We often talk about cinematic attractions - Kane, Kum, Bout de Souffle. One film, however, is often overlooked by "serious" film critics. I'm talking about the classic Doc Savage (M.o.B.) This film is not only exciting, but seriously exploring the issue of exploitation of developing countries by American imperialism. Not to mention kung-fu. He also owned the largest soundtrack in the history of the film (as long as Kueen did not leave breathless on Flash Gordon). Though it's a little rarity, this movie is worth the search - ten times will give up the effort of your search.
