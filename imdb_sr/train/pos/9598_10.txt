I followed the path two years ago on the Internet - now I saw a movie !! What a ride! And what a way to finally meet Darius Veems! So brave, wise, witty and talented spirit! And what a crew! To hear how Darius laughs from the water in the Panama City, to see his fear that he is too close to the alligators in Louisiana, a miracle in his eyes while riding in a balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, I bet that we eat a spoon of the vassy, ​​and phone calls home, and as always - guys will be boys. This film should be seen by everyone - both young and old. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. The crew members are witnesses to the heart of the younger generation. They got a new wheelchair Darius; they documented problems of accessibility; they took Darius to the path of his life; and touched many, many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and fostering research funding, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of the Darius Goes West - a DMD medicine.
