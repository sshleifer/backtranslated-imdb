You like to solve the mysteries? Do you like complex narration? This is for you. A great, smart film by Francis Leclerc (son of legendary French Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Incredible photography and smart editing is the word of Leclerc, strongly supported by Roi Dupuis, who is a dithirambic in the lead. unknown. The tourner tries to remember who hit him when he ended the deer's suffering on the road. During the fight, he has a strange behavior and seems to have taken over something. It is not spooky, it is a very mysterious and well-played movie. I have a hypothesis about the ending (I think the Indian caused an accident), but this area was open to any explanation. I recommend you 9.5 / 10
