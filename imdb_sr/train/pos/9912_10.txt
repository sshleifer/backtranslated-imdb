Absolutely beautiful drama and Ros is top-notch ... I recommend this film. Her performance, in my opinion, was Oscar material! The only real sad fact is that Universal did not see that this movie is ever available on any video format, whether it's a tape or a DVD. They ignore VERY good movie. But Universal has little regard for its library on DVD, which is sad. If you get the chance to see it somewhere (not sure why it rarely even runs on the cable), look! I will not go into the story, because I think that most people would rather have an opinion on the film, and too many "reviewers" spend hours writing about a story that is available anywhere. A 10!
