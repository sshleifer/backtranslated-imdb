Dark comedi? Gallovs humor? How does someone make a comedy from murder? It can be risky business because the viewer has to give up his moral values ​​and laugh at the antiquities of a man who kills people. So, the story is solid, with a good dash of suspended reality in order for it to work. So, Pierce Brosnan, the Irish response to 007 is now thrown like an alcoholic who smokes, a sexually dependent alcoholic who kills people for life and has a life crisis. He gets to know a businessman who is struggling, Greg Kinnear, and after a rocky start he finds out that he needs a friend. But Greg is happy married Hope Davis and Brosnan sees in him the basic things that do not exist, love, home and life. Add actor, Philip Baker Hall as a hit man manager and go on the races. Brosnan is beautifully rude and rude as an anti-hero, and Kinnear is as beautiful as his colleague, a very human businessman. Hope Davis adds spark to Kinnear's conventional wife who is fascinated by this abandoned who goes into their lives. The end is wonderful and with some surprise. You should leave the theater, at least, partially good - if you can suspend the horror of killing people.
