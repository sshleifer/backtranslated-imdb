When I found out about the death of Mr. Alec Guinness, this was the first of his many films that I thought to see. What a wonderful comment the film gives and after all these years. And Ginis helps charm to wrap into every frame. His eyes and face are glittering like the white suit he wears. Both he and the film must be considered as favorites for life.
