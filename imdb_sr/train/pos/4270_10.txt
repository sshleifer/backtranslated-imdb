Who is singing there is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies and comedies, but tell me who gives you a real smile every time you watch it. But the truth is that the humor in this comedy is special. And all the former Yugoslav republics know well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) can not enjoy it so much. Because the subtitles destroy the hole. But they should at least try !!!! Yes, it's ironic! This is the best film in Serbian history and the world does not understand it! :-) If you have a chance to see this, do not explode OK!
