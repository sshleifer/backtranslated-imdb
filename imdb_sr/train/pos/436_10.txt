I absolutely loved this movie. I'm not even sure what special about it, but I think it was wonderful and it should be available for DVD. Women were strangers and still agreed well to spend the time spent in a villa in Italy. Actors, in my opinion, did a great job. The characters were so different and yet a smart story that made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship issues all in their time. It takes 10 rows for that, but I can not remember to say it, so I'll just rattle until I get 10 rows. I'm so sorry about this. What else can I say that it's been a long time since I last saw it. I'm looking forward to re-review, but it's not available.
