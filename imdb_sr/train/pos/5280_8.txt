The Order is a young Frenchman of Moroccan descent. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. The father announced that the Order would lead him to the Hajj (pilgrimage) in Mecca - something that the Order does not care about, but only obliges. As a result, from the beginning, the Order is angry, but as a traditional Muslim, his father is difficult to talk about or discuss his doubts. Both father and son look very rigid and inflexible - and it's very ironic when Daddy tells his son not to be so stubborn. When reading an abstract, it talks about how many characters grew and began to know each other. However, I really do not think they are and it's a fascinating and sad aspect of the film. Of course, there were times for understanding, but so often there was a wickedness of hostility and repression. In fact, I liked this and appreciated that it was not completely - as it would seem to be false. All in all, the film is well-acting and fascinating - giving Westerners an unusual insight into Islam. and hajj. It also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional Islam and a secular younger generation. Although a slow slow pace and lack of clarity about the film can disturb something, I think the film gave intense realism and made it look like a movie about people - not some formula. Nice and unusual movie.
