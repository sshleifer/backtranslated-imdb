Probably the most frustrated season of the first season, 'Shore Leave' has its ups and downs; some parts are drawn for too long, others are unambiguously shortened, but they can not be denied that they have thrown everything but a sniper to make this a fun episode. It seems that Kirk and the crew have found the perfect planet to go to the coast after an extended tour of duty left all the people on board who need rest, relaxation, and so on. It seems that for all intentions and purposes uninhabited Earth, with a beautiful landscape and an ideal climate. The first indication that things could be just a little wrong is when McCoi, the leading advanced team, spotted Alice (from the Land of Miracles) after a big white rabbit jacket. Kirk descends and finds others who report similar bizarre events and encounters. One thing everyone has in common is that each crew member was thinking of the person / place / things they discovered before they discovered it. This does not collapse immediately with Kirk or anyone else. There is more weirdness, including the views of Don Juan, the Siberian tiger, the WWII fighter jet, etc .; Kirk meets with Ruth, a beautiful old girl (of course) and a siledger from his academic day, Finnegan. The scene of the fight / fight with Finnegan takes too long, but at the same time, McCoi is spat with a spear by a knight on a horse and apparently killed. In the end, the older man appears and explains what is happening. The planet is a futuristic "amusement park" in which visitors can only imagine something that will appear. Nothing is permanent; McCoi is not really dead. When this is explained, Kirk decides to order everyone to go to the coast. Despite 'all that was a dream' type of ending, 'Shore Leave' is being held as another first-class episode of the first season of Star Trek.
