I just recently read the novel "Mother's Night", but for some time I have a DVD, and I often watch it. I have a few movies I've seen and made me think and ponder as much as Mother Night is, I am amazed by the brilliance of not only Vonnegut, but also the translation of his text onto the screen. You can not rent or watch this movie on VHS, it must be done on DVD, and must be accompanied by the comments of the film director. To see how they made a fairly simple story, and yet complex in their essence and dialogue, and made it work so well, I think that every viewer will be stunned. The misses in the movie are little of the text, and does not diminish it much, the movie could be a book and the best adaptation I've ever seen. I highly recommend a book and a movie together, that it makes a bad service just to say go go watch. It will change you if you do it.
