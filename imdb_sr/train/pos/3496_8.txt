I'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars. But they simply do not understand the film. The story is about growing up in weight. There is a crazy grandma who really wants the best for your grandchildren. And there is a good reason why so many critics love this movie. The reason is that they understand the film. I'm sorry for the low results that some people gave. I would like to be able to write a short preview movie, but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. Honestly, I have nothing else to say.
