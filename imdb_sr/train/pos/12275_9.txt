I've never heard of that book, nor does it care to read it, but a movie I'll probably see many times. This film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest images I've ever seen in a movie. It was like watching pictures many times, which I think was an idea. Incredible movie, story, actors and cinema. Full of deep emotions from every angle. Although I do not like romantic movies, I liked it and I was deeply impressed by Vinone Rider's request that her father be all right. G. G. G. Irons earned a reward for his performance, and the Close was never better. <br /> <br />
