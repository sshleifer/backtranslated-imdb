That's all iall who think 1. That was boring television transmission 2.Halle Berry and Denzel Washington did not earn their Oscar Shut the F ** k UP !! This was one of the best awards of the Academy because 1. It was a moment in history that black "black actress" won an academic award for the best actress, so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for years. To be honest, I stopped watching academy awards because of the lack of diversity in the winners or nominees. To me, it was just a bunch of whites who stuck to each other at the academy. which were brilliant in movies, e.g. Alfred Voodard, Vhoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Marie Jean Babtise, but it was not 2.Halle Berry deserves that the Oscar no competition academy was under pressure to vote for her for as long as the actors who ignored the Academy, which consists of white voters ieah that Nicole kidman sang very well in the muling rouge, but it was time for black people to be placed in these awards. for all of you who think that race is not the problem of "probably white people" in the film industry, but it's a lot of the most talented black actresses that are either reduced to the stereo-typical role of the white people I think is black or there is no "Angela baset". I do not expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of them.
