This film has many strong sides. He has one of the best choirs outside the Lugosi-Karloff-Chanei Circuit: Lionel Atvill, Fai Vrai and Dvight Frie, plus leading man Melvin Douglas. There are all real ingredients: bats, a castle with many stone stairs, a crazy scientist, citizens who waving torches and vampire hunters, a figure of "Igora", a beautiful girl, even a foolish Burgomister. Working on a camera with a soft focus is crazy and imaginative. There is even a good comic relief that is nicely arranged by the script. But this is not really a monstrous movie, because there is nothing supernatural in "Kleinschloss" ("small castle"). The action revolves around a generic crazy scientist (who acted nicely at Atvill) who appreciates his work much more than human life. It is not the top material, because of the ho-hum resolution of the action and some embarrassing bad dialogue for Dvighta Frie. But it's worth a look if you like wound b / v horror pictures.
