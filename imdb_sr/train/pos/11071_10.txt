I'm giving ten of the top ten movies ever. Absolutely shattered, stunned and stunned by the whole picture, beautiful play by Jason Statham, Ray Liotte and all teams, an incredible plot ... Just look at yourself and get your courage to admit - it touched your soul, because that's weird, but there are all answers which you ever sought ... Best, mr. Ritchie! THE VERI BEST EVER. Those who searched for simple figures and skirmishes were still shouting that they were disappointed. But in Hollywood today there are plenty of shallow films, you can not think about what's next day. On the contrary, the Revolver is unique, I barely expected it to be possible to display such a clear and ingenious image of me, about everyone who watched it. Absolutely unmatched, stunning, glittering ... I can get an insight into this, I have no doubt about it. In fact, none of the words can express my admiration ... I'm still wondering how it was possible to record such a film after years of bulky Hollywood garbage we watched. Thank you from the heart, it's just the best.
