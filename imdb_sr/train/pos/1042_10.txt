The American, her husband and children from Europe are returning to her mother's house in "Vatch on the Rhine", a 1943 film based on Lillian Hellman's play, in the lead role by Paul Lukas (whom I believe repeats her stage-play here) Bette Davis, Lucile Vatson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Voods. An anti-fascist, worker in the underground movement, many times injured and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lukas) needs a long break on the property of his rich mother-in-law. But he reveals that there is really no escape because one of the hosts (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and more than willing to sell him. In this film there are many plays written very much to point out the liberal point Lillian Hellman. This was definitely a powerful propaganda vehicle at a time when it was liberated, such as the evil war and what happened to people in other countries came to safe American homes. Today's big controversy is that Paul Lukas won the Oscar for Humphreys Bogart in "Casablanca". Humphrei Bogart was a great screen and fantastic Rick, but Lukas is transcendental as Kurt. The monologue of his need for killing is swallowing, just to mention one scene. Although this is not what Bette Davis is thinking about, she gives her a masterpiece here as Kurt's loyal and beloved wife, Sara. Her acting sorrows in the heart, and love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender. The last half hour of the film has tired me with sincerity of emotion. Lillian Hellman is not everybody's tea, but unlike Little Fokes, she has written some truly cute, beautiful characters and a nice story, given that Varner Brothers added A casting and production values. Recommended.
