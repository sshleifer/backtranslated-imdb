. . . or knock on a computer keyboard, it would probably give this epic movie a rating of "10". After all, no elephant is shown killed during the film; It is not even implied that anyone is injured. On the contrary, ELEFANT VULK master, Peter Finch, complains that he can not kill any of the nipples - no matter how threatened - without permission from the government (and his tone suggests that such permits are not within the reality of probability). Moreover, the elements come together - in the form of unusual drought and human cholera epidemics - to leave the plant of the Vilei planted by total destruction by elephant people (as the natives call them) to close the story. If you accidentally see the current Earth show, you will discover that Elephant Eleven today is weaker.
