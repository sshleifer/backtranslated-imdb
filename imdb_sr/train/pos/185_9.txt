I finally bought and added a copy of "Shov People" to my collection. I can not comment on anything more than what the previous viewers have cited and the characters, the complication, and the overall quality of this film without repeating their own words. Watching the camera, the appearance beyond the character of so many M-G-M quiet stars is worth watching itself. I really like the scene where Marion Davies plays and on which she plays herself in the film, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure to read her lips because there is no title card that shows what she's saying when she sees Marion Davies, but that's something like the effect "I do not think I like it!" Get the corn, put the tape and get ready to return more than three quarters of a century in the history of film making. Enjoy!
