The superb star quality of Gerard Philippe, who has died too young, jumps from the screen in this witty, funny, cunning comedy with many swordsman swordsmen. Charmingly corrupted in her narration, it is impossible to resist. Cute romantic comedy with a very young Gin Lollobrigida as a love interest. A movie that you will remember with great affection.
