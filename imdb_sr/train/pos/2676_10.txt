Every day we can watch a lot of movies, soap ... on television. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great movie, with real feelings, with great actors, with a brilliant director. For me, there are two films that everyone should see: the first one is Pacula? "Sophie's Choice" with Meril Streep. The other is the "Hope of Hope". As human beings, we must learn humility, love for others, the acceptance of another civilization, the second way of life. We must fight against racism and fascism. We must avoid the trial, criticize; We just have to love our earthly companion. This wonderful movie helps us to reach his dream (John Lennon): Imagine that all people who live live in peace. These two films are hard to see: watch them, but you will surely be hurt, but better. Great movie, great actors, horrible stories, pain and screams guarantee, but also a better understanding of others. Enjoy.
