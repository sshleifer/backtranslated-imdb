This movie is great. Simply. It's rare that comedy with levels is found, and that's a good example of such. When I first saw this movie, while the loan turned, my friend and I looked and asked ... "Did you catch that? For those who doubt, take a look at the levels. See the comparisons between Vic and people in the club, DNA! You see different characters, each is fighting for the position, and if you do not see anything else, look at the link between Vick and the path through the movie. It's all in Vick's Head! An introductory line about the Vick world. The final scene with a camera that enters Vick's head, and inside, the entire universe! Thorough quotation, beautiful cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
