20 of 10 This is a really wonderful story about the war-evacuated and scary carpenter Tom Owlly. The boy (Villiam Beech) was rewarded with Tom, and it is now obvious that he has serious problems when he first got a bed. William is illiterate and scared, but somehow the two of them find the comfort in mutual loneliness. It turned out that William has talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a choir in the amusing performance of Jerusalem. Villiam is getting acquainted with Zacharias Vrench, a young Jewish young man also from London and together with Tom and Zachari, finally learns to read and write and feel like part of this small neighborhood. Just as he calmed down, Villiam returned him to London from his mother, and we just see why he's so fucked up. His mother is apparently mentally ill, and when Tom does not hear Villiam, he travels to London to look for him. Finally he finds him holding his dead sister in which he was tied up in the basement. After a period at the hospital, Tom realizes that he must take him and take him home. The highlight is a bitter-sweet ending when it was said that Villiam would adopt him, while at the same time he learned that his best friend Zacharias was killed in an air strike in London. For me, one of the most scenic scenes was when Tom talked to a housewife official. I love them, for what's worth, I think he likes me too. Is it simply not better to do it?
