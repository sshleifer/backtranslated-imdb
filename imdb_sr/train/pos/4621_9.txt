Taking into account all teenage films such as "Breakfast Club" and "Pretti In Pink" that are lionized. It is surprising that this is so ignored. In it there is no sex, but it refers to sex, including the idea that it may be important what others think about it. Children do not always agree with their parents, but neither parents nor children are seen as always right or wrong, and parents are not seen as monsters. It deals with the worship of the hero. How a girl does a dangerous thing, which could lead to real dust, before she realized she had made a mistake. The film is a little ahead of its time. One kid asks another child what kind of birth control he is using. She says she does not do anything to control birth. Fits (wrong) "oral sex".
