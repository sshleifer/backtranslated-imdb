Why is this movie rated so low?! I've seen this movie over 25 times, I know every line for this movie. Obviously I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (South Park creators and Team America's new puppet masterpiece) are Joe Cooper, or Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "Sir Svish". Mostly just called Coop and Remer during the entire movie. Just as the film begins, it reminds us of the money-hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports, even going so far to make one called "Tovnsell". I have to quote this part of the film because it's true with some sporting beginnings: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, the year for Arganaute in Toronto, plus one season as better in Desert Inno. I'm glad to finally play here in the fine city of Miami. "His agent leaned down:" Minnesota. " Let's not forget this important part of the movie. So Coop and Remer begin to celebrate high school and realize they are still nothing to talk to their old colleagues. Outside they create a sporty BASEketball after being challenged by probably basketball heroes. After embarrassing them, the sport goes for about a year. During this time, they are recruiting their third teammate Skueak, who is actually the day after they invented the game. As the film follows, we learn that Coop, Remer and Skueak are the only virtuous sports heroes who have remained. The story follows with cramped pupils, Milwaukee Beers fans and a humorous feeling that is so absurd that they will leave you to cry more. Look at him, that's funny.
