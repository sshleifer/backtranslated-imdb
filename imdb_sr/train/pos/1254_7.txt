The work of Ed Harris in this film corresponds to his usual standard of excellence, that is, he removes the screen from anyone with whom he shares, including the great Sean Conneri. The film, which is more than desirable, is revived only in scenes when Harris examines the lawyer of another convict. It's an amazing, master class in artistic control. Other band members are skilled and Conneri is as reliable as Fishbourne, but the story itself does not go by. The plot depends largely on the assumption that a black prisoner will always be abused and forced by white policemen. This is the engine that triggers the story, right or wrong, and makes you feel a bit cheated in the end. Still, it's worth watching to see Harris in action.
