Film "comedies" today are mostly 100 minutes of toilet humor, ugly speech and bumping a groin. Modern comedies attract the lowest common denominator, undemanding and slow in the brain. Of course, the occasional good comedy will appear, but they become increasingly rare. "Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cari Grant and Mirna Loi) decide to build a house in the suburbs of Connecticut. The film follows their story, starting from a trip to house hunting, to the noisy construction of a house, and so on. all the way to the ready-made home - with their "zuzu-zuz water softener." Their role, of course, (Grant is especially funny as he looks at the cost of the house without control). However, the film was stolen by the wise lawyer Blandings, whom Melvin Douglas brought up to perfection. Manageing to steal every scene in which he is, Douglas is not funny enough that Blandings are blooming from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denni, as architect Blandings and Harri Shannon, who is like a solid old water drill, are also wonderful. I watched this movie many times and always makes me laugh I think it's a good movie to watch when you need an elevator, either to build a house or not.
