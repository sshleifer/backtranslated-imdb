What can be said, really ... "Tenant" is a first-rate thriller with equal amounts of uncertainty and full paranoia. It's an intricately drawn movie - every detail seems to be included for some reason - although the action rarely makes sense, and much is never addressed in an objective way. That is why we are becoming more and more unstable Trelkovski (Polanski) - a meek Polish man who got the apartment due to the suicide of the previous tenant - to lead us through the world of escalation of fear and uncertainty. After a group of mutilated colleagues threw a flat on the heating of the apartment, Trelkovsky found himself under an intensified, seemingly unexplainable examination by other tenants in his building; the rest of the film chroned his mental decline and gives us a fundamental thought on the line with the subsequent efforts of David Linch. The "tenant", however, is more obscure and evil, filled with unexpected comic relief, fine performances and a true result. It's a movie that's more experienced than described, so jump on it.
