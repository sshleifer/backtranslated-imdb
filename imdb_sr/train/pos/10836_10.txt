I thought this film was fantastic. It was hilarious. Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap. This must be seen for every fan of the '70s. (I hope that I and my friends will not be like that in twenty years!) Bill Nighi gives excellent performance as a top singer trying to rediscover that old spirit, /> Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the movie while the glue tries to hold the band together, but it does not work well. . You will not regret that you watched this movie. I know I do not know. Even my family thought this was ridiculous, and it says something.
