I picked this movie in my local library. After meeting the director at the film festival late last year, I was curious to "check" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. The film watches freshly-known topics, love, disbelief, friendship, jealousy. It can sometimes be a bit "talc", but never so much as to completely sink the film. I enjoyed watching a love story with figures that clearly belong together and watching them make informed decisions, and not accidentally "falling" into something as important as love. The black and black film is quite different. Take a look at. If you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of a sound pad like mine. Good thing!
