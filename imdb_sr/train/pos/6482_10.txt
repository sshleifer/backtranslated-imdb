I was just thirteen when I first saw this series and I watched it again, on the DVD, over thirty years later. Pictures through introductory credits never left me. This affected my view of the world and the nations in it. My parents were with me long enough to see a series with me, and we always talked about it. He gave me the love for studying history and the highest grade I got at public exams in our school! The voice of Laurence Olivier is timeless and perfect. I have the feeling that the people who lived it felt that this was their version of the history of the Second World War. I can not imagine ever bored. Perhaps similar to the Cold War could now be considered, although it is difficult to imagine who could replace Sir Laurence. Buy it!
