Mrs Patti Duke's story of her life and martial depression struggles was like my struggle for life. I saw myself behave like her. I was so amazed by the similarities of our lives to engage in sexual abuse that we both suffered as children. I saw a movie when it first premiered in 1990 and I loved this movie so much. Anyone who fought with a manic depression could get so much from this film. It does not matter if she showed her rewards or for what they were. That's not a problem here. The question is how Mrs. Duke was suffering and struggled to survive and overcome. Ms. Duke has a lot to be proud of in her accomplishments with her struggle to survive the disease, which often leaves many victims without hope. Unless a person personally fights with this disease, they do not know the hell they have to live with. My film was successful because it showed real problems and how a person is depressed and manic. It was so real ... so, really, really. It was like I was looking up there on the screen. I wish I could personally thank Mrs Patti Duke for the courage to make the public aware of her illness. Bocka
