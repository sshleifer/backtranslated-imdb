MEN OF HONOR has Cuba Gooding Jr. He plays Carla Brasheara, a man of high courage and heroism. He is a poor farmer from the south who wants to become a naval diver - but he has a problem because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert De Niro, is a racist redhead that still grows to respect Brashear. The film talks about how Brashear must agree with almost insurmountable prospects, not once but twice. The performances are what makes this film special. Gooding is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in film history, gives top performance - his best drama work in years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as DeNiro's much younger woman. The film is a bit too strong on the patriotism (though not close to the level that was in PATRIOT), and a few characters are only one dimensionally bad (Hal Holbrookov is nowadays rare in films), which is exciting and inconclusive.
