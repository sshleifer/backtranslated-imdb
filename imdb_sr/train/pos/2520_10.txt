Despite the fact that others have said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I waited to see him, but when I finally succeeded, I immediately fell in love. Of course, this is weird, but it only gives more exciting taste. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of Gackt's and Hide's first films. They did not do much, maybe 3 or 4 peaks. So give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best at the beginning. I believe they throw some strange situations there, but I'm watching how to find the best spots of this movie, the emotions that are being shown and what. That's why I gave, and I will always give this film 10 out of 10.
