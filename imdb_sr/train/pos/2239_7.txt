I suppose this film will only work on people who have all been cast out of the giant crook of the Lord of the Rings. Well, I was. And I really love this movie. I especially like all these flawless superheroes from LotR that are so perfectly and unfairly parodied. The most brilliant is Gandalf (a brave and wise and completely foolish wizard for all): Almghandi, cowardice and dead transvestite. Sauron's colleague ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) wears a bucket with an eye area with eye holes. Aragorns alter ego is another idiot who is trying to repair his broken sword ("Ulrike" legend) with whiskey. And "Strunzdumm" (pandan Vormtongu) really has some great resemblance to Brad Douriff! And do not forget Grumpflies and Heidi ... huh-huh
