Fido is a very strange movie. And in many ways, very good. My first thought after watching, is how, dammit, sell this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his story of a dog combined with a nostalgic comedy of the fifties with zombies. It does not go well with language. Fido has a little Shaun's massacre, laughter and belly. It is a completely different beast (forgive the dowry). Fido starts with a black and white informative film that explains the story of his back - people have won a war against zombies by developing a controlling necklace that restrains the carnivores in stupid servants. First I thought that we were in the fiftieth paranoia of parody in the cold war a la Matinee, but soon we entered the world of bright primary colors and fifties-classical nostalgia. Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely child that does not fit into school. His mother is a potential social climber, and his father is nervous and separated. Wishing to keep up with Jones, Mama (Carri-Anne Moss) got zombie. Jimmy is first uninterested, but 'Fido' (Billy Conellei) soon proves Jimmy is an excellent friend. While his necklace does not go brighter ... Fido is not a horror movie, but my movie problem is to find out exactly what it is. Much humor is a light family diversity, and sometimes the complication line relies heavily on the boy and his moments in the family / belt. Still, the film is filmed with beautiful dark, really funny moments, while it's welcome, it will provide R rating for what is, for a long time, family comedy. Film looks beautiful and beautifully performed by everyone involved. With its tough tone problems, I hope this film finds a niche because it's a pretty small gem in this year's film crash.
