I absolutely love this game to death. Since my ninth year (now I am 15 years old). It has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, accessories, and do not forget about the extremely great dragoon forms! I'm still waiting for a remake, binge, or continuation of this spectacular video game. You play as Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be a real hero. On this adventure, you meet the wonderful creatures and bosses of the boss. On the road you also meet some friends who have their own special element. Such as Fire, Darkness, Water / Led, Thunder / Lightning, Earth, Brightness and Wind. There are also objects known as dragoon ghosts, which allow you to turn into magical creatures of the legend. Dragons, wizards, beings called wings and evil creatures must face this adventure full of excitement and excitement. One of my favorite games, Legend of Dragoon!
