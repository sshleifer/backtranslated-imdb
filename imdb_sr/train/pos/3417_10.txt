Before I saw it, the topic was postponed, but this is not your average triumph over the story of troubles. Although this is technically about the blind Tibetan children climbing Mt. Everest, there's more. This film shows a very strong, often contradictory personality of two very successful blind adults who lead children, Erika and Sabriie. Erik is an American blind climber / athlete and Sabriie is a blind German academician who founded a school in Lhasa Tibet. Both are exceptional in their own way, but disagree about what will really build trust in children. Erik wants to come to the summit, while Sabri wants to enjoy Eric as an example and enjoy the moment. The nuances are complicated and one one is not quite sure who was right or the whole ascent was a mistake or a great idea. The deepest scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they faced before they found the way to school. Most of all I had a story about Tashi, a fragile teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents left him. I could watch the whole film about his life and I was happy when I learned that thanks to the school, he now runs a successful small company with some of his colleagues. If you like Spellbound or Murderball, you'll love this.
