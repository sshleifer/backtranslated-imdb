The war is hell. But this World War II documentary is paradise. Not only is this series a stunning, almost exhausting picture of the Second World War, it is a poetic masterpiece that was clearly and topically said by Laurence Olivier. /> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. It's been a long, no doubt long, but you will enjoy all of them and want to return for more and more. (I have a series on a DVD and I'm probably watching the series three times a year). Indeed, this is a flawless film work. Apart from Olivier, the best part of the series is listening to veterans who talk their stories; whether it's a real battle or finding a pig for a butcher so they can have something tasty for dinner. I'm going to watch it now (again, my ... 11th time).
