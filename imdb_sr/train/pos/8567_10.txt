I enjoyed the movie and I would suggest everyone to have a good time. Do not take the film too seriously because you remember it was Disney and it was ranked by G. Good entertainment is good, although some parts can be recognized by adults, but children will never notice, especially the "triangle" between Cruella, Le Pelt and Cruella. valet Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and really did Cruel to her, and it's probably scary even when she is "cured" of her way she loves fur, she can instill fear in the audience with her excitement that literally shakes the theater. (I even found myself jumping to my headquarters when he surprised you with his 'bipolarity' like a dog that loves Ella.) All in all, I'll see him again in the movies, I enjoyed so much.
