Unlike other comments, I found this film fascinating, even with all its errors and zombie acting by some actors. Being a technologist, I discovered that the experiments are interesting and hardware real. Although reading people's minds through computers sounds fantastic, experiments are now being carried out to do just that. I note that these experiments are at a very early stage, and the results so far were not favorable. The characters in the movie are well thrown. The girl, though a bit too exaggerated, seems pretty stupid. The truck driver is a ring for the right truck drivers. The Minister first doubts (The Chief Investigator tells the Minister that he (Minister) is not sure if he believes that God created man or man created God. His faith. Only that Doctor plays zombies, and the secrets they conceal are suitable for their characters. the face of death they react as human beings would create. Film is a warning against the dangers of unrestrained control by the government, because the strictly triloger, the film does not have enough excitement, and as a scientific exercise with philosophical foundations is fascinating.
