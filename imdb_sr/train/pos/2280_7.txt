It's hard to categorize a movie - maybe it's an avant-garde spy thriller? Mother's Night is a very good Vonnegut novel, and certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt to a feature film. Film adaptation is very true to the original book. Indie's approach to the way this film is produced is probably more effective than being financed by a large Hollywood studio. These days I doubt that an intelligent novel like Mother Night would ever get a green light from big Hollywood houses. And normally it's too bad, but not in this case. Mother Mother has a solid and solid role. Nick Nolte, who seems to get better roles while older, still has that "personman" person who allows him to take up a wide range of different characters. Cheryl Lee is beautiful and brilliant as ever. I always thought she deserved better than she left the entertainment industry. I guess your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with a low broadcasting time is not the best role, even if TV shows become less likely. In any case, this movie is completely fun and you do not have to read a book to understand the movie. In fact, given today's geopolitical reality, the premise of the novel can be dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be completely confused by the events taking place (I am telling you, fellow Americans who are students and who have the lowest grade in the industrialized world in geography, history, and the master knows what other subjects!).
