Nothing is more pleasant to me than a story that is cautious or uncertain, which keeps you guessing that everything will end. And that's exactly what is happening in DEATHTRAP, based on the exciting play by Ira Levin ("Rosemari's Babi"). Laurence Olivier retreated to SLEUTH - with almost the same skill and as many puzzles as he ever had in that extraordinary clever game. As far as the outcome is concerned, it is difficult to write a conspiracy review. Let's just say that what we know in the beginning is everything you need to know about the movie for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is a crazy jealous drama writer whose latest drama is defeated. When his young writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends a manuscript of his drama, Kane realizes that his release as his own will solve all of his problems and return his reputation. From that moment, it's a matter of entertainment and games for the audience, while the story of Ira Levin takes place, manages to outstrip Agatha Christie for the number of turns. Caine and Reeve play each other brilliantly, each delivers a certain dynamic tension of the story as well as some witty touches coming from a scenario that plays dramatically with humor. In short: Well worth seeing - but not everyone is satisfied with the ending.
