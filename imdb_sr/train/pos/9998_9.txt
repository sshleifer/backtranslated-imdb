Since the average number of votes was rather low, and the fact that the video employee considered it "okay", I did not have much expectation when I rented this movie. Up, I enjoyed a lot. This is a charming film. It did not have to grow, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a great performance as the main character, I think it is somewhat different from his usual personality in his films. , and all in all this is very pleasant and very easy to watch movies. Highly recommended.
