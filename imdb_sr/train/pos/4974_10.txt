This was a wonderful presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god has so well played animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbish superiority and innocent wonder. The quotation (or scenes) that I vividly remember is when Hemo Rubber "all this plumbing ... you did not even learn my secrets" and threatens to get away, the scientist answers one word "Thalassa" - salt water that terrifies the fiction writer, but it softens Hemo and so fits nicely into the chemical aspects of the blood. Such a wonderful mix of entertainment and information makes this classic fresh and more interesting today as the day it is published. Stimulating interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching children to love learning.
