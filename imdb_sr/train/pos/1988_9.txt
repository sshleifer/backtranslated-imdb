First of all, I would like to make a correction for another review of this film, which said that the last musical that won the Best Film Academy Award was 'Gigi' in 1958. 'We Fair Ladi' won in 1965 and 'Sound of Music' won the year after that. Still, this movie is absolutely fantastic! The story of the novel has been somewhat changed, but this is more because of the restrictions they had on the stage that they simply did not return to the recorded version. However, I do not mind. In fact, I rather think that the whole production is better than the novel does. I love Nancy to bring Oliver to the bridge with her and to be killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie are those that make me laugh. I love the moment when Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start coming out from the office of the Governor. The emphasis for that moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this film are Jack Vild, who plays Best Dodger in any movie version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and witty Fagin (this character is worked out much better than in a book) and Shani Vallis, the strongest, most vulnerable version Nancy. The only reason I gave this film 9 instead of 10 is due to two large production numbers that are 'Concider Iourself' and 'Vho Vill Bui'. I always hate when choreography in musicals should look like people are doing day-to-day jobs and jobs. It looks terrible and sour, especially when playing in London Meat Co.. They were supposed to do regular choreography for these scenes. However, this film is rarely a treasure that will remain with us, we hope, forever.
