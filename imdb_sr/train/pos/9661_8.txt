After losing Emma for her performance as Mama Rose in the television version of GIPSI, Bette won Emma the following year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live concert recorded for HBO from Las Vegas. Midler, who has been performing live on the scene since the 1970s, proves she is still one of the most effective live performers in the industry. From her opening number, her classic "Friend", where she descends from the wings on a beautiful cloud, Bette orders a stage with a style and charisma from a rap-stylized number called "Good Looks", and then proves she's in a joke like a little other performers in this business while pervading through various music selections. The broadcast section in which she welcomes Burlesque lasts a bit too long, but she manages to include her old jokes Sophie Tucker here in good advantage (although she actually forgets a joke in the middle of a story, but her ad-libbing does not remember she's hysterical). Bette treats us on Rose's Turn from GIPSI and the title melody from her smash film THE ROSE, as well as the shameless connection for her hit FIRST VIVES CLUB. She brings the house to the end with "Stai vith Me, Babi" from THE ROSE and her only hit album "Vind Beneath Mi Vings" from BEACH. It's a great evening of fun musical comedy and for fans of Midlera, it's a must.
