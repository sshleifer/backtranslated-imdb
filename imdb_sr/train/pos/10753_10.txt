For those who say this film deserves something under the ungrateful mercy it showed, I disagree. This is an incredible documentary about a shocking day. IMDB asks us to rate this film. Please take into consideration the fact that the documentary was made. The courage to shoot this movie is most memorable. We think that these two brothers separated when that moment occurred. They continue to document the bravest courage without knowledge of their own and other security. To assess whether the nobility was to record a recording of this tragedy or to save lives from those incredible, incredible firemen were not mine. I only know that in 30 years, the class of full children will not know one without another. I support wholeheartedly 10. That's why the art of recording has been created! To capture the natural emotions offered by real life. You can keep your kung fu garbage. Romantic is sweet. The action will never reach that level. This film, September 11th, will be timeless in that it did not glorify it. She did not have a shrill look. She did not have all the obvious vanities that the lion's share of many films on many screens blew. She had a class, compassion, essence, and she had a record of the day that changed the modern face of America, and even the world. They talked about things that are inevitable around the camera. Please, think about this film, as I have proclaimed myself, with exciting respect for all those who fell because of the free, beautiful name of America. decorates the natural courage of real people who behave in unreal time. I like "Kuma", but "9/11" is forever different kind of film because it is now a different world. It's art without question or question. Jf
