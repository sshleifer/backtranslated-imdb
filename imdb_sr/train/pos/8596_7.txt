I thought the guard would be the central movie. When I finally saw him, I took a good surprise. a series like 24 or Alias. It is very similar to that series and reminded me of the thriller Wolfgang Petersen in the fire line. Movie history, you will be disappointed. But if you go with little expectations, you will enjoy the guard. Rating: 7
