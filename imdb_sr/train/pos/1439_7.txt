CITI HALL is a slightly mixed bag. Part of the vignette of political life in New York and part of a moralizing story. Al Pacino, Dukakis-eskue Boss with presidential dreams, often gives a sour or humorous performance. There are several times when the chewing landscape, and in the case of CITI HALL, here it shines. John Kuzak gives a humiliated and generally flawless performance, not entering into the neuro-caricature of the Neville Orchestra's dialect, or by slipping in the melodrama during the peak of the films. Danni Aiello as a political boss is also very good. And I love shovtunes. The main problem with CITI HALL, and it's a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of lack of momentum. He appears more like a documentary than a movie. We see an action or follow the story from a separate perspective, and, of course, the viewer does not turn on. When the viewer does not get involved to a certain extent, they become indifferent to the characters, and finally, the complication. , came out as "Hmmm ... uh ... okay." They say that "the city hall can not be fought," as the clich√© passes. However, it still can not prevent you from thinking about what could be, that they only sharpened the scenario and pace of this film.
