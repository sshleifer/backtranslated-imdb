Dear God, where to start. This is a bar that's not the best movie I've ever seen. Camera angles are excellent, but in my opinion, the performance was the best. why script writers for this movie do not write big budget movies that I will never understand. The other is an actor. that's great. that's probably the best movie that's been shot there. I know that some of you there probably think "there is no way to get much better," but not your mistake. raptor island is an artwork. I hope he was supposed to get the best movie of the year instead of that nasty Crash movie with a bunch of no names and no predators. I believe this film is indeed the most beautiful thing EVER.
