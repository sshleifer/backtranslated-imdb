Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit does not lie solely in American civil liberties, but in the hearts and minds of people everywhere, the Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief into a Danish high school in 1969. More specifically, he breaks into a crusade by a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively cruel and brave abusive director, Bent Meining. Adapted from the real story, performances are performed with a certain suicide, and a refreshing order over diverse characters keeps it involved. The battle of ideology between the 13-year-old and the demented disciplines gives way to inherent humor, but clumsy changes in the disorientation of mood, despite the fact that it is cynical in the same spirit as the "Society of Dead Poets" more than "Matilda." She goes through the famous track, but the continuous and precise service to the young protagonist, including the personal subclot that surrounds Frits as a young man who becomes a young man, manages to raise the film into an exciting family film with her nose right to money.
