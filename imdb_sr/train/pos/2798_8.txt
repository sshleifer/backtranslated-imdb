Jess is 18, she is very smart and does not want anything more than playing football, when joining the local team, she has to lie to her parents over and over again, because they would never approve to pursue her dream, they want to settle down a good Indian boy and learn how to cook. The band that's like Beckham is a very funny feeling of a good movie that does not have to be deep and complex, that's all right. The actors are very good and play their roles well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny. Large family film 8/10
