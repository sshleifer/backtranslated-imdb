I know that many people do not like this movie, but I think it's wonderful. I can not say much, but the movie is a good movie that I think is good. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are many ridiculous lines in the film, especially as Briggita teaches about what society is doing and what does not. If you like musicals, I would say that you like this one!
