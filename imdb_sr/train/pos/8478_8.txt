I saw this movie as a child and broke my heart! No other story had such an incomplete ending ... I grew up on many great anime films and this was one of my favorite films, because it was so unusual - the story of injustice, cruelty, loneliness and life, and the choice can not be undone and the need for others. Chirin makes himself alone when a wolf kills his mother, but the wolf is alone when Chirin follows him into the mountain. The Wolf does not kill the lamb, although every evening says "maybe I'll eat you tomorrow." The tape I have is broken and degraded by age and use. I will fix it and watch the movie again one day and cry as hard as I did as a child. Such stories, with this depth and feeling, and this intricacy of meaning, are very rare. It's a sad story, but I've never encountered any kind of catharsis. I'm glad to watch this movie, and I'm glad to see him as a child.
