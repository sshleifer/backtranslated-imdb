This movie deserved better. It's great fun, there are some wonderful jokes and humorous aspects, some of the things for "Geekes" among us (and we know who we are), and the effects are really effective. Watching the fiancee Paul Reubens on the winner of the Oscars is worth the price only. I never read comics before I saw the movie, but since then. no matter how good they are, I still recommend MM film. (Although Flaming Carrot as a character would be cool, too) Greg Kinnear is, well, ... incredible as Captain Amazing, and NONE the other can not be Shoveller except Villy H. Mation My favorite line in the movie? "We have a meeting with destiny. And it looks like she ordered a lobster." Watch this movie. BUY this movie! It's only $ 5 and some changes in local Val-Mart. You will thank me. You really want to. Oh, and Mrs. Garrafolo is in her. To make him look worthwhile
