Haiao Miiazaki is not the same when it comes to hand-drawn animation as a form of narration, but is often compared with Valt Disney. It is so unfair, because it becomes visible by watching Miyazaki's films that he is a top-notch artist. He really has a gift of excitement for both adults and children, and Laputa is really one great ride. But where can I begin to describe a movie that is so magical and breathless? Miyazaki's works never stopped me. Laputa is an adventure of great proportions and I wonder how the movie can be so full of detail and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a child who dreams of such a great adventure and so magical, how would that be? The answer would be to connect to a seat and look at Laput because it's really fantasy from childhood. Every minute of the movie is rich and stunning ... from trajectory to train to staggering flight sequences ... and to a marvelous view of a floating castle. Not to mention the excellent result of Joe Hisaishi! Everything you want from an adventurous movie is here.
