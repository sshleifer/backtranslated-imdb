I just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially beautiful movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters are pretty and beautifully made, but what really shines is a digital set design. More inspired by traditional animated films than reality, design gives you really, really looking at the world in the stunning use of color. Sometimes it touches reality (especially water was impressive), but nevertheless, it's a fantasy world based on reality. Including a multitude of enormous landscapes, it is especially helpful to reduce the cost of rendering. Picard films shine with technical shine, this shine with the effective use of technical knowledge. Enough enough technical tricks, fun, family and sometimes just funny fun.
