When watching this movie, you should notice that this is not a normal movie. There's no real story, just characters, a bunch of gangsters that associate in perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can only lie and listen. The film highlights why it is difficult to find the right way to describe it. Therefore, the user's comments on this film are so mixed. I love the movie and I recommend it to everyone who likes one-liners and things that are different from "normal". You can not really put your finger on something that's so beautiful, it's just a comical world where gangsters rule. Place of love and danger. A movie that you can see many times.
