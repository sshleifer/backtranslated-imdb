Was the script more suitable for a 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but they still work. I thought actors did a fantastic job with a mild scenario, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people in the committee really hate this movie. I do not personally see how this could be, but Envi is just one of those movies that you either love or hate. Similar to Napoleon Dynamites and every Leslie Neilsen movie ever made. Or think it's one of the worst movies ever made or one of the happiest. Do not avoid this movie for comment. Watch him and see if you are one of those who really like him! If you do, I guarantee it is worth your money. If you do not like ... well, now you know.
