I watched this movie yesterday and I must say that it's the best horor movie made for the $ 36,000 I've ever seen (Sorri Steckler). The film is certainly worth the search if you are a fan of zombies. This film gives the soul and the atmosphere. Some zombies are the best ever shot. VERY ghastly, looking at dusty bodies, they slowly devour their victims. Brrrrrrr. Hotly relaxed Canadian women with sexy accents will keep you preoccupied before HORROR takes your head to eat the dead. This film was played from the beginning to the end. I could not ask for more than that. My only complaint is that it's too short.
