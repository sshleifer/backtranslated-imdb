Tea Leoni plays Noru Vilde, a serious photographer who goes through a bad divorce. She wants her freedom, but she comes at a price. She wants a legitimate photo, but she's hired to work for tabloids like paparazzi. Her boss plays a wonderful and divine Holland Tailor. The show was mostly written well. Nina Tea began to develop into an unforgettable character, but the network did not support comedy and is still missing. Even when they brought George Wendt from Cheers, they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters. The show was fine at first and the audience got used to it, but then the network broke down as a bad plastic surgery.
