Stunning. Absolutely stunning. This is a film about two children, whose father suddenly has a vision. He claims that the angel visits him and tells him that they have to kill the "demons". Later, he receives instructions and begins to preoccupy the demons, who, by their naked eye, are ordinary people. They kill the so-called. Demons with an ax with their heads, and crushing them, burying them in the rose garden. Their father claims to see their sins when he touches them. The film continues, with a turn at the end. What I love in this movie is that it perfectly captures the fragility of human perception. Is their father totally crazy? Or is it telling the truth? The audience remains deciding. Go make a decision for yourself, and watch a movie. Now.
