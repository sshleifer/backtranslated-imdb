I just got back from Zero Dai's premiere in Montreal ... and I'm surprised to find a negative comment on the film. Basically, the fault is that Coccio is doing a light and exaggerated social message ... well, Mr's reviewer, it's a simple and full-fledged critic of social-charged films. I do not want to bring my life here, but I come from a small city with a similar school than these guys. Reject & Not Knowing Menu. The thing is ... I understand how young children can lead to such a horror. Secondary schools have become fields of conformity. It's a real ugly sight. You have to fight to be like the rest. It's hard to explain, many people do not realize that high schools become human intelligence cemeteries. In the meantime, parents close their eyes and laugh about how their life in the neighborhood is perfect. The real motive of the movie is not what drives them. It is about this peaceful suburb and to all who close your eyes and try to create the atmosphere of the perfect city. Cal said it well. It's a wake-up call. Drama is everywhere and she can take every form. In this case, small drama (as Andre calls the jacket carrying jacket from J.C. Penny) turn into the worst nightmare of the whole city. Andre & Cal used the most extreme way to express his pain. The discomfort of mismatch in an era where you need more than ever to be like others to be accepted. In particular, I like the last scenes in which some fell victims of the Andre & Cal crosses, as if with the pain they reported, Cal & Andre announced their blind rage to their community, refusing to think about the causes of some of the works . It might seem aggressive as a movie, but Coccio meditates more than vhining or enunciating. What Andre & Cal lives is reality ... and scary that can come to other kids. An upsetting movie ... Homecoming and a powerful feeling made Ben Coccioa a very disturbing movie.
