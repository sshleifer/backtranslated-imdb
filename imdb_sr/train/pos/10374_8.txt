I sat through a very comfortable 45 minutes ROLL speed. Roll is about a rural boy, Math (Toby Malone) who has dreams of becoming a sports star. Matt travels to the city and needs to be picked up by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, it was a plan anyway. George is involved with the gangster, Tini (John Batchelor) and makes his delivery. Needless to say, Mat gets into George's world. I thought it was great how Mat taught George about morality and respect, while George teaches Mat how to relax a little and enjoy life. Tobi and Damien were well-fed and did a great job. Every character in the film was greatly praised, the two policemen were great. David Ngoombujarra has brought some great comedy movie to the film. Tini played a cute gangster who reminded me of one of my favorite characters 'Pando' from Tvo Hands. He lived for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was nice to see the sights and sights with which I grew up, especially the old Ferris Wheel. This Rocks 'n' Rolls
