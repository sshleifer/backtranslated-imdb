I just saw the Australian prime minister Shover [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. Program notes indicate that this is a perfect pleasure - unobtrusively made, touching, funny, dramatic and powerful. I can not agree more. I just hope that other festival films will welcome this standard of entertainment and I'm looking forward to seeing more Chinese films in Sydney in the coming months.
