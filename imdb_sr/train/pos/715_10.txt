All the people who sit here and say that the weak link of this film is Ramones, they would probably say that Amadeus is fine, if not because of this irritating harpsichord. Rock and Roll High School was located around Ramones. How can anyone look at this, and not get out of Joe Ramona, eating the calls of the scenes behind the scenes in an effort to keep him in the state of affairs, is obviously a wet blanket of square dad. Ms. Trogar, exploding white mice, patrols in the hall ... the current classics. If you do not like Ramones, then you do not know rock and roll and you do not deserve to watch the movie ROCK AND ROLL High School.
