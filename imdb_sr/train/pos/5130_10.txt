... may look exaggerated, but not. What's so difficult to understand is - why did not they make more musical short films like this one? Was the beauty of it completely visible to all who were involved? Apparently not. So many short short films are made only for commercial reasons, and with some luck, there may be some artistic values ​​in them. This is one exception - the only one? - where the director seems to have a vision and could clearly appreciate music as an art. Why did not anyone ever think he shot Lester or Charles Parker live? Crazy, man. It's a pity that there were no extensions. If you saw something of a similar quality, divide it!
