Ah, the best and most entertaining film about female football fans, just a bit better than the 1982 teenage mistake of a teenager in northern London. By the way, I've just seen this on Film 4 [2008-12-21] and I've been ruining my inability to set up a PVR). It's simply my second favorite soccer film after "Mike Bassett: England Manager", but this time with an additional turn of the watch as a guerrilla piece of film made by a team that obviously continues to shoot movies that are banned in the country they are making (just think about where the girls are taken from the stadium just like the Sun sets: quick reactions on all sides). It's very rare that the film smiles loudly, but when a rural soldier took one of the girls to the lioness, forcing him to wear an injection of a mask made from the poster Ali Daey, I could not stop staying in the house with my frets, especially when the young the soldier misunderstood the calls of his grandfather for help ... When we are at toilet, I would just like to speak Farsi so that I can elaborate writing on the walls of the toilets (yes, there were several scribblings in the roman script, but mostly related to US American rock bands). Also, in the rural and Farsi topics, do not you think Omid Djalli sounds like a joke when talking to the Farce? Listen to the sergeant in this movie, then go "Yes." I will not go into the sexual politics of Iran, and I will not bother about the suspicious. act; my love for this film comes from scenarios and editing: top things. Here are the lists of my favorite football films: 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. One Glori Glori Dani 4. Shot at Glori 5. Arsenal Stadium Misteri
