This film is one of my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amila and My Life as a Dog. Similarities with these films, as well as with many great foreign films, is that it occupies a regular part of life and turns it into a deep lesson. In Japan, a man who has bored his daily life and the breadth of his marital life, sees a beautiful Japanese looking through the window of a dance studio. At the moment when his train passes, he is fascinated by her. But is it only because of her beauty, her distant glance, or the relationship that they will discover to share? Shall Ve Dance has unforgettable beautiful characters that have to deal with painful realities by overcoming them through the world of dance. Breaking traditional molds and stereo types of Japanese society, they risk everything for happiness and feel that joy is not far away. It is one of those films that are so magical and meaningful, and in itself, transcend the earthly display of real magic and wonder that life can be.
