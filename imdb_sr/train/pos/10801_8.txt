Frankly, when I saw this movie a few years ago, I immediately wanted to exclude it. While I sat for the next 10 minutes, I realized that the actor who plays Navin stole the show. His facial expressions and comic behavior shook my head on why he was not in more comedies. There's that "Marty Feldman" thing for him, but much, much more talent ... not getting anything from Marty. The movie really shocked me how close I was with the original Jerkom, but again, that was so much. I really think that if this film was first published, and I saw the movie Steve Martin second, I would think that the other was cheap. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but it's true. I really like Steve Martin, but his performance is another actor in The Jerk Too. I wish I could get a copy for my collection. I invite you to see it if you find it.
