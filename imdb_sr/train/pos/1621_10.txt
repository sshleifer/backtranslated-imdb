Harman and Isings 'Old Mill Pond' is a real masterpiece of art of animation. The perfect skill and skill that characterizes this duo's work is nothing more than in this caricature. It's a shame that so many people can see only an insult to what is, and what should always be, the bright heart of the party, which in no way tried to disparage black people. If nothing else, it is a tribute to the contagious humor and musicality of the black race. I could not see this garment for many years, because 'racial commissioners' in England considered it too offensive to be shown in multi-racial Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I would very much like to look again at this masterpiece. I think that those who routinely search for messages and intentions that have never been intended for these cartoons, which are, after all, sixty years old, should try to be amused and remember that the world today is completely different, but that does not mean that everyone has the right to censor what is seen from the past.
