I'm not familiar with Largo Vinch as a comic book (or is it a graphic novel? Actually I do not know), but I have to admit, hearing about the agent / hero, I expected something completely different from what I actually got. While it was surprising to watch at first, it was nice to look at this move. You could never say where it will go (some turns are predictable, but you can not say at all if this will end). More than a great performance by a leading actor and really good support, make this clock comfortable. Not as an action packed as some might hope or expect for such a movie, but a really good mix.
