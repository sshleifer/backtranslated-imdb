Straight It is a multiracial research on the goodness and beauty of America. On one level, a slow walk through the heart, kind people and yellow grain, on the second level of aging and remembering what is important (and actively forgetting what is not). David Linch gives us time in this movie and helps me remember that so much can be said with silence. An extraordinary movie that will rest easy with me for a while.
