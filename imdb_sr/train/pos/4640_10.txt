This is one of the best films I've seen in the last 2 years (I've seen the prime minister in Tel Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war began ...) This problem in communication between People who are causing wars is interested I have seen Bubble three times, and it is still surprising and exciting - every character reminds me of one of the many people I know, and the difference between them, such as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw that - it was with my friend, who is a Christian Arab, and it was on the Independence Day of Israel (the smallest possible! How ironic) and ... he finally cried !!! - if he was touched and not embarrassed - everyone would be touched by Bubble!
