The masterpiece of comedy, the masterpiece of horror, the masterpiece of romance, if there is anything negative about the Chinese ghost story, it might be that the special effects seemed outdated in relation to modern technology. The film has a simple premise: the poor collector of debts must remain in a hidden area while trying to collect the debt. Of course, this has been persecuted. What I did not expect for the first time when I saw this movie was that it was one of the most lovable love stories I've ever seen; It is without loss of any of the comedy slapsticks that will have you in the seams. Unlike some Asian cinema films, the story of the Chinese spirit is not hard to swallow for those who are not familiar with Chinese culture. Indeed, it is played on timeless topics of paranormal and romantic cultures. Think about Evil Dead 2, if you have cast a lovely love story in mik. This film is real, despite the fact that many people ignore it. It's absolutely among the best I've ever seen. The ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross-border cultural borders to attract everyone to humanity is nothing more than fantastic. Very recommended, 10/10.
