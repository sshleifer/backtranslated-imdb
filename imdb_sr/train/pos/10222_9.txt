It is unlikely that the duo Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte have teamed up to give us some interesting performances and the theme in The Angel Levine. This is an interesting turn on topics from the "Wonderful Life". Zero is married to Idom Kaminski and the two belong to the special class of the old Jewish poor in New York. Mostel was once a tailor and proud of his store, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminski is mostly tied to a bed. He declined to apply for the benefit. In despair as Jimmy Stevart, he shouts to God for help. Now, if he got someone like Henry Travers, things may have been different, but even Stevart had trouble accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing for him, he was over 100 years old from this mortal coil and all his links to earthly things have disappeared. God sent Mostel a completely different, recently deceased Harria Belafontea, who was supposed to have at least some basic training for angels before he was assigned the task. there are still many problems. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know that he died, was hit by a car at the very beginning of the film. You put his questions and questions of Mostel and you have a good conflict, starting with the fact that Mostel can not believe in a black Jew named Levine. It was a farewell performance for Polish / Jewish. actress Ida Kaminski, who won a nomination for the best actress in a store on the main street a few years ago. The other prominent role is that Irish actor Milo O'Shea acted as a good Jewish doctor. Recalling O'Shea's excuse from the verdict, I was really surprised to see him and hear him leave the doctor. Angel Levine poses some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society. It was brought to you by a starred actor and of course created by the acclaimed writer Bernard Malamud. Make sure you catch it when you broadcast.
