As for many, I can not but compliment the actors and the team that developed Talespin and others who worked during my childhood, and everyone who commented here fully enjoyed the quality of not only animation, but also the quality of the story. Lines and characters. To classify this artwork as a "cartoon" you would never be able to do talespin justice, in fact, it's an insult to classify as a "cartoon", Talespin is an animation and nothing less, it's obvious that this is the greatest genius piece produced in Disney until today, when Disney's "pulled" out of the air little understood what they did and I'm sure their souls had been regretted since then. Br /> I'll take a moment to explain, from the first that ducktales did to the last one I think was Darkwing the Duck, Disney was tormented by failures due to political correctness and took a quantum leap back from, They prefer that Quantity no longer mentions A room full of monkeys is a story, I could not have my children watching the soothing "cartoons" that are now being thrown out of fear that everyone will show up as Homer Simpson for some time in the future and 50% of guilt will be on me because I allowed them to watch them I could allow this to happen, which is why I have S VE shows from the late 80s to mid-90s on Harddrive so that one day My Kids could not be corrupted by the "Cartoon Crap" from today and to enjoy the last childhood I have and to stick to and owe it to all Talespin. The story is undoubtedly the best animation ever produced in the world because of the depth, charm, wisdom, compassion, emotion and lack of really poor quality and stories that many today have, Do you see any of that content in the words "Ed, Edd and Eddie, or something else you can think of?" The garbage produced today can be compared to a 3-year unmanageable Hirogliphom that displays Picasso. Next time you watch episode e of Talespin; look at wood material on any wooden building or building such as Higher for Hire and slaughter over the quality of the work and effort invested in this Animation, even one shot made as if it would use them again and again, the Buildings Looks to the True Art Deco Movement that it was popular in the time period shown, Even the vehicles are loyal to life, OK, not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation, but the low-end scenes were covered with top-quality scenes, so everything in everything was leveled until the end of the episode and probably never n You would not notice if you were not focused and paid attention to the details. The only thing I like is that I like to call "Deliberate Mistakes" or "Intended Mistakes" in each episode, and some have two, for example in a deep skin where the rebecca says "You're on something Baloo "and Baloo responds" Vho, Me !, I'm not a virgin as a schoolboy "look at Rebecca's eyes, I beat" spoil the rest of Baloopera, but just hold Eie out the next time. Everyone else comments are bang he and 100% correct, I have nothing else to add that others have not already said here, Disney, wake up and smell coffee, sleep for more than a decade, stop producing Dis garbage and return the quality of the animation and stop producing it "cartoons", we saw proof of what you can do and we want him back as quickly as possible.
