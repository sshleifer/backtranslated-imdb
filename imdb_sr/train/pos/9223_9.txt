Ashanti is a 70's film (more precisely in 1979). This in a way reminded me of wild goose (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on the mission in Africa). And that's a very good movie, and I enjoyed it. David (Michael Caine) is a Doctor who works in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman named Annes (Beverley Johnson) who trained. in America and also a doctor. While doctors, one day he was kidnapped by slaves who work for a Arab slave trader called Suleiman (who was perfectly played by Peter Ustinov, all people). The rest of the movie is that David is trying to get her back. Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a character who is very determined and ready to do anything to return his wife, but rather hopelessly with a gun and action. He was first assisted by an Englishman who fought against the slave trade nobody recognized (Rek Harrison!), Then a short pilot helicopter (Villiam Holden) and then Arabian Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a point to calm down with Suleiman (he is a very intense, very attractive character), and he goes with David to find him and bring Anans back - this includes a wonderful scene in which David fails to fit on his camel. . Then there are many adventures. There are many questions about morality. The progress of the story is a little predictable from this point, and there are several freedoms that are taken with planning to move things faster, but all this is pretty forgiving. The question is whether David will come to the Ananda before Peter Ustinov sells Omar Sharifu (that, of course, Omar Sharif is in him!)?
