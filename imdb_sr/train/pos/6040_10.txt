I simply do not die from watching FREEBIRD. My husband was extra, so I was involved from the very beginning. They stay in touch with Jon and helped promote cinema in Cinemas and now on DVD release. Even to the extent that promotional postcards are distributed on ferryboats and various places throughout France. FREEBIRD was professionally written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus a choice of casting. Only Phil Daniels could fit into Grouch's role. It is a great privilege to meet Jon and the actors in the party after the January premiere. All you want to do with Jon, just ask, either by e-mail or by phone, you know how to get to me. Sue kk
