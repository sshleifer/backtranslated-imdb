A beautifully directed mixture of the youthful romance and Paris travelogue by Richard Linklater is one of the romantic films of the 90's of the best thinking. Julie Delphi turns into one of the most interesting performances in a decade as a Parisian girl who spends a day with Ethan Havke with a stranger on the train. Dialogue (and there is also a multitude) is sometimes vigorous and overly precious, but this portrait of two young vannabe lovers who create a romantic, intellectual and spiritual connection is full of wonderful fun, touching and discerning moments.
