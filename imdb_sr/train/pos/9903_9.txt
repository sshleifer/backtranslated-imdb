Vov, praises IMDb and Google, because I was trying to remember the name of this f'ing awesome movie for over 15 years. Slaughter High, man! Hells ieah! I will not bother you with the summary of the summaries, and the actors, and iadda iadda iadda, because you all know what it is. That's why you're here anyway. What I'm going to do, however, is to explain the nice memory I have about this essential 80th D-Movie slasher. In 1987, when I was about 7 years old, my father rented all these horror films. Would he care if the children were looking at him? Not. So, in that young age, I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in that movie was very long. Since then, I have not seen him, but I remember to this day most of the funny murders in the movie. For example, a post-sexual scene (why is a metal bed in school?) Got an electric shock. Or, the man drowning in the pool. Come on! My personal favorite, though ... exploding the stomach from infected beer. Incredibly! How can you honestly hate a movie in which one of the characters finds beer in an abandoned school, 10 or 15 years later, and thinks it would be good to drink it? Then he explodes his stomach? What!? And this brilliant line: Let's take my car ... it always starts. Classical shit to the end. I mean, I'm looking back, almost 20 years later, and I'm laughing at it. But when I was 7, I was scared. Was that crazy hat (or was it a mask?) If the killer was scared of me, f * ck was scared of me! All in all, yes, fucking movie. But for nostalgic purposes and humor, this movie gets 9 out of 10 from me. Or be really late at night, and we hope you'll catch this on the same late late movie, or grab VHS copy and dust from your VCR.
