I picked up a movie without a lid and did not even know what it was, but when I looked at it, I laughed so loudly. It's now one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the guys made a masterpiece, and I would recommend this film to anyone with a sense of humor. Thank you, Rusty, for giving us something to laugh.
