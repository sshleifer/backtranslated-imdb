This film begins with a family that went in different directions and their daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very in love with Joe MacLeod (Zack). The mother plays Mitzi Kapture (Jill Dunne), who suddenly enters daughter and Zack, and then it seems that all kinds of problems come to the surface. Jill Dunne has a husband who is constantly traveling or is often away from home. There are also major problems that arise when the family chooses to go to a campsite that their daughter Olivia does not like and simply can not adapt to sleeping in the open and asks for a tent to guard all the bugs. In many ways, Olivia performs extraordinary performance as a teenager and Nick Mancuso, (Richard Grant) gives her a big supporting role as the owner of the hotel. This film will guess you'll end it and enjoy a movie full of horror and terror. Enjoy
