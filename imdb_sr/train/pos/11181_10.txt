This is one of the most horrifying, horrendous and most faithful horror films EVER! Dr Creed (Louise) and his family move to a new home with their own wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage). Everything seems normal as Dr. Creed does not lose a patient who had a terrible head injuries, then haunted by the spirit knowing that Victor takes him to Pet Sematarti and shows him where the dead are alive. Louis does not know if it's all a dream and talking to Ellie who is concerned about his cat who might be killed by a truck, and later for Rachel, tells Louis that it's really hard to talk about death due to her sister Zelda who was really sick (as we see in the shedding how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most beautiful scenes ever!) The next day Louis gets a call from Jay who says that the cat was killed by a truck, and Jade took him to a place where Viktor Duh said he was not going! And bury the Cat, His wife and children to go see their grandparents, and Luiz is alone in shock to see the cat return, and now as evil in his eyes, he goes to see Jeddah, so Jade says he is buried. And the dog there (As we saw another flashback). Later in the film The Famili out with the Picnic, Gage is playing with the dragon, and Gage says I'm dropping him, "the wind blows a bar near the road where the truck comes in a quick past, Gage is approaching the road, Louis hurrying to bring him, the hottest scene in any horror movie will go with your jaws on the floor or your trembling will fall on your back when you hear that Louis screams Soon he missed so much, then Louis buried Gage at the same place where the Cat was buried. The most terrible thing about this movie is that some of the scenes in this movie are not far from the real life. This film is just incredible and the acting of all is great!
