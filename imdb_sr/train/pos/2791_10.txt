This is one of my favorite films and I would recommend it to everyone. On my list of favorite films (mental list, mind) are the only ones that are parallel to movies such as Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Avai and Fli Avai Home. main character Jess. At the beginning of the film she is a shy girl with a somewhat strange background that has many more friends who are boys than girls. She really sucked you in her life. I can certainly not blame the actor's protagonists, or anyone else in the film. Football was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea about the rules. The film is never boring. The romantic is really sweet and did not make me blush! One thing that really did was an Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indians and there are many colorful Indian conventions that provide a very interesting cultural insight through the film, like everything else. Indian people are also hilarious! Basically, this is an age movie for choosing the desired road and fighting for it. Feel good comedies thanks to this movie. They are funny, refreshing and make you feel good! ^ _ ~
