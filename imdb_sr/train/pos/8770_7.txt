I thought it in a good way, believe me. True, it's not. The whole Oirish thing gets a bit dense, but you enjoy acting actors - Flinn, Smith, Bond, Vatson, Fravlei, etc. All good. I also liked to see Mike Mazurki of course playing the boxer, what else? Typical forties move with familiar faces and fast scenes, one after the other. Flinn is as good as Mr. Jim, you will never go through a dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and I should have been satisfied, that's all. The boxing scenes were pretty good, Vard Bond's record keeping was messy, and you're just as if you've watched all those BillyLub billboards come to the scene several times. at that time, and it's clear why the audience likes it. <br /> <br /> ***
