This is one of the best in the series, ranked there with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or biohazard: Last Escape). Who you probably know from the original Resident Evil) It's terrible like the other Resident Evil and contains many more scenes. My rating: **** of ***** star (Rating based on comparison with other video games)
