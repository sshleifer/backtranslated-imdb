For my life, why did this film get R rating?! Although it's about eating zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good movie for your family - at least if your kids are over 10 years old. Unlike traditional zombie movies, this has a great sense of humor as well as traditional values ​​- although somewhat weird! The language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity, and the film style is definitely focused on children (similar to the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - some of the stupid people have fooled R's rating! Believe me, most of the children saw the violence above this and it seems stupid that the audience thinks this is just an adult movie. The story is set up in a parallel-type world. While fashion, cars and customs appear around 1953, in this bizarre world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that has resulted in a "zombie war" and massive changes in everyday life. At school, children are trained in armed conflicts and there is a sweet scene late in a movie where the father gives his son a gun and tells him to keep him in his wound "just in case"! As far as life outside of school is concerned, it's pretty strange because people have now learned that zombies are not that bad thing! To hell, using shock collars and training, they can be turned into slaves who can do your homework, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick person, be your "special friend". This film deals with a family that finally buys its first zombie slave (played by Billy Connalli). Mom is delighted and her son slowly becomes a friend of zombie. Dad, on the other hand, is not convinced - he was forced to kill his father of zombies for years and has not overcome this !! Funny, dishonest and unique - this film should be seen by a much wider audience.
