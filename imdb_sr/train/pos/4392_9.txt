I enjoyed this movie. Tobei Maguire gives a great performance like Jake. He must be one of the best actors I've seen. And I was surprised that during the film there were so many witty lines. And he was extremely good at this, although I never saw him bring a comic book. The film brings you to the relationship with the characters and really asks you what will be of them. I did not know what to expect from the performance of Jevel, but I think it's been a good time. A lot of exciting scenes. Fully good ride. I'm an absolutely fan of Maguire's. Check the rules for the cider. One of the best ever.
