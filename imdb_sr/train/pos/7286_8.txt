I was well spent watching this picture, and I was magnificently surprised by my teachings. First, the film is undoubtedly inexpensive with its cardboard sets, limited settings and creative scientific backgrounds. The act moves from the very poor (two strippers), barely professional (Herb Evers as the leading man), Gothic excess (Leslie Daniels as an assistant Kurt) to first-rate with Virginia Late as the headless victim who lives her will for the benefit of science and lustful passions of her fianc√©. Although the script is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this kind. There are numerous questions about the role of science and medicine in our lives and their boundaries. This movie is a movie in many ways. However, do not be too fooled by his real intention. It's a dirty story about a man obsessed with his ability in medical science who wants to merge the head of his dead girl with the perfect body, creating such a perfect woman for the best, the body and the soul. Another very light aspect of the film is saxophone music that strongly resonates every time a doctor examines the city for women's beauties.
