Visual Arts Tsui Harka is at the height of this film. Unfortunately, the terrible acting Ekin Cheng, and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the need to strangle myself while watching this, it's so bad :) sometimes made it difficult to watch. This film is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I first saw this, the fork dropped again and I thought I had never seen anything similar, but that's how it should be done to fully fulfill the mythical world of Chinese kung fu novels. ! No doubt, this is one of the most beautiful Chinese historical kung fu ever made. But, unfortunately, Tsui Hark did not improve much in the writing department, and the story and dialogue were before the juvenile (his obvious obsession with stupid and overly long showing of the evil guys did not help). To make it worse, this film is very bad. They decided to use "hot" popular Hong Kong idols as the main characters, but unfortunately Ekin Cheng, and especially Cecilia Cheung, are completely unsuitable for historical kung fu drama because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters should represent. Adam Cheng Siu-Chov and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. I want to one day Zhang Ii-Mou and Tsui Hark join forces and produce a movie that has Tsui visual arts, but with the maturity and story of Zhang's poetry ...
