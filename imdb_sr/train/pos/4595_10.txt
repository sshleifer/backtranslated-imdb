The name of Jacky Chan is synonymous with acrobatics. This movie never let you go. Opening the best scene for hunting and the last scene from the half is so risky of a miracle if he knows the meaning of fear. This film comes very close to Jackie's best that is PROJECT A. The main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars, while in this film, Jackie carries a movie entirely on his shoulders. This may be the main reason why this movie made Jackie the greatest martial arts star that Bruce Lee is following. Too. What makes this film a work is Jaki's ability to show his respected side in a contract with a typical action martial arts hero. This film was followed by a sequel that was good, but it was pretty pitiful to its predecessor.
