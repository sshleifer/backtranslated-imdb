ROAD TO PERDITION can be combined with the result of Thomas Nevman. She is beautiful and beautiful, but you are aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work and while listening to the sound background you recall MIRIS WOMEN, JOE JOE BLACK and SHAVSHANK REDEMPTION, which you recall to other movies, the story takes place on the screen. While Sullivan drives across America trying to escape from a psychotic killer on GETVAI, the Irish gangsters are MILLER'S PRELAZ, while the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summarized by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics.
