during Eddie Murphi, women from the crowd shout at Eddie and a man from the audience responds. what is said, women - TO MR ROB (this is a character from Saturday night live), the guy responds with SHUT UP BITCH. Unlike the previous post who said that women were yelling buttons, this is wrong, although the poster said that he was there and that he must have a hearing problem! despite the fact that the poster says he is not in a position to have a close listening here on DVD, as you can actually hear it on a DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! I hope this helps any curious crowds to heal the gauze !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
