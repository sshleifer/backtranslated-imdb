Since I'm always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie on the internet. I thought it would be just another "B" movie, but I was stunned by the acting of the two main characters. All the actors in this film were very capable and well-directed. The action was wonderful and unique, with great morals for the story. This film is definitely not for someone looking for a sex mess, "dumb and stupid" or blood and intestines. This is a fantastic touching movie that shows some sad reality of life along with the kindness of the human heart and enough frivolity to be interesting. video even a large number with high earnings at the box office. I recommend this film.
