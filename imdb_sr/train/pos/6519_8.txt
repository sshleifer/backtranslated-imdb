This movie has big stars in its earlier years: Ingo Stevens never looked more beautiful; Iul Brinner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte, who fought over his piracy and wanted to maintain neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a pretty good job like Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit stiff. It is really good for students to learn this part of our history, and this shows that all happy ends do NOT include lovers working together - sometimes it is happier to go and find partners of a similar background that will better understand them in the long run. I watched her every year at least twice for 16 years; and although this is not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
