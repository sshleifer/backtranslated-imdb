Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out at about the same time as the Challenger explosion. What really did it do to get out, or even when it should be carried out. I'm glad they did. First I watched SpaceCamp on the drive-in movie. What really improved viewing. While I heard about Leo Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I've never heard of the others in the movie. So it came as a great shock for me to find all these young actors, and to behave really well! Of course, and Kate Capshaw was great. Especially I liked the scene, where these kids showed how they behave, like a team. The children's scenes are preparing for a journey that I can only hope for. The real launch of a spacecraft is, of course, old news for us. However, this was different. All in all, this is one of my most prized films. Escapist maybe, but it was fantastic for a spacecraft like me. After possibly renting for 30 - 40 times. I finally found him in a certain shop and bought it. Now, if it only appears on a DVD. I'll probably have it forever. This movie gets 9 out of 10 from me.
