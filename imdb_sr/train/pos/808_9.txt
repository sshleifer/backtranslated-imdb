I just want the return of the Jedi was directed by someone else, I think, there are too many scenes, completely unnecessary. In addition to this, our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Sol, Luke looks bored, Darth Vader is not as evil as before, and Ida just dies. I'm going to this episode that I just can not hate it. SOME SPOILERS 1. Jabba Cottage 2 Sail Barge Attack Sequence. 3-Imperator (now it's evil) 4- Speeders rushing into the wood of the endor. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark Side Seduction Scene. 7. Return Anakin to a good side of the force. 8. And the last celebration. Some of them are so good that you can cause tears in your eyes. If some of the scenes were cut out and the other director was hired, that would be perfect as episode 4 and 5, but it's still remarkable. 9 of 10
