Confused by secret, Ben Thomas (Vill Smith) seeks redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he does not know. Once a plan is set up, nothing can stop him. At least that's what she thinks. But Ben did not plan to fall in love with one of these people and she is the one who will ultimately transform him. Vill Smith returned with director Gabriela Muccino after a film that inspired the life of The Pursuit of Happiness. "Seven Pounds" is another movie experience that changes your life, which not only reminds you of their previous cooperation, in tears, but also gives you a joyful inspiration in the end. Vill Smith, also re-produced with someone else. These films are very real, showing the life of an ordinary man and his struggle through life. Seven pounds may have taken some time to get a real moment, but right after half an hour of film, the movie is ready to rule your heart. Also, this movie has several turning circles, which allows viewers to guess. Director Gabriela Muccino is again the winner all the way, with his emotional and inspirational message. He makes all the characters of the movie very real, that people will actually find themselves somewhere in the film. With the director, Vill Smith is another winner, with his outstanding acting skills. Once again, the duo of the director and the actor works like charm. Also, there are other talented actors in the film who have done quite a bit of their work. Rosario Davson, a beauty with the brain, so can be called. It looks gorgeous and makes its part extremely good. Barry Pepper gives great support to the movie, and Voody Harrelson does the same, although Voody did not have much time on the screen (it would be better if he had more). You will not easily forget this movie. Watch this movie and change your life. Top Cinema!
