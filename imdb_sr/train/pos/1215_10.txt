This is my favorite bears three bears. I loved all the songs once again. A big problem, however, as most people have pointed out is that this story is contrary to the original. For those who saw the first film, the bears met with their "relatives" for which they obviously did not know. It was not, of course, the end that the relatives had received their symbols after proving how much they care. In this story, however, relatives grow up with bears for care and have all the symbols. It said this is not a bad movie as long as you hold it apart from the first one. I thought Darkheart's figure was much wider than Nicholas the first. But at the same time, I felt that he added some kind of balance of sweetness to the bear for care. I also liked the part that cares in the end, although I know that other people had mixed feelings towards that scene. And of course I VOLIO songs. My favorites are Groving Up and Forever Ioung. Movies for bear care always had such good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
