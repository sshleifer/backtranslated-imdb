I saw this film when I was about 7 years old - which was 33 years ago - and I never forgot this movie! I was deeply touched and inspired by a brave little boy and beautiful eagle. And I could not believe it when it turned into an eagle when everyone in the theater thought they were going to die ... My sister was in the movie with me and I recently asked her if she remembered the movie we saw with a boy and eagle, and she said she remembered it was yesterday. So that's not just me. This film must MUST SEE! You will never forget him - just like my sister and I ...
