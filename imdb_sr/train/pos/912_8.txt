This film returns many memories of the classic old cinema, in which actors did not have to be removed so that the viewers watched their film. First I think that the main plus of this film is incredible chemistry between Shahid and Amrite, it is definitely making a movie. I saw a lot of comments about a movie that was sweetly cute and overly sparkling. In response to this, I think that this is to some extent correct analysis, but given that this Barjati's film, I think that in comparison with MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it is significantly reduced. HSSH was almost unbearable to look at some places. In this film, however, when the sentimental moments appear, you are smiling, wanting the young couple to get to know you better and hoping that nothing bad will happen to them. Another big plus are performances by Shahid and Amrita. Both acted very well, especially Shahid who looks great in the movie. Amrita looks just amazing and needs to be taken seriously as a future big star. Although I really enjoyed the movie as a whole, I feel that it was too long. Some areas could be shortened and may have an even greater impact. I also think that music, although it fits into a movie when you see the situation, a little old-fashioned and a movie could benefit if a more recent soundtrack was available. Although the performances of the songs Mujhe Hak Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein are wonderful. All in all, I definitely recommend this film, its romantic, amazing image and dramatic climax (I will not go) in detail, only in case you have not seen it. PS. If you are prone to crying - take the tissue!
