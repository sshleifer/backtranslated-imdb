A group of people travel to Belgrade in a terrible bus ride with a drunken conductor and his stupid son (who loves to drive his eyes closed). Their journey is often interrupted by many hilarious events that with much irony describe the decline of the national spirit in 1941 and are so ridiculous that they are still used today as common jokes. The man who "steals the show" is a 4-meter farmer with 4 sons who are almost twice as big as him. In the end, the film has a dramatic turning point and the journey becomes only a swan song of a dying country.
