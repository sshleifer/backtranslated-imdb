When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I must say that all of the shows I've seen end up all this. I had to see this show, and that's what I did. When I got the first volume of this show, it was the best. I really liked the animation, and all the fighting scenes were great. I must say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber, and Archer and, of course, I love Ilja. And of course, all the episodes on that were interesting and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (known for Transformers and others) who play Berserk's voice. He has a cool character. I even watched the entire series again before I looked at the final book. So if you see something good, then watch this show, that's the best.
