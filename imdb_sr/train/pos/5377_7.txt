"College Girl Killings" is my first knowledge of the writings of Edgar Vallace? and generally my first real acquaintance with "Crimea" movies in general? and I can say that I'm moderately impressed. These things are really fun, although I would never expect it to be so? goofi! The film has an exciting and beautiful plot, with a healthy amount of humor, brilliant turns and beautiful inventive murders. Is there some type of James Bond who is an evil master? who always sits in the shadows and in front of a large monitor - recruits prisoners to kill certain girls at a particular college with a new type of poison. There is also a wicked monk with a whip, dressed as a member of the Communist KCC, releasing the remaining characters, such as overly curious teachers and the like, as well as the Kooki police commissioner who persists in solving the case with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I had known earlier that these films of Crimea were so colorful and crazy, I would have bought them. The ignore of the feather actually raises more questions than she ultimately replies, and the overload of comic tricks at the expense of the inspector of Scotland Iard Higins sometimes swallows a bit, but I do not care because it was a sublime party. Even the funky music of the 60's has been stuck in my head for a long time. It's like a variant on Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
