Well, I come from Bulgaria where it's almost impossible to have a tornado, but my imagination tells me to be "very, very scared" !!! This guy (Devon Sava) did a great job with this movie! I do not know exactly how old he was, but he did not behave like a child (well done)! Now about the tornado - it was not really real, but it scares you! If you want to spend a good time in front of the TV - this is a movie!
