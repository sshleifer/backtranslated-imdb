The only season was just broadcast here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! like it! All the stories are so good! and a more realistic view of teenage and family life today. however, she continued to have strong family values ​​to stick together and to be here for each other. their problems were real, and they really got you into the show. The show is basically about this family called 'Dani' and their lives. Abby Dai (mom), Jack Dai (Dad), Natalie Dai (sports daughter), Cooper Dai (son of an outsider) and Nathan Dai (son of the genius boy). Each episode is the day of their life, with the perspectives of the cooperatives on things through all that. I loved the cooperation, his insight through the show was great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things that could be continued, I'm really sad that another season has not been made. It was a great performance I would miss.
