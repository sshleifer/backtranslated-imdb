Mahatma is portrayed as a man who ignored his son in this film. Do not misunderstand me; I do not condemn the film; It's such a wonderful movie and got out of the cinema with a throat in the throat. We must understand Mahatma's spiritual state, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened man could separate himself from his loved ones. A man with such a caliber leads his family and followers for example. According to the film, he talked with his son and tried to make him understand where he came from, but poor Harilal could not understand his father with such a little intellect. When things went wrong with Harilall, Mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son was a great tragedy. If they were some other parents, they would compromise their values ​​to help their son get up. Mahatma did not do it, he is the true leader who leads his case.
