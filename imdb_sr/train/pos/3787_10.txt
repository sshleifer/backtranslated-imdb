I saw him as a critic at the 49th Internationales Filmfestival Mannheim Heidelberg. As every film I know, so Zelenka, it's simply brilliant. I love his way by combining different stories and characters. His * Knopfler * and the truly magical * power * (part of Regina Zieglers * Erotic Tales IV *) is certainly worth it. Go and take it, folks!
