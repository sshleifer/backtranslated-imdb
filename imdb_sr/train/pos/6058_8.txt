This is a well-made documentary about the thrilling world of Indie Car Race. The photo is simply extraordinary. The scene in which Mario Andretti drove the old racing roadster down the street of New England, bordered by ancient clans, leaving him aside for the speed of the car, is unbelievable. The film loses some of its beauty on the small screen, but if you like to watch cars brought to the limit, you should look at this movie.
