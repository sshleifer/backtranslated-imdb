Toni Havk Underground came when the series really started to lose its glow, Toni Havk Pro Skater 4 did not meet expectations and left the series really in the air on what Neversoft and Activision could do with a series that could be different and interesting. Underground introduced the story, which was very cool because it made a new world for lovers of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Another feature that the fans were greatly looking for and who was able to get off the skateboard, which is nice, because now you can actually climb, run and do various things. Levels well, Neversoft also improved the problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and it was the length of the design level. The first two games for PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great, because the levels were fine and long, and some hidden in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 are shortened due to several features that have been added and actually pushed systems within their boundaries. In this version, they have shortened these features, there are not many people who are asking the streets, in fact, almost none in some levels, and the graphics and physics of skating are a little reduced, but not much. > This game has one end, the story is a bit short, of course this is Neversofts for the first time working with Toni Havk Pro Skater, so it's understandable. However, with those words, you will definitely finish the game in one day. All in all, a great addition that was very refreshing.
