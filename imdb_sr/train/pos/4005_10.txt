Although at one point I thought that it would turn into a graduate, I must say that Mother works greatly on explaining the sexual desires of an older woman. So I'm glad the British movie was because Hollywood would never do it, and even if they were, they would ruin it by not taking time to develop characters. The story is revealed slowly and realistically. The acting is beautiful, the characters are faithfully flawed, and the dialogue is sensitive. Many times I tried to predict what would happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very intrigued by the story. I recommend this film. And I have to admit, I will always watch my mom in the other light!
