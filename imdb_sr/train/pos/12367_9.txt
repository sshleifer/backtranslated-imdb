Well, after a long wait after I looked at several spots on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments, I waited a long time to see this movie. The action was simple, the beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into a residential building that is entering hell. Sentinel is a real real creepy movie, even if it's a bit slow. It's a mixture of The Omen and Rosemari's Babi. The acting is fine, and there are some really disturbing parts like an awkward orgy scene with a dead father and a bumpy woman in the middle of an orgy that eats cake and laughter. It's very strange, but in the end, I really believe in a great movie! One of my favorites from the '70s, even if it's nothing special original. It's crazy and extremely creepy! Probably one of my favorite favorites. 9/10
