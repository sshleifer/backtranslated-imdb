I screamed from my heart watching this movie. I have never suffered from any eating disorders, but I think this is a real image. He expresses these feelings incredibly well. My teenage years have returned to me so lively. Anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or a teenager will be able to connect with this film. I recommend everyone to see it! And music is great - I discovered Diane Lorden. Oleander, because I'm sure it's perfectly suitable for the role of Agnes.
