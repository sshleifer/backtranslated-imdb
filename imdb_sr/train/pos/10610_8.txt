A sweet young mountain man with a sad past (Henri Thomas) comes to an abandoned girl in the woods and immediately falls in love with her. The elders of the city mostly support him in guarding the child, although the local temptress (Cara Seimour) little thoughts about the new family. A determined long-haired girl and an evil merchant (David Strathairn in her creepiest) have a parallel story that fuses in a fateful way. This is a charming part of life in Ozark in the same spirit as "Where's Lily Bloom" and "Dollmaker". All three were killed in a location in these beautiful hills and covered the lives of a simple but not a simple American nation. The minimum of a strong language and a short but pronounced violence makes this a fairly safe family watch.
