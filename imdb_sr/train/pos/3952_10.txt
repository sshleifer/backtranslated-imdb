I feel like I have some rare disease that nobody has heard and finally I came across a online support group! I finally found this title looking for an answer to a "professional" site on the Internet. And I watched this film at a young age and I was hit by the atmosphere and in particular the ending. I've never forgotten him, and since then I've never seen him. No one I know has seen a movie, and I almost gave up on finding my title. Unfortunately, even knowing the name, I'll probably never see a movie again because it's impossible to find it commercially. Small steps ... <br /> G
