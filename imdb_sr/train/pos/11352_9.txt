This is a fascinating report about the hunting of the first known serial killer of the Soviet Union. I got closer, I expected only a semi-decent TV movie, but I found myself attracted to the convincing way that the story was told. As others have said, there can be a lot of admiration here, which, unfortunately, is missing in many large screens. It's impossible not to feel emotionally. The acting of the entire actor is also excellent, especially the one from two leaders, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their persuasive portraits give high-handed credentials to character, and the scene in which they have their first board meeting after the perestroika genuinely touches. A little less glow, I recommend that you look at 'Citizen Ks'. <br /> <br />
