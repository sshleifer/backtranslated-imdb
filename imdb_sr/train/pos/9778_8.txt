This is a trio story, "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali," about the experimental commune (or some other such thing) called the Tailor-Eriksson Group, which led people to travel within and into the Unknown, and left a little Damage here and there, I would say. Many years later some of these damages are still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show off. Shakti tells a story about a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn up, and the suspect is a man who may not even exist. It seems that this woman is able to project an inner demon, or find out the sister of the man who was killed when she is trying to talk to that woman as a reporter. Devi witnesses a story about a young man who wants to "pop out of his skin". He is skinhed, quick and sent to a psychiatrist who is by chance a former member of this commune, which results in a good doctor helping a young man to achieve his desire. This is probably the best of these three segments. Cali tells the story of a healer who is trying to "heal" this woman who was part of this commune and let some kind of demon live in that woman, but he is wondering whether he did it or she let it out because she could no longer Survive in it. All three of these stories are quite creepy and uncertain because you're never sure what to expect, and the premise and settings are so similar to those conventional horror films that add to strangeness. This has a distinct look and feel of a low budget, but it also manages to demonstrate a rather violent atmosphere as a whole, much to its own account. I watched this while my mouth hung openly for a good while and when the real fears (and worse) hit quite hard. I discovered that this is a very interesting and disturbing movie and that I liked it very much. A good little invention, I would give him 8 out of 10.
