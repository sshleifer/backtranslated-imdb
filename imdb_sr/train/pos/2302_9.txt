Reese Vitherspoon was unforgettable on the big screen for the first time. It looks like a freshly cleansed face "tweed" slightly and tough, but undoubtedly Reese. I always loved him as an actor, and had no idea that she started this young man with her career. In fact, I got a little respect for Reese to know who she is so early. I say that whenever I watched her performances, the characters so far, in every portrait, she also seemed to have had her personality who lived with that character, pretty nice in fact. In any case, my first film experience with Risa was the parody of the little red cap Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I assumed it was the first time that "on the bat" did not do so well Reese
