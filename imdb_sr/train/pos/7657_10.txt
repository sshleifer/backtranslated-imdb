This is a very dark, heavy blow, even a brutal film about the pause for the death penalty that breaks down. It's a black and white photo that prevents it from being dated. Mickey Rooney is great as a twisted, but unusually cute pencil. One of the first films to show the psychological devastation of the death penalty. It's also pretty sharp.
