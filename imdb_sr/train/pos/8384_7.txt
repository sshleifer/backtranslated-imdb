Somewhere I read (in a fairly brief overview) that this is something called live action anime, and I think they are on the right lines. The first time I watched this movie when I was very young and I was dying to see it again, and when I finally managed it recently, all the memories came back. I do not think this is taken too seriously - it's just a bit of fun for a good old 80s (it's set in the background of a rather gloomy future, although this point is not emphasized much). What I liked most in this movie was that the dialogue did not sound generic - without clich√©s, without foreseeable lines - all in all just good fun! Perhaps the time was not kind to this little movie, but I can still find pleasure in it. It's by no means perfect, but it's fun and does not try anything but that. Let the nerds and comedians take care of technical details - who cares? See for yourself and make your decision. Opinion of no other is not important.
