Have you ever, or have, a pet who was with you through a thick and thin, without whom you will be lost, and whom do you love, regardless of everything? Betcha never thought they felt the same way about you! Divan, wonderful family movie. If you have a soft spot for animals, this will guarantee you to cry, regardless of age. I watched this movie all the time while I was a kid, and now I see that at sixteen, I like that as much then. Then I could never decide my favorite character, and I still do not think I can! I love all three animals. Dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving but enthralling family. I like the opportunity and finally says that he finally has a family. Shit, yes, but it must be remembered that this is a family film, and that this role is perfectly fulfilled. Sassi has only the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shad's is the perfect leader / model for a young, adventurous chance. that it is in interaction with them (ie rescue Molly, and the end). Not to mention an incredible sound record that gives even more emotions every moment, and the accompanying feeling of swelling of the heart. I'm giving this 9/10. To compare it with (and even better rated) than cats and dogs and babies.
