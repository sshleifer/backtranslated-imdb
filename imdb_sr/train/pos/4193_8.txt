Director Sam Fuller has some cult escorts, especially in Europe. Still, most of his films are more than forgetful. However, he recorded a really great movie in "Pickup on South Street". Very early in career, the films that followed were very inferior. From the first to the last frame, "Pickup" works at all levels. It was shot with impeccable fluidity, boasting fine performance. Richard Vidmark and Thelma Ritter both players with a fine record of top performances are at its peak. Vidmark, who was not a stranger to the play of evil men, although genuinely meant to his heart, still manages to discover only the smallest humanity that gives him a fascinating character, and that the character of Peter Peters falls on him more credibly. Fuller has no bumps in this truly solid film. There is a scene in which Jean Peters spewed Vidmark. It's really shocking in its reality. This is not the case of carefully choreographed photos. Less self-conscious than many movie noirs in this period remains an excellent example of a genre.
