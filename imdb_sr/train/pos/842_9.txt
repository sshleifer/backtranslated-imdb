Matador is a witty, darkly humorous and tense melodrama that rises above the core thanks to two very interesting and serious performances by Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here, and always reliable Greg Kinnear who has his best role since then plays gai's neighbor Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets. A big plus goes on writing. A smart and sometimes very unpleasant dialogue is delivered with the pleasure of Brosnan, and slowly building a friendship between these two different people is completely convincing. The story takes several unexpected moves and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where to go. The beautiful artistic touch of directors such as good music use, smart editing and a bit of unusual cinema occasionally set a nice tone for a movie and for a long time you do not know how to tag a movie. But it is also thanks to a very well-written letter kept by the viewer (me in any case) on the edge of his seat.
