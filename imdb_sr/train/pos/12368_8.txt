I had a TV for a white noise traveler and heard "$ 400 for a fully equipped apartment" so I ran into a TV show waiting for another movie and got more. Luckily, I could get to the top (DVR buffer) and press the capture button to watch it fully. A thriller worth your time to watch. Pretty creepy and progressive in time: the character Beverly D'Angelo masturbates in front of Alison Parker, cautiously acting by Cristina Raines, Parker stabs, in her very bloodier style, her father explicitly marks the three scene. Watch) Movie TOTAL 70 is full of bad clothes (polyester clothes and sticky bats) and decor, bad hair, exaggerated music, and famous cinema. Actors are great, take a second on the homepage of this movie to check them out. It was a surprise to see Christopher Valken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Silvia Miles - always beautifully creepy! ENJOY!
