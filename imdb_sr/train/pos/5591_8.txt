Alternative name of ecstasy is Symphony of Love; a title that appropriately describes the mood and feeling of the film. Ecstasy was an early conversation, and it could have been very good to be a classic movie, if it was released during the era of a silent film. This film is a visual delicacy and deliberately sings so that the viewer can enjoy in his sensual lyrical quality, which is presented in an artistically low way. The directional style is very European. The subject and access to sexuality were far more sophisticated than what was then produced in Hollywood. Think about the code of censorship in the United States, during the 30's, which essentially sums up. Hedi Lamarr, one of the greatest beauties of all time, was the perfect choice for this 'Symphony of Love'.
