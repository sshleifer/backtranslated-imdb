Once I lived with a roommate who tried suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar offense for sighing after midnight - well, it's superfluous to say, it's easy to connect with the Polanski "Renter". But I also enjoy the film for other reasons. I'm not sure it works at all - the decline of the Polanski figure in paranoia and madness, which lasts for the last half an hour, seems quite disturbing and bizarre. Ebert was, after all, totally inconclusive, and he slammed a movie with a glimpse of one star. But I think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully, so even if I do not understand the whole movie - what does Egyptology have to do with it, for example? - I still have a general positive impression on this. I like, say, an unpleasant friend described by Bernard Fresson. God, how many times have I agreed to have such stupid friends, and I do not even have friends at all! I love the movie scene - the most amusing moment in making the movie, I would say. And the boy, if I love Isabelle Adjani - she's so beautiful in this movie, it's almost unbelievable. And it gives a great performance, as always. Polanski is a good actor; I do not agree with occasional disparaging remarks about his performance. His character should be a low key and imagined, so his low-key performance is appropriate. I found him one by one, perfectly sympathetic - although he lost me a bit when he began to dress in dear, without a clear reason. Yes, the film is unclear. And slow. But he portrays the alienating quality of housing - something I have completely done - so I dug it. It's weird that all you need is a common reference point, and suddenly a strange movie like this becomes profound! It's definitely worth picking up a pocket change on a DVD.
