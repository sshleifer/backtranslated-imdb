I was lonely in the old theater in northern California when this film came out. As good on DVD, it's even more scary and scary on the big screen. Although it's been about 9 years since I saw it, it's still one of my favorite favorites. In danger of sounding banal, "They simply do not make it any more like this!" If Sixth sense has scared you at all, this movie is definitely for you! An excellent story, an incredible number of characters, an evil setting; even the sound surface has a striking quality. I recommend that you do not watch it yourself. What was placed in a brown apartment only for 1977, will give you a dime (it would be at least 10 times more than today's price).
