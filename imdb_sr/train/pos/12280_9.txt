This is one of several films that I watched twice in the theater. I really like this film because of its atmosphere and talk about the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes, but he gets a chance for redemption. Is not this quite a comforting thought? When I first watched it, I thought that after the winning elections, the film would be over - I did not know the book. So, the guy I made a mistake when the dramatic climax just came! I'm literally swept up with the strength of the last half hour of the movie. Many people here do not like this movie completely. I can not understand a single one. Perhaps those who first read the book - such as often the screen adaptations of the novel - simply disappointed that many things remained unverified, invisible, unexplained. But as a film that tells a touching story - a story about the family, the rise and fall of the man, the deep sympathy of the woman, the power of love and the madness of hatred (and conservatism) - this film is simply great! Moreover, the soundtrack is incredibly good, and the actors are great - especially Vinona Rider and Jeremi Irons. Definitely one of those films for which a fictional cinema was made!
