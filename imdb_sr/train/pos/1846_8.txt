When I first read the plot of this drama, I assumed it would be like Sek and the Citi, but this drama is nothing like that. The stories that characters look more realistic, and you are more sympathetic to situations. The concept of a drama is similar, four out of 30 women who lead us through friendships and relationships with problems and quarrels on the road. Katie GP is a dark and dark character that's hard for you to connect and is the best friend of Trudy's widow. The hardy character is warming up the heart, as it can relate to the difficulties it has with the fact that it is the only mother of four. Jessica is a fun girl who is very confident and knows what she wants and how she gets it. She is a nice personality and the closest is Siobhan, a newborn person who, although she loves her husband, can not help her eyes wander with colleagues. Through all of this drama, it is surprisingly addictive and if the BBC continues production of the series, it could be good. This is unlike other female acting drama such as Sek and City, or Desperate Housevives. If it's played right, it could be the next cold foot. Plus, male actors are not bad for the eyes.
