This is one of the first and best Columbus, featuring Robert Culp and Rai Milland. Robert Culp appeared on Columbus, and several other villains, including Patrick McGoohan, Villyama Shatner, and Jack Cassidy. Rai Milland also appeared. In this case, Rai Milland is convinced that his beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, has an affair, and hires Culpa to investigate. Culp has a blackmail job on the side, so Milland is a fake report and threatens Crowley with the right one if he does not pay. They hit a big fight in Culp's house, and she's killing. Enter Columbo. Culp does everything in his power to exclude Columbo from the case, including his job, but Columbo has been from the very beginning. Great episode.
