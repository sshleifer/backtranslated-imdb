What a real treat and pretty unexpected. That's about the real movie of the trilera. I flew into a video store, grabbed the movie without reading the whole advertisement spot and hoped for the best. I was completely surprised and delighted. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought everyone gave a great performance and made their characters realistic. The action was well-designed, well-written and directed. From the beginning to the end you were interested and you were never bored in just one minute. I recommend this film for those who like the thriller, especially the thriller that is well timed and that keeps you in mind. Definitely 10 out of 10 of me.
