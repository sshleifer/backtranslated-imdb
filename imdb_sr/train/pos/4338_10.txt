The movie was very mobile. She was gentle and funny at the same time. The landscape was absolutely gorgeous! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award-winning performances. Olimpia Dukakis was great. I understand, because of the story that its part had to be short, but I wanted to see more of her - she is a true professional. watching this movie. We were fortunate to see Paul Reiser in K and A after watching. He is a wonderful man, smart, eloquent and "real person". It was a really nice evening out! You'll be so grateful you left.
