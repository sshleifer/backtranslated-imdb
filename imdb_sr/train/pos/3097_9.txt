This performance was fantastic. She was tangled and well written and all the characters were cute because they were awfully cute. Even Jonathan Cake was a lovely boyfriend. Since our radio waves are filled with nonsense such as American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that was not too much soap opera. It was always interesting to see how each character would be related to the following circumstances. It's really disturbing to finally get a play that makes you think a bit and throws it out because of some mysterious number that most of us do not even pay attention. Some of us are not sheep. Maybe this is not a lot of people, but some pretty loyal fans.
