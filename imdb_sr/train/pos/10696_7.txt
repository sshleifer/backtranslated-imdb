Every time I see Nicole I love her more. I love a movie like this. A woman you just will not give up, but she constantly interrupts your heart. The first movie I remember was that I saw this: Human Human Bondage, the version of Kim Novak - Laurence Harvei. Beets about the soundness of Russian speech in this film are tiny, it was good enough to deceive me or anyone who does not know Russian, I'm sure. It's weird that people miss the point. Russian guys with good will were also well thrown. Finally, I have to send a hat to Ben Chaplin, as someone else has noticed, he plays juice with great dignity, and there was definitely some warmth between him and Nicole. To think, the guys are paying for it.
