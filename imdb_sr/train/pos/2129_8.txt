Cute romantic drama / comedy about Stevart and Sullivan who write love letters to each other without anyone knowing who the other is. Of course, they work together and can not stand each other. You can hit the rest. She acted nicely on the whole acting (especially Sullavan, Stevart and Frank Morgan), has a funny, intelligent script and looks absolutely amazing. He is being held in Budapest and was filmed in Hollywood, but I realized that I had seen Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and similar to dreams. Unique film. Do not miss!
