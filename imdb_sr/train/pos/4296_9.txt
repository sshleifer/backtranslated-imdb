It would have been my first film of the year for 1991, except that he won the brilliant JFK. This is a wonderful movie! I liked it. I love stories in which the lives of different characters interact with others and how they deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but surpasses Danny Glover and, especially, Steve Martin. I've never really liked Martin or his style, but it's great here. I loved the whole speech that gave Klina close to the end of the Grand Canyon. Writing was great. Larry Kasdan is an IMO, a great writer of dialogue, on the ways of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantin. Here he created several three-dimensional characters and well-designed stories and messages that give a positive feeling to our lives. A really great movie. 4 of 4 stars
