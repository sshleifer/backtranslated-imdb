Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man who is seeking answers about his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Марголин и г. Morrowes all turn into the first roles in their roles; Ms. Phillips has a little less than an enviable task to try to spice up a movie made for TV (twenty-five years ago), supplying "sexual interest" in an otherwise unconvincing movie. The real star, however, is "California Kid"; Ford Coupe from 1934, borrowed from Jake Jacobs, placed in front of the camera and received a training that would leave the viewer breathing, dazzling and holding the edge of the seat without waiting. The scenes are spectacular, (though some of the dialogues are a little ludicrous), which led to a fine evening diversion. This is how to make all the "movies from the car". Try catching this movie on the late movie channel; worth the missed dream.
