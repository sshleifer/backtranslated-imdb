Can anyone discover the title and the song artist, which is played at least halfway through the film. I can not remember what the scene was playing. The words in the song are ballads. Some of the texts go as "This is a way to tell you something wrong." Nature is to say it in the poem. "" It's a way to forgive you. "Please, help me with this question. So this will cause me to find someone who could help with this thing. I would like to pay attention to the scene when I played it.
