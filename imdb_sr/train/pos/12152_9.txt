I just saw this movie on HBO, and it was really good ... a really tragic love story! I really appreciated the fact that the guy at the heart of the story lost the use of his leg in an accident. You rarely see a love story that involves someone who is physically handicapped. The love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life beautifully showed me that I would love to think that love can cure one's heart. Laura Leighton ... all 27 when she made this movie ... she was as brilliant as a woman so full of life that she was able to revive the heart of this guy. Unfortunately, since his family is rich and not her, "problems" are developing. It's been playing at HBO this month. See schedule here - http: //vv.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ ScheduleServlet?
