This movie is so cute. Bounty people trapped in an abandoned school. They start killing themselves, they know that they are in the right, so what are they doing? One girl decides to take a bath, the other decides to deceive her husband (who is also there) with an old boy so they somehow find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) And go to it. <br /> <br And it comes through the mountains and T & A. And it is also interesting from the historical / sociological point of view. Where the common slasher of the 80's reflects how we look at ourselves, or how adults look at young people, or how Hollivood looks at the rest of the country, it has a unique perspective. This is a Brit movie made to be an American slasher. It's funny to see how often British actors who are trying to speak "American" inadvertently slip back into their accent in the UK. .
