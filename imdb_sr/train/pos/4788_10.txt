This is one of the biggest movies I've ever seen: I've flashed through the whole movie. Music and cinema kept a spell when it happened a little on the screen. The slow pace was determined by the way of travel (lawnmower with a large trailer) and it was maintained in the background of scenes and sounds and the slow lives of other characters. The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no acting; everything was completely real, as if the actors were transforming into characters. Sissi Spacek gave a powerful performance as a slightly incompetent daughter who suffered a lot, but she moved on, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was perfectly thrown and he became beautifully Alvin Straight, stubborn but lovingly elderly man traveling through Iowa to visit his alienated brother, Lile, who had a stroke. Alvin had learned a lot of wisdom during his lifetime and seemed to have best shown in the people he met on the road. The film emphasizes the importance of family for this man and, hopefully, for all of us. I look forward to seeing him again and again. Directed by David Linch, this film proves his director's skill. Farnsworth was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress; At 79, he was the oldest candidate ever for that prize.
