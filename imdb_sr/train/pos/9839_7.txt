Hmmm, this episode is extremely underestimated. Although there are many bad writing and acting on the parts. I think the good gets bad. I love origami parts and a great 'tweeting' at the end. I absolutely love this scene when Michelle confronts Tony. It's actually one of my favorite scenes of Season 1. For some reason, people have always hated reincarnation episodes, but I always loved them. They are not the best in terms of writing. but the topic really interests me, I'll give him three stars, but if the writing is a bit more consistent, I'll give him four.
