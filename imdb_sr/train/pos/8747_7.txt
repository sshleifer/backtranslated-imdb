* Possible spoilers * Although it was done before (and even better) in 'Midnight Ekpress' and 'Return To Paradise', Brokedovn Palace still struck me. Here we have a story about two young girls traveling through Thailand and arresting for drug trafficking charges. Was it Alice Clara Today? Was it Darlene from Kate Beckinsale? Was it a handsome stranger whom they met on their journey? None of this matters, because this is a story of friendship and trust and the limits to which they can expand. Insert Bill Pullman as a frightening lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai young (and a better lawyer than he is) and we have a nice little story that draws the attention of the audience. Brokedovn Palace is nothing special, or notorious for any reason - it's not an original concept, it does not show the sensationalized violence that leads the audience-avant-garde to say that it's "persistent realism" or "hard hitting the truth" - it's just a good story with some nice performances. Bill Pullman is the weakest with his lazy pulling and pebble speech - I was pretty boring with the character. Kate Beckinsale, although decent, is nothing spectacular. He's acting well, but it's not a very unforgettable performance. However, Jackwell's Kim is in good shape, creating a nice and defined character where, indeed, there is not much work to do. > But do not make a mistake - this is Clare Today's movie. I am a fan of her work for a long time, and that does not change. She fascinates in every scene she appears, and if she is not her, the film would probably go down to a boring dinner. I especially applaud her performance on the scene between her and Darlin's father. The film also has a great sound surface. 7 of 10
