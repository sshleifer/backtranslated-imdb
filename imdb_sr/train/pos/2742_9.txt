Richard Brooks excellent? A 1967 film Truman Kapotea's In The COLD BLOOD is a perfect piece of pieces by Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar, who won the Oscars Award in 2005. They really play well together (try them separately). It's unusual to find films that have been separated for 38 years. These two really improve each other. Although various actors play the roles of Perry Smith and Dick Hickock killers, these two pieces fit well. Only a part of the writer (played by Paul Stevart) in Brooks films is weaker because they give him a different name from Capote. I suggest you first look at CAPOTE, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It's a powerful experience!
