First I must say that I am Portuguese and it is not common to spend time watching Portuguese films, probably one year or even none ... ... The reason is almost general idea among the Portuguese people that National images are terrible, really close to the worst ever made! However, in the last decade, it is beginning to surprise me when we return to the funny of the forties when "Leao da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were among the best in the world, with films like "Pulsacao Zero" or "Sort Zero" from the director of Fernand Fragat, as well as some actors and collaborative music. This is also good, not the same type as it is not a real comedy; In fact, it's an official drama, a female drama has some unexpected funny parts, a cause of witty characters or hilarious things that happen to them, such as a hypothetical trip to the Caribbean just to lay it down. The plot works and can surprise us several times; actors are fine, the sites are regular as a result; but the truth is that everything makes sense, then we can consider this a fine effort for national cinema, which seems to start from ashes as phoenix. If you want to watch a Portuguese movie, you can certainly take a better option, but there is still one that needs to be measured.
