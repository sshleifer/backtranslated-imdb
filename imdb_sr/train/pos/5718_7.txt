I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I bought tickets for the first time and then checked IMDb reviews. I was worried I would see a bad movie. Well, I enjoyed watching a movie. Some parts, which apparently should have been terrifying, were actually quite humorous, almost as if Buffa's vampire killer. It's not a bad movie. Not even a good movie. Just a pretty well-made horror movie. It does not rely on special effects, but on the corners of the camera, acting, music. In my opinion, the acting was fine. Sarah did a very good job, pretty convincing. And the other actors are definitely not bad, I loved Ioc. The sets are good (and I do not care what sets are the same as those used in the Japanese original). Br /> Terrible moments were often predictable. But not always. I saw a lot of horror and I did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nicely. The film had several beautiful scenes that were almost original, such as garbage trails, simple special effects for ghosts, the eyes of the boys, the cat that caused the noise, the gurgling from the dead boy and his mother. Do not go if you want to see Sarah in the second episode of Buffy, because she is very different from her work, Buffy, much more serious. Do not go if you just want to watch movies that bring nominations for the Oscars. It's a good horror movie, enough tension. I gave him 7.
