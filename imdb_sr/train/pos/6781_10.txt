When an actor has to play the role of an actor, fictitious or factual, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. In Double Life, Ronald Coleman surpassed himself as an Anthony John, a dual double personality. He put all his talent and sincerity into this character. Expressions of face, manner, attitude and attitude spoke eloquently about what Anthony John went through while playing Othello on the scene. Coleman was also extremely good as Shakespeare's actor in those short scenes such as Othello who was part of this gem of the film. Breaking Coleman's face while Othello was tormented by doubts about Desmond's faithfulness were in themselves scenes worth watching. It was like watching Spencer Tracy as Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hide, except that this double role was much deeper and more touching. Shelley Vinters looked so cute, vulnerable and beautiful at the same time and added her talent to the movie. It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film above all the others he played and won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1947.
