I just finished the Chronicle of the Heroic Knight only a few minutes ago and I found myself extremely pleased, but the questions continue to surge over me. Although it seems that the first 7 episodes are actually reciting events from the first Lodoss War plate, the truth is that they really are not. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different vision of how the original ended (and that may be the reason for the first 7 episodes to happen), but I do not consider it to be such. CotHK says it starts five years after the war that Parn was part of. I think the director made the first 5 episodes as if it were similar to the original rebalance only to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to the characters and their works done because they appear much less after the series enters Spark's story. Now, when the series hits the Spark part, we will meet for another 10 years (15 years since the war for Heros). Spark and his crew, in some cases, resemble Stein and his crew when the journey begins to expand, especially the love story between Spark and Neese. I also thought several times during CotHK that I was thrown into the original series and that there were no Spark's long blond hair, I know that I would stop more than once to make sure it's a real disk. I consider these large sets, however, that the writers have done a good job in producing convincing characters and extraordinary tales. The only thing that hurts me is that Ashram and Vagnard are coming back. Ummmm ... how ??? Do not get me wrong. Both are great criminals, although Ashram's only malicious feature is to support Marmo. Maybe I missed something during a rough series that explained that part. As for the sequels, I recommend CotHK. I also put CotHK and, moreover, the original record of Lodoss's war is far above the trilogy of Lord of the Rings. Both are more epic than anything I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend this.
