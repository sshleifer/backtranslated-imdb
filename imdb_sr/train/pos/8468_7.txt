A surprisingly interesting meditation about the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia. Many things happen because it lasts only 74 minutes, but it works. Fears are very subtle, not excessive fears that seem to host the latest Asian horror films. The way the "fears" are set is similar to the disturbing moments of "The Uninvited" (4 Iniong Shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but it's not nearly the same caliber. The film does a good job of balancing the classical story of ghosts with something unusual and psychological. It's not perfect, but it does what it takes. I would recommend checking it if you get a chance.
