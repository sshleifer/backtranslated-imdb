The three main characters are very well presented, especially Anisio by the rock musician who turned into actor Paula Miklos. He is extremely convincing as a lower class offender. The film shows very well the effect of snowball involvement in increasingly dubious jobs, contrasts and similarities between the lower and higher classes. How they all get out of greed and ambition. 9-9.5 of 10.
