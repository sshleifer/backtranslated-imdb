After an anonymous phone call for an aircraft that crashed in a frozen tree, two police officers found evidence that the event really took place and apparently one Marsian left the place. They drove to the nearby Hi-Vai cafe and found the bus stopped, and seven passengers waited for the snow to reopen in the bridge. However, the driver says he only had six passengers when he parked the bus. While interrogating travelers, strange things happen in the restaurant, turning on and off the lights, turning the turntables on and off. When passengers are released and the bus will follow his journey, one passenger returns to the diner and reveals the plot of the invasion on Earth. <br /> <BR> "Will the real Mars get up?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. An intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogues, funny characters and situations, and a surprising and unexpected story at the very end. My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): "About Marciano" ("Martian")
