Red Rock Vest is one of the few movies that keeps you wondering what's going to happen. Nicolas Cage is wrong for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find a job. Dennis Hopper is a bad guy and nobody plays better. Look for a short performance by the stars of the singers of the land, the Dvight Ioakam. This is a serious drama for most of the time, but there are some easier moments. What is important is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality of work!
