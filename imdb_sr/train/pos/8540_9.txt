It's funny how your life can change in seconds ... For the first time you attend "Vaterdance" it was an unforgettable experience, the way you have to get used to a new way of life can look terrifying, and notice that there are other people who are going through through a similar situation that can help you continue. The performances of Erika Stolts and mostly Helen Hunt (o man, Helen is the cleanest and more gracious woman on earth ...) are wonderful, Vesely Snipes is also surprised in one of your last serious roles. The film is simple and at the same time deep that does not leave us indifferent to the message being transmitted: enjoy every moment of your life ... Really movie as if the watch did not attend !!! (Sorry, it's a Brazilian expression ...).
