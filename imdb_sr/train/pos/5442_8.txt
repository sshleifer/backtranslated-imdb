This is a great movie. In the same genre of "Memphis Belle". I watched him 10 years ago. And I'd like to see him again. There is a connection with the history of hellish angels !! As the pilot team fights with the Germans in VO2. And most of the changes are formed by pilots for the Harlei motor cycle. The film actually happened in some way. Watch the movie!
