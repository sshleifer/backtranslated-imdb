An interesting combination of comments that it would be difficult to add something constructive. However, I will try. This was a very good action movie with some great sets. Note that I have determined the genre. I did not mumble about the lack of characterization, and I did not play acting. Enjoy if for what people are, a good average action movie. I could proceed, but I gave my comment.
