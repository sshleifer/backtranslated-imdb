Not surprisingly, Busei later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity, this film is also a bad decision, but I enjoyed it completely. The first 5 minutes is the most inspirational 5 minutes in any movie; boring, bad dialogue, and then, with Spiderman's attitude, Busei shouts the worst order in any movie ever created ... "Your worst nightmare!" I coughed from my eyebrows how I smiled so much. This line is responding so well, even the top of Clooney's notorious line "hi Freeze, I'm Batman". The other classic moments are that Busei is constantly upset by people who remind him that he had killed his former CIA partner ... what he did by accidentally shooting in his chest (all this enabled a great slow-motion slow-motion sequence that makes color look dry looks exciting) . There is an ashtray for hops, banging in the face, and "it was not my fault and you know it!" Well, the footage shows that he misses a bad guy and hits his friend, so ... The other cry-loud moments must be his ex-girlfriend who throws a bomb on the ground to allow his bek - a plan that defies all the logic, physics, and absurdity. Lastly, when McBain jumps out of Thunderblast during an intense Guerrilla War and begins to run and fight with a small object, I almost got soaked. Some of the best Buse's works so far, rent or buy today "Butthorn!" My voice is perfect 10 (per meter).
