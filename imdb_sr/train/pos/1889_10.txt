My family watched Arthur Bach stumble and stutter since the movie first came out. Most lines are stored. I watched her two weeks ago and still scolds me for a simple humor and a look at the life Dudley Moore shows. Liza Minelli did a great job as a side kick - although I'm not her biggest fan. This movie makes me enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur visits his fianc√©e's house. His conversation with the butler and Susanna's father is a side-by-side saliva. The line from the butler, "Would you like to wait in the library," and then Arthur's answer, "In order for the bathroom to be ignored," my NEVMAIL notification is on my computer. "Arthur is really a" funny thing "!
