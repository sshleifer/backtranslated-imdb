This is a very moving picture of thirty-forty best friends in a small English city. In the younger piano instructor we find passionate love and a new beginning, when tragedy and hearts change forever. Definitely a movie that has a tissue box with you! A powerful job. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time. SPOILER !!! SPOILER ALERT !! SPOILER !! * Main hero takes over her young, handsome piano instructor and passionate romantic flower. Her two jealous "friends" play an immature joke that quickly leads to tragedy. She loses her love and her friends in one run. In the end, suddenly they were surprised by the surprise (in my opinion, it was not forgiven)
