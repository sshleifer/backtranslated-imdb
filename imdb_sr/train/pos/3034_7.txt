The inadequate addition to Graham Greene's film canon - his perceived mistakes can now be regarded as virtue. Director Å umlin, the theater director, frames his action with repressive cruelty that suits the material, and seemingly incompetent compositions convincingly suggest discomfort. And the dark thriller and the story of moral regeneration (for the female figure! In the thriller of the 40s!), The film has an upright hero who is crazy and killing (and perhaps a pedophile), brilliantly brings forward the distant ideologies of the Spanish civil war. in an Ionizing dangerous reality, there is a terrible murder, a stunning insight into class and capitalism, smart theatrical metaphors, a rare approximation of Greene's God, and a place that is only happy if you do not know anything about history.
