Personally, I could not get into the song "This is not a love song", its brilliant movie and there's a great story, I'm just convinced that I'm checking the time on my phone every two minutes to see how much it's left from <br /> I love the connection between Spike and Heaton, where they depend on one another to fit in with life. At the same time, I want the connection to be more than what it is. Heaton is in love with the spike, but Spike Ibsen is not in love with Heaton, or he does not know how to love him. The work of publishing, on both parts, has a major impact on two men. Both were destroyed by the fact that others fled and left them, at a time when they really needed each other for survival.
