I would say that this film gives an insight into the trauma that a young mind can face when a family breaks through a divorce or another disaster. I recommend this film especially to parents or individuals who plan to have a family. The characters were attractive to me and very sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions. The scary monster, though probably not scary for most adults, has a very real indication of what could have been an over-imagining imagination of a child who faces unknown horrors.
