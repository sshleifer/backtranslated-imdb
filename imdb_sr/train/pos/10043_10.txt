This film rewrote film history in every way. Nobody cares about what someone thinks about this movie, because it goes beyond criticism. Every defect in the film is easily overcome by many incredible things the film has about it. It's a very nice movie, and I doubt that many of us will see something similar again. I've seen it many times than I care to count, and I'm still becoming transfixed every time, with a feeling that's hard to describe. One for centuries.
