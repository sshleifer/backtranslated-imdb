This surprised me because in the past I was often disappointed with Adrian Pasdrom, but he caught the perfect balance in this show, avoiding the farce and the pathos while delivering humor and making emotions. Always lovely Julie Vaters is great here, and anyone who has not yet recorded in Educational Rita in 1983 should be rented immediately (a wonderful film). The rest of the auxiliary characters are well-played, and many are wonderfully eccentric without crossing over the top. This is fun.
