This is the best movie ever! Am I saying this because I'm a big fan of Silverstone? In part, but even without her, I would still see her. I am a fan of genre serial killer films, and I believe this is an excellent entry into this category. Also, Marie Giordano is easily ranked in the ranks of Alicia's top five creations. Totally unforgettable - as if it really exists. I would put it on my side if there is a mystery to be solved. She plays the character, just as she does with her real life, with complete certainty of everything she does. It looks cute, honest, nice ... as it is in real life. Is it an act? Yes, indeed, she is again a kind of rebel. This time it's not bad, it's too good and it's a little scary to do things that look above the law. But she does not do things that a normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends time reading the detective magic and solving crimes. The clich√© is abundant: it in some way refreshes the fathers of death, in a different way from the style of the avenger. At that time, Alicia seemed to play the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without parents, lonely. And this is happening here, but this time it's a little reluctant. It does not matter; It's still cool like a stupid one. Look at this soon, otherwise Giordano will investigate why you are not ...
