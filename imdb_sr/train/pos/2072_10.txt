I was about thirteen when this film came out on television. He's far superior in the action of most films since then. Martin Shin is excellent, and although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also provides excellent support. Vic Morrow as a villain is great. When Sheen "tests the water" in her Ford (34) along the mountain highway is spectacular! Great. I'm disappointed with the bad vote. I consider that younger generations have more interest in most of the garbage that is emerging these days. Good taste evades the masses!
