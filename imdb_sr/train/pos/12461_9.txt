A smart script from the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and intelligent performances from two male guides - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or this should be the opposite) results in an interesting and entertaining thriller. Add to above the competent veteran regime of JEAN HERMAN and the scant but effective result of FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIKS, it becomes easy why this film has an odd timeless quality. This is a friend or friend of the story with two loners, disappointed and worldly tired, coming back, probably from Algeria. Like other colonial powers of this time (after the Second World War in the 60s), France struggled to retain performances abroad. The loss of Algeria was a bitter blow. ADIEU L'AMI (original title) records the actions of our two (anti) heroes as they struggle to leave after their discharge. /> One thing happens for the other, and the viewer really has to pay attention, because JAPRISOT is slim and economical with its scenario: if there, then there must be a reason. Suffice it to say, these two men are fighting physically and mentally, one long weekend. Their motivation is quite different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on one another. ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different from the outside - a former, undoubtedly handsome boy, and another ugly robber, contributing to chemistry. This quest makes a great story, which in turn brings a great story. In order to forget that there are women in this film and that they are true to the Japanese method, they are unforgettable, though not so close; say a lot more to spoil the pleasure of discovering their true nature. FRIEND IS APPROVED IN UK; ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 ENHANCED; Only in English (not even hearing aids); CURRENT TIME 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK or DE ROUBAIKS music has a lot of blows! Highly recommended.
