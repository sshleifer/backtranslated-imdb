The actors were good, and I thought it was a good performance by Christopher Lloyd, whom I loved from previous films. The movie was an excellent family movie, nothing to worry about to show it to younger children, good story, a lot of laughter, carefree and pleasant. If you want to entertain children without boredom, they fit into the account. Kid is pleasing, and it is not difficult for parents to watch.
