Although the main story was to be held in Morocco, this film was filmed in foggy Romania for 18 days with a very limited budget. As far as their charts are broken, the actors and the team play them with extraordinary skill and dedication, so I eventually find the result touching and graceful. Nikolai Coaster-Valdau offers an outstanding performance as a bad guy. The script and direction give some jewels. However, whether you like the movie or not, it will probably depend on how much you will look at Alekandra Staden in the title role. Other reviewers pointed to Staden's inadequacies as Modesta Blaise. Perhaps they have a point, but I realized that its interpretation is wonderful and very appropriate. Modesty manages to overcome terrible chances through discipline, innate talent and courage. Staden seems to be doing the same here.
