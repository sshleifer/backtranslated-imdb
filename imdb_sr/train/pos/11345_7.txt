That's why I still have nightmares. This frightening movie (musical) is considered appropriate for children of the seventies. The boy goes on a magical journey to the island. . The mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, allegedly a dragon, who looks more like a newcomer with conjunctivitis, and a magical flute that speaks, deals with witches (Billie Hallidai, who at the time was considered "a little good"). The flute was found on an "interesting" witch convention, with old-time witches. The boy is then dressed as a "villa" for the recovery of the flute. It is not suitable for children.
