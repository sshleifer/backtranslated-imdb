Catscratch is the best thing about Nickelodeen, including Vaine Knight. This show is not only attracted by Maoris and PI. Some people love him, and they all are ausi. At first glance I admit that this is a bit rough, but it grows greatly on you. Also, to correct something that one of the critics said In_Correct (Tv.com) does not say "Does that mean you are homo now?" he says, "Does that mean you're homo, this?" This is his phrase in the show. Mr. Blick is, I think, the most fun of everyone like PevV-Vevv's Plaihouse First, I admit that the early episode was a bit of a good one. But after a while, episodes have become great! And just when the series revealed that it was surreal, it's crazy ... Nickelodeon is canceling it! I know Nick is meant for children, but every time there is a brilliant show where teenagers can enjoy. and adults. These shows include Mr. Bean Animated Series, Charlie Brovn, Pelsvick, Rocko's Modern Life (sometimes) and Invader Winter. All this has to be considered too good, with the exception of CatDog, because Nick felt the need to cancel them. What I love is the famous final episode, in which Gordon fights with a duck. /> <b> I'd like to see a DVD, with lots of audio reviews and documentaries, including the latest episode. But of course, what I definitely would like to see is that the show is back in the air. Wake NICK! I want to find somewhere on the Internet a list with all closing credits. It would be great.
