Although I would like to enjoy the show, I expected something completely different from the first time I saw 'What I like about you' I expected to find something like the 'All That' model (I'm not sure if it's happening anymore )) but I must say that I love the show and while I do not classify it as a breakthrough show, it is very charming and I love chemistry between characters (including auxiliary heads) <br /> <I would definitely say that it is great to see Vesely Jonathan back at screen, because I really loved him in Citi Gui. I also saw a woman playing Valeria's friend in Popular, and while I think that's fine, I do not really like her character in this show, because she's just not my cup of tea, but she's rounding up well.
