These films are the best movie for watching comics. The sets, costumes and colors are so vivid that it's just like you went into a comic book. This is a film about whom the mafia, suits, hats and attitudes are mentioned. Hofman gives comic relief as Mumbles and you can not help but insult Madonna while trying, and does not manage to beat Traci. This film contains all the classic mafia clich√©s - burying people in concrete, blowing up a car of people, tying a good guy and trying to blow his girlfriend out. This film is a classic in everything. The word, even the angels with the camera shouting at the comic book. It's great to be able to go back to the older movie and see that someone knew how the comic should be made in the movie after he saw such mistakes as Spavn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!!
