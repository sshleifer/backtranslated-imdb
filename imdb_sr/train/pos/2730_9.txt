I saw it in the theater during his first release and was disturbing, because I'm sure he will continue to be. That was the first part of '68. And it was still doing rounds in cities across America and recently there was mass murder in my hometown where I saw this where one man went to the shooting. The freshness of this close home event combined with this dramatic true story has been made for a very disturbing theater experience. He really enjoyed the great acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was introduced to a novel based on Truman Kapote's true event, and the script and direction by Richard Bruce emphasized the Truman's interpretation of the incomparable film adaptation. Music from Quincy Jones effectively evaluates his story. I've seen it just a few times since. It was too real. Almost as if I were a witness of the crime itself and riding along with the killers. I would give this 9.0 out of the possible 10. The society is so sensitive today to violence and crime that it probably seems slow and pitiful and can be viewed with less effect, but for everyone over 50 years it will be a feature in criminals' psiche.
