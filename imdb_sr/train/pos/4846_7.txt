This is a classic British comedy thriller that I always wanted to check, but for now I have not had the opportunity to do so. It is based on a popular theater play that has already been filmed several times before (especially in 1931 by the same director, but unfortunately this version does not seem to have survived in its entirety!); for the remake that is being considered, the action has been updated to the present wartime situation. In any case, I mostly knew the early British comedians through the films of Vill Hai: since this has a similar plot of legendary persecution, smuggling and hostile agents, this is largely concerned ( he actually wrote Hai's regular writing team Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); the element of backward passengers, therefore, was equally tried and true formula. This time the star is Arthur Askei (supported by Richard Murdoch) - none of the films I've watched before - which is an incredible hero like Hai himself and whose personality is proven potentially irritating ... but soon he warmed up ... to him , and Askei certainly comes with a number of witty lines and fun parts of the business to justify the fact that the main character of the show (and a 1931 film version) is divided here into two parts, and Murdoch acted as a flat partner of the star. Remote individual setting (movie events largely take place during one stormy night) provides some wonderful atmosphere; The last half hour - with the sudden appearance of the mysterious pair (Raimond Huntlei and Linden Travers) and, ultimately, the arrival of the titular vehicle - is particularly burdened and well processed. On the list of other actors it's worth mentioning Kathleen Harrison as a stereotyped scared anointed person, with a parrot as a permanent companion and who is encouraged by all the excitement to take his first drink.
