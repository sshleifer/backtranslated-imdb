One of the most intelligent comedies for films in the Hindi movie. Remake Priiadarshans Malajalama from the 80s hit Boeing Boeing, which was again a remake of the same hits of the 60s, Garam Masala raises the standard of comedy at the Hindi cinema. Akshai Kumar once again proved that he is one of the best super stars of Hindi cinema who can do comedy. He fitted well with the new piece of John Abraham. However, John still remains in the shadow of Akshais and fails to climb the opportunity. New girls are sweet and fully fulfill their role. A must watch comedy. Leave your brains and smile for 2 hours !!!! After all, laughter is the best medicine! Ask Priiadarshan and Akshai Kumar !!!!!
