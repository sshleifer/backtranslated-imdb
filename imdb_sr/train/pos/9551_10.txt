I must say that I was surprised by the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. Scenario and acting are pretty good. The director did a good job. Although some scenes look a bit clumsy, it's a decent movie in general. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth was not revealed to the very end. The mental hospital atmosphere was pretty good. The action was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people may be a bit boring because the story is very focused and they take their time to develop characters and stories. He had to tell stories, it's a decent movie for his genre and it's amazing.
