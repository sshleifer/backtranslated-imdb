What is most worrying about this movie is not that the schools that kill in school, as shown, are really happening, but it's true that they are run by teens like Cal and Andre ... normal children with normal families. Using the handheld technique and witch Blair, Ben Coccio manages to bring us into the lives of two friends who have some problems with high school, although we have never been told exactly what lies behind those issues. They seem to be typical - a lot of people hate high school, so what? Part of you simply does not believe that he will ever perform a very well-designed massacre on Zero Day. Scenes of surveillance cameras in school during the shooting are even more powerful for this reason. You can not believe that this really happens, and that really happened. The handheld technique also creates an illusion that this is not a scripted movie, a great idea with regard to the topic.
