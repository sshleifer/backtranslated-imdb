This is a cry that has never been. As much as I wanted to love Beaches, it always seemed to me that it was too hurrying to "feel" about it (although its soundtrack was one of my favorite albums). On the other hand, Stella moves slower (and occasionally slow) pace, and although something is manipulative in a tear-trigger story about a self-sacrificing mother, it works because Bette and other actors turn into great performances. 10/10
