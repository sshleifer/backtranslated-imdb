I finally saw this movie tonight after I rented it in Blockbuster (VHS). I must agree that this is a wild original. Yes, maybe the characters were not fully realized, but that's not one of those movies. Instead, we are treated to the director, his vision of what he is talking about. And it does not stop. And to be honest, I did not want to. I believe that Sabu had to influence directors 'Lock, Stock & Tvo Smoking Barrels' and 'Run, Lola, Run'. But I absolutely loved the way in which three people say to see a beautiful woman in the street to turn them away instantly. I really need to see this other directing work because this film really intrigued me. If you want insight, culture, strength, and drang, go elsewhere. If you would like laughter, camera movement and criminal cheer, see here.
