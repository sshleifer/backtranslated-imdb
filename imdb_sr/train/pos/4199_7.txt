The only thing about this film that refuses me is that the DVD is so expensive. At the moment, it's too much for my budget, or I would buy it, because the film is a good example of a movie night ... and I enjoy seeing Richard Vidmar, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter. The criterion produces great DVDs, but sometimes the price is just a little bit too low. This is the case for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound that's good, but nothing exceptional, cinema. The story is a story here (as opposed to paintings, actors), sound, sets, etc.) as a pocket (Vidmark) inadvertently struggling with a spy microfilm in his possession after stealing Peters's purse. (Say this three times!). Everyone except Peters is a convincing figure in this film: Vidmark, police officers, US agents and communists, and especially Ritter as "Moe," an informer. She and Vidmark are the stars of this movie. Peters works a decent job of playing cheap floos, but at the very beginning he loses credibility by "falling in love" with Vidmark at the first meeting, although he is nasty to her. Only in the movie world !! Too bad, because this funny romantic part of the story is taken away. It's an average movie noir that means good, but not big and certainly not worth owning at a price of $ 25-35. For this price, it could be done much better in the film market noir.
