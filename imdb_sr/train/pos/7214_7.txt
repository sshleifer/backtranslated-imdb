Ira Levin's Deathtrap is one of those mysterious films in Sleuth's tradition that would be very easy to spoil, if you really tested the film's plot. That's why I will be short to say that this is a play, one man who is a famous mysterious drama writer, another man who is a promising writer, the wife of a dramatist who is much younger and sexy than she should have been, and a German psychopath for driving . Director Sidney Lumet, who is not a stranger in the movie, is pretty good at creating the tension that the film should be running. Dialogue is fast, fresh, and funny. Michael Caine stands out in such roles. Christopher Reeve is usable and actually grows on you to see him more. Irene Vorth stands out as a fun psychic. A Dian Cannon? I loved how Lumet packed his back in those real tight trousers and worn perhaps the harshest peaks around him, but she is terribly wrong in that role - the role that should be given to the older actress and one less seductive. But why rebel with the apparent attempt to bribe his male viewers when nothing changes now? Deathtrap is funny, sophisticated, witty and stylish. The mystery has some obvious flaws that are somewhat disturbing, and I was not completely satisfied with the ending, but watching Caine and Reeve under Lumet's direction with Levin's exalted insight was enough to capture my interest and hold him captive the entire length of the film.
