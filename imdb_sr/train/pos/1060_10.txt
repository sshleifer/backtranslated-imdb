Dark Angel is a cross between Huklei's Brave New World and Percy's Love in Ruins - showing a not so distant future as an upsetting blend of chaos and order, in the worst sense of the word. Once you swallow the premise that all modern technology can be stopped by the "pulse," it provides a fun landscape to explore the personality and relationship between the two main characters - Maca (Dark Angel / cyclist) and Logan (rich rebel). It seems to be uneven, perhaps the result of various authors, but it keeps together the energetic, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba, which looks both strong and reckless, but vulnerable and sensitive. I think Fok repeated it.
