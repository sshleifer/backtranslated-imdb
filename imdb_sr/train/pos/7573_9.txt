One of the most terrible experiences of games that will make you keep the lights near the bed. A great story with a romantic, terrible and ironic complication. Lovers of the original Resident Evil will be surprised by the return character! Not to mention that voice action has been dramatically improved compared to the previous series. Do not miss the best of the series.
