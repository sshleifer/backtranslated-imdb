Vow babies, this is indeed a fine Asian horror / up, and a crazy unusual movie. This is a Japanese splatterfest that reminded me little of Tetsuo, except in this case with all my blood and intestines, there is a bizarre love story. It's hard to imagine how they even dreamed of this visually stunning movie, with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites, turning them into parts of a machine or assuming cyborgs. The only thing that's wrong with these creatures after taking over a man is that they have to kill themselves and eat the other. hmm, ium ium. This would probably be called industrial spatter or something similar, with an excellent sound surface that will contribute to the party. The film also lends something to Carpenter's "Thing" in the design and effects of the creature. I would put this in a must-have category for gorehounds, because there is a non-stop slaughter and some very fine up. And have to-have for stoners, because you do not even have to read subtitles, visual images themselves are enough to travel the mind. The design of small creatures that inhabit the human body as a fetus reminded me little of Frank Henenlotter's films, which is another homage to some great choronious films that have a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is a big party for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it, and I just loved it.
