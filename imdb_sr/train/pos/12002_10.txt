Despite reading "initial comments" from someone who loved the film curiously - (WHY IS A NECESSARY COMMENTARY ONLY FIRST IN THE CENSUS?) It was nice to mention that everyone else loved him! It is obvious that the Church wanted to highlight some points and showed the prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way - that's the whole idea. In fact, these points were extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was a human being ... but in spite of all this, all the terrible negative attempts of the opponent, he showed how he managed to finish the incredible, God-given work. I would recommend it to everyone!
