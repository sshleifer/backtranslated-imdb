This was one of the first CREEPI movies I've ever seen ... \ t Scared me GOOD! But that night I put a chewing gum on one eye to be like a monster ... and my mom was very upset. She had to cleanse her eyes with alcohol, and the next day she smelled me at DOUBLE MINT! NOW IS A FILM! Hey, it's time to be a great movie. That head sitting on the desk was as real as it was then. And if your 5 is OLD OLD! The children are now spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave NISHT to your imagination. Your mind can think things more horrible than special effects! (IMO)
