I was lucky to catch this movie while I volunteered at the Mariland Film Festival. I have always been a fan of classic horror films, especially the tricks of the Villiam Castle, so this definitely had to be seen. This is about the life and work of Villyama Castle in my opinion was the underrated director. True, he made some cheap budget movies of horror films, but he added something to these films: they make live theater tricks that you no longer see. For example, he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack in their films and placed vibrators at the bottom of the chair in TINGLER. to the light, and celebrated his contribution to the horror. In it, the castle is bigger than life, which was very popular and he had a smile on his face. shows interviews mainly from members of his family and directors influenced by his work, such as John Vaters, John Landis and Joe Dante. Must be seen for classic horror and sci-fi fans.
