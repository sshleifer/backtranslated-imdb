David Beckham is the British football star and husband Victoria Beckham ("Posh Spice" Spice Girls). Its trademark is a goal that bends over the field and enters the net. A soccer equivalent of an inconspicuous ball in a baseball. "Bend to Beckham" means making such a spectacular record. In addition, and a little shrine to him in the main hero's bedroom and the fauk-cameo at the very end, the film has nothing to do with it. The film is full of small football. - jokes, such as the present, that one of the parents of the characters gives her a number 9 shirt (the property of the great Mia Hamm, those who know them), the references to "Posh 'n' Becks", a video homage VUSA, one of the characters a game for an unbelieving friend ("They * have * it?"), lesbian jokes, sports brassieres, and so on. The story is about a teenage girl in England who is idolizing Beckham and wants to be a football star. She has a real gift, but two seemingly insurmountable obstacles to overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the UK (hence their fascination with our VUSA), and her parents, who are indigenous immigrants placed in very old-fashioned ways. which do not allow daughters, inter alia, to engage in contact sports. The girl's family is shown as figures of ironic entertainment, but with great affection - think of Mi Big Fat Greek Vedding. The girl loves and respects enough to go through hell to hide her growing football star from them.
