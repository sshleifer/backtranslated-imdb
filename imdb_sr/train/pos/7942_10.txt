Giallo fans are looking for this rare movie. It's well written and full of all kinds of common low living populations of these films. I do not want to say anything, so I will not say anything about the plot. The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere, and you do not know what to expect or who you would suspect. Recommended! The only place I've seen to get this movie in English is from the European Trash Cinema, for $ 15.
