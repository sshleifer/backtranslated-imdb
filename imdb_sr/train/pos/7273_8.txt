Carlos Mencia was great. He worked hard to show everyone that it was the right thing. I know that people said that he stole the material in this special, but that's not true. Carlos brings the comedy at first glance the way he wants it, not how someone else wants it, so he's so good. People say it's not funny because Dee dee dee dee says too much, and they still did not realize it was part of his act, and they do not want it that way, but he brings it anyway, and manages to do it like that. laugh. For all the hijackers out there, here are the messages, Carlos is there to stay, you do not have the point of trying to bring him down.
