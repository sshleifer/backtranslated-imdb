With a stunning cinema and a thread of Kafkian absurdity, this film brought me from a simple but fascinating scene. The film plays a lot like a dream, and I think it's the reason people either hate or love. The characters are superimposed, and the story itself is small and maybe a little nonsense. But these are the shortcomings of the film, but they know the choices. The film does not work as history, but as a deconstruction of war films from the 1940s. It would be difficult for me to argue that the movie was very real, but the film is such a film wonder that I was completely blotted out. This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, and there's also wild imagination in your style. I can fully understand why people would hate it, but I give it 9/10.
