The "Kum" of television, but apart from its recognition and character mafias, the two of them are nothing like that. Toni Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Toni is actually part of two families - in one family he is a father full of love, but not so perfect husband, and in another family is ruthless wisdom. After the analysis, Dr Melfi concludes that Toni's problems are in fact from his mother Livia, who is suspected of having a borderline personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as the main character; however, Bracco and Marchand are not as well known for their equally talented performances as a psychiatrist and mother. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo praised their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from E-Street Banda) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is pretty convincing and latching. Chianese, the only repetitive actor who actually appeared in the movie Kuma, plays Tony's uncle and on-off nemesis. Many fans enjoyed the characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's kids are "ok" but not noticeable (with the exception of Iler's amazing performance in the third episode "Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirrip are incredible and over-the-top, but the show is too strong to keep them. Even as the series continues for more than six seasons, it ceases to have a boring or predictable moment. **** (from four)
