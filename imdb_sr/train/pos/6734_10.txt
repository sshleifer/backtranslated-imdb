Riding a giant is an incredible documentary that describes the history and stories of three influential surfers, Gregg Nolla, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Staci Peralta has done an amazing job by taking on the role of director and you should congratulate him for having done such a brilliant job. The structure of the film is brilliantly edited and perfectly works with narration, interviews, animation and surfing. The music music addition contributes to the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, making the riders with the game a great look. Personal accents include any of Greg Nollo's comments, which is with his direct sincerity, Laird Hamilton's shot at Teahupoo, and footage at the end of the film. But this whole movie is really great, recommended, which is recommended if you have the opportunity to see it. It's a shame that it's not known anymore, but the jewel deserves attention. 10/10
