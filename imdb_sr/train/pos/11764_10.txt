I saw it in the '86 theater and dropped out of my chair, laughing several times. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... he's the best goddamn baseball player ever to have lived." It's great to get there. Training scenes are very funny, but the best scene can be when Jack and Reno try to watch Falcons football match. Vikings on Monday, trying to organize dinner with their husbands. It seems that Villiams and Russell are very entertaining with this and that it is bad that it is ignored as a top comedy.
