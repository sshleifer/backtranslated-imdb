To begin with, since this movie is a classic remake, the rating has to be reduced. Since this version is headed by Viggo Mortensen in the lead role of Kovalsky, it helps. Is not it just as the United States government has terrorized one of its citizens. Sounds like Jason Priestley's character from the movie! But this is true, the government would do everything possible to destroy the life of man because of an attempt to return home to his wife. A woman who is no less pregnant, and maybe she fails. "In this country the police have followed a man to his pregnant wife." Say the disc of the jockey. In this film there were great scenes of landscapes and great car searches and a lot of spirituality. After much consideration, I gave this film 7.
