Daniel Dai Levis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's unbelievable how much he throws into each of the characters he plays, making them real. I remember, many years ago, we had a party in our house - friends came, we sat, sat around the table, drank, drank wine, talked, laughed - had a good time. Television was included - it was a movie that we did not pay much attention. Then we suddenly stopped talking and laughed. The glasses did not sound, the forks did not move, the food cooled on the plates. We could not take a look from the screen where the young man was mutilated by a man whose entire body was against him and who only had control of his left leg, raised a piece of chalk with his foot, and for what seemed to have been eternity to write only one word on the floor . When he finished writing this word, we all knew that we were witnesses of not only one, but three victories - a triumph of human will and spirit, a triumph of a movie that managed to capture a moment like this, and a triumph of an actor who did not act but became his figure. "My left foot" Jim Sheridan is an riveting, unsentimental bio-drama about Kristi Braun, a man born with cerebral palsy in the Dublin Stall; who became an artist and writer and who found the love of his life. I like every day of Levis performances (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONI) but I believe that his biggest role was Christi Brovn in "We Left Foot"
