When I was 17, I started Bie Bie Birdie High School - which is not a big surprise because it is the perfect material for high school and known for being the most used musical in the world. I was a music student and kept a strong memory of the production and her songs, as well as the long-term neglect of the Dick Van Dike film version which (deliberately) blurred Elvis's references and camped for the audience of the 60s. <br /> <br> So, when the 1995 version of Jason Alekander played on my cable TV screen, I was delighted with what I saw. Alexander turns into an extraordinary performance like Albert, a performance in strong contrast with his famous person from a certain TV series. The rest of the actors are fun and convincing in their roles (Chinna Phillips may be the only one that does not look like her part, supposedly naive and innocent student). But best of all, musical numbers that are famous for theater performances are preserved in this film and performed as theater music songs (with the absence of a stage). So, if you know music (and a few do not), then look at this telemovie. This shows justice on the scene in a way that can not possibly be improved, which is good enough for me. What is better than the faithful and faithful writing of a writer, color and style?
