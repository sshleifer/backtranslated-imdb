The completely rounded character of the main role of this film, that policeman who torn his past and the way of self-destruction, so clear to the viewer, is unique for his time in 1950. With film music and a well-written action, the film is the best example of a movie noir at its best. The great plans of Dana reveal the torment in themselves, Karl Malden stands out as a boss who has no nonsense, but he also has pity for those under his command in the district. Oto Preminger made this kind of film just about his own. If there is any mistake, it would be with the breath of the beauty of Gene Tiernei who looks strangely inadequate with a rigid cop. However, their cafe scene is wonderful and true. Tom Tully, in a small part of her father is as perfect as Garry Merrill as a hood. Excellent lighting and mood. Building in which deadly work takes place very atmospherically, I like the old woman in the basement. 8 of 10.
