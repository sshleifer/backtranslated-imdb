This incredibly stupid, "Valker, Tekas Ranger" movie contains some of the most incredible scenes ever seen in a TV movie. In addition, the outcome can be predicted from the outset. However, it's a fun little movie that does business: it's fun. That's all it was supposed to do and it does. Acrobatics and explosions are fun and exciting, and the plot is not half bad. The acting is also decent, which is not a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of the genre (and "Valker, Tekas Ranger"), you will surely like it. If not, then do not waste time. 8/10
