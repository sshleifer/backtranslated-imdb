John Travolta, the biggest honkeitonk in the world, and a mechanical bull ... what more can you look for! Yes, you probably will not get much surprise or a deep sense in this. Nevertheless, it has always been quite pleasant for me to watch this peasant romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sissi (Debra Vinger) meet at Gilley and fall in love. They have all the difficulties that you might expect from a hardcore redneck couple. Honkeitonk scenes are fun with dance, mechanical riding bulls, and of course - the necessary brawls. He has a good soundtrack from 1980, with "I'm looking for love in all the wrong places", "Devil went to Georgia" and "Hello Tekas" from my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Beat your cowboy boots and get a boot! *** (out of 4)
