North Africa 1930s. In a small Arab city on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman seeking a sense of her life and a handsome monk trapist who runs away from her crisis of faith. They will meet and the passions will be stirred up, but the Sand of the Diver does not know whether they will find happiness or sorrow here in the GARDEN OF ALLAH. The action is pure hockey, but the movie is still fun and nice to look at. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boier are a top pair of screens. She is, simply put, beautiful, and Boier gives the most effective, underestimated performance, allowing his sensitive face to do a lot for him. The support is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in the lovely role of the Count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly, talkable guide (all "Arabic" he and others speak in the film are pure nonsense); Lucile Vatson as a gentle mother higher; Alan Marshal as a respectable young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comedian; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner; and the magnificent Sir C. Aubrei Smith as a wise old priest. Film Mavens will recognize Helen Jerome Eddie as a nurse; Marcia Mae Jones and Bonita Granville (wrapped over the sister's shoulder) as a girls' monastery; Nigel De Brulier, a monastic lector; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel official, are all unpublished. Movies from the 1930s are rare and beautiful to watch, and this film is no exception - cinema is colorful like the desert itself. The ALLAH GARDEN was the first Technicolor film that was filmed at the site. Iuma, Arizona, gave filmmakers all the sand dunes they could wish, but contaminated drinking water and heat of 135 degrees soon rebelled. When daytime runs showed Boier's face burned a great tomato in red, producer David O. Selznick finally gave in. The rest of the film was shot on a Hollywood sound stage.
