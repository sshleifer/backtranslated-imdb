I do not see how you can say that Freddi's Nightmares is cheese and rip-off. Obviously you do not know the good TV when you see it. Episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddie's nightmares and I hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturdai Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series is exhausted then you have the right to your opinion, but remember that this is just your opinion and it does not mean anything. Freddi's Nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and will quickly accept this fact. If you do not like it, do not look at it, but do not deny that it's great.
