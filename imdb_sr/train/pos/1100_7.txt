- When he was tired of rats race and cramped living conditions in New York, Jim Blandings (Keri Grant) is finding property in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find a simple life. But building a house is proving everything just not. As headaches and bills begin to accumulate, they laugh too. Will the g. Blanding ever get your dream home? - What makes this film special is the three main actors - Grant, Mirna Loi and Melvin Douglas. Each of the three is able to carry the film independently, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been my favorite in this type of role. She's so good at playing her husband. Loi is always a pleasure to watch. The films of the thin men she recorded with Villiam Povell are near perfection. And Douglas has become my favorite in the last two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, one of my dear ones. - Film is definitely the product of your time. I lost out of the imagination of a time when you could build a two-storey, three-bedroom, four bathroom at $ 15,000 income annually. Get into the fact that your two children attend a private school and you have a servant who lives in it and it becomes almost fantastic. and the predispositions in which Blanding's findings are found can easily be linked today. And comedy is coming here. How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie just to eventually cost more money than they expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the whole "wife in love with the best friend". It really is not necessary for complication and it feels out of place and is very unpleasant as it is presented.
