With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $ 60 million, Fok Animation and Blue Ski Studios have done an incredible job. They combine the cutting edge digital animation, perfectly act the talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizama and Denis Liery (among many others) to make a very fun family movie with a strong message of cooperation, friendship and care for your members what to. And how sometimes it takes a lot of different creatures to create a herd. As I watch this movie, I got a strong political message on how to deal with people who share your space - you might need to watch for all the world leaders! David Nevman - another member of the Nevman family of Hollywood composers - provides an excellent score that is not intrusive, but serves to move the action and, sometimes, a positive toe. The overall appearance of the film is incredible; an intensely colored, unusually convincing fantastic land of snow, geyser, mud, rock and ice. Individual figures were very convincing, and the expression of Raifan Manfred's face was a special treat. The entire sequence with DoDos will not leave any doubt as to where the term 'Dumb Doo comes from.' 'This is a good family movie that keeps things that can alarm or scare children, to a great extent disinfect - but they are still real. It would be a great movie to watch in the theater and shopping for the home.
