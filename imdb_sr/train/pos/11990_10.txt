In 1990, the cartoon world about Disney TV was certainly at its peak. They were already popular Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears, and now Disnei made another great cartoon and this cartoon brought the birth of Disney Afternoon. This cartoon is called TaleSpin. It's about the old character of the Jungle Book Baloo Bear while getting a job in an airline business. In the series he meets Kit Cloudkicker, former Air Pirates and a good surfer, business ladies Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is very funny and has many great games that you may not understand as a child, but later you understand in life. This is a smartly written series and it's great to add to your DVD collection. Parents, buy this for your children, rather let them watch all those horrible Nickelodeon cartoons. If you liked TaleSpin, then look at the "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Spin it!
