Yes, Giorgio, is a good movie. Little romantics, great music, beautiful landscapes, comedy, (big food struggle) and a bit of bitter-sweet taste are the ingredients Da, Djordja. Every movie lover would enjoy this movie. Those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere. Many of us need to get out of here somewhere and how to better do it, but with a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? Must see!
