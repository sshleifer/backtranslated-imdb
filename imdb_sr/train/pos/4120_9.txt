In 1970, after a five-year absence, Kurosawa made his first color film. Dodes' Ka-Den is a film that revolves around many intertwined stories that unfold in a small Tokyo straw. . We slowly meet more people in a small community, two drunkards who trade with women because they are not happy with those they have. An old man who is the center of a city that helps a breaker trying to rob him. A very poor father and son who can never afford a house, and imagine their own. By the end of the film, the stories come in a full circle, some turn out to be happy, others are sad. . Maybe too. This film goes in many different directions and it is difficult to calm down and enter it. But do not misunderstand me, Dodess's Ka-Den may not be Kurosavin's best, but comes from the greatest director of all time, much better than 99% of today's movies.
