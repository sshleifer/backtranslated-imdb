This movie has everything that a fantasy movie should have, romance, smart dash, great acting and a fair amount of magic. I basically enjoyed this film and got into his original work (based on the novel Neil Gaiman I'm now looking to read) and colorful characters. One of the most remarkable things for me in fact was how the story itself was concerned. Unlike many science fantastic films that now leave open ends and such, this was a pure fairytale, in itself satisfactory, without the need for continuation. Original. Fun. Feel-good Fantasy.
