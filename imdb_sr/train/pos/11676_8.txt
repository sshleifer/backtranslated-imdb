If you love Long Vai Round, you will enjoy it almost equally. Educational, fun, interesting and intense. Charlie shares a screen with two interesting matchmakers, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too many Russians. Evan made several appearances, but Charlei really pulled himself out. He is a funny, attractive and still patch of stress and suspicion. Great stuff! The series ends in 7 episodes. Like LVR, preparation is almost as interesting as a race. Although they well cover the entrances and exits from the race, there could be a little more explanation about trucks and cars, which are just mentioned and rarely even seen. It's a movie for motorcycles and everyone on two wheels will love this. The series has a stunning photo, as well as several interviews of people. Iikes. There is another very attractive topic like LVR, but this is not nearly as good as Stereophonics. watch it on your computer like me. Oh, and be ready to buy another motorcycle.
