You know? Our spirit is based on this revolution, he sleeps ... I can explain, I think !! Well ... Until this happens on April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have the freedom of speech, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese people have lost their mind, we do not use our freedom of speech! This is all the consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear! ... About the movie ... I think there are several mistakes on the character of a character, but by the way I use to watch Portuguese films, that's pretty good! I like it a lot!
