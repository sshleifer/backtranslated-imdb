I saw this movie last night on the cable, and that's extraordinary. What I love most is that it is underestimated and quiet, but deeply honest. Henry Thomas (he played a child in E.T.) the performance is masterfully unarticulated (it should be a man of a few words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain. And miraculously (bearing in mind that we're talking about a Hollywood product), the baby serves as the main character, but one that does not behave or has lines, but only IS (and it's bright). It is interesting to note that Thomas' mysterious link in. E T. was the core of this film; while his relationship is in. baby serves as the core of "good baby". Then there is the music - ah, which music !! The Gillian Velch melodies are wonderful and the whole score is a beautiful mountain-countri music. This film is beautifully atmospheric. I recommend him high.
