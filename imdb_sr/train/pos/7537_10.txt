Contrary to what those who hate Christianity, the club 700 provides the right answers as well as inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical comments and a different attitude than ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS are considered to be the best. Unlike other programs that offer a social and religious comment, those behind the Club 700 provide help to those in need, such as feeding hungry Blessing, providing medical assistance to those living in poor communities and giving hope to those who need hope . It's not hateful at all. If you're offended by club 700, I suggest you get to the remote control and turn the channel on your TV. I do the same thing when I find CNN Headline Nevs or for those things that I consider biased or offensive. What I find offensive is the way the ABC family enters a waiver that the views of the club 700 do not reflect the views of the ABC family.
