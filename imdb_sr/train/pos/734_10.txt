This movie is a punk punk rock, from beginning to end. Ramones, the ruling princes of the Punk rock in the late 70's, appear as if they were alone. PJ Soles starring Riff Randle, a rebellious middle school student who lives and breathes rock 'n roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for Ramones, her favorite rock band. She holds the school in her hands, and encourages her colleagues to join her in her celebratory foolishness. She's a tremendous, scary Amazonian woman. And he promises to make a "line" for students. There are even a few students who act as monitors, who report it to their colleagues with dirt. Ms. Togar is particularly determined to capture Rifa, and endangers Riff's anarchist abhorrence. But Riff has smart ways to disparage Togara at every step. The glory of the top performance of Mari Voronov, in her role as Togara director. Mari is a legendary B film actress. And in this film, actress Ms. Togar plays with a mockery. PJ Soles as Riff, turns into electrification. Clint Howard as a dual Eaglebauer, has a lot of fun with his role. Ramones perform many of their hit songs in this movie. And so the viewer sees why Ramones were so influential, in the Pank rock scene of the '70s. Of course, this is a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you're not in Ramones or Punk Rock, this movie is a great explosion (literally) of energy entertainment.
