The recorded presentation of "The Roman Seagull" is the most beautiful and most interesting performance of Coleridge's stunning song. A striking cinema, combined with a collection of two centuries of effort to illustrate an epic song from 1798 by world famous artists, and Michael Redgrave's wonderful storytelling, are very worth the time to look at this excellent visual work. In the era of television, such work as this is an invaluable tool that encourages young students, as well as adults, to explore and learn the value of great poetry. As far as I know, this kind of business is really rare; It's a regret. As a student of world literature and as a former professor and college academic advisor, I feel that "great translations" of great epic poems, such as Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," should be translated. Although not a film critic, but as a passionate reader of classical literature, I am pleased to recommend this fine production without any reservations.
