Very light spoiler This film (although only on TV) is absolutely excellent. I did not really pay attention to differences in appearance or accents, so I can not comment. The acting in this was so good that I had to tweak and say: "Remember, it's just a movie, this really did not happen." As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn, I knew that it was exactly that John and Paul would talk about that they had this meeting. John's comments and burns were right when it comes to his character (especially in the restaurant!), Like his depression while Paul was very light and relaxed. Both actors and an excellent job, and I was thrilled to see this movie. It's a bad experience for any Beatles fans. And get ready for a few surprises!
