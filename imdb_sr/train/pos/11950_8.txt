I went to this film not knowing anything about it, and in the end I really enjoyed it. It lacked authenticity and conviction. Some of the things that the characters said and done were completely bizarre, and many scenarios seemed to be ad-embedded (maybe it's typical of Voody Allen? Excuse my ignorance), but the whole audience. he laughed so much in the theater. He is not even on jokes in the movie per se, but on the film itself. The act reminded me of Seinfeld's acting work, where she tries not to laugh with her jokes - they are running away, but if you do not understand the film too seriously, you can really appreciate the humor of the actors, not the HARAKTERS. If you are looking for a random movie, and you like Voody Allen, I would definitely recommend it!
