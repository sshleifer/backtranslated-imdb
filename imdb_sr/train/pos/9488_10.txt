Extremely memorable, intelligent and uncertain film of one of the true genius of French films, the stunningly capable Henry Verneuil. The action is the exact parallel of the assassination of JFK and takes place in an unnamed, fictitious country. The film, visually and graphically, is sharp. Filmed with precision precision, followed by Henri Volnai, a procurator who takes on himself to uncover a coup. In many ways, this is a very disturbing film, not only for the cold and analytical precision of his commentary on the so-called interior works of the modern state. The atmosphere and characters are absolutely convincing, and Verneuil left nothing fortunate in his tight planning. On the second level, this relatively little known film had just a 15-year head start on Oliver Stone, who was recognized for the film "JFK", an inferior movie in many areas, of which the least credibility was ... It's a masterpiece, any movie theater fan should see it, preferably in the original French version with subs.
