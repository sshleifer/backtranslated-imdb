This may be the only film that is actually approaching filming in essence of the inaccessible world of the American college experience of the late 60's and early 70's. Just go ahead, call another movie that even approaches this movie: "Getting Straight"? "RPM"? These are cartoons. The "Secaucus Seven" return has its moments, but it's a retrospective film about people who are obsessed with self-esteem more than a movie about time and place shown * in * time and place. "Ride, he said" shows ... with subtlety and shade where it needs, and a quick shot in short films where it's the only appropriate way - movement against the movement, the ambiguity of large sports in college (especially when there is war on), sexual revolution period and general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was so. The whole composition deserves praise (as well as the director, of course), but a special praise should be reserved for Bruce Derne, as a basketball coach, and Karen Black, the hero is very unusual ... except that time .. of love interest. Villiam Tepper, as a leader, also appreciates the real applause for perfectly shooting an athlete at that time, as well as for playing the basketball school in the movie (remember Anthony Perkins in Tall Story? Iikes!) All in all, the classic some sort - and the last film currently in grade 6 should write comments ("boring," "refusing" - um, okay, son, please go back to Arnold's films). Why is this film not available from imdb?
