Many movies about the Lair-Than-Air (LTA) aspect of aviation have not been recorded, but this is one of them and it's damn good. Just a fun movie to watch. Most of the film takes place in Fleet Flame Operations at NAS Lakehurst (in the role of NAS Tustina). Vallace Beeri plays the cute, but Munchausen boss Ned Trumpet, an engaging pilot, whose stories are so common that no one believes him. Half the party is near the end of the movie when events begin to prove that most of his unusual stories are truly true. Built during the Second World War, the main plots are rowing around the bachelor, the trumpets that the local widow end up in the end have a father and son relationship with the widow's son, Jess. He said that he would never walk without the crutches by the doctor, the head of the trumpet pulling out some wires, and the naval flyer surgeon helps restore the boy's mutilated leg. Jess continues to join the Navy to become a flight officer, fly to Lakehurst and face a whole new challenge. Very well-made film, though not without cowardly Hollywood dialogue. in addition to technical advisors and Beeri's apparent inability to step in. Otherwise, this film gets good grades for technical accuracy and gives a rare look at the LTA Navy operations. The box office scene, the exchange between trumpet and future love Jess Cathi, is absolute noise.
