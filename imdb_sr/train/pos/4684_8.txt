Petter Mattei "Love in Time of Money" is a visually stunning movie for watching. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait of human relationships. This is a movie that seems to tell us what money, power, and success make people in the different situations we encounter. This is a variation of Arthur Schnitzler's perception of the same theme, the director transmits an action to the present time in New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each is connected in one way or another with another person, but it seems that no one knows the previous contact point. Stylish, the film has a sophisticated luxury look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world in their own habitat. The only thing that gets out of all these souls in the picture are the different stages of loneliness in which everyone lives. The great city is not exactly the best place in which human relationships find sincere fulfillment, as seen in most of the people we meet. The act is good in the direction of Mr. Matteo. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Davson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and other talented actors, revive these characters. We want Mr. Work.
