The title attracted my attention and then I wondered what would appear on the plot, as we saw so many "super-men" of films these years ... and actually, I really liked it because there were many unusual funny scenes that I did not expected. Uma Thurman performed as an average in the role of G-girl. Surprisingly, I was again able to watch her fingers in a wide screen (as at the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson was still well-played by an idiot boy who met with a big woman, I could really get into his situation. If you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely watch G-Girl and average Matt's adventures, especially to cheer up your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
