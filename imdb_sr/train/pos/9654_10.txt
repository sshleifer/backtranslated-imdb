Stephane Rideau was already a star for his tour of "Vild Reeds", and he is one of the greatest French indie stars. In this film, Cedric, a local boy who meets Mathieu (newcomer Jamie Elkaim, in a beautiful, tinted, ethereal performance) plays on the beach. Mathieu has a complex relationship with her sick mother, a demanding aunt and sister (with whom she has a competitive relationship). Soon they will fall in love. The scattered story of a movie - which consists of long flashes, pieces of the present and a move to the future in real time - - It's a little scary. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not signal in what time period we are, and the story is difficult to follow. But endure: The final 45 minutes of the movie are so exciting that you will not be able to turn your eyes off the screen. Altering, breaking and elevating, this film ranks as a "wonderful thing" as a movie that must be seen.
