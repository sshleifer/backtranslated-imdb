This was the second of three films Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and is by far the biggest result, and it is somewhat unusual that two numbers are performed by Harriet Hilliard, and the rest is split and / or shared between directors. As usual, the story does not need to be retained even though it was based on Shore Leave, which also served as the basis for Broadway Music, Hit The Deck. Anyone who really saw Shore Leave in the theater may have been confused at the moment, because the roles of Fred and Ginger were created for the film, but what is important, as always, is music, texts and digging, all of which is beyond the right of the bottle. It's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in 1) to see Astaire playing the piano - he was a great pianist in real life and composed a few songs, one of which I built to the terrible Dovn, had the lyric lyrics of Johnny Mercer and spent several weeks in the tables - and this is the only series where the soldier played, although the former hoofer who logged in the Navy after being rejected by dance partner Ginger before the story starts. He gets a little famous, but an excellent Berlin number, I'd rather lead a band, and a duet on "I Put All My Eggs In One Bunch," but the final number is prophetic - in 1936, we piled in the Hundreds of World War II - Let's we are facing music and dance, one of the most powerful ballads ever performed by the team. So what if Randolph Scott is a little woodless and without water without a horse or six pistols at your fingertips and Harriet Hilliard does not place the screen on fire; We came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is whether they deliver. Answer: In Dots.
