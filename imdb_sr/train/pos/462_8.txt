In the foreground, the "Luigi Defense" is a story of an idiosyncratic chess scientist (Turturro) who turns into a game and, in the background, through flashbacks, his boyfriend's life and the forces created by the man he became. The factor in good and evil in the forms of his love interest (Vatson) and the former "mentor" (Vilson), respectively, and you have a sad drama filled with touching and delicately humorous moments mixed with the rich scenic beauty of the Italian lake Como and the intensity of chess. An excellent movie for those in the period of drama, the author's euphemistic metaphor of chess games for orgasmic enjoyment is an indication of the subtle sense of the film.
