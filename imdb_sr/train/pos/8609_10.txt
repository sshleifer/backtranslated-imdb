I thought this was one of the best movies I've been watching for a long time. It was a great story and she showed that people are so intricate in all possible ways. They recommended it to all my friends !! I always enjoy a good story and this film had one of the best I've seen for a long time. I could see that I have a daughter and do the same things Natalie did to learn more about her life and love. It showed how not only to live with our families; but we also have parts of our lives that we do not share with them - because it may not be in their best interests to know all the details of things that we do not work to which we are so proud. <br /> <br> I'm looking forward to another such film, which will keep me in the eye.
