Judy Davis shows us why she is one of the most respected and favorite actors in Australia - her portrait of a lonely nomad is straightforward. Teenager Claudia Karvan also gives us an insight into what would make her one of the most popular actors this year in the coming years, with future roles in BIG STEEL, HEART, DESTRUCTOR, RISK, and the acknowledged TV series TAJNA Å½IVOT US. (By the way, Karvan, as a child, was a young girl whose toy Panda was stolen in front of a pharmacy in a drama in 1983. COME WITH Tracey Mann.) If this happens on the movie, be careful to see it! Rating: 79/100. Also see: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, VACANT POSSESSION, LANTANA.
