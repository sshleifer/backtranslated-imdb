I just watched the movie two days ago, and I was filled with anticipation, because Paris was my second favorite city in Europe and I spent very romantic 18 months there in the 80s. I was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes, although original and artfully made, did not capture the "light" and the beauty of the city. We did not see any boulevards with trees ... There was too much darkness, not only literally but also figuratively. Some of the complications manipulated the viewer as it seemed, and let him "descend" (the Marais sequence, the hair stylist sequence, to give two examples). Rising, good: The Mime Sequence, the cemetery, Montmartre (though he left too much to the viewer to grasp), the Cowboy Vignette, and Sacre Coeur - seemed a bit and far between, and I would love to see such a wonderful actor as Orlando Bloom in something that would further show his originality.
