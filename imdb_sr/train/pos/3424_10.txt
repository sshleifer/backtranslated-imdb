The information contained in this film is somewhat familiar to many who have recently been paying attention to the news. Valter Reed's scandals show a small part of the fact that we do not do a good job by taking care of our wounded heroes when they return. What this film further shows is the truth common to all wars. The psychological trauma that soldiers suffer during the war and the difficulties they have when returning to civilian life. They do not just change or bargain, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with it because they do not know themselves. Finally, this film shows what the army does to our young men. for women to prepare them for war and policies and practices that must be followed in the process of war that leads to all psychological trauma. We have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion. ; but we have many tens of thousands who will endure a lifelong physical and psychological trauma due to this war. It does not matter to which side you are, you need to know how much the war price is to decide if we should be in that business. This film perfectly shows the costs for men and women.
