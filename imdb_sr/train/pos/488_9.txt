The part of the enjoyment I took from this film came from the fact that I knew nothing more about it than that they played John Turturra and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to watch), it was a period and included chess. Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. I will not, therefore, give much more. It is enough to say that Turturro is magnificent like an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius, and Em is responsible for stepping as a strong woman who attracts him. It's about love and obsession, and not about a respectable social play and after a gradual drawing in the first half hour, it has become quite attractive. And I defy everyone to guess the end.
