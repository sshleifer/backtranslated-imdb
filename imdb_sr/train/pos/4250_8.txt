Todd Rohal is a crazy genius. "Knuckleface Jones", his third and most memorable short film, has an unusual sense of humor and will leave some scratch on his head. What the film says in the heart, and he would almost certainly agree with me about it, is how regular Joe finds confidence to break through life with a little inspiration. Or not. You have to see yourself. A short film occasionally touches the festival circles, so your eyes remain open and catch them if you can - you will be glad you did it. It's hilarious. And check out Todd's other short films that appear here and there from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
