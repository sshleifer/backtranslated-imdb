14 years since this show was made and still the best shov ever made. Writing was first class, and production was unrivaled. This performance would never have been made today, and that is a shame. I hope if you are thinking about finding this show to watch how you do it. AG came out in the year when I left high school at a time when my fav TV show was a file that gives you an idea of ​​why I first entered this show. AG was a far better program with better writing, but only one reason? I know this is not the only program that will only get one season, another example that would come to my mind would be a lone gunman (they turned off the files), he had good writing and was ridiculous, but he got only one season. It does not look good! We also have to remember that this show was somewhere before it was shown as if darkness showed the cool in the dark, so I think this may have allowed the show to go down the hill. Watch this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.
