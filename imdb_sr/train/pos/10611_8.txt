What the other reviewer called the lack of character development, I call down the underestimation. The film did not override the head with exaggerated explanations or unnecessary background. Yes, there were many untold stories about which we only had insight, but that was above all a one-day recording of the event that catalyzed the changes in the life of all the characters. Henry Thomas's performance was a really great study of the power of acting, which focuses on the reaction rather than the action. Good rental.
