The shooting in the heart is wonderful. She brilliantly illustrates the state of Gary Gimore, the condemned murder that sought death. Shot in the heart shows the temptation that Gilmore's family passed through, devastated by hatred. This film is an incredible psychological study and remarkably depresses and raises. 10/10
