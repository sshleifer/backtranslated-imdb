*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Director Richard Shepherd. Well-formulated story and film all together, Brosnan has never been better in the movie role outside his "Bond" films. After 2004 "After sunset" his latest role brings laughter and great time. A professional hit man, to put it this way, Julian Noble, at work in Mexico City, ends with a contrary attitude from himself, high-ranking businessman Danny Wright (Kinnear, perhaps one of his best roles), and on jobs there. Two twins on the screen produce comically filled, funny restlessness and fail to fill the laugh. Davis in one of his best roles from "American Splendor" gives another charming and witty performance. One of the most beautiful and best movies. My final rating is 9/10
