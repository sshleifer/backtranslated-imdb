The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is separated. Things that are only indicated in the novel are shown on the screen for some strange reason. Did they think that the audience would be too stupid to realize that everything was not shown to them properly? In addition, this is very good. All actors do wonderful things by bringing their characters into life. For shallow women there, it's worth watching at least because Tobi Stephens while Gilbert is the sexiest. If I were Helen, I would simply forget that I was still married as soon as I looked at him ... Some kind of spoiler - The end scene is a ridiculous reversal of what happened in the book.
