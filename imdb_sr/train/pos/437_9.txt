The magic April is a tonal song, an impressionistic painting, a masterpiece of conveying a message with several words. It was one of my 10 favorite films since it came out. I am still waiting, though less patient, to make the film appear in DVD format. Apparently, I'm not alone. If Amazon's parent company's ads are accurate, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this acting and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. Actors are spectacular, cinematography and direction are flawless. The film is definitely a guard. Many have already asked. Add our names to the list.
