I've never seen Richard Thomas as a bad guy. I was not sure I would love him this way. And I was not sure he could do it. But that made me stunned. He sent me trembling in his spine and led me to look better at street people. The film is enthusiastic and fast. Bruce Davison is convincing, but anything that can really be a good guy. The real talent is Thomas. The ending was a bit clumsy, but perhaps so real people fought ... If you are a fan of Thomas, you must see it here best that is bad!
