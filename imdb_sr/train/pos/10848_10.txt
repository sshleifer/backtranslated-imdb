... Heads, Hands, and Feet - a band from the past, just like Strange Fruit. Three-way sound there. Those who claimed to dislike this film are either soulless or under 40 years old, and did not have experience with real things. Sad for them. This is a painfully well-seen small picture that is a great way to pass an hour or two, and probably will not fade much in another display. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as a thick drummer (in many ways the most fascinating figure of all), and Bill Nighi - a new name for me - as a neurotic vocal and frontman all turn to super performance, and Juliet Aubrei is a wonderful eyes to go with some sharp acting like Karen, who is trying to hold the band together while spectacularly self-destruct. Sid Barrett / Brian Wilson echoes out loud and clear, Mott the Hoople behind one in their outspoken laugh, and the script is never funny over minutes. Do not compare this with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monti - it's unfair to all of them. The closest comparison is an obligation, and that's not bad. And any movie that can conjure up memories of Blodvin Pig - a band I do not remember I've ever seen, but the name lives - well, it shows that someone from the team knew what it was about. Little pleasure, and thank you for remembering. Oh ... and I have another one - Stiff Little Fingers; a-a-a what about SteelEIE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... Ten Inch NAILS anybody? (You have to watch a movie or have been on the go)
