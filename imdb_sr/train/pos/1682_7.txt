After diving his fingers into the giallo pool with the masterpiece "Strange Vice of Mrs. Vardh" (1971), the director Sergio Martino followed the same year that turned out to be another twisted thriller, "The Scorpio's Case" His previous effort, this one star is the handsome George George Hilton, who will next star in Martin's Satanic / giallo hybrid "All Colors of Darkness." "Scorpion's Tail" is also featured by actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who will continue show dissatisfied couple (to put it mildly!) In Martin's "T Oi is a closed room and I only have the key "(1972). (I just love this title!) I guess Edvige Fenech was busy in the month they shot this! In any case, this movie boasts a stylistic direction that fans of Martin they were expecting, as well as a curtailed plot, some fine-made homicides and a beautiful Atenite snapshot of the site.This story relates to a security investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here looks like a nicer, smarter nurse Farrah Favcett) who gets involved in a series of horrific murders after airplanes an accident and a million-dollar inheritance from a beautiful widow. I really thought I had a picture halfway, but I was wrong. Although the action makes sense in this giallo, I may have to re-watch a movie to fully appreciate all of its subtleties. For me, the most important images were Anita's fight for cats and mice with the killer in the end, especially a tense home burst and a wonderful fight on the roof; A lot of good actions in this movie! Good people on No Shame should thank for another awesome DVD, with nice subtitles and interesting accessories. It turned out to be great clothes, in their constant endeavor to bring back those lost Italian jewels from oblivion.
