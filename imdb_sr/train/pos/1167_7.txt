Alain Delon is visiting a quick, safe vengeance on a relentless criminal family who recruited him as a hit man in the Duccio Tessari thriller Big Guns after accidentally killing his wife and child. Tessari and screenwriters Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore for the "Minute for Prayer, the Other for Dying" and Franco Verucci of "Ring of Death" take this action on a career for the mafia, all the way to the wire. Indeed, "big pistols" are pretty predictable, but still qualify as a solid party with many wild and often sudden killings. Alen Delon of Godson was appropriately laconic while he methodically killed heads of mafia families who refused to retire to enjoy life with their little son and daughter. Richard Conte of "Kuma" plays the Sicilian criminal boss who wants to bury the ax with Delon's character, but the rest of his hardworking associates want the murdered man to be dead. Like most criminalist thrillers of the 1960s and 1970s, "Great Pistols" agree to the film morality that crime does not pay. It is interesting that a person who has nothing to do with the murder of his wife and the hero of a hero survives while the other issues heroes with extreme prejudices. Tessari does not lose even a second in this 90-minute recording. Except for the mother and son who die in an automobile bomb intended for the father, the worst thing that happens is in the back yard to rescue the car, when the associate of the hero is broken into the garbage. Apparently, the "big pistols" are a fairly bloodless excursion, but it has a high number of bodies for the 1973 mafioso melodrama. Only at the last minute our protagonist let his guard and so the fictional morality of the eye eye remains intact. Tessari launches a couple of car robberies and the death of a donut in a train that travels through the tunnel is a bloody train like this violent yarn. Photography and compositions are great.
