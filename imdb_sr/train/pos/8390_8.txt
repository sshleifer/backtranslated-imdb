My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Film and an alternative cinema (a small hall, with uncomfortable seats, the public had to wait until the movies were changed) were perfect. they were really entertaining. The sound was also brilliant (sometimes louder than the dialogue). And I loved the way in which the postwar time was presented. Real party! <br /> <br />
