Wow, it's been years since I last saw this movie. Watching in 2008 is certainly different from watching in 1986. At first I did not think I could get through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so disgusting, arrogant and dishonest that it was hard for me to watch him. He embodied every negative stereotype of Americans. If that is not bad enough, when it turns out that the best American city workers have shown that the picture has only worsened. On the contrary, the Japanese spectrum is represented as emotions, robotic radocholics. The film was not even so funny that I just hung there for the nostalgic value. And I'm glad that I continued to look. Just like Boxing, the judges are under the influence of ending the round. This film ran from three to seven while I was evaluating it for completion. The end was great. You always want a harmonious ending and this is exactly that. It was wonderful that the city had to keep jobs and keep the factory, but what was particularly was a marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was the central film that ended on the high note.
