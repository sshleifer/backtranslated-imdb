Old Jane's story looks very popular these days. I've lost the number of moving versions. Probably the reason is that her "furrows" of our "furrows" even on this late date. This mini-series TV gives it a convenient story for the novel. Stubborn, unyielding Emma is a pretty "modern" girl when you think about it, although the world's atmosphere, Jane Austin, may seem a little wise today. If you do not seem to be EMMA, I will only say that the self-satisfied Emma got the money. It's worth watching to find out how. Acting honor goes to the ladies: Kate, Prunella, Luci and Samantha. They could almost have a psychic relationship with the old Jane!
