First I saw the Ice Age in Subiaco cinemas when it came out, back in the '02. At the time, I was only 13 years old, but then I liked it. He had some kind of heat. We have had it on video for several years and no matter how many times you watch it, it's never boring. This is due to an element that makes it different from all other 3D animations made at the time - the characters do not have a special 'home' that they leave. They are nomads, and it's really refreshing and exciting watching. Also, each individual figure on the surface, it seems to be just facing, but they are in fact all good friends. Also, all the characters have their charms (even the bad guys). Snapper Sid is charming in his boring, superhuman and naive way. Manny is awesome in his depressing, withdrawn character, and so on and so on. Another great thing about the movie is the beauty of animation. All environments and characters were originally formed by clay, giving the film an artistic advantage. Another aspect that contributes to the feeling of a movie is that sex means very little. There are almost no female characters, but you do not really understand that until you look at it several times, and even then, it only affects the way you view the movie. Therefore, there is no mention of a nuclear family that would be truly pathetic in an environment like the Ice Age. All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and the proof is how much effort was placed in 3D animation before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.
