Microphones are classical short Stooge. The guys are incompetent service workers who work on the radio station, and during some horses in the broadcast cabin, Curley's perfect imitation of the Voices of Spring video is misunderstood for the right thing, leading to a radio contract and fun music entertainment. . Especially fun throne performance of the quintet "Lucia de L'Amamore". No doubt, this is an essential view of Stooge fans. Although evidence of Curley's poor health is visible in his face and voice, his performance is amazing, and this is probably the last look on the old Curley. Some fans think that the "Big Bird" is the last big Curley short, but his rough voice and slow motion are too hard to watch.
