Here, on IMDb.com, I read the opinion that Gray Owl is the best character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed. I do not know if he had better or worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this was really remarkable. Another thing - the impressive hand of the director. I give my respect. The peace, beauty and spirit of the wilderness are really exclusively shown, I have never met such proximity in any film before. original books and the atmosphere in it. And a little more. I respect the original Gray Sove.
