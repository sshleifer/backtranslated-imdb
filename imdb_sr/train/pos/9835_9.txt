Just to say that I'm a big fan of zombies, so I do not make claims as above. Second, allow me to say that this is an Italian zombie movie, and Fulci has been directing only 15 minutes before handing it to Mattei, Rats. This is not the Dawn of the Dead. It is said that this is one of the most entertaining zombie movies I've ever seen. The scenario is amazingly terrible. Just check out two scientists trying to find an antidote ("Let's try putting these two molecules together"). Zombies come in all variants. From jading, to mats handling maniacs, to birds! Gore is abundant. The legs are bitten, the hands are amputated, the stomach collapses. The pace is fast, flying from one zombie attack to the next. Then the head is in the fridge. Head in the fridge! One of the biggest moments of horror since Ash got a hand in Evil Dead. You should already know if you are the person who will like this kind of movie. Get some friends and beer, and you will be on a fun night. Have I mentioned the head in the refrigerator?!?!?
