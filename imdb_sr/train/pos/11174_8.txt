Probably the most accurate adaptation of Stephen King. It's not surprising, because the king himself wrote the script. The story follows the Creed family moving to the beautiful house of Maine. One of the other residents is Jud, a nice old man who knows a few things about the area. One is the highway that goes through their yard. The second is the path that leads to the Five Sematars, where children for decades have buried animals killed by motorways. Soon, the cat Ellie Creed, Church, was found dead. Fortunately, this happens while the family, with the exception of Lou (father), is not on Thanksgiving Day. Jud takes Louis to another cemetery, behind the Five Sematars, where the church should be buried. Later, Louis was greeted (not so decent) by the Church. He returned, apparently pulled him out of the bag he was buried in. Maybe he's buried alive. Maybe not. I can not say anything else without ruining the story. Of all the adaptation of the king that I have seen, this would be most scary. The characters are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert works perfectly. Suspensions are maintained quite high throughout the entire film, partly because of the development of the plot. The scene where Gage was killed will always remain in your mind. Then, of course, we have a conclusion. It's easy to determine what will happen, but Lambert pulls some really scary and sometimes disturbing moments. All in all, this is a good movie and a great adaptation. If you like to be scared and do not mind being tempted by some occasionally disturbing images, then "Five Sematars" is exactly what you are looking for. Fans who do not enjoy want to avoid this.
