This is a little puzzle for many artists Linch. They are trying to write this as some kind of meaningless, rude, minor Linch project. Like Linch, he transmits gas between his actual films. Well, it can be a fart, but one of those intriguing farts you've captured and it's embarrassing to admit to enjoying it. What can you do with the aspects of modern life, but you laugh at it. If you took that seriously, he would have gone mad. Crawl into it, feel it, taste it, feel its agony, its unreasonable nonsense, and then express it in any medium you choose. It's called art, and art is not stupid. But it's Dumbland.
