I'm so upset that ABC gives up another show that has the chance to be a real winner. This show is so good, writing and storytelling were a great, real original idea for the show instead of another boring reality. Casting was spectacular! Not only were the characters and actors right, but they are very talented actors. The concept and ideas are really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share this idea of ​​"connection". I really love the characters Steven, Laura, Vhitnei and Damien. But to be honest, no person is connected to this show I did not like, even those that were only for a few episodes (for example, Sheri Appleby). The acting and characters are so light and so talented !! I wish ABC gave this chance more chances, not to stop the show halfway, it was also not advertised enough. Really dishonest !! to all!!. This show has shown a great promise. I will allow ABC for one person to know how I feel and I will continue to send emails to keep this shovel alive. Please, join me, I know we can do it. He worked for Jerica. (By the way, where is episode 13? I want the last show!). Please support this show and send an email to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is worth it !!!
