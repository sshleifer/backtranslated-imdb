This was one of those movies that I would never get off the shelf, but I came to IFC one day and I said - Eric Stolz, Villiam Forsithe ... why not? If I had changed the channel, I would really miss the treasure. The subject is depressed - the young author is paralyzed in climbing in the reconstruction of an accident in the downtown rehabilitation center. It would be so easy and tempting to turn this into a manipulative tear. But this does not happen because he was written by Neal Jimenez, after he himself was accidentally paralyzed. There is no Hollywood happiness here. All patients in the department come from very different backgrounds, but they share a sense of helplessness, be at the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a "lonely wolf" type, forced to have an unpleasant addiction to his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Vesely Snipes is as good as a former female man whose family is falling apart; but Villiam Forsithe takes the cake as a hard man who decided to pay someone to deprive him of his independence. See this movie.
