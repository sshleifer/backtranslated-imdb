There are many police drama that run rounds. I'm not sure why. It's probably related to the old basic theme of good against evil. This film has a documentary style while we follow the tough initiation of Anne, a raw novice, into a police unit stationed in the Baltic area. No attempt was glamorized by the police. They are indeed on earth, casual and rude, unyielding, Anne, on the other hand, has a gentle heart, perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all rules, she sometimes retains the incriminating information found on her tape and other investigations. This is not a pleasant movie. No one to let you go. There are not many feelings of optimism in it. Looks like the police were involved in a lost battle. Tomorrow there will be more shots, more murders, more breakups of families and more agitated children. Let's be realistic. This is the world we live in. As the days go by, Anne becomes more intimate with the police and the families they are exploring. The only real heat in the movie is the one given by Benni, a 12-year-old from a broken family. Anna has her own way to patch things up. He closes his eyes at Benny's theft and tries to help him as much as possible. I was surprised, though she went so far as to stab Beni's father. I wondered if it was a father or her needs. After all, the film clearly shows that it was desperate for a partner and children who loved them. Well thrown, but not my idea of ​​evening entertainment,
