This is a huge (4 hours) remake of the story Rider Haggard, with the usual women and foreign underground, where Russian soldiers sought the "Stone of Power" buried together with the treasure of King Solomon. It is very well recorded, it gives a vivid feeling to the wide open spaces of Africa, and has behaved very well. Patrick Svaize is great Alan Kuatermain, and Allison Doody is as attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Kuatermain to help save her father. Sidede Oniulo as Umbop, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of Russian soldiers (who are not named in the IMDb list) are also remembered. For all of this, Hollywood can not leave a good story alone when it is adapted, this one is well told and, except for too long, I enjoyed it. 6/10.
