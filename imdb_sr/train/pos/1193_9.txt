The memory of "Last Hunt" stuck with me since I saw him in 1956 when I was 13 years old. and the ubiquitous contrast between short-term and long-term effects of greed. Today it is as relevant as it was in 1956, the cinematic discussion was extremely deep and relevant. Above all, the ambience is beautiful, and the cinema is excellent. Remembering this movie will be with me until the end of my day.
