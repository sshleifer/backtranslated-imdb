This film recommended my friend. I've never seen an ad or a trailer, so I did not know that Clunio was in it and did not mind him that his role was so small. I thought that the whole actor was suitable and that the film was pretty pleasant, everything in everything. The original scene, with a small crew of bandits standing on the side of the road, looked like a whip and exhausted, attracted my attention right away. He had a way to tell you, "Do not leave; this will not be boring," and that was not really there. It turned out to be an interesting, easy comedy with enough turns to keep you on the seat until the end, but when the end came, I felt a little cheated ... just a little bit. The events continued to build so you expect to continue building, but at a time that I can not define, it is somehow equalized, making the ending a mild disappointment. I guess I expected a bigger bang of climax, but it turned out to be a low level. If you watch a film with that in mind and you can live without high doses of George Cluniff, this film should be very fun and worth watching. Now I would like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a rare occurrence in the United States.
