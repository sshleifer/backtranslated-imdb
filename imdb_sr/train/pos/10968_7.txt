Grey Gardens was enchanting and crazy and you just could not turn your eyes off. It was so strange, funny, sad and sick, and I can not really describe the words. The Graa Gardens movement is out of bizarre. I learned about this film that was read by the Big Hall of the Reading Room of John, by the Reader's Bathroom Institute, and it was good to pay off to hire and run to the top of the movie viewing order. This film is about the coolest eccentric people that may have ever been shot. You should look at it for their favorite Edie clothes, which I'm sure include curtains. When I grow old, I almost want to be just like the Great Edie, to put my nose on normality and society.
