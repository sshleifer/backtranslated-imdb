I just read the comments of TomReinolds2004 and I feel I have to jump in here. I understand that he does not like the movie, but his reasons are not visible. My feeling about this movie is not to be afraid to travel in the darker ways of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sorrow. Each of these two persons, as shown, has many reasons to be bitter and angry, yet they find gentleness and comfort in each other. Only a great deal of acting could do this without becoming an emotional cabin, sentimental and sulky. I was really interested in these people because of their enormous humanity given to them by such powerful performances. I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her activities in the Vietnamese era, but apart from personal feelings, she is fantastic in this role. Robert De Niro is remarkable as a man whose intelligence and goodness begin to lose him in a world that is indifferent to his abilities. This is the first time that DeNiro uses gentleness, not toughness to sell a character and I really like it. This film was a great surprise when I first looked at it and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.
