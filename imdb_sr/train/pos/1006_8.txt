Classic novel Roberta A. Heinlein, Starship Troopers, has been banned in the 1997 film of Paul Verhoeven in a series of television series, in several games. But none of them, to say so, really did not capture the spirit of his novel. Games are usually unconnected, the TV series was spin off more, and the less talked about Verhoeven's film, the better. Little is known, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation has already been made, the year of Heinlein's death was announced. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, according to plan, the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic. The most obvious plus in this series is the presence of exoskeletons of armored armor, which we have been deprived of in Verhoeven's film. Like a book, the series focuses more on characters and their connections than on action and space travel, although we see a fair amount of each. Although events occur differently than in the book, there is a sense of the book's action. Rico and Carmen have romantic intricacies, but that's just a bit more touching than in a book. While some may believe that dialogue and character interaction are slightly inferior to the book (it gets a little anime treatment, but what did you expect?), But it's far superior to the movie. Heinlein's political views are only removed, unlike the film, where they are reversed. The biggest gain of this series, however, is the clandestine clandestine battle between soldiers and bugs / aliens, which is characterized by action from movable armored suits that we would like to see in the movie version. > <br /> All in all, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to Heinlein. And I think they've gotten along well with this. If you can find this series, take a look at it.
