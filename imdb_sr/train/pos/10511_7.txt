"Emma Voodhouse" Gvineth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duet) has nothing to do with her, but the picture goes with her friends on a chariot up and down, greets people in the city and tries to find everyone she knows. I guess at that time there were no movies, television, and girls had nothing to do but gossip. I wish she had read something more. I like Gwyneth, and I think she is a beautiful young woman. She is talented, and "Emma" has the privilege of hearing Gwinn singing. I can not wait to see "Duete", where she needs to sing. She is brave to speak British English with all those native British, including Emma Thompson's sister, "Miss Bates" Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and Funeral, Lughnasa Dance). "Mrs. Elton" Juliet Stevenson (true, crazy deep) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American film kingdom, and is nothing more than the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsevhere) and Tony Winner Blithe Danner (The Fingerprint Mit). I hope it will be there for a long time. Lucki us! I loved Emma and recommended it. It's one of those old stories that are still true these days. Favorite scenes: Emma sings and plays the piano. I especially like it when I sing a duet. Favorite citations: G. Knightlei ": Emma, ​​you did not ask me to contribute a puzzle." Emma: "Your whole personality is a riddle, Mr. Knightley. I thought you were overly qualified." Miss Bates: "She left us without a word, quite without a word, I tell you, and since then we have not stopped talking about it."
