As if most people had not had a nervous look at dentistry, this little movie would make you paranoid. A successful dental hygienist testifies that his wife is going to a man at the pool (on the anniversary of all days!) And quickly goes through a severe breakdown. After shooting at the head of an assault dog, he went into business and ended his marital attack on patients while he planned to do with his "whore" of the woman. There are a lot of close-ups of mouth-jabbing, tongue-cutting, and the beauty of the queen caressing, as well as the wonderfully disturbed performance of Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which she ties and extinguishes her wife before mercilessly pulling her teeth, it's definitely hard to watch. A dentist is an absolutely wrong person who can go from a deep end and this film definitely explains it in detail. The "dentist" is incredibly fun, fast and funny from time to time. Take a look at!
