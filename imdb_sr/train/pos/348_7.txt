These paintings have passed their sale by date, but this is a good party. Valentine's cards are witty and well-designed. The film has one peach order ... "He is not an Angel ...." when it is IS Angel! Watching Buffy Replay will never be the same! Actors are a squeaky display of young talents, but the story does not give them enough real depth. It seems that Denise Richards on the DVD thought that the girls on the set were well connected and it would have a feeling that you sympathized with their characters. Sorry, but NO! The direction is very good, succeeding to show very few real bloody, and relying on your imagination, it was a threat. Much can be said for a similar way that Miss Richards and Heigel do not take off their clothes ... :-( In essence, the main directorial plus, lies in the "borrowing" of various other Psycho shower scenes is accompanied, along with the "masking" of Halloween. Killing someone who is hiding in a body bag, although it's pretty original, as far as I know !!!> Lighting, not exactly Scary, but a few good moments for jumping. If it was a choice between The Hole and this, choose The Hole. A good slasher, but nothing revolutionary !!!
