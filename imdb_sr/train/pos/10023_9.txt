After looking at some of the films of Villaronge, I had a pretty clear opinion of him - he concentrated too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting the rhythm of the film. For this reason, even though they have good reviews, his films have never attracted the attention of a wide audience. In ARo he follows the same line, but he really improves in the rhythm, especially at the end of the film. Honestly, I slept through the first part, because although the first part gives the necessary information, it's really slow. However, the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the entire film the best film ever made by Villaronge. Recommended.
