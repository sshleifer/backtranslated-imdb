Ah, I loved this movie. I think she had everything. That made me laugh aloud over a dozen times. Yes, I am a girl, so I write this from the girl's perspective. I think it's a shame that he scored only 5.2 in the rating. Too many people vote? It was far beyond other romantic comedies. Just because I do not enjoy the female in all the chick flicks, on the contrary, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they thought. But as I said, this film had everything, almost, in my opinion. Excellent script, good liner, nice acting. Although Eva Longoria Parker's character was very much resembled Gabrielle from Housewives, but what then? It was great. I will save this film for rainy days, the days when I feel low and I need a few laughs.
