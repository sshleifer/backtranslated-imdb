The Lion King series is an easy crown of achievement in Disney animation. The original king of lions is the greatest masterpiece in the whole animation. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is the BEST best sequel for a direct video that Disnei, or any other studio, made for an animated movie. He earned the theater edition. The same can be said for this movie. It has an original composition, Elton John's poems, a hilarious story, an exciting action and touching moments of character. All you expected of this series. Not so much new story, already filled and expanded background about Timon and Pumbai, and their place in this story. What impressed me most was the concern about animation. Until recently, Disney's short films about the quality of animation of their video and television efforts. But here, they seamlessly connect a new animation with the original movie footage. Scenes never seem unreasonable. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing like Timon and Pumba. Matthews Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelli play their roles as Simba, Rafiki and Nala. We even have a returnee visit of Vhoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as hyenas. There are many great laughs in this movie. So, if you love the Lion King, you need this movie. The story is simply not complete without it.
