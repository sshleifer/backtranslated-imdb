IK is a beautifully original romantic comedy that inserts the greatest and most developed scientific minds of the 20th century as Cupid's assistants. Confronting the heart and mind is the central theme of this carefree and thoughtful film. You do not know how to react, because part of the time when you see great scientists make silly things that foster love, but on other occasions you hear them talking about some of the deepest puzzles of space / time of our day. The end result is a fun movie with surprises. Valter Matthau is the perfect Einstein, Meg Rian creates a strange mathematician, and Tim Robbins revives the contradiction of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by the doctrine. All along, they create a farsi way through love and science, mind and heart.
