Slaughter High is about a boy named Marti. He was upset and picked up in high school. A group of children played a few jokes on it, and these jokes are really bad. The last joke was tragic. 5 years later. The gang of children is meeting again for gathering. One of them put him in an old high school. The school is now abandoned, and they have to break through. For some reason, the jonist is still there, but tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer. parties, and watching their old cabinets, and see something from Marti's. One girl complains Marty, but the other is calm. When the murders start, it's great. Every murder is creative and bloody. We see a figure in a crazy mask, catching them one at a time in school. Looks like Marty came back to get revenge. After the first person was killed, they find that they are locked in school. They're starting to look for a way out. Now, there are a few illogical things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has a five-year gathering. Second, after the first child dies, the girl gets blood all over her. They all fled in panic, and still run to the bathroom and find a bath. A friend of mine has just been killed, and she decides to bathe !? More importantly, why is the bathroom bathing in the bathroom. Anyway, when she seems to really not work ... and she dies with terrible death, this is a movie from the '80s. It's a terrible slasher. Who cares if there are some illogical parts. I do not have one for one. This movie has really big deaths. Completion ... there is a craft. I recently saw Haute Tension, I can compare these two. The only way they are similar is that there is a craft that left me disappointed ... SO IMMEDIATELY after the twisting, there comes a big, if not the best killer in the movie. After the last murder, the killer looks into the screen and also does something crazy, and that was the perfect way to end the movie. It makes me "vov ..."
