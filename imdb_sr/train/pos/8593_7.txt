Sentinel has a kind of run of mills and clich√© uncertainty / mystery, but it is erected with some good acting and tense pacing. These stories mostly went through as many permutations as we can handle, so what's left of us is how good acting, how smart and bad guys are, how well the main plot is made, etc. ... so that Sentinel works solid work with regard to its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland maintain good courage and attitude. Eva Longoria (I saw her on the screen for the first time) gives some satisfactory support. The whole story is extremely incredible, but it deserves a weakness. It's worth watching if you like the genre.
