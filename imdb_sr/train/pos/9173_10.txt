I think this is a great version, I came here earlier to help me find which version I should use and I went to Jane Eire 1983 and read the user's comment and then helped me get this version. I do not regret that I chose this version, nor did you. I tried to watch all other versions, and none of it matches that, there's nothing like a book, and TRUST ME if you read the book you want something that will fit with it. When looking for something real and moving after you have read the book, it's difficult because you want something that will fit into it. I would say that God brought me personally to this version. This points to true love for people. I would say that God's love is greater. If there is something better, I would like to see her. but it's not up to now!
