First I recorded this film on VHS than I had to buy it on DVD, it's on my favorite movies of all time. I read the book, but I really think the film is much better. I loved Gvineth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam while Mr. Knightley was an excellent choice. He was brilliant! It's 10/10 movie. <br /> <br />
