I saw this film for the first time on my way from Paris to Nevar in Air France in August 1996. I am a film, I believe, a pretty masterpiece. It's a movie that people need to make. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors. In this French film he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his passion for life until he has crossed over a single Dovn Dovn syndrome living in an institution with other patients with Dovn Syndrome. Actors, including an actor who actually has a new syndrome, create a compelling friendship and relationship between these two incredible men. Daniel's life and our lives are forever changing in a man with Domen's syndrome. Realizes that life is not just a job, not a game, but for life and love, and that's what life should be. The end is a bit stupid, but I think it's one of my favorite movies. It's enough to narrow your eyes.
