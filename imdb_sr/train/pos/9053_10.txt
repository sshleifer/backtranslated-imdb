1.) This movie was incredible! I watched him while I was in the city next to him in which he grew up! I went and saw the buildings in which the story was played. All in all, I loved this film, One of the best Jake Gillenhaal !! Also - my favorite parts were the science fair, and all the time with his father. It looked so sad. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father did not care in one way or another. This line label is true. "Sometimes a dream is enough to brighten the sky." The way this film was shot was flawless, everything was so convincing that it could have been recorded during the 1950s. The dress was right and they had a slang. I definitely recommend this movie!
