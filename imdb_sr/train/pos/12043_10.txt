... On the stage, in TV or in the book, 'Woman in Black' is an extraordinary story about ghosts. Other reviewers have already said almost everything that can be said about this movie, but I thought I would add my late little review. The film that is made for TV is the first, deliberately slow act, starring Arthur while talking about his job as a lawyer in London in the 1920s. I can understand why this would not be attractive to all palates. Still, for me, I love this British storytelling style similar to any of the BBC's "The Story of the Ghosts for Christmas", the adaptation of the great work of M.R. James. In the second act, the story of ghosts begins as Arthur sends the bosses to the provinces to arrange the affairs of the deceased client. The third act mercilessly relates to the conclusion of the pins ... As a Londoner, I saw the show. I own a book, a DVD-R, and I have an unwanted audio book on my iPod. What is safe for me, 'Women in Black' on any medium is a story about ghosts with several equal ones. It's time to have a legitimate 2 DVD issue.
