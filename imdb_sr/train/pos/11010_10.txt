When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and challenged existence and identity, it was expected that many films would be used by him as an inspiration. It did not happen, surprisingly, and it was until 2002 that a film of similar issues appeared. But to say that Cipher is a clone that would be in his discredit. The story is about Morgan Sullivan, who is applying for a job at a high-tech company called Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and to get information about a rival company, whilst under the assumption and false identity. His life in the house is quite normal, but he must lie to his wife about what he is actually doing. However, things begin to deceive even before he realizes what is happening, he begins to wonder who he really is. This does not help an unusual woman who appears ... Turning and turning in every direction keep you absolutely fascinated, and at no time does anything seem to be thoughtful or incredible. It's an enchanting journey through a not-so-distant future, and with good performance all the time will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very recommended.
