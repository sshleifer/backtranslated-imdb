First, I did not know what to expect when I started the video. Always when someone returns the cult type of the film genre and adjusts it to the present, something unexplainedly loses in translation. br /> It's not the case here. This movie starts on the right path. It is part of the famous territory, but it manages to take it at the top. Anyone from the Crockzilla scene? It has to be seen, and just try to hold the right face. This film takes some of the old classic classic movie entertainment films and manages to incorporate it seamlessly into modern production. It is good to see that someone meets the need in this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
