I saw it in Detroit in what had to be its original run. I literally got into the passage in the theater. It was so funny. Since then I have not seen him, but I would love to. Where do you get a copy? Anyone who says anything about being dated or excessive, for my money, is just a bunch of poses. Every sketch is either evil, erotic or perverse funny. Every! There is not a single weak one. For example, the introductory sequence, which parodies 2001, shows gorillas go-go-dancers with hanging chests. Fellini would have recorded that he had a wicked brain ... If you come to this open-minded film and carelessly ridiculous heart, put it right on your best list.
