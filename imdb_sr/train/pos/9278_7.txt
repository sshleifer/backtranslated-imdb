In The Vhite Balloon and Crimson Gold, two other films by Jafar Panahi, which I have seen, the director produces surprising depths in subjects that look a little on the surface. In Offside, Panahi's seriocomic gift to Iranian women who advocate for their rights, I do not think that he is successful. It is not that what he says is not important, of course (and the damage is that Iranians can not see him, like almost every other Panahi film). But after a while, the film feels then, and it feels long, even 90 minutes. I'm not saying I do not like it. The actors are fantastic, and the celebration at the end of the film is contagious. But this is not an important business, in my opinion.
