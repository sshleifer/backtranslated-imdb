In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets the job of a clerk in a gift shop; There, she is dating with associate James Stevart (like Alfred Kralik). The two of them disagree at work because each of them fell in love with an invisible friend. Watching Ernst Lubitsch directs these stars through inevitably predictably satisfying. Even better is an underground plot that includes Frank Morgan's shop owner (like Hugo Matuschek) who doubts his wife has an affair. Employment of a private detective, g. Morgan confirms that his 22-year-old wife has sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan, painfully understanding, "She simply did not want to stare at me," and supporting characters are what this movie is about to hide.
