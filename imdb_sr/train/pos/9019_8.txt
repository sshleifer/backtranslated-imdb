I do not want to add anything here, I'm just saying that a technically excellent, flawlessly acting and exciting little flick will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and half a party: it will entertain, surprise, may occasionally hurt and almost certainly pull to heart from time to time as it approaches inevitable but not obvious, ending without becoming clich√© or foreseeable in any way. Definitely recommended. The previous user's comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for great performances by Branagh and Bonham-Carter - I agree completely ....
