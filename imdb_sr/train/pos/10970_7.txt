A fascinating but disturbing look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (little Edie) aunt and the first cousin of the late Jackuelin Kennedy Onassis. They live in a contaminated rodent, a dismantled villa considered to be hazardous to health. It quickly becomes clear that these two have been well-eccentric. Little Edie seems to be most exciting when she ponderes the 10-year-old thinking, although she's actually 53. The content is generally composed of two things. The first talks were the Little Edie lambastes Big Edie, which took all of their potential jurors and destroyed their ambitious career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions usually become rhetorical, meaningless and often entertaining. The second part consists of long attempts at singing on both sides. Everyone of course thinks their singing is perfect and only the other sounds bad. In an incredible scene, Big Edie physically attacked Little Edie with her stick just to stop her. Very impressive, however, gets the feeling that a serious exploitation is happening here and that the subjects have gone too far to know it. It seems that filmmakers treat it as freaks in a circus, which come every day to film (and laugh) in any bizarre behavior. In the end, this is a sad picture because it shows how the world has simply passed these two. Their hopes and dreams are as collapsed as the villa they live in. For without the other there would be no shelter from loneliness. The most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats are released through the bedroom. Her response to the scent appeal is simply incredible.
