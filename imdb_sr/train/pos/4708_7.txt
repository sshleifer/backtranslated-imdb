Yes, Keaton looks like he really enjoyed shooting this movie. With skipping in his footsteps in his strapped striped suits, he will remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Keaton is a young master who works only to pay her mother a high price of medical bills and send her younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to the law faculty. No one even knows Johnny Kelly that Johnny Dangerousli is until later in the film. Joe Piscopo is Vermin and does not like Johnny (and I do not like Vermin). Marilyn Henner has a nice routine of singing / dancing while Johnny enjoys it. I love the part when they are in a car that is constantly changing! The policeman who calls "all cars" is Skipper from Gilligan's Island! You see this for the gangsters of the 1930s! The gags in this movie are hilarious, but you have to catch them or you'll miss them! Look at the background of each scene.
