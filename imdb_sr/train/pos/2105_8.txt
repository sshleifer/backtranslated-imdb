Set in the World era of depression in Prague, it is a story of an ambitious employee who falls in love with a mysterious woman with whom she exchanged romantic letters, only to discover that a mysterious wife is none other than a shopkeeper from his shop, who is constantly arguing with his colleague. Add some twistiness (the owner is convinced that his favorite worker - Stewart - has an affair with his wife's owner), leaving Stevart briefly 'fired,' along with the recognition that the saleswoman 'loved' Stevart all the time, a happy ending is inevitable. Although VERY with a date (references to poverty and - I have a wife and two children to consider - are overused, with the notion that many small objects of pleasure, like music cigar boxes, are out of reach for enjoying the ordinary people), this film is much more effective (and more credible) than in the 1990s. In re-made by Tom Hanks and Meg Rian, the real chances of the event chain are so incredible that the intelligence of the viewer is grossly offended. "Shop around the corner" is an innocent walk through a series of memories in a less complicated, less demanding and romantic time and place known as the novel Utopia. Lovers of classic romantic comedies will enjoy this picture!
