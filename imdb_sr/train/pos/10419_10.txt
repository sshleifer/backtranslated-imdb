I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza, was the best voice God had to offer, only that he could find the courage to go to Hollywood and go to the opera that he could be American Caruso everyone says he could have been, but in any case he a fantastic introduction to art without any bones about it and if that's the way it will be. see the movie you will see why Lanza still appears in the discussion even in my house. Somebody says Pavarotti is saying MARIO LANZA. As for the movie when it will be on DVD, it has to be returned and VHS is not good enough, but it should also be the only Lanza film that is put on DVD, others are bad and boring.
