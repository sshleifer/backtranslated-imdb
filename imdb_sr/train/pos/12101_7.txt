I remember seeing this film at the West End Theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was a boy. The scene in which Dr. Carmus finds the armor of a gardener and his dead body in the breathing was for me the most horrible part of the film, only enhanced by the darkness of the film. I also wondered about the people who hung from the trees at the end, until I recognized the part of the movie in which it was renamed Blackvoods Blackbound, because of the fact that in family history there was a figure that is known for its numerous hangs from different people. Sir Thomas Blackvood seems to have kicked his blows from dying from his family. I also noticed that Foster enters the cemetery gate for the first time and carefully sees a sharp object on the gate, where he encounters his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror fans.
