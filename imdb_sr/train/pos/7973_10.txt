Maybe I am juice, but this is the sweetest movie ever! The first time I saw him when I was about 4 or 5 years old and shook my eyes. Between that time and now (embarrassment at the age of 15) I've seen it more than 25 times and I cried each one of them. Do not worry, it's tears of happiness! And that's not all! It has a lot of humor and comedy. Usually, talking about all the animals they are talking about can be great resistance, but this is not the case in this movie. My only advice: Even if you love this - You do not see the sequence ... foolishness! I suggest that all checks this ... you will not be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!
