Like many people on this site, I saw this film only once, when it was televised for the first time in 1971. Certain scenes remain in my memory and the general feeling of unrest is how I remember being hit by it. I'd be fascinated to see it again if it was ever available for home video. Possible spoiler: I wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic setting of the plot and characters may have been derived from the 1960s. The British movie, originally called Citi of the Dead, renamed the Horror Hotel for the American edition? There are some similarities with the British film The Vicker Man. One detail stays with me after I looked at the movie. It's a small but significant moment near the beginning of a movie. As far as I remember, a minister and his wife stopped to help some people by the way, around 1870, somewhere in the west. The friendly seemingly Rai Milland presents himself and his (daughter), Ivette Mimieuk, a beautiful young mute woman. While the preacher is helping Rai Milland with the wagon, the sound of the sound passes into the horizon and swings swiftly, without any character except Ivette Mimieuk. It does not look scared at all, but staring at the serpent with a quiet concentration, until it disappears. With this strange little moment, we already realized that there is something very unusual in these seemingly normal people, although the possible danger for the minister and his wife remains uncertain and uncertain for a long time. This one small scene stays with me alive after all these years, along with many others. The film has a terrific quality that does not let it go, and it's not surprising that people keep it alive. Someone should make this available for home video!
