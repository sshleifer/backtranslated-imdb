Even if you're not a fan of Ramones, Rock 'N' Roll High School is still the biggest rock 'n' roll movie ever made. Why? Because, under all awe and respect, it refers to the contempt and disgust of teenagers who often feel (and justified) for the boring, stupid, fascist, adult establishment. This final scene is one of the most famous and most beautiful final scenes of the film I've ever seen. "My eyes have seen glory ..." Rock 'n' roll! <br /> <br />
