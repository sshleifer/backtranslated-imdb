I was just watching this after my mother returned from America for me, was afraid to watch this after all the negative comments here, but I must say that the acting is cheesy, some effects are ridiculous. But you must remember that it was supposed to be 1898 and not 2005, and for such a low budget I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed this version much more than in the Spielberg version I saw last week. I read the book so many times, and I found myself "almost yes, it's in the book" almost all the time, the other version was barely there. So well made for at least an attempt to make the right version.
