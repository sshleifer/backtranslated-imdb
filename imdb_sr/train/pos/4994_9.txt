Man's Castle is a wonderful example of a pre-code movie. Includes realistic events with really editable and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without coins in his pocket. He earns his life by doing strange jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored. One night he meets Trina, the beauty of all standards that are cold and alone. She refused to resort to prostitution, so she did not eat for several days, but the two of them are well-off and form a relationship. His free spirit makes him leave, so life is rocky, but there is a real spark between them, even if they live in a cottage by the river. silver screen. His characters are incredible and relatable. We can see his thoughts on the face, making it easy to identify with him, even if we believe he behaves badly. The young is great in pre-code movies. Her character is very sweet, but far from perfect, which makes her more attractive.
