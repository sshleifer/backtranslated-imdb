Let's go straight to the point: this is a movie I would take with me on a lean island (with a DVD player). That's perfect. If there is a reason to see a movie that you love actors, you like to see them to feel free to enter space and feelings, this movie is for you. Watch the scene when Myrtle (Rovlands) comes to the scene and Maurice (Cassavetes) must improvise because they no longer follow the script. If you are sensitive to camera movements, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves to the stage, a certain stream that gives you the impression of the camera to follow the actors as if it was guided by the theatrical principle of "private space" "... Incredible. And the story is just brilliant a mixture of stories and realistic drama. Kasavets is once again arguing with Hollywood and the politics of the great, but this time he works through Broadway, making one of the most exciting films about the theater. Well, this film is bliss.
