Okay, I admit - I'm stupid and occasionally I love a silly comedy. Although I have seen more films by Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut, than practically anyone on the planet, I still have a soft position for a stupid comedy that does not try to be sophisticated, but it's simply funny. A few such films that immediately come to mind are MONTI PITHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, UHF, MOVE TO A REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, FOLLOW BREVES, and Bill and TED movies. They all lack a snob appeal, but only a zombie or a professional film critic can not love them. While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEI is not as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted movie, it's still fun. Also, unlike the original, it seems to be improving with repeated viewing. I remember I did not like the movie the first time I saw it - probably because the other film set such a high standard for laughter. But every time I see it again, I'm impressed by all the great moments - especially those that include the Grim Reaper. And by the way, this reaper is so different from Bergman's SEVEN SEAL as you can get !! In addition to a lot of laughter, this film also has great music - one of the ways to be better than the first movie. The Hymn Kiss in the end is a great, but also the rest of the hard rock melodies - provided you're not an old killer like De Nomolos. Great looking for children and adults.
