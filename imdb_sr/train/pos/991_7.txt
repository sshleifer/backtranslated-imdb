I'm really shocked to see the number of reviews that this movie lambast. This film was not conceived as a film about "deep thought", and that's what the vast majority of reviewers think it should be. In fact, it seems that IF ANY movie does not produce a change that would alter life, and a deep, distorted, striking story, they would have rated it as 1 or 2. Do not throw the film in the trash because you do not like the Genre, people. This film was an action / comedy movie, and that's all it was supposed to be. And for action / comedy, it was very good. In fact, I was quite surprised that I enjoyed as much as I did because I was never a fan of Jamie Fokk, and I had too used the plot he had. The plot was nothing spectacular, a typical criminal exits the prison, and casts on the conspiracy of bad guys while trying to clear his act (see Blue Streak, Hudson Havk, 48 hours, etc., etc.), but is warmed up with a little technological change. Now "bad guys" are actually "good guys", and REAL "bad guy" is uber-geek. Jamie Fokk actually plays convincingly humorously, while at the same time he is quite intelligent and serious to the protagonist, and he did not try to exaggerate with the humorous side of the film. If you are looking for a deep background like "Matrix" or drama like "Of Mice and Men" then this movie is not for you. But if you enjoy unforgettable action, super fast shooting and occasional shifts in humor, this movie will not disappoint you. I would usually rate him with 8 (at the same level as Die Hard Trilogy), but I gave 10 to try to get the result to what it should be. <br /> <br />
