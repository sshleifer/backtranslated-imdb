This was a great movie that had many under false issues. He dealt with racism and class issues. But she also had a message to know herself and take responsibility for herself. This film was very deep and gave a message that you and only you can control your destiny. It also showed that knowing yourself and being content with what you are the only way you will ever fit into society. What others think about you is not important. I believe this film has been excellent. Actors that I think were able to present each character beautifully. I just thought it was amazing how much this movie really was. When you look only at the view, you will not see how deep the movie is, but if you look further, you will see the meaning of the movie.
