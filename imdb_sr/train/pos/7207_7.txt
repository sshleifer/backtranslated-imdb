I went to Deathtrap expecting a well-orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while this is something like this film; Also, I can not help but think that this is a poor Sleuth. The 1972 classic movie is obviously the inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of complicity, but it certainly is the case with execution. Kasting Michael Caine in the central role only confirms this. The film is based on the play of Ira Levin (previously written by Rosemary's Babi and The Stepford Vives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a drama writer whose best days are behind him. After his last game bomb, Sidney was at a low level; and that did not help when the game was named Deathtrap; written by the amateur who taught, comes to his threshold. Deathtrap is guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins to cast his own plot; which involves calling around an amateur scribe, killing, and then transferring Deathtrap as his own work. Deathtrap falls on one primary element, and these are characters. The movie does not offer a unique character, and it's very difficult to worry about the story when you're not cheering for any player. This does not help acting. Michael Caine makes a good and entertaining performance as you would expect, but no one else is proud of. Christopher Reeve is uncomfortable in his role, while Dian Cannon somehow succeeds in making the only possible characteristic disgusting with a sincerely irritating performance. Happiness is then that the story is good; and it's good enough to save the movie. There are many plants on the plot; some work better than others, but it always has enough to ensure that the movie remains interesting. Director Sydney Lumet also deserves some credit, because the style of the film is another great plus. The central location is interesting by itself, and the cinema fits well into the film. All in all, I must admit I enjoyed this film; but it could have been much, much better.
