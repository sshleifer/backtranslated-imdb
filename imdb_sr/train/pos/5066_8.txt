I know that some people think that the film is boring, but I disagree. It's a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I love the characters in the film and I think leaving Archie's parts of the mystery life captured his humanity. I think that the purpose of good biography should not be a detailed description of one's life, but the complexity and relationships that make them interesting. And what's even more fascinating than someone who is so successfully reinvented? "People get what they dream - you dreamed well." Good job for Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really stands out as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more films.
