I love this movie !!! The purple rain came out of the year in which I was born and it had my heart because I can remember. The prince is so firm in this movie. Last night I went to a special Purple Rain show and it was like a concert that I was glad to see some real fans because this movie is so underrated, that it's really one of the biggest movies of all time. Music is untouchable. The film is about "Kid", played by the prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest actor in the city, and he has his eyes on Apollonia, an ambitious singer. There is no doubt why purple is my favorite color, and I can thank Kid for it. So if you did not see it, then you have to do it as soon as possible. This is a classic - 4ever!
