Any movie in the early days of Orson Wales is a triumph until the Third Man with the Joseph Pact. He is also wonderful in the touch of evil. Please take a look at them all! He has a tendency to become pompous and self-satisfied in films such as F for Fake, a really stupid scattering of the film. Do not waste your time watching it. it's really a nexus. Orson Velles is a film icon and anyone who studies the movie should see everything he's filmed. All his leading ladies are huge, but eventually Velles became a fat drunk, and his character in A Touch of Evil! For some reason Orson Velles had a way with women, I see how he can be considered attractive in his youth, and not as Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cari Grant, John Vaine, I can go on and on, but I withdraw. and because I'm a woman, I see the attraction for him. He (Orson Velles) is one of the last true filmmakers and if you do not consider today's filmmakers: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most filmmakers disagree with filmmakers for the forties! I know that there are many great film makers today, but for such a short time I can not name them all. No attack on one of the greatest filmmakers of this millennium! August 21,2006. Please remind me of some current filmmakers, I do not want to get stuck in the past! Now I love some of the movies, but rarely have them on the list of "100 best". "Hustle and Flov" was great, like "Fargo," and "Oh, brother, where are you" from the line in Sullivan's travel; another fine movie from the forties! Can someone give me the best list for the 90's and until 2006? I would like to know who to watch! Thank you! Also props for this site! Where else can you put a movie or save it! I love ranting and squashing from regular people like me who can say what I want and I promise that I will not spoil any movie for someone who has not seen it yet!
