Lars Von Triers Europa is a very good movie. How to? Von Trier has a very stylized way to tell the story, at least he had with Europe. For me, the whole movie was an experience, even if I saw it on a small television screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this movie is the most complete, REAL and moving part of the movie, and most of the films on the list of the top 250. I also think it may be the most horrible, the most Gothic movie. All right, there are other good ones, but this one is my favorite. The last scene is one of the scariest scenes ever.
