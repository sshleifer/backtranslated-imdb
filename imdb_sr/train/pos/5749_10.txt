I want to warn you that it has a very bitter quality for this comment. Also, this comment will be much more important to you after you look at the movie. Although it's tragic sad to say, this movie has a similarity to my life that is so striking that it's really scary. You will never know how precisely this film describes how people who were in such situations act and react in their later lives. It could not be a fiction; this should have been based on personal experience. My proof of how good a movie was, is that although it was one of the best movies I ever saw, I watched my life shown on a silver screen, it was such a painful experience that never again I will not be able to see him. But I support him from my heart as an opportunity to inspect the soul of another human being to the extent that you have probably never experienced before, or will ever again. I know that because of the fact, because that's my soul to watch.
