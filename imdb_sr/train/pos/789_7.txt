Crush provides a combination of drama, humor, and such irony that I consider the English very well established when it comes to heart issues. Most famous for directing John McKay wrote this wonderful script about thirty forty friends in a small town in England. All three professional women who did not have luck with men formed a ritual female night gathering with the input of gin, fagots and sweets, which included the endless blasting of their date of wrong behavior or the need of their libido. Andie MacDovell once again dropped by the British environment (in which there is even the most exquisite) is absolutely charming as the main mistress of a prestigious school that intertwines with a younger man. Gossiping a small town and disapproving of jealous friends (big supporting actors) are in conflict with her relationship. Developing a series of brutal misfortunes and showing us many difficulties when someone is looking for true happiness. Keep in mind that the main premise of this film is friendship, and the end is exactly what this shows. This is the type of movie that you either love or hate, which is why I believe in many opinions about the mix, and not the greatest success when this film is released. As I'm sure, most of them are just digging up a movie. I enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend those who love movies like Love Actualli and Three Veddings and a funeral. Not to mention the soundtrack is remarkably perfect for recording these key moments.
