This movie is a great fun to watch with a woman or a girl. In the abundance there is laughter and very interesting little nudist stories. Actors are very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty. Life on the beach Maslin is full of diverse nudists and personality types. The landscape of the Australian coast is simply wonderful to see. What a place to visit, at least, one day can become my hideaway. I really enjoy this movie and every time I watch it I enjoy it more. I would like to see more of these characters and I always wonder what is with them. Although the action is somewhat soft, this film is, of course, a great excuse to relax on the couch and enjoy the beautiful and famous beach of Maslin with these wonderful nudists and their personal stories.
