I captured this film accidentally on a cable in the middle of it and I had to rent it to see that it was completely and I'm glad I did. I was instantly attracted to the story and I was worried about the girls. Naive high school students, best friends from childhood, go to high school and are taken away by rogue nicknames Nick who lead them to serious problems. They are used as sacrificial mugs in the circle of heroin trafficking. Caught in custody, girls learn to deal with the prison while trying to find a way out of their troubles. Anything they try to help themselves is missing when the Thai criminal justice system shows deficiencies, and girls end up in a bigger problem and lose the trust of their US lawyer, Iankee Hank. Hank gives up trying to defend them after she feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, the Thai born wife, Hanka, smells rats in this case, and further works on the investigation, revealing that the girls were indeed victims. The end of the movie when Alice made an unselfish action to save Darlene (Beckinsale) was in tears. I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it.
