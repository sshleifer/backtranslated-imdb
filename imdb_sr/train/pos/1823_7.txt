I remember watching this film with my friends when we were 4 years old, but it's strange that I never watched it after that. The other day, I kept the kids and my cousin never saw All Dogs Go to Heaven, so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really liked these movies. So many memories came back watching this film once more and I must admit I even cried a little. I'm 22 years old and ends with me. All dogs go to paradise is one of the most animated animated films and I'm sincerely shocked with this score of 5.8, I thought this film would bring good memories to others. I admit that the animation was a little typical, but the story is so charming and fun. Charlie is a gambling dog killing another gambler, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he returns to Earth with a watch that can not stop typing or is the end of his life. When he and his best friend, Itchi, seek Carface and spy on him, find out how Carface gets all his money, has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who will win. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes false promises to get the money. But he finally finds out that perhaps he should first put Ann-Marie before him when Carface returns to him with vengeance. This is an excellent family movie for watching. Not to mention it's so cute and touching. I know they are funny and some call me crazy, but this movie for me, when I was a kid, made me believe that dogs have souls. How could they not? They're just so kind, and I think I'll cry again. In any case, I would recommend this film to everyone, it's a fun movie to watch. 7/10
