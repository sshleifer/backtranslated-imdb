I saw it at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille just one night after the first public projection in Paris. A very nice movie about three teenagers aged 15 years, all at approximately the same psychological stages. Many scenes allow us to return to our era of adolescence and our first feelings about sexual relationships. it is possible to imagine that the director wants the first strong sensual feeling of girls to be reduced to lesbianism, but even in that case it does not spoil the likelihood of a story. Sometimes the movie is a bit slow, but that's what creates this intimate atmosphere. I finance young talent actors, especially mentioning Florian and Marie, very convincing. There are many smaller details, but this film has made it possible for me to discover what is synchronized swimming: impressive!
