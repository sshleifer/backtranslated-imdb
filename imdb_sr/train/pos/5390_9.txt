Life Begins is a wonderful movie with pre-code that plays some of the best in the era. It is located in the maternity hospital, especially in a room for women who are expected to have problems. She is an elderly woman, a tough unmarried mother (Glenda Farrell), a fragile young woman, an Italian woman, and the main character (Loretta Ioung) who spent 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital of every other sick person to know that everything will be fine. Aline MacMahone plays a sister who is great at her job. This film is very interesting and fun. It is by no means shocking, but it's interesting to see a topic that is ignored on a silver screen. The acting is great everywhere. Loretta Young is beautiful here. Eric Linden is coming from nowhere and is as honest as he can be. His innocence resembles Michael J. Foka. Glenda Farrell is as great as ever, the basic pre-codes and for a good reason.
