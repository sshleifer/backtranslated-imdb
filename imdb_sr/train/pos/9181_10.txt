I had no idea what Jane Eire was before I saw this minisery. I read and watched many classics before, and I believed that most of the classics were boring, exaggerated and overstated stories with moderately interesting complications at best. This miniseries Jane Eire completely changed my conceptions. Zelah Clarke is an incredible actress, and she gives a beautiful portrait of Jane Eire. Her accent is wonderful and her calm, but the firm nature corresponds exactly to the image of a young governess. Timothy Dalton is incredible Rochester. His passion and energy in the film make me believe that he was born to play the wise master Thornfield Hall. I could not sleep all night after I watched this miniseries. The plot is both wandering and inspiring. The characters are masterfully made, and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eira that will ever appear on the movie. I read the book later and I was stunned as far as this minisery was in line with the writing of Charolette Bronte. Jane Eire is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, see the BBC version of Jane Eire in 1983.
