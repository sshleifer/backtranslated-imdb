Spoiler This film talks about such a concept. Villiams will go to any level in order to repeat a football game that drinks his life. Russel plays an ec jock that has reached a peak in high school. Finally, the dogs under the dog get their kick, and Villiams can save the face, instead of being a clown. Great return tragedy. 7/10
