Imagine what school would be like in this world: children are one big gang that has a really good taste in music and unite against bad principals and teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" takes place in this world. It's like Ramones's record is reviving. The characters are all stupid, innocent and charming as Ramones' songs, and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. High school comedies have really changed over the years, if you compare a movie like "American Pie" with a classics from the late '70s, when they do not make uncomfortable sexual jokes at all. As the remake is obviously in work, it is likely that the charm of the original will be lost in the road and will be replaced by vulgar, semi-funny jokes, as Bill Hicks called them. However, the main problem will be that Ramones can not be replaced. They were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even close their place. So, the best thing to do is to leave the source itself, as odd and charming as it is. Gabba-gabba hey!
