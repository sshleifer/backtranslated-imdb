If this movie was shot a few years later, I would give him a lower score. However, for 1909, this was a whip movie and still stands pretty well today. Just do not try to compare this silent movie with a later silence - the industry has changed radically so that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century do not look like movies made in the 1910s or later. This film lasts 11 minutes (on average for most of the films then) and represents a variation of the story of Edgar Allen Poa, TASK AMONTILLADO. Although many are familiar with the story, I will not go into further detail, because I do not want to ruin the film. Just say it is very creepy !!
