I saw this film a few weeks ago, and since then I've been stuck in my head. There are two striking characters in it, unfortunately, the central documentary. In order to get a true story about Beales, I had to go through all the bonus materials and comments on DVD and search the internet. Although Maisles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie) on the claim that this film is an exploiter, it's exploitation in the true sense of the word. Little effort was made to explain Beales or how they got to the state they were in - it seems that Maisles's approach is just inclusion of the camera and waiting for Edith and Edie to say something out of place. The sound, even when releasing the criteria again, is bad and it's hard to track it. Although I appreciate that this film was made somewhat earlier in the history of the documentary, it is ironic to compare it with (!) A far superiorer Gerald Rivera series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at the Villovbrook State School at Staten Island in 1972, four years before Sid Gardens killed. To paraphrase a review in New York, there were many things Edith and Edie needed in their lives, and the documentary was not one of them. As for Edith and Edie, what I was thinking while watching the movie was "where the hell is their family"? They lived in dangerous, unhealthy, uncertain conditions. How come Jackie O, married to one of the richest people on Earth (or the wealthy Bouvier families) can not afford Edith and Edie to become a decent home? Or at least hire a housekeeper or carer to come and keep an eye on both of them? It's a shame and a permanent embarrassment for the entire Bouvier family. Although this review may sound negative, I strongly recommend Grai Gardens to everyone who enjoys documentaries. Perhaps someday somebody will come and do a documentary about this documentary - bringing in a rich story (and storyline) of Beales and the entire subdivision of Hamptons' society in the 1970s.
