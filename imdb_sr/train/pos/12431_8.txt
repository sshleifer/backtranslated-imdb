All right, honestly, I've seen performances for this movie and I thought, what do the producers think? Hutton, Jolie and DUCHOVNI? How could a monotone actor compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But, surprisingly, the two had a kind of chemistry that showed intense care without kissing. Even David's humor corresponded to Jolien's sparks and fire. As for Hutton, he played the psyche very well, contrasting with David's calm delivery of life-threatening situations. All in all, I was very impressed with the writing and development of the character. I gave her 8 stars.
