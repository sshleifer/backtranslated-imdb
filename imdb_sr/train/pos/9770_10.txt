This movie is great and I recommend that you rent it to anyone owned by a local video store. Or, better yet, you can buy it because you have the chance to watch this over and over again. I remember watching this movie as a child and then it was great. But after yesterday's watching, I discovered it was amazing. Good blend of comedy (though not as big as "Mr Magoo" - another of my favorites) and action. This deserves 10/10 and I hope that it will soon make the extension (crossed fingers). If you are doing babysitting or taking care of small children for anything, then I would recommend renting this movie because it will entertain them for hours :).
