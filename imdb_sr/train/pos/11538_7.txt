Felic Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been dismissed from his wife because he is one of the most boring, neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he just can not get him to work, so he goes to his friend's house. Oscar Madison (Valther Matthau) is also recently divorced and lives in the sky. Smoking, gambling, hitting fish, eating and never cleaning is not a paradise. Well, with suicide attempts, Oscar decided to let Felix get in. At first, it is a game made in the sky, Felic cooks and cleanses and helps Oscar to pay for alimentation in time, but soon Oscar will covet for women and Felix (who soon went for women and Felix (which today's world would probably be gay) he is not ready to move on. They invite several British birds and find Felix so gentle that soon they and Felic will cry and talk about his family life, leaving Oscars negative. That's it, he explodes and throws him out, but Felic is not so helpless as he It seems, and it's about to take precedence soon.

Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comic chemistry and appear in the movies Grumpier Old Men and Out to Sea, changing the same roles, but with different names (in order to avoid problems with the author's p By the way, I'm sure). This film is like a strawberry dipped in chocolate. Chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, strawberry is sour, juicy and bright red (unless you get those nasty greenish colors). They are almost polar opposite, but together, contrasts stand out and make a beautiful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http: //blog.mispace.com/locoformovies
