The act in this film was wonderful, but it was mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa. It was a good thing that the writer separated Boesman and Lena from others fleeing from their homes so that we could fully share their victories and defeats; the conflicts they shared while growing together and separated. It's worth seeing when you put the movie in its proper context.
