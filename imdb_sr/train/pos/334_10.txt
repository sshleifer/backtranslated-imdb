It's easy to qualify this movie: "PURE MASTAR". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the work of the actors, it seems that the citizens of that era, 1100 BC. They perfectly personalize the characters. Another reason is that poetry expressed by Homer in his poem is well represented by production. Among other things, the narratives made by the choir give a special atmosphere that makes us a party of artistic transmission. The third reason: the reconstruction of the d√©cor is absolutely perfect, in the Mediterranean regions, where the action of the song took place. And most of all, emotions are in the meeting. I repeat my gratitude: "PURE MASTOR".
