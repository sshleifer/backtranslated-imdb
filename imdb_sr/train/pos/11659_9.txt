This animated feature (co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is certainly one of the strangest objects ever for a film: the creation in the 9th century of a well-known illuminated manuscript, Kells Book. In this fantastic persuasion of this story, a preposterous boy named Brendan, who lives in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a strict abbot who takes care of preparing the defense of the abbey against the attacks feared by the Vikings, must enter the forbidden environment of the forest in order to find the materials that Aidan's main illuminator needs to complete the book. To do this, in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly villa called Aisling. Beautiful and delicate manually (there is some computer animation in several key passages) in a way that looks like medieval and traditional Celtic art, and with very creative use of colors and all kinds of geometric shapes, this film is relentlessly strange, but strangely strange, not from a variety of items than from the opening of the eyes. If someone was engaged in fluttering - above some anachronisms, as an African monk in the 9th century in Ireland? it could be said that the combination of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this film was never really connected. And the comic relief is sometimes too broad. That's why I can not give them the highest rank. But these are minor problems with otherwise beautiful and top-notch imaginative film.
