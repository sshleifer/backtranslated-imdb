The magical journey made by Alecander Cord and Michael Povell. These two British TITAN films mixed some incredible ingredients to make a movie masterpiece! Some of the most beautiful early Technicolor, SUBLIME and glittering musical parties of Miklos Rozse, together with Sabu's youthful prosperity, Conrad Veidt's theatrical and malicious crime and the extraordinary beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess, work perfectly. Miles Malleson, who plays Dupree's father, sultan Basra, also wrote the perfect scenario that is perfectly grandiose. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE! Since publishing the above comments, I got a recently released DVD and I can honestly say that I have never seen a picture until I watch this DVD version - clarity and resolution are so precise and the colors are so vibrant that I am stunned. incredible classic can be viewed again and can never charm and delight the viewer. Again, A MUST SEE!
