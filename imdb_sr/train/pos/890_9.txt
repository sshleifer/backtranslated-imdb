This is one great Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a big part of the Hong Kong action movie. The story is about pedophile drivers in Macau looking for love and mixing with the evil pimp. The performances are great and the characters are all nice and well-defined. The story includes and has enough romance, drama, comedy and uncertainty to keep one looking between the scene of the fight. Sammo Hung proves that he is probably the best choreographer in the fight. The action is simply incredible, especially. the fight in Lau Kar Leung and the final. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are astounding. He has to take care of every action lover.
