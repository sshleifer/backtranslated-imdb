A timeless musical gem, with Gene Kelli in top form, stylish director Vincent Minnelli, and great music numbers. From the beginning to the end is a great party, one of those films that people look at with a smile and say "do not make them like it used to be!" But they never did so. The 25-minute, 25-minute, climate-free music sequence is among the most beautiful in the history of the film. Film magic, clearly derived from the heart and soul of all involved. Must see!
