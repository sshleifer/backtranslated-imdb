Five Deadli Venoms is not bloody and violent like Story Of Ricki or Super Ninjas, but contains some of the best sequences of hand-to-hand combat in the history of Hong Kong. Director Chang Cheh creates what many consider his masterpiece. This film has started the career of five men playing poison. Meng Lo plays another bad ass. He would continue to be in Super Ninja. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Knox, would go to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. Every fan can do it. But I still think it's not as good as Super Ninjas (also Chang Chang). But all is well and this is one of the best.
