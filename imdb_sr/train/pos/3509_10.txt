I've seen this movie for a while and is still at the top of my list of 'favorite movies'. Stunningly composed and what really makes the movie are detailed pieces of coffee (such as Cafe Bustello coffee which is once again used as a cup for washing their grandchildren's hair) that people do not see because you do not understand this movie Unless you are HISPANICI. This is just one of those films that are very culturally specific and specific. Please, do not hit this movie if you do not have prior knowledge of the basis on which it is being built. I fully see what the writer / director was going for, and he hit the target perfectly! This film deserves a better rating.
