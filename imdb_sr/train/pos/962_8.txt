I just finished watching this movie and I have to say that I was so impressed. Actresses, story. A faithful child who has grown into a brave, always ready to help others. His mother must be proud. I could not take my eyes off this film for fear of not missing something. It is a prefect fairy tale / story with moral, sweet and scary spirits and 'monsters', but still a heart-warming people. The child was bullied and bullied at a school that became a hero. Elected to be a rider at a local country festival and a journey to Mount Goblin where Iokai discovers, which are incredible creations to make Brian Froud proud. And evil Kato and his apostate who definitely needed a hug. These evil people capture Iokai and throw them into a red pit together with unwanted objects, such as motorcycles and other mechanical things, and these melt into a terribly violent robotic monster whose only task is to kill. The boy Takashi is the one to become their savior, next to the red man / dragon, the man with the turtle and the princess of the river, and the sweet little creature that, if it was America, could turn into a lovely toy and sell it in all good toy stores . The lines are good, especially do not try this at home children and other jewels that bring a smile to your lips. Give up on belief and watch this with your child or yourself and enjoy! Although I must admit that the place was a little sad. And not necessarily so. Cheers Furdion
