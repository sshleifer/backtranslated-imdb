I'm not a big fan of martial arts movies, but the video store was almost empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Veaphone 4 and I got it for free when other films I rented, either as I rented it. I absolutely liked, my roommate and I (22-year-old biochemistry and accounting students) spent half an hour after the film made strange Kung Fu sounds and threw beermat shuriken to each other. I can not explain it (maybe a little tequila). I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, a skinny guy who hit a big guy, beat him, shot a bigger movie, and so on. Think of Jackie Chan with a little bit of comedy and more action.
