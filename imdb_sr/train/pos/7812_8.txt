A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Bull. He is one of those Negroes who did not survive apartheid, who actually died a long time before his normal time. The old film does not yet show how important Biko was, what he really did present. His life and his learning were reduced to little, at best, to a few witty remarks. The film from 1987, the goal was to transfer South Africa across the edge that would lead to liberation. The film aims to show how South African supporters of apartheid in 1987 are unreasonable. To prove this, the film must look beyond Bick's death, so that his discourse does not focus on Biko, but on the white liberal journalist and his avoidance of absurdity. the system in which he lives. His escape is necessary because of the victimization victim, along with his family, and because he wants to publish the first book about Taurus, after his death, and this can happen only in England. The film shows a way to avoid South Africa, while apartheid still stands and kills. So do not expect this time to be real and true. Can not be. However, the film has grown aghastly because it does not portray South Africa with any historical distances, the very distancing that has taken place under the chairmanship of Nelson Mandela, and this is called forgiveness, provided that those who want to be released speak and speak. The film is strong and emotional, but this historical boundary makes it pretty weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. All panegyric books or movies have this disadvantage: they look at a person you should portray only from one point of view. This explains why the film has grown so old, it seems to come from so long ago, as if nothing had changed. Remake is necessary.
