This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought about the September 11 attacks. This film is expertly compiled and represents this disaster as more than an attack on the American soil. The consequences of this disaster are reflected in many different countries and perspectives. I believe this film should be distributed widely for this point. It also helps the healing process to finally see something other than news about terrorist attacks. And some of the pieces are actually funny, but not offensive. This film is highly recommended to me, and I transmit the same feeling.
