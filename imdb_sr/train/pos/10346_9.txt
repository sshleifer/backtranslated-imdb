What happened around 1939 that helped produce so many great Hollywood films? Well, whatever it is, magic can also be found in this picture of Colombia. It's a long forgotten comedy that Turner Classic Movies began to show. (Maltin's book on the movie does not contain.) In almost every department, Amazing Mr. Villiams is a gem. intended for. While wedding bells are about to ring, he is called to the scene of the murder. The lady in question must learn the hard way not only to enjoy the search for criminals, but also to belong to the police. She laughs a lot in that process. Melvin Douglas once again proved that he had a little colleague in a bright comedy. Joan Blondell was at the height of her career and she was thrilled. Edward Brophie and Donald McBride are hilarious. The film takes too long, but who cares? Terrible comedies are always able to entertain, and this movie belongs right there with the best.
