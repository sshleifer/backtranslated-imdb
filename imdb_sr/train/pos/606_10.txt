I've seen a lot of Saura movies and I've always found the incredible way he records music, dance, drama and big movie in his movies. Iberia shows even better Sauru, which deals with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that has attracted my attention is the fact that in this film, dancers and musicians, dance and music are equally important: the camera shows various aspects of musical interpretation, examining not only technical issues, but also the emotional experience of playing. Saure's interest in the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is another ingredient in turning this film into perhaps more aesthetically exciting among his other works. That's why I strongly recommend it to those who like good cinema, good music, good dance, great art.
