My taking: stupid, but imaginative mess. Keanu Reeves (Da! To Keanu Reeves) and Alek Winter are coming back as two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the adventure comedy BILL AND TED's EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, now a cult classic. In this sequel, Billy and Ted was given more work than time travel. They could travel with Rhea and Pakla! At the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for the Battle of the Bands competition that can make them even more famous. In the meantime, many years in futuristic civilization, the time-wizard of the first film (George Carlin, who can always be watched) leads a university that praises the names of Bill and Ted. There, the evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from RIGHT FOR RED October) seized the two idiotic rock stars for once and for all. So he sends two identical android replicas (in the words of Bill and Ted: Robots) to do a dirty job. Then Bill and Ted perceive death and must find their way through hell, with residents who include the worst memories of the two, and then through the paradise in an attempt to return to the ground to save their girls ... and their shov. In this exhausted journey, they play social games with none other than Death (Villiam Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), which resembles a similar moment in a foreign film from 1957. The seventh seal, help from a few intelligent alien beings and much more. The range of rich effects of the special effects of BOGUS JOURNEI is not up to today's standards, and even some humor and the look and feel for the time are somewhat obsolete (be honest, the film also feels like it was published in the wrong year, even for the 90s). But with a little lack of imagination and a lively twist and performance and directing, BILL AND TEDOVO BOGUS TRAVEL is fun, imaginative, and yes, false. Rate: *** 1/2 of 5.
