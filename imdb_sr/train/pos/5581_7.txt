This photo was banned in American film houses in 1930 due to nudity by Hedi Lamarr (Eva Hermann) who caused all kinds of problems among women in the thirties, but not so much for the male population. This story refers to a young woman named Eva Hermann who marries an elderly man and is carried over the threshold of a wedding night, and her husband never ends up marrying and caring for all kinds of very petty things such as his shoes and killing bugs. Eva leaves the husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot summer day, Eva rides her horse and decides to bathe naked in a lake in the forest. Her horse runs away and she runs behind him and is watched by a young man who finds clothes and returns them to Eve. These two people are very well acquainted and there is a romantic that begins to bloom. There are many more interesting issues that arise when you look at this movie to the very end. Enjoy the Great Classical movie that was Shocker movie 1933. Enjoy.
