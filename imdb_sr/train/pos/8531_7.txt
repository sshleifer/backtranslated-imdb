Although the shop was sometimes a bit scarce, and VERI hurried in the end, as if the director had run out of time and had to hurry and finish the story, everything was pretty good for Made-for-Backvoods Cable TV genre. However, the actress who played bebisiterka, Marianne Klaveno, was very good! I hope to see her more in the movie. The music was also well made, getting all the possible coolness from the music based on the tension on the basis of dah-DUH-dah-DUH. I do not think I would like to see again "While the kids are asleep", but if I did, I would be focusing on the performance of a talented keyboard player.
