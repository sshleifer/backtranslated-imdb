This must be the best adaptation I've seen to be my favorite and I think it remains very close to the book. What really does this need to be seen, although casting two main actors. Beautiful Timothy Dalton is Rochester's Best I've seen the dark and tragic on the screen, while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and tenderness like Jane. The story (as I'm sure most people know) is this, young and simple Jane Eire is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800s who advertises her services as governor in the newspaper. Governor of the Grand Villa Thornfield Hall to the tutor of Adele, the young corridor, the mysterious and respected owner of Mr. Rochester. As the months go on, he falls in love with Jane and he runs several situations in order to try to see if Jane is so madly in love with him as she is with her. and when this effect is devastating. This is a touching and well-acting drama with beautiful locations and beautiful costumes, as I had previously said excellent acting, especially from Zelaya and Timothy.
