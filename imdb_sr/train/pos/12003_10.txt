As converted into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I am trying to absorb as much as I can from my history a new religion. I am invited to attend the presentation of this film with my sons and other young men and women, as well as their families from our department. On a beautiful spring evening, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio, to the historic village in the church. We should have booked in the center of Vistor to look at this film. Since my watching of the film was limited to only a few church documents, I was intrigued. The only "full length" of the church films that I saw were "Legacy" and "We Best Tvo Iears", which, in my opinion, were well written and derived. At the beginning of the Missionary Interpreter carried the tissue claiming that several people were deeply touched by the tears of this film. I thought, "OK ... but it takes a lot to get me to tears." Imagine my surprise when I found myself crying! It is indeed a very moving and inspiring testament to the prophet Josef Smith. Take a look and believe in his powerful message!
