Although I'm not a big musical fan, I loved Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they are just fun. Certainly, they can be a little formulated, but although you know what will happen, they are still very satisfied with watching. However, despite this, I was a little disappointed in this trip. Part of this was because this movie does not have great support as you saw in TOP HAT or we want to have fun. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, there seems to be a little missing film - especially in the "fun" department. The stupid characters of these backing actors gave other charm movies that you just do not get from FOLLOV THE FLEET. In addition, unlike the usual character played by Astaire, this is more a jerk - because his thick head Roger is causing problems again. And, as a result, it is much more difficult to love it or want to see them at the end of the movie. In addition, although Irving Berlin's music, the songs simply do not look as memorable. In fact, none of the songs was so special and I can not think of any of them, even though I just watched the movie. Although this is still a sweet and valuable movie, it just misses the spark and magic of some of their other films. Good, but far from the big one.
