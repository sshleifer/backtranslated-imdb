Oh, sixties. There were interesting movies. I was a film guest at that time. Now I enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home, not going to the theater. I saw this short film "The Legend of a Boy and Eagle". I'm looking for this movie for years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I finally managed to collect more information from your site. Thank you. I'm surprised to learn that this short film was an opening for Disney's picture. I did not even remember Disey's film. I did not even think it was a Disney movie. I honestly want to show it on television. I wonder if Disey has the right to this film? Is it available on DVD? This must be seen for all generations !!!
