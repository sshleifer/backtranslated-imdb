Ettore Scola, one of the most memorable and most respected directors we are world's people, is not yet available on DVD ... (that's summer of 2001 right now ...) Mystery for the observation of the mind. This great classic returned to the theater in my hometown thanks to Sofia Loren - the summer retrospective, and to see her again on the big screen after all these years of watching the video tape ... it's a real gift . To avoid criticism, try to prove something: I took my reluctant younger brother to see this movie. He had never seen a movie before and "he does not like those old Oldies ..." Like all the others in the theater, he was intrigued by this miracle. And during the final titles, the theater remained completely silent. This SPECIAL DAY is really special. A miracle of sophistication. And a big loss if you have not seen it yet ...
