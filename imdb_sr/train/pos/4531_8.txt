This is a tidy movie that shows love through the ages. The film consists of Keaton, who is looking for a mistress in the Stone Age, in ancient Rome and the present (1920s). In all three cases, he is a common sarcastess Buster and he fights against Vallace Beyer for his love. Of the three time periods, I think that I liked the Roman best, although I admit that it may have been the most appreciated. In fact, I liked the scene with the lion, who was obviously a costume guy, and a strange car crash in the snow - but what I enjoyed most was to see all of Keaton's incredible stunts. However, all three time periods were a good old-fashioned party, and the film, although not the best, is still an extraordinary and enjoyable movie. Take a look at!
