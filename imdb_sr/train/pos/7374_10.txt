For his first debut film, this movie has some dazzling and cold moments. In the best mode of horror film, the pit of your belly rises every moment during this movie. The place is great. Manufacturers Blaire Vitch obviously watched this film ending is not the end, but the beginning of the end. A great movie and just a piece of Japanese, as far as the intimidation factor is concerned, it's a perfect result that makes you think and scare yourself.
