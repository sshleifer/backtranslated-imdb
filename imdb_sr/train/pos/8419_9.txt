The last command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg. He presents us to the imperial general, the great prince Sergius the Emperor (Emil Jannings) in his glorious days. He had love for his wife, Natalie Dabrow (Evelyn Brent). Ten years later he applied for a small part of the film about the revolution. His old enemy, Lev Andrew (Villiam Povell), is a director who chooses to engage him as an extra film or not. The last command is a very good silent drama. Emil Jannings has an unforgettable role at the helm. Evelyn Brent is a wonderful actress at the head of a woman. There are many scenes in this film to remember. Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent. And then it ends with Povell and Jannings. This is a film that touches many parts.
