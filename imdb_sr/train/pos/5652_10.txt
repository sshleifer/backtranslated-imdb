I love the series! Many of the stereotypes that show Southerrners as peasants are very obvious, but such people exist too often. The depiction of the southern government is also true, but the sympathetic characters are reminiscent of one of many good things about the south. Some things never change, and we see "good old guys" every day! There is Lucas Buck in every southern city that only has a phone call to get things done, and the book's story of "after" white garbage is too familiar. In addition to supernatural elements, everything else could have been very good in the modern south! Somehow I think Trinity, SC must be in Barnwell County!
