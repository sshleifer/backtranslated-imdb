Watching this movie from start to finish without bursting in laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith, as you need to constantly say to yourself, "it's old", "it's classic", "be kind", not because the movie is so bad , but because at best it is so good. This is one movie. It is also a classic, if one is defective. I am not inclined to laugh at people, in principle, and I become more irritated when others do it. To laugh at Informer in my opinion, it's kind of like I'm giggling with the idiot's savant when he draws his orange juice across the tablecloth. Yes, somebody tells himself, he is an idiot, and yet, when he is at the top of his game, he is also a true scientist. The same is true for The Informer, which is sometimes horrible, yet it can boast great photography, some fine acting, a wonderful result and a good, decent simple story. In the end, what I will not give, politics, religion and psychology gather in the church in such a way that the scene seems to be mirrored and over the top, and yet life is sometimes. Uneducated people of simple faith behave differently from us (probably brilliant) modern people, and the scene is not so amazing (I buy it, but I know it) as embarrassing. However, people behave like that, they say such things. It's not every minute, and maybe it's not even desirable that everyone will be hip. Are people today so much superior to those who were seventy or eighty years old? And in what way? I do not think so. We are just different. Now go watch the movie.
