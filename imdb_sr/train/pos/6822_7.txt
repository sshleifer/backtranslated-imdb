The "Opening Night", issued in 1977, is trying to be an ambitious production. It works only in the truly amazing performance of Gene Rovlands. Her character theater actress Mirtle is not necessarily someone we would like in real life. She is complacent, often disgusting, and makes life mischievous for those around her - in other words, not as some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the verge of collapse - we are not entirely sure whether the demons she fights real or imagined, even though we entered the secret early. Rovlands is apparently well-versed in the love of her talented husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who plays a role in the film. This film is not without disadvantage - it's too long, and the last part of the movie in which Mirtle is going to the stage while a very drunk seems almost cruel. "Improvisation" in some of the dialogues - at least while on the scene - is too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially from Ben Gazarre, playing Mirtle's sleazy producer. The character of Joan Blondell has never been fully developed, and I could never understand why she is in the film, except to calm Myrta. Watch this movie just for Rovlands - it's fascinating - and it's hard to take her eyes off her, although you'll sometimes want to.
