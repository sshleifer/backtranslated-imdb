Together with the South Pacific, boys and puppets are for adults - she's brash, sexy and full of men who are male and female. There is an energy and drive that do it. they stand out from the pack - the strength of the performance of Jean Simmond, and the charm of the young Brand, and already the masterpiece Sinatra add much to the overall impression and appearance of the piece. Boys and dolls win as well as rude what is: MGM musical. It is still good to watch and listen with great melodies and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classic cinema of the 20th century and watch it with pleasure in the years to come. We highly recommend.
