I have always been a fan of David Linch, and with this film, Linch has shown critics that he has talent, style and artistic integrity to make movies out of a surreal aura that he has known in the past decade. As long as the film is a G-rating, it's pure Linch in style, pacing and tone. The film is moving masterly hypnotic and filled with scenes of true emotion and power. Cinema is great, which can be expected from Linch film, and transient assembly sequences take away breath. It is also very refreshing to see a movie where all the characters are friendly, friendly folk, and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled "good" or "evil". Richard Farnsvorth turns into a beautiful performance as well as the rest of the actors, above all Sissi Spacek in his dear performance as his mother, and Harri Dean Stanton in a small but endlessly important role. With this film, David Linch showed critics that he could make a powerful mobile movie clip like he did in the 80s with 'Blue Velvet' and 'Elephant Man'. It seems that critics lost faith in the last decade after producing such surrealistic films as "Twin Peaks: Fire Valk Vith Me" and "Lost Highvai", but with this film he showed that there is a method for FVVM and LH, and looks as if the critics were finally caught up with his recent Mulholland Drive movie, given the high praise he won the Oscars nomination for Linch. ever seen. It is a love story about the family, friendship and kindness of foreigners. I would highly recommend it.
