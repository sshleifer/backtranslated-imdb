I loved this movie. Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreau, although he is practically in all German films. But also because he is not a major actor. The management took over Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to watch Juliet in 2001 and who really carried this film on his shoulders. The family moves from Italy to Germany seeking a "German dream". (this is my own invention and ironic ...) cheap labor in the steel and coal industry. However, in the end they open a restaurant and the journey of the movie to this point is just as poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From that point onwards, the story relates mainly to the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of becoming a film director is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's decision to return to Italy. What follows is great - and completely neutral - a look at what life can be formed through the choices you make. In the end, this film does not say which life (Gigi's or Giancarlo) was more successful or more complete or more interesting. It just gives us a satisfying look at what must be like looking for identity when two countries and mentality are involved. and this view is not driven by bitterness or disdain toward any country, making it so a brilliant film for every country dealing with tensions deriving from immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin moved to Germany from Turkey in the 1970s also gives this film a large measure of credibility and emotional accuracy. Cakes on the cake are fantastic performances of the entire actor, especially Metschurat, and - I really have to emphasize this - the boy who plays young Gigi. The execution of this child would be a difficult thing to be followed by anyone! Great movie, go see him.
