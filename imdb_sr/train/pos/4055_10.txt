This film is incredible and I recommend to both children and adults. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is enchanting; far better than anything the American studies produced at that time. However, there are several warnings to this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the Ghibli back catalog and then cheated on him. My main point is that Disney re-recorded the film, despite the fact that the original English version was very impressive. A new actor with Van Der Beek and destroyed him and took away a lot of characters' attraction, e.g. Pazu and Sheeta moved from teenage adventures to teenagers. Original music is also far better than Disney's remix. The question arises why Disnei made such a change? It seems to me that when Van Der Beek and others are thrown away, Disney can get more money, which is fair enough, but in this process they have been crooked by the movie. It's still a nice movie and I would still recommend it to everyone. My main beef is that Disney destroyed the childhood movie I loved and still love. I'm happy to have original Japanese imports with the original English dub that I will now preserve with my life!
