All in all, I would have to say that I liked the film. Some of the combat scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Ian. One thing that really disturbed me was the fact that they used the Asians to play black. I really think. Talk about bad taste. During the battle scene, you see one of the fighters laughing on the floor. Otherwise, Sammo copies Bruce Lee's fight perfectly. 5 of 10 stars.
