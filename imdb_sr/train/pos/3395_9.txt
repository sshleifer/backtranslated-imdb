This is a great sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women watch the same movie. I talked to many people about the movie and almost every guy loved him and said he was brilliant - while most women think it's just disgusting and stupid! This is the only movie I know has such polarized views based on sex. Perhaps many women have less tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots - but, whatever the cause, I always thought this difference was fascinating. . This has been set in the near future and the head of the large international corporation Soilent has been killed. As the film unfolds, you quickly realize that it's a horrible and highly unjust future American society. The rich live in beautiful apartments with security and all the pleasures that money can buy (including "furniture" - euphemism for paid mistresses that come with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are poor, unemployed and often live in abandoned cars or apartments. Excessive populations and smog have taken a big tribute and the future really looks terrible! Why the rich man has died and a terrible truth with which he can not live, I really should not argue - it could ruin a movie for you. However, the film has an excellent plot and acting, and it's awesome to watch. In addition, Edward G. Robinson is in the final show on the screen as a brave assistant to Heston. Although not for easy depressing or nasty, this is a great sci-fi movie that is allegorical and deep.
