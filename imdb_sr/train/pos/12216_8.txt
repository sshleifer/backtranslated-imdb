The film only went into cinema in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after its official release, and after many illegal DVDs found the way to the public. Obviously the popularity of an illegal DVD led to the release of the movie, while the audience still came to watch it. Sometimes in a humorous way, the story is told about the theater writer who writes a story for his theater, since the regular Kabuki theater performance is something that is bored. In the beginning, the audience might be a bit confused about what story we are following, but when the story unfolds, we see that the love between a man and a female demon leads to a great story for the new theater play Kabuki. The audience stays in the dark if it is a story that should really happen in Japanese traditions and mythology, but it does not matter. The way in which the story is told with love for theater, expression, vivid colors, humor and tragedy make this ride great on a Japanese film, as well as in the theater. Enjoy watching the movie completely, try to see it in the movie instead of on television at home. One critical point: the sound record is sometimes a bit boring. Although the majority of this is great music, the movie has a few moments which I think should have chosen a more dramatic music. But perhaps the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose even for easier moments in music.
