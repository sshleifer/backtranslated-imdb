Resident Evil: Veronica is a great and well made video game, has great graphics, very comfortable controls, great story and fun factor. in the main lab while searching for her brother. The graphics on the vertex are very good, the effects of the fire and the rain are great. Controls are comfortable, but the pattern of the button does not correspond to the Dreamcast control, which makes it difficult to use it. It's even fun to go around some strange disturbing place, shooting a womb from zombies. Code: Veronica also has a little "Romance" between the two main characters. You'll also play as Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1 The sound in this game is better than ever, for example, although I hate a new feature, when giant spiders crawl, they are disturbing the sound of jumping, and the pistols sound much more realistic. story, comfortable controls and real Stic sound makes Resident Evil code: Veronica definitely loved. I give her 10 out of 10.
