this is an honest attempt to make a wonderfully sweet love story. an obvious inspiration for the successful Bevitched TV series, this sweet rom-com is timeless treasure. The comparisons are obvious. Jimmy Stevart plays an unhappy or firm "right". Money plays a sensual blue witch that catches it through a love spell. but when this spell breaks up a stronger witch, she is satisfied with the duties of running her own action and enjoys the fact that her beloved burger (her famous cat) cares for her aunt's aunt. you will recognize aunt of "Murder of Death". this film is funny and touchingly cute, carrying some spectacular wit and a nice feeling. vorth a look.
