The main story is that Aditiia (Kumar) is a spoiled son of millionaires, Ishvar (Bachan) who owns the toy industry, in his Ishwar eyes his son Adithia can not do anything wrong, Adithina's mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar to bring his son in a responsible way before it is too late because Ishvar is a patient with lung cancer and has only 9 months of life when his son escapes and marries the Mithali (Chopra), Ishvar easily forgives Aditi, but when the happy couple Aditia and Mitali returned from the honeymoon, Mitali It's pregnant, and it forces Ishvara to and throw Aditah out of the house to make him more responsible, Aditia does not know that his father suffers from lung cancer, and he also does not know his father threw him out of the bowel to make him more responsible, Ishvar can not be brought to high Aditya to die, with a hungry and pregnant woman. it's a race against time, so Aditia does everything he can to prove to his father, and the peak occurs when Aditia gets a big break in the film industry and his father tells him he will die. This film is absolutely brilliant, this is a breakthrough in Indian cinema that was needed for the Bollywood industry, Shah's directing is almost impeccable, but which film does not have a flaw? The best part if this film is a father is the son of a relationship that is a tearjerker. the song interludes has just been set up at the right time, the scene is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between Bomani Iran and Rajpal Yadav are too long and after a bit boring, but all in all it is a brilliant film, I advise anyone Reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other criticisms. 9/10
