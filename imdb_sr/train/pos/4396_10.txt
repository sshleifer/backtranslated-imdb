I really enjoyed the details that appeared in the script. Jonathan Rhis Miers (wrongly written) and Jevel were outstanding in their support roles. Like Jeffery Vright. Tobi McGuire gave an actor's work as always shown when he had to amputate the hand of his best friend, knowing that he would die without a procedure. Attention to detail, with a good dialect coaching to capture the southern accent is incredibly good. I have strong suspicions. Which makes me more attractive. I gave a dozen copies of a DVD for gifts. Fully foreseen movie. Rent or buy and give him full attention for a few hours, then judge.
