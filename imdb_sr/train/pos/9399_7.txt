This is the film I saw when it first came out, which I've seen several times over the years. It's always nice. One thing is that comedy does not take sides: it alternates between capitalists and capitalists. Only Sid looks out of classical combat, although he is responsible for this. Warning on the spoiler: do not read further if you have not seen the movie This is a fantasy, although presented pretty much. Ask yourself: Can someone support most of their weight in a single fabric chain? He would have cut almost any support. Also, when he is driven into the alley, Sid uses garbage he can cover as a knight shield. Sweet Symbolism. One day I will get this on a DVD.
