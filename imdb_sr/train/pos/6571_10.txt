The first thing I must say is that I own Jake Speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most entertaining films ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Copins) who is trying to find her sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family did not hear anything. Jake Speed ​​(Vaine Cravford) comes in and tells her exactly where her sister is and offers her to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He does not work for money because he just wants to help and has a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes his adventures in novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's funny, it's full of action, it's just great. I suppose it's a cult film with a very small cult. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed ​​and throws out some one-line that you will never forget. Copins and Christopher are also good as girls and assistants. John Hurt, a man with a stomach, exploded in Alien, a devilish, perverted villian that only contributes to the party. In many ways this film is similar to Indian Jones, in a way similar to the James Bond films. It might have been called Indiana Bond, but whatever the title, it's a very nice movie.
