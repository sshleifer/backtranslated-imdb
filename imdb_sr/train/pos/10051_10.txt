Family problems abound in real life and that's what this film is about. Love can keep the members together through temptations and temptations, and that's what this film is about. One man, Dad, has the maturity and courage to support the family in the face of trouble. Children are growing up, one of them is, in a difficult way, to realize that no matter how old or the parent is, the parent still loves his children and are ready to provide them with a cushion when they fall. All actors who show their characters have made outstanding performances. Yes, I shed a tear on the road knowing that I had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent. This true life is one that every young adult and parent can see well, although some will not understand it until they become parents. He has to take care of those who care about their families.
