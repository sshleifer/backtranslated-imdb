When I bought my storytelling tape when it came out on Video after it was released in cinemas, I saw a trailer for what the Toy Story creators said. As soon as I saw that I knew this would be a good feature! I was right! Bug's life as Toi Story is a great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim rhino Beetle, which were spoken by Brad Garrett and Hemlich Caterpillar, by the late Picard Storiman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim Walking Rod (David Hide Pierce) raises Hemlich to try to divert attention from the bird and Hemlich like you, Mr. Early Bird. How about a fine worm with taste on a stick, and Slim like I'm going to break it! I'm going to crack! I just died with laughter in that scene. Since I am a big fan of insects, I think Bug's life is my favorite Picard, although I know that many consider it the worst Picard film ever! I do not know how to hate Picard! I think all good movies! Good job PIKSAR!
