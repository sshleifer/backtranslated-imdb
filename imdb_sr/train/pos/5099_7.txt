The only reason I came across this movie was that it was on DVD LITTLE MISS MARKER and I recommend watching it, although you will not like it as well as a more famous movie. We have Garry Cooper and Carole Lombard as a fraudster and his companion. The film starts rather slowly, but it becomes more dramatic when Coop first plans to use his daughter to make a considerable amount of cash from his son-in-law, but after meeting with a girl and seeing the discipline to be dealt with with his brother-the Laws choose to keep it. However, he has problems staying on a straight and narrow track, so the drama is developing. Cooper and Lombard are good, and Shirley still manages to steal the scene in which he is. has only one song. However, this is fun and worth watching along with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
