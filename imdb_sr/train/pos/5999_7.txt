This is a strange movie for me, because after reviewing a good film by a new filmmaker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), another writer / director, Rian Jafri, called me and asked me to watch and review his CURE movie. I do not usually watch movies this way, but what is it - I like short pants and I can not wait to see others. Interestingly, although it turned out that I like CURE, I was not thrilled with this and let Yafer know. On his merit, he encouraged me to review him anyway - giving him a sincere assessment. The film has a huge style and as far as Jafri's regime is concerned, it is outstanding - especially for such inexperienced film. (this is his first film). The combination of exceptional color, pacing and music that suited the film well created a great atmosphere. You're really drawn into a movie and it's a credit for making a movie. However, what I did not like was something of writing. Although the basic idea was excellent, the end was too easily predictable. I really would like to end up if it came as a surprise or that there was an unexpected turn. However, bearing in mind that this film is from someone who should not be able to make such a professional film in view of his experience, it is good for his future. Good job.
