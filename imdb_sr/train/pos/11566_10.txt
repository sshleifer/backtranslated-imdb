FROLIKA MLADIH Short course. Teenager, confused by the fear of dogs, escapes from home. The abandoned search spaniel helps to change his mind. PARDON MY PUPS is a cozy little movie, with Shirley Temple stealing all of her scenes as a heroic living sister. The opening opening - which deals with bedwetting - is bad taste, but is quickly forgotten. Highlight: climate impacts that look impressive realistically. Frequently overlooked or neglected today, short themes with one and two reels were useful for Studios as an important training for new or growing talents, both in front and behind the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short topic was completely different from the dynamics of a feature film, something similar to writing a short story, not a novel. Economical for production in terms of budget and schedules and capable of displaying a wide range of materials, short objects were the perfect complement to studio films.
