Like the Arabian nights, this movie is played with narrative conventions to make it feel complicated, complicated and even more complicated: it opens with what looks like the framework device of a blind man who tells the story of his life, and then throws it in a flashback that us leads to the presence of a blind man, where we discover that about half of the story is still coming. (It must be acknowledged that the other half does not fulfill the promise of the first one.) Like the Arabian Nights, he tries to incorporate as many Middle Eastern national motives as possible. The liberated spirit, the beautiful princess, the flying carpet, the fantastic mechanical toys, the maritime travels, the crowded market, the evil vizier, the jewels ... I do not know why all this works, but it is. Everything is so wonderful. The sets are beautiful. Jun Duprez is beautiful. Rozs's result is particularly nice. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he succeeds in convincing us that he is Hungarian in the Persian way.
