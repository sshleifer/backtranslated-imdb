"Masks" is a motion picture film that operates on multiple levels. To put it simply, it is a story about a street artist who ties with a small child while trying to transfer his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although, occasionally, the story makes the old man into a job, he is so well-made (colorful, acting, directed, beautiful production values), it is easy to move beyond his situation. And, if you stick with it, the film is ultimately cute and exciting. An honor is everywhere around. This is a wonderful movie for children and adults. The trick is how to make Americans who do not want to watch movies in a foreign language see!
