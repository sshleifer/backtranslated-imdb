To suggest Anton Nevcombe from the massacre Brian Jonestovn can also use some therapy. In Dig! who won the grand jury award at Sundance, we look at him and his group for self-sabotage for seven years, while former friends and contemporaries The Dandi Varhols are raising to comparative size (mobile advertisement, in any case). What rises Dig! above its contemporaries is a huge, almost biblical comic-tragedy that takes place: a depressingly honest debate about art versus trade and compromise. For all of his "look at me, I'm a bloody genius" posturing, Nevcombe has actually discovered that it is unique gift, if immensely upset, the musician - far more talented than his rival, Dandi's Courtnei Tailor who narrates the picture. If it's Nevcombe Dennis Hopper, Tailor's Peter Fonda. Even sadder, Tailor seems to realize this, his tired statement is tired, his voice is uneasy: he knows his band won the battle - but cost? In fact, they sold out, made Indie-Lite plates, held their teeth nice and clean, and probably wiped their hair twice before bedtime - so they won record contracts and a big tour bus. And reject all credibility in this process. Nevcombe, on the other hand, lives in dirt, constantly busted, hits the band members on the stage, hits the hackers in the head - and last sees in Dig! while the police took him away, losing the right to see their child. Two of the best movies about the rock subculture directed by women: Penelope Spheeris is "Western Western civilization" and this one? the current classic at the time it was published.
