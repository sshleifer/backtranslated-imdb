This movie is so cheap, I'm glad! With Vaughn, Major Vaughn provides the most fun film on film history. I have 2 copies of this movie on video ... on one, Ralph Macchio is caught up in the background with Major Vaughn as he speaks to "Hash". It is obvious that they forgot to change this mistake from the film, but it shows how the film is ridiculous, when the actors themselves can not keep their face straight!
