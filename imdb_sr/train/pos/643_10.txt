From my third or fourth viewing some time ago, I was abstaining from La Maman and la Putain while waiting for a DVD. In the meantime, I read the French script as well as Alain Philipp's monograph on Jean Eustache. This ends with frustrating filmography, eleven films, fiction, dock and between, it's impossible to see, or, in the case of Mes petites amoureuses and Le Pere Noel ..., look again. Several questions that have hit me at this time: the Polish Veronica French is quite colloquial (un max d '' un maximum d ''). Still, does it have an accent? I think I can say that it is. What adds color to the absence, especially in one place where the edge of the city is visible? How is this margin different from sleep and travel that separates the worlds of storms and winter stories? Ditto Alphaville. We can imagine the past year since we did it, but does Eustache deliberately describe the mood of the film? Is this an enchanted island? Is Alekandre Fairytale? Alekandre always deals with choreography, taking care of how or where to stand or walk, what to say when, announcing these decisions that need to be taken care of less than what he does. Or is it his way to try to choreograph others by doing this to himself? How different is Vertigo's Scottie? (I say, I mean, very.) What is the difference, and is there, between Eustache's Leaud and Truffaut, and Godard's? How different is the current Leaud? Is it still not working, whatever it is, in recent roles, Irma Vep, Le Pornographe, whatever, approaching age? Once I arrived early for one in a series mostly Antoine Doinel (Leaud's character) Truffaut films. For a long time, every three or five minutes, a man of twenty men would come down in the joke, a tweed coat, Leo's hair, a nose that was looking for direction. I have no idea if it was a conscious or unconscious mimicry. I was such a year, but I have no idea how I personally looked then. At least not a scarf. I have a brother who seems to have learned his Bresson carriage.
