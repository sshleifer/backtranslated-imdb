When I was young, I saw very few films. My parents have rented this in their wisdom. I was very careful about the film, in fact, I was not allowed to watch it. My brother and sister, of course, came and it made me very angry. What have I done? Late at night I destroyed VCR! He dropped the TV screen and called the police and reported the vandals. I was arrested, of course, I could not get my feet off the TV before the police arrived. I only got a strict conversation and sent home. My parents naturally founded me and made me work on debt repayment for TV and VCR. This is tearing me apart, a slave job is really shit, believe me, but I had to do it. Jobs around the house. What happened at the end? We had a large TV screen, a DVD player and a surround system for my work. How did I get the money? I easily recorded my movies and sold them to Disney! Do you remember finding Neno? Well, I wrote that movie and recorded the golden fish in their ponds! Of course, they rewrote the action and did it in the CGI because they could not afford to do it with a real life action like I did! In the end, I never saw the movie The Head who did not die and the rating I gave him is my life rating! It's pretty good!
