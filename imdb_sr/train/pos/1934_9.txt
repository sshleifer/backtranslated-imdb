I saw The Big Bad All at Temecula 2006 film festival, and I was completely caught up in the unpreparedness of being drawn into it. The film focuses on the lives of groups of people who take an adult swimming class for various reasons. The humorous idea itself, the class serves as a catalyst for major changes in the lives of students. What surprised me in the movie was how it really feels. Rarely in ensembles, the characters were treated so well. I enjoyed classroom scenes immensely, and the drama that was going on outside was very fierce. Nothing seemed inappropriate or out of character, and ultimately left a very strong feeling, such as attending a school or a summer camp - where to find fast friends, forming strong relationships and discovering yourself, but you still have to go too early The only complaint I was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which is why you wanted to know something more about her than was eventually discovered. I suppose you disagree with everyone in the class, although ... Besides, the film was very rounded and pretty comfortable. See if you get a chance.
