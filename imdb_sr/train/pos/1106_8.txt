If you are a fan of the great actor's ensemble Altman, as you can see in mainstream movies like M.SH, Nashville, Gosford Park and less watched movies such as A Vedding, then you will no doubt be entertained with HealtH. Focusing on the health convention where two women compete for the president, HealtH contains many of Altman's past 70s, such as Paul Dooley (who helped film the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, while also including the most popular Altman's newcomers such as Lauren Bacall James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many other films from the movie Altman, there are numerous subgroups in this film, but it's not as astounding as movies like Nashville or A Vedding, but it feels more at the center, perhaps like M.SH. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is the apparent satire on the Health movement, filled with superior, unusual, contradictory characters, with guest stars such as Dick Cavett giving curves of comments on the whole thing. The highlight of the entire election process is Altman's characteristic pessimism about politics and public attraction, but what is most appealing in this movie is the pure entertainment that most people make. This would be one of Altman's latest films like this for a while!
