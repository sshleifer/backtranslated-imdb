Kerol, a young girl at the center of the story, was transplanted to a foreign country, Spain, in the midst of civil war conflicts in the late 1930s. For this girl, everything is new, in her alienity. The war and her father are her constant worries, and she must plunge into a provincial culture that has been for years behind what she has in New York. Imanol Uribe is leading this film with numbers. Kerol's family was apparently divided, while Kerol's mother was married to someone who was a left-wing aviation pilot, while the rest of the family's sympathy with Franco and fascists who won the conflict. The story does not add anything to what has already been said, much better, but it's a simple movie to watch. The magnificent landscape of northern Spain is shown. Do not expect much action because most of what's happening is around Carol and a friendly guy. Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranco is Carolina's mother Aurora, the one who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, a teacher who is a friend of Carol. Carmelo Gomez, playing Alfonso, the man whom Aurora left behind when she went to America. This actor, who usually plays leading roles in most Spanish films, has nothing to do, because there is an enigma during the film.
