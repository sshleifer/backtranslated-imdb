Religious intolerance is present everywhere. Australia is not immune to that. Dingo took the baby, and the mother was tried and sent to jail because she "killed" her baby. I do not want to spoil the story for you, but you need to know the basics before you reach your knees in what makes this woman in jail. Buy or rent a movie and discover how deep human hatred towards those who are different continues to advance throughout the world. This is a very moving movie picture with great actors. Both Meril Streep (with her famous Austrian accent) and Sam Neill, whose emphasis on his pronunciation in mother tongue, are remarkable. They are also good with accompanying roles. You will remember this film for many years. Take a look at it!
