Glacier Fok is one of the most incredible and beautifully filmed wildlife films ever recorded. Film makes you carefree for every member of this cuff, from the blind to the strongest - their adventures are sometimes ridiculous and tragic. Place yourself opposite the inhospitable village, the hearts of the audience are warm for family members. Music and verses tell a story that fits the narration of what is happening in the general sense. Man remains one of the greatest predators, but there is no doubt that foxes are able to live, and not only survive through human endeavors.
