With plenty of sunshine, airy light and filtering shadows through windows and rooms, tracking shots moving through crowds with hand-held cameras, quick assembly, and extreme close-ups both here and there, photography is a thing in this interesting, artwork made in the film. The action of this film began as a dawn of the beauty contest. The film begins on a hot Sunday in the local pool, where we meet Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a little show in front of the men looking at the pool, soon deciding to enter France in the beauty contest Miss Europe, which is a lot upset her very jealous, happy fianc√© (really boring guy). The ten competitors who jumped down the runway showed themselves in bathing suits, while the winner was selected as a contestant who received the longest applause (I wondered if girls can not walk slower to extend their time - and so applause - the catvalk ?!). Lulu is soon haunted by a prince and a maharajah, but her hot head does not like the attention paid by other men or her audience, in that case (I suppose he just wants in his house, cooking him. His meals, and stay out of sight, eh ?!). Luiz Bruks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps improve this film, but it's really the way in which she was photographed, who was most interested in me. A bit of noise is the sound of an unusually called sound, which is a little off. The print on this version looked very clear and a lot of fine contrast. Looking at this, I just tried to overcome the problems with sound and I watched the movie visually, and I found the movie as an excellent, worth watching.
