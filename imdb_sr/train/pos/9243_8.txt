Do not listen to numerous and gloomy comments about this movie ... simply put it, as far as ninja movies are concerned, these are my friends as good as they get! Yes, it's stupid, that the acting and script are absolutely cruel, but the rubber - it's so bloody fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Films, the terrible 'acting' (which is in the case of a film about which it is, really among the worst I've ever had the joy of watching!) And funny 'complicates' actually <br /> < It is obvious that the fighting scenes are the main attraction in this, although for the most part I am glad to say that they are very well choreographed, especially the final calculation (during which we testify that the ninji are not supposedly restricted by the normal laws of gravity ... .) Believe me, if you are a fan of Ninja's films and not yet when you saw Sakura Kill rs, then really what is missing in my opinion, one of the real gems within the genre.
