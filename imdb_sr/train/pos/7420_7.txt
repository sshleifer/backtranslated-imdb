Although Chris Kristofferson is good in that role, who would not want to see Elvis Pressley? With drug addiction and falling from top glory he might have frightened Elvis's agent to be different from film, that was a mistake. This would be a perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from excellent, Paul Villiams and Barbra Streisand are doing a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this "period" piece / music. Something of love story, this is more drama about the fall of grace and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedies, the hero's story died. Also, Gary Busei is again perfect in an unprejudiced role.
