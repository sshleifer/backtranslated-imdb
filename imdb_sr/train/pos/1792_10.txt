I was pleased to watch this wonderful movie last night with a wonderful addition of questions and answers with the director after watching. I suppose the first commentator has never lost a parent or someone very close to death. I had a lot of such losses and this film spoke to me. One of the main topics is that we do not deal with issues / problems / stories with our loved ones until it's too late - they are too incompetent or dead before it happens. Talk to your beloved people, listen and record their stories, tell the people you love, solve the differences. I loved the message that there are no mistakes. I love the director's view of the relationship of the two daughters - as one of the six brothers and sisters, it is clear to me that he understood how these relationships are complex. His cinematic history also comes out loud and clear - what a wonderful film! Casting is remarkable - the film is not missed!
