This is a long time (2 hours, 20 minutes), but there was a lot of the famous novel Pearl Buck. In other words, a lot of land to cover. Sometimes it was a soap opera, but it also had some visually dramatic moments, also covered with attack by locusts at the end of the film. That was amazing. Given that the film is about 70 years old, the team of special effects on this film has done a spectacular job. Paul Muni and Luise Rainer have been award-winning actors in their day and do not disappoint themselves here, both give strong performance. The only problem is credibility, because all the Asians play Caucasions, and some of them, like Valter Connolly, simply do not look real. I would like to see this movie again with all Asian actors, not for PC reasons, but simply make the story look and sound more credible.
