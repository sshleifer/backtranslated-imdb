The brutally depressing scenario and some fine low-quality performances of Peter Strauss and Pamela Reid and some good recording locations in Ohio kick off this fine TV film about tough times in rustbelt. As mills are closed and trade union jobs disappear, workers of blue collar threaten everyone: the administration, the owners, their wives and children. Strauss is completely convincing in his role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, beautiful. See if you can identify John Goodman before he gets fat. Heavy Metal Party - Did anyone make a dash? - is, sometimes, intrusively boring, but Frank Stanley's cinema is knocked out, especially the mill scene.
