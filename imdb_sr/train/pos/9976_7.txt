Certainly, it was syrusly, pointless and sometimes rough, but at least the filmmakers did not try. While most television films borders on the edge of the center, this movie has some of the features that give it. Cinema was pretty good for a TV movie, and Viggo Mortensen displays Aragorn's nuances in a movie about a man playing according to his rules. Most flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the mountain lion scene was intense. I was kind of angry about the role of Jason Priestley in the movie as rebellious shock-jock, but again, it's TV MOVIE! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was terrible. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona, at a prominent place in the film.
