If you go to this film expecting something that is not, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. This film contains what Hemingway described as an "iceberg effect". Surfaces of random movie clips are simply hidden on the surface to make a movie. If it were written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast, and if you do not actually try to catch it, judging behind the plot (along with some subtle hinting) can very much go next to you. Definitely a movie that you will have to see twice, to fully understand it. Experimental cinema barely describes this film. Working with cameras and post-production greatly contributes to the overall taste of the film, making it pretty artistic at some points and open to interpretation in others (something that may be desired in American films lately). Although, in some parts, it can become a little rude, creepy and too difficult for an audience, the film never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the film that I would write off as "necessary improvement" is the selection of a soundtrack. No movie is good without a proper soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is pretty convenient, the opening is a bit too long, and other rap songs in the movie could indeed be replaced by something more suitable (heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic) Electronics would make this film a real journey) . Flooding of images and dynamic ... color palette adds another "artistic" aspect, also in combination with events that take place throughout the film, this is not a movie that can miss some part and still understands. However, it also makes it much more desirable to watch, not the one you are going to quickly get bored of. 8.5 / 10
