In 1976, I just moved to Caillon. I was 23 years old and had been married for more than three years and I started out as a lesbian. I saw this film on an old black-and-white TV, with a horrible reception, alone and uninterrupted, in a wake that looked like an echo of the story. I lived in a small house in Tucson Arizona, and it was summer ... like everyone else here, I never forgot the feelings that caused the images of this story, and the rest of the brittle magic, and I kept my hope, I would see him again one day. I'm still going to sign up. I also want someone to make a film about "the other side of Venus". also has some delicacy and persistence ...
