The first two sequences of this film were posed by two conflicts: - thematic - the conflict between Todd's soldiers and his suppressed humanity, and - the physical - conflict between Todd and his bio-engineering replacement. Both sequences are pretty cautious in different ways. The scenario of people is moving a little bit by solving the first of these arches halfway through the film, which means that the other half is little more than a direct action. Still, praise the creators to create a genre action piece with a heart, and even a little soul, especially Kurt Russell, who very little transfers. It's not a great movie, but worth watching.
