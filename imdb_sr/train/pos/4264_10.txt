I accidentally saw this movie two times or more and I found it well made! The second world war has just ended and the so-called "cold war" has begun. This film could therefore be defined as one of the best "propaganda" patriotic films that prepare Americans and, secondly, people from the still-formed "block of Western NATO" countries to face the next threat. The film celebrates the power of the United States through centuries, while projecting further to the current current war, which has just ended. A nice and fun way to describe the discovery of the American continent by Columbus and the pretty "episodes" of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from a drunk local Indian. He must see it (at least once, because of curiosity of propaganda mode over time)! :)
