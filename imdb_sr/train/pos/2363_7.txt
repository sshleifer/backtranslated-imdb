This adaptation of the short story of MR James 'The View from the Hill' was first shown on British television in 2005, in a little-viewed digital BBC channel 4. I saw it recur on BBC 4, and decided to give it a go , recalling BBC's successful adaptations of the 1970s other stories of MR James, including "Breathe and I'll come to you" and "Signalman". Although not in the same class as this masterpiece, 'The view from the hill' is still a pleasant and sometimes uncertain drama. The historian is coming to a small village village to inspect the collection of the recently deceased collector of ancient artifacts. While in the village, he sees an abyss that is in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does it have to do with the old binoculars and the terrible legend of the ominously called Gallovs Hill? And what does a sane farmer and his servant know about the situation? Although it was not terrible in any way, I enjoyed this small production, and that the duration of time for more than 40 minutes could become a really big adaptation. As it is, everything seems a bit hurry and a little more exposure to mood adjustment would be welcome. I give him 7 out of 10.
