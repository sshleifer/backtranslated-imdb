I would not go so far as not to recommend this film, since the only problems with him are due to the excessive exposure to the actions used in the film - things that are common to any film that has ever been made. That does not mean that it's bad, just not something I would go far away. It's a little saccharin, so I can say that in most cases anyone looking for something with a little more wit can disappoint obviously with a movie for kids like this. However, it all comes out of the window when this squirrel (she in all trailers) comes on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems obvious that the decision-makers had the wisdom to say to these guys, "Hey, can you hold a little squirrel?" every time it gets unbearably bored. It does not save the movie, but you can leave it to say "at least there was one aspect in which I could not stop laughing." And of course, visually it will not disappoint, but it's almost with given Picard flicks. Of all their stuff, I would put this on the bottom ... but that's not bad in itself.
