The version I've seen about this movie is renting a Blockbuster with a similar title, but the cursing in it. This film was as funny as hell. It was to the bone. If you've ever spent time in Hollywood or in the area around him, you'll understand humor. If that's not the case, you might not get it at all. The story of two people in business is struggling to do this until they finally reach the turning point, it's a rare gem. It says it's a drama, but it's a drama as much as Deer Hunter is a comedy. Loren Dean is wonderful, as always, as an auxiliary actor. Jamie Kennedy managed to maintain his well. His performance is particularly impressive during the scenes of the poodles. The only fault was Carmen Electra, but we can not have everything.
