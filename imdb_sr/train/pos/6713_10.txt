I liked this TV show because it was a matter that a girl who on her sixteenth birthday finds out that she is a witch and that she lives with her aunts in the house and they are both witches. Well, it took her a few weeks of getting used to it. When she first used her power, it was so funny because she turned her enemy into the pineapple. She had to return the time and repeat the day. This series is really cool and it's a typical teenage series, but it was wearing thin when she moved out of her home and into a flat with college friends from college, and then it got bored and stopped watching. and the other was really upset. I loved Valery and I hated Sabrine's enemy Libby, she was ugly.
