After reading the reviews for this film, I began to understand with great doubt in my mind that it would be good. However, this is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. Most of the reviews I read said that complicated complications made it difficult to track. And while some parts leave you confused, the end ends so many loose ends that you feel like kicking because you've missed so much. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch," in the sense that it's not so funny (actually it's pretty dark), and it's much more intelligent, in the way you see parts of the scenes from different perspectives (and, one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in the elevator and fights with himself. The way it's similar to the movies I just mentioned is that it's full of unforgettable characters, especially Statham, who gives a fantastic performance as a leader, and Rai Liotta, who plays most of the film at Speedos, still gives great performance. If you have time, and after that you have time to think about the movie, and even to look at it again, you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are exposed through the film. I think it's fantastic, and that Gui Ritchie is the director at the top of his game.
