When a plague occurs in Nev Orleans, Richard Vidmark rescues the "Panic in the streets," one of the lesser-known films of the great Elijah Kazan. Kazan keeps pace hot, and has many marvelous touches - the scene between Vidmar and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and scene at the police station, show family life and work life and relationships of average citizens, which is in sharp contrast to lives and the relationships of those low life, portrayed by the threatening Jack Palance, his weak ones, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting pictures - Palance has several scenes with actors who seem to get up to their knees in height. The act is magical and dialogue sharp if the story is not entirely in the direction and the performances. There are several controversial aspects that the observer will easily notice. On the side, it's worth a look. Kazan was a master director.
