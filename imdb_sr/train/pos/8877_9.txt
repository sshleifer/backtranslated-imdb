This story was probably one of the most powerful I've ever made. John Singleton certainly went over and later when he composed this educational masterpiece. The great performances of the entire actor, but Epps and Rapaport have turned into the best and most persuasive career of any young star. to extremes. In the sense that, although they are problems that many student dormitories are confronted with, they are not presented as large or open, as this film would be believed to be believed. In some cases, it almost seemed absurd to think that something like this might actually happen. However, in addition to the fact that it was a bit more dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, incapable of talking, just think. One of the things from this image that I will remember forever is a quote from the character of Lavrence Fishburne, "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you can not see your power." Great, just brilliant.
