Tiempo de Valientes is a very fun action comedy. After a great movie called El fondo del mar and the spectacular TV Los simuladores, Damian Szifron made another great work. .Diego Peretti and Luis Lukue are two great actors here, they have excellent performance. The movie is very fun and fun and has great moments. time. And I must congratulate Szifron on all the talent he has. Rating: 9
