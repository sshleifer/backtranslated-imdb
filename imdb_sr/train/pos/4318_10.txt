One measure for the size of the film is, 'if it came to the so-called. now, will you sit and watch again? My answer to the Grand Canion is a powerful "yes", as it would for almost every movie I've ever seen. There are so many powerful moments, so intelligent and moving story, so incredible performances. It perfectly captures confusion and violence that were so widespread in the early nineties. But it also dramatically confirms the ability of individuals to love, think and care. In an easy way, the film was his time. It partially shows society as a balloon that will burst. Since the country was in recession, and so deprived of leadership, that's right at the time. But the film is timeless. I think it would be possible to sincerely confront any film that has ever been made, and this is the most viewed film of all time.
