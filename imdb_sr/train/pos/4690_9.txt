Twenty-five years ago, I showed this film in some classes for children in Entomology and I can still remember the excitement of children; they were fascinated! It's not just about the termites that they built and live in "Castle of Clay", but also about other animals using the mounds. There is a fantastic scene in which the cobra fights with the lizard to track, while the mongoose colony looks. It is not only good for the class of entomology, but also for teaching about ecology, because there is a lot about the interactions between termitas and other organisms and the entire ecology of all organisms that live in and around the mounds. I'd like it to be available on DVD, so I can watch it again and show it to others.
