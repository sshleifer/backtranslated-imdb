More than a "child" film, "Holes" sees that past incidents still affect us today, whether we know about them or not. When teenager Stanley Ielnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to jail, where he is forced to dig all day, he reveals several things about the camp and his personal relationship with him. Through flashbacks, we learn that a lot of things are closer than we realized (you'll better understand when you look at the movie). LeBoeuf works quite well, like other band members: Sigournei Veaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. Very interesting movie.
