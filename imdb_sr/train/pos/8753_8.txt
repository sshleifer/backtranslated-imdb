I saw this movie in the theater and was completely impressed. Then again, it was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not a foolish, arrogant, Hollywood bitch today. After all, this film really made me one of the raw, more realistic, wonderful films of friendship. How far would you really go for your best friend? In the end, I was moved to tears, and I still tear it up when I look at it now (I own it). I remember as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and cried to her how much I loved her. This is a great movie to watch with your best girlfriend. However, be ready for an almost certain conversation, after which it turns to you and asks if you would do something similar for her.
