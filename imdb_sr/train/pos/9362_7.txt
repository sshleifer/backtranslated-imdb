Greetings from the darkness. How rare for a movie to examine the lost soul of men in pain. Adam Sandler plays Charlie, a man who lost his family in the tragedy of September 11, and has since lost his career, his reason to live and undoubtedly, his common sense. Don Cheadle plays as Sandler's former roommate at a dental school that seems to have a perfect life (which Sandler apparently had before September 11). Of course, the parallels in the lives of these men are obvious, but it's actually refreshing to see the human feelings that appear in the film ... differently from the sense of lust and revenge. Watching how they actually help one another just because they are there, it's painful and honest. Writer / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger", and Sandler's accountant in this movie) really brings a different look and feel to the movie. Some of the scenes do not work as well as others, but are generally well written and well-directed. Sandler and Cheadle are great. Sandler's character is reminiscent of his fine performance in "Punch Love Drama", but here he brings much more depth. Cheadle is always good and nice to express the burden that carries ... just watching him do the puzzle. The support work is excellent for Jada Pinkett Smith (like Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in an unusually attractive role), Donald Sutherland as an irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Clayne as Sandler's cousins. how the tragic events of that day influenced one man so deeply that he was basically destroyed. In addition to an interesting story and some great NIC images, you must love any movie featuring vocals by Chrissy Hinde, Bruce Springsteen, and Roger Daltrei ... as well as Eddie Vedder representing Daltrei. Not a precise movie, but a quality movie with an unusual story.
