This was a great movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. There was so much to connect with so many beautiful pictures, and so much compassion in what was not said. I was thoroughly entertained, and I had the feeling of joyful excitement, just as I am when I finish most stories about Tom Robbins. Now I did not read this Robin's book, so now I do not know how it was, but I can not imagine that this movie could have been a very bad interpretation. The film has left much to define yourself, which is the best part of any novel by Tom Robbins, dreaming of details. To all of you who said that this was the worst movie ever, I'm sorry for the little that's left of the dim light in your hearts. Far from the worst, this film was magnificent. Living an asshole crane.
