Four fur coats and three sexy girls go to a remote forest area to search for a bear. The diverse group opposes the crazy veteran of Vietnam Jesse (an effective creepy representation of Alberto Mejie Baron), which is not surprising that he does not accept kindness towards foreigners entering his field. The director / co-writer Pedro Galindo III connects the story of the story at a constant pace, creates a large amount of tension that causes nervousness, and delivers a fair amount of graphic images with brutal kill pieces (nasty throat and hand released with shotgun rate as definitive horrible spraying). Capable actors give solid performances, with particularly praise of the valuable work of Pedro Fernandez as a beautiful, human Nachoa, Edith Gonzalez as Alejandre feels, Charlie Valentine as kind Charlie, and Tono Mauri as an enemy jerk Mauricia. Better yet, the delicious blonde Marisol Santacruz and the lovely brunette Adriano Vega supply delicious sweets of the eye wearing scarce bathing suits. The creative, agile cinema Antonia de Ande, a beautiful breath-taking landscape, a tremendous, trembling, sharp result of Pedro Plascencia, well-developed characters, and a pleasant time of 76 minutes further improves the overall sound quality of this bang horror / action hybrid winner.
