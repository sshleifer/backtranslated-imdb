This movie I liked, sweet and fun. I found this movie as a good family movie. The most dreary part of this film was when he mentioned Nev Iork Iankees. You must be in Red Sok Nation to understand that NI Iankees is a dirty word. We are sorry to say this to the fans of Iankee. I recommend this picture for the whole family. the moment in the movie, with love and what I do, but the film is compensating for all those moments. The film show shows the moments that the Red Sok Nation (in Fenway Park) felt that the 86 years of the Sok were always screwed at the end of the season and that Sokka's love and love with other people go hand in hand.
