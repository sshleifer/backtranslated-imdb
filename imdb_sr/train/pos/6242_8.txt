I agree with the previous commentary in naming the contents of the film "Everyday Madness", but I would like to emphasize: "Dog Dais" is about how women are treated in a (male) society. The episodes we see here show some variations in the daily discrimination of women, mostly categorized by age groups. There is an elderly man who looks like his new partner looks and behaves the way his late wife had, treating him as a doll that will act "worthy of wearing" a former dress. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship he is almost a slave and he (a violent) master. Furthermore, we find a slightly younger man who does not communicate with his / her friend / wife, and instead of being really jealous of her jobs, he even makes friends with his competitors. A young adult man clearly explains to his friend - a girl who is really worried by being nice enough for him - that jewelry must be on his side and follow his narrow rules of behavior. Finally, in the late fifties, a man who calculated his advantage gives a freelance stopper a woman to an angry client who - by being guilty of scratching his car - a natural brawl. In order to complete these examples, we find a friend of a man in a "master-slave" -kupi - after collectively abusing her - threatened and humiliated the former "in her name", because she will get rid of her partner and take herself as her new "master." In all this, the inhabitants of the recently built settlement in which the action takes place lies under the burning sun - absolutely immobile (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic presentation of archaic structures that still dominate relationships between women and men, but what I saw convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. It is probably a useful tool in teaching even less sensitive observers what goes wrong - due to good visualization.
