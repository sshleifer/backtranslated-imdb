I really did not expect this film, which left me pleasantly surprised. Sometimes the story is a bit strange, but generally I think it has acceptable credibility. The action scenes are pretty nice, and the accompanying music is used to challenge the patriotic feelings of common American films. This may not be the best movie ever, but this is unusual for Sweden and I hope to see more similar in the future.
