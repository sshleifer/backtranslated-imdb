This is, undoubtedly, the most unpleasant film I've ever seen. The first part of the film, though odd, has a light and fun quality. The journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and highlighting the beauty of the Appalachia Hill. But this is a false belief. The apparent social problems (inbreeding) and deformity of the inhabitants of the village are only the first disturbing aspect of the film. I can still hear Bobbie as a pain in pain, and I shiver from that thought. Levis' leg stuck me. However, while the film as a whole was very disturbing and disturbing, he posed some interesting questions. When is this moral, or the right to life of another individual? What does morality tell us to do, or not, in some cases? Is dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever conclusion you can extract from the film, it is in itself a achievement (in spite of certain aspects that were terribly real and creepy).
