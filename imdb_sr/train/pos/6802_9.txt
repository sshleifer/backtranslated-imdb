You better look at this episode from the beginning, because if you start to look at it later, you will be confused about what happens to Clark's life. However, it is a craft; Clark is stuck in an alternative reality. Lana is dedicated to him. Lek lost most of his legs and was in a wheelchair due to an accident on the bridge when he turned to miss Clark in the pilot's series. Marta is married to Lionel. The only constant is his worst friend, Chloe, who still believes in him. And, oh, that's not super power. He is in a mental institution because he is put into the world of imagination in which he has the power, and is ridiculed because he believes in it. Apart from Chloe, there is one mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black man who in an alternative reality is a resident of the institution, who believes he is from Mars. Clark has to stay faithful all he believes is a real reality, not that his brain is washed out by the psychiatrist of the institution, which is in fact the fourth rebel of the Phantom Zone. In addition, it provides a fresh shift from the usual type of "Smallville" episodes.
