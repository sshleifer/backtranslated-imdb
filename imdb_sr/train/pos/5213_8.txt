This is the first review I wrote for the IMDb so I was alone, but I caught this movie on HBO and I was sure I was watching it. Richard Gere is great in this movie as a passionate agent / detective who rules in order to do the job. I think the story is great, and there is never a boring scene that slows down the pace of the film. Some parts of the movie that have to do with demented sex addicts are quite shocking, but if you've ever seen a movie about a crime like Se7en, you'll be able to try out the scenes well. All in all, if you are looking for a good detective / uncertainty film, ignore the low rating that this movie got to IMDb and definitely watch it.
