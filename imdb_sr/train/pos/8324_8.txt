This is a romantic comedy in which Albert Einstein played beautifully Valter Matthau, and his playmates are played by the creator of the game by his niece (Meg Rian) and the talented car mechanic (Tim Robins). The interaction among these main roles is enhanced by the great support of well-known actors. This movie is cute and fun ... "good"! Cordial recommendations.
