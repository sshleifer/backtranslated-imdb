"This show of the '70s" is definitely the funniest shov on TV. I began to watch it two and a half years ago and as soon as I saw it I could say that it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my Fez and Kelso are personal favorites, Leo was also a great character while he was there, I really hope he will come back because he is hilarious. It's classical when Fez goes "you son of a bitch!" And when Kelso yells "burn!", It always smiles at me: they are both big characters and they always have something funny to say about. Jackie is just another reason to watch the show: she started really well It's one of the rare shows that I can watch constantly and still laugh as much as how many times I've seen it, but it's still funny. The actors are classical: almost all are funny, where there are only a few funny characters with many shows. I will be sad to see this show at the end of next year, but it will be excluded as one of the best shows ever.
