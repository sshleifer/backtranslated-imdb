One night I was bored and Red Eie was involved and wondered why not. Red Eie is one of the best movies for a long time. I mean, I just got into the movie was so brilliant. The story is new and different. The film also has two great tracks in the film with Rachel Mcadams like Lisa Reisert and Cillian Marphy as Jackson Ripner. The acting is just brilliant and you get the feeling for the people in the movie. The music is just great, it gives you a cold and can also feel relaxed. I just like how the movie was so well made and it's never boring. Red eye is just phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. It is an excellent thriller. All in all, I enjoy the Eye so much that I can constantly watch it. <br /> <If you like Red Eie, then I recommend Elektra and Cri Wolf. I give Red Eie 9 out of 10. Excellent film
