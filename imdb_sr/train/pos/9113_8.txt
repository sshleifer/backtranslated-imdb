Probably the first Portuguese film I saw in my life and I enjoyed it. The action refers to how young military officers took power in Portugal in 1974 to finally defeat the fascist Caetan government and end wars in colonies, i.e. In Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Vert. Most of the events portrayed in the film reflects the accuracy of the conduct of military officers and soldiers to carry out a coup, oppressed people who were very pleased with this new development and freedom, the resistance of Caetans, as well as the subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinolu, who took office the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered by the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop a democratic one, and that is what the country achieved a few years after this coup. or revolution. The film also shows that military officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.
