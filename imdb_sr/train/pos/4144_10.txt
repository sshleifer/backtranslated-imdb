For some time I was caught in a trap, where I watched independent and foreign films and lied to myself that I liked it. The Fatti Drives Bus is an exception. It's true. It's the best "bad" movie ever. It looks like the "bad side" of this movie is natural. Halfway through the Satanic monologue, the word "hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. Glamorous Bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and clothes for a bargain shop. It is necessary that an eccentric couple is constantly trying to kill each other for a while to descend down the stairs. Jesus is walking on a funk soundtrack. In any case, Fatti leaves the impression that someone lost a job due to a film project consulting. But it's sincerity how bad that makes it so beautiful. The impression is that the creators knew it would be bad, but never forced it. Very recommended.
