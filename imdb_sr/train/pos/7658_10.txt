I saw this movie many times. At least Dozen. But, unfortunately, recently. However, carved in my memory never left me a scene in which Mickey Rooney, "Killer Mears" knows that he will be executed and approaching the moment of truth, He dances and cries, and laughs, moves from hestery to euphoria and starts gambit of all emotions. I've never seen such a great show of any actor who lives or is dead, past or present. Then I'm sure Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was also an actor of great genius. As much as I kept it, I'm thinking about myself for years, I must surely be alone in this regard. About 15 years after I last saw this movie on television, I accidentally read the old K & A part of the Los Angeles Times. The question was posed to Lavrence Olivier, and the question was, "Mr. Olivier, you are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, whom then do you consider among the greatest actors?" His answer was: "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was stunned, but not surprised. I immediately returned to his "Killer Mears" and I felt very good to see this great ability in it, and now my view is supported by the other one whose work I admired. Later there were "Bill" and many more moments with Mike Rooney. This film, "Last Mile", should be seen by all acting students. Frankly, I can not remember much about the film after all these years, but Mr. Roonei will never leave me in it. If anyone here remembers this film just like me? I would be interested to hear from you. For this painting engraved in my heart I gave her only to the face of his performance.
