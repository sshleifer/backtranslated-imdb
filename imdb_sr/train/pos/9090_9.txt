"Hollivood Hotel" is a fast-moving, lush, beautifully entertaining music comedy Varners that is unfortunately overlooked. It should be remembered that it is only for providing the official theme of Tinseltown - "Hollywood Time." The scenario of Richard Woking and Johnny Mercer has a number of other jewels, however, including the charming "I Am Like a Fish from the Water" and "Silhouette on the moon". The best music number is "Let It Make You a Lesson", in which Dick Povell and the company detail the accidents of people who are "behind eight spheres," a fate that literally works in the slow burning of Edgar Kennedy by the number ending. The image celebrates Hollywood glamor and punctuates it all at once, as it gets a lot of comical miles from pompous and ego-maniacal actors and stupid actors in the studio. The cast includes a bunch of great comedic characters - Allin Joslin as a cunning agent for the press, Ted Heali as Dick Povell's manager, Fritz Feld as an exciting restaurant patron, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall sarcastic Gal Pet, Edgar Kennedy Mabel Todd as Mona- a dumb sister, and Hugh Herbert as her father. The "racist" element mentioned in the second review here is ten seconds where Herbert appears in a black face during the pseudo- "Gone Vith the Vind" sequence. It's in suspicious taste, but that should not prevent you from seeing other pleasures in this movie, especially Benny Goodman's quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) In what I believe is the only record available on this incredible jazz combo. Sequence "Dark Eies" takes too long and comes late, but otherwise "Hollivood Hotel" is a gem, worth your time and certainly a movie that should be considered for the DVD edition.
