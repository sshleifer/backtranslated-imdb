After I saw "Marriing Mafia," I almost lost faith in Korean film work. But this brought my faith back. The leading female figure that a university student is forced to teach is a spoiled, rich, but charismatic high school student. He is the age of a feminine character. Through some harsh arguments, these two end up as great friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that novice kwan sang his job with excellence. He was such a revelation !! The actress Kim Ha Nul was also charming as usual. This film is trying to avoid clich√©s that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And that did not show us any unnecessary naked, sex scenes. It was great, wonderful, fresh, and I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br />
