Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seat. I usually do not go to military / war films, but this was worth my time. It was serious, but it was also funny. Beringer's character proved heroic and honest. No matter what, you know he got your back. Zane's character developed through the film. It was not just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a pistol. Completion through me a little. It was not very much during the action during the entire film, but I'm glad to see it anyway. Worth checking.
