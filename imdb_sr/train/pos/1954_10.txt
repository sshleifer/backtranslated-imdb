I thought this film was a good job. It was not as creative or original as the first, but who expected it to be. It was a lot of fun. the more I think about it, the more I like, and when I go to DVD, I will pay the money for him very proudly, every last cents. Sharon Stone is great, she is always, even if her movie is terrible (Catvoman), but this film is not, this is one of those films that will be underestimated for their lifetime, and will probably become a classic in 20 irs. Do not wait to be a classic, watch it now and enjoy. Do not expect a masterpiece, or something that attracts and touches your soul, just let yourself get out of your life and get involved in them. All in all, this movie is fun and I recommend people who have not seen it, because what critics and boxers say is not always counted, you see yourself, you never know, you might enjoy it. I recommend hat this movie 8/10
