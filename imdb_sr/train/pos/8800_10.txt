First of all, I do not understand why some people view this film as anti-American. Of course, there are moments when the United States is directly charged, such as Ioussef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they are not naive accusations; Instead, they are based on factual and documented facts, and all the documents that the CIA has published about Chile confirm this, for example. the various moods we find in it. We find that children are educated to respect all the people who died on that event; we find an unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find ordinary people who have reduced their feelings to the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to it, with dignity or frustration; We even find someone in the movie for whom the fall of the tower was the basis for a moment of real happiness. All these visions and others - as powerful as this one or even more - make a consistent connection and help to the viewer to provide insight into how different people around the world reacted to the events of September 11th. So, what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than white and black people, and that can make some people frenzied; but this is the world we live in, and there is no place for maniheistic ideologies, even though the presidents or priests can tell us. Finally, I think it's a pity that there is not even the date of publication of this film in the United States. It is a pity that most Americans ask why this catastrophe occurred, and this film could give them some indication. This film is very clear - it's different to what some people in this forum think - that everything we are doing today will determine our future and that past mistakes will affect how we live today.
