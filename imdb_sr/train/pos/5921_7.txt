I was an accountant of production in this film, and I also had to work on it, so I'm not completely impartial, but that was terrible, I would say. I thought it was a funny movie, not a reputable masterpiece, in any way, but by the way there was a lot of laughter. The Bible says that laughter behaves well as a medicine, so watching this movie can be good for your health. This movie. Susan Sarandon is, of course, the one who has since moved to much greater fame. Melanie Mairon was watched on TV every Sunday as a photographer in the TV series "Thirty and Something". Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, who continues to haunt people's dreams. One of my favorite actors in this show was Dub Tailor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comic actor, and a really nice, honest person. We all had fun at working on this show, and I think the party is happening.
