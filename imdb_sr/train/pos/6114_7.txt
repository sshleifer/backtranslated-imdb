A really sweet movie that has some similarities to hit "Mi Sassi Girl" from 2001, but is able to captivate most of the time. The biggest applause should go on two tracks. Ha-Neul Kim is cute and weird, Sang-voo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious. Chemistry between these two is very good. Director Kieong-hieong Kim uses some CG-inserts to capture visuals and also offers impressive fighting scenes in which Sang Quoon can shine. I loved it much more here than in the highly overrated "Vulcan High". And this boy has a future - those prospects, and techniques of struggle, and a romantic trail. Not bad. Well, I can shorten: Good movie. My Score: 7/10
