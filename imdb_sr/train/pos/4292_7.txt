I do not know anything about the movie before watching, and I think it was a "no-expecting" factor that helped me withstand at the beginning and later and more than I expected. but interesting. The story had gaps / jumps that I think throws a little bit on the audience. There is no great soundtrack in the background that creates a "romantic" ambience. But they are not all important. Chemistry between Emma and Louis was simply exceptional. There was inexplicable strange chemistry that I could not resist; I fell in love with him and here I am, I write this review. The subtle portrait of the love of two actors was great, and I believe that this is the essence of this film. This film is not a daily romantic comedy; in fact, not everyone will appreciate it. I had to sit down a bit, and then I slowly began to understand the little things I did not catch at first. I can not guarantee that everyone will like it, but I hope you will do it.
