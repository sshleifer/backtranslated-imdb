Let me get to the final outcome: I have 3 children, ages 5 to 10 years old. Going to the theater is a success when there are no talkative animals. I can see most of the videos for kids in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the film turns to The Vizard of Oz, a sex joke over the age of 18 in El Dorado and the tragic tragedy with the end of Rudolf Red-Nosed. I could probably write Nemo only from memory. Why do I support one of my children (which varies) who proposes this title for a family movie of the evening? In one word: Shoverman. The moment of silence ... Sigh *
