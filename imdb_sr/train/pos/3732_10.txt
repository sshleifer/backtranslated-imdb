Producer Joel Schumacher who directed "Phone Booth", '02, and many other great films showed in detail that no one can really be trained to be a kill machine without destroying their personality and real fears that a person has to face with COMBAT !! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), "Intermission", '03, gave one of his best performances and actually carried the whole picture on his back. Matthews Davis (Jim Pakton), "Blue Crush", '02, gave a great supporting role and Shea Vhigham (Pvt.Vilson), "All real girls", '03, showed his true acting skills in the role he played. There were two short scenes in which soldiers managed to find a hot romance on a short vacation in a local city and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. A military war veteran instructor from Vietnam told soldiers how to really trouble his enemies using electric wires in all the wrong places on the human body. Pleasant and fun movie to watch.
