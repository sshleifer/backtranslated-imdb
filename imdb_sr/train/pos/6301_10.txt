I participate at the Symposium of the director, and this film is shown after we have already seen a not so good movie and participated in the 40-minute discussion. Although it was incredibly late and we were tired, the whole audience really enjoyed it. I personally thought that the movie was hilarious in all the right places, and I liked strange actors. They really grow on you in the movie.
