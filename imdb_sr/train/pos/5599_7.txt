This was the second time I was watching a movie (via a version in French, unlike the first, which was synchronized in Italian) and I feel that it improves in the following views. Convincing if slowly building a study of the character that is beautifully captured and Parisian settings are equally impressive. In the long run, it's not Polanski's top level, and I would rank him in the 9th place in his filmography, but it's still a safe blend of subtle deer and, surprisingly, often wide comedy. It also has nice music, all of which are in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvin Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. Still, I'm a little confused by the sudden coercion for Trelkovsky to 'change' into the previous tenant; Apart from the owner of the cafe opposite the residential building, where everything that Simona did without asking him whether he wants to do anything else, there is little that he could point out (as far as I could see) that this was what everyone wanted me to! Okay, so he found Simone's stuff still lying in the apartment, but what exactly made him wear a dress and rise like her (even if he obviously started doing this unconsciously)? Following his somber visions in the bathroom, the last part of the film (where Adjani is almost disappearing) is almost anti-climatic - in particular, the scene where the landlord and other tenants testified his attempted suicide as if it were a night at the Opera, a concept that 46 years ago used Jean Koko in THE BLOOD OF THE SAND (1930)! The end result is, at the same time, predictable and unresolved: exactly what made two occupants of this apartment jump out of the window?!; I remember that this factor was forced to my first look, and I'm sorry to say that it is not clear now! Keep in mind, the first two thirds of the films are quite solid, but I want Polanski to be less inclined to obscure points in the whole story.
