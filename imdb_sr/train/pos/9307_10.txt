It's not a movie for everyone, but this movie is in my top 10. I am a fan of black comedy. With actors, including Richard Dreifus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Ben 'Brass Balls' London in lines, lines can not be dry. The support is almost a dead center. Counting minor shortcomings in the film: Makeup Ellen Barkin expressed her face; there were several lures from Joe Bishop and Richard Prior who did not serve the purpose, and the time of Michael J's recording. Pollard was too short. All in all, the actors were incredible without breaking the fine scenario. If you've seen Larry Bishop's film (writer, director), Undervorld (dark crime), you will enjoy this. His next trip (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
