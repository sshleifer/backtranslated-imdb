I was completely impressed by Shellei Adrienne "Vaitress" (2007). This film only confirms what was clear from that film. Adrienne was an incredibly talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. She managed to show the misery of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency. Alli Sheedi steals this film with a great performance as a woman who fell over the edge. The guy who runs Reg Rodgers, looks like Judd Nelson, is fine. There's also a great comedy, Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the movie "The Bastard Song" written by Adrienne can stand as her optimistic compliment: "It's the world of suffering, In the sea there must be pain, <br /> < > No matter how much sun you bring, You are hitting the rain ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not let your heart go down, <br /> <br / > Do not greet the hearts at the door, Do not live among the soulless "
