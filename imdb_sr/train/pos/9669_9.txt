After reading the original play, I thought it would be much more difficult to adapt to the screen than it turned out. Donal McCann puts on a one-time excellent performance as Public Gar, a suppressed antagonist who is open on the screen with his extroverted (but invisible others) alterego - Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays excellent "shots" whose inability to communicate his feelings only coincides with Gaughr. It is definitely worth renting if you can find it. (Probably inaccessible outside Ireland and Great Britain)
