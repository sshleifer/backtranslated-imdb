I chose this film based on a summary and a critique of quotes on the back of the box. I'm not great in foreign movies and I did not know what to expect. I'm not interested in subtitles either. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple, nice quality that leaves a sense of good will in life. I found myself laughing loudly. I would recommend this picture to everyone, even to those who are bothering foreign movie titles. This is worth the effort.
