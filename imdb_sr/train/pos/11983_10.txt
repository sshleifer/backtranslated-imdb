This show has a great story! It's very convincing! A young woman dies and he can not take care of his own children, so he invites his brother, his best friend, and many others later come to the show. Like Rebeecca Donaldson, a lovely but strong dog Comet, Nikki and Alek, you can find out yourself (I do not want to spoil it) and force Kimmi Gibler! (DJ's friend) and children are also wonderful. This is Marie Kate and Ashley are the first to go! You can also know that Candace Cameron Bure is from a series like St. Ellsworth Punk Brevster and it's so raven! Jodie Sveetin plays Steph Love in a state of a middle child who feels left out. This is a really good show!
