Now this is more like this! The first film had some suspicious dialogue and somewhat weaker acting, but it seemed that the team behind it had sent their stuff to continue and published a solid, thorough, hilarious and creative comedy that would keep everything on the edge of their places All the Way. Seriously, this is just full of great things, full of creativity, and at the same time it's less than a grin on movies from the '80s. The scenes in hell are great, as are those in heaven. Indeed, there is no shortage of crazy adventurous clutter that promises this, and you will never again see this kind of movie. Even the final act of Hammi's film is not as bad as the first one, since it is generally warm and pleasant in his extreme clich√© repertoire of family fun cinema bliss. Even Keanu Reeves, despite the look of her 30 years, is not bad here. Sounds like a good deal.
