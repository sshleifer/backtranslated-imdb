I think this film would be more pleasant if everyone saw it as a picture of colonial Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, not as a story. Because there's no real story here. Only one vignette on top of the other as a small point of light that does not mean much until you have enough to paint the picture. The first time I saw Chocolate, I did not "understand" it until I thought about it for a few days. At that time, I realized that there were many things to "get", including the end of colonialism that was just around the corner, there was simply no conspiracy. Anyway, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. The scene at the airport with a short shower and beautiful music was pure poetry. If you love "exciting" movies, do not look at this - you'll be bored with tears. But for some of you ... you can later thank me for recommending it to you.
