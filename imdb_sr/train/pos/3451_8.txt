First of all, this film was not published in theaters (I TESTED Badly say), I say that they realized that the story of broken policemen, politicians and dedicated journalists was made to death, just send DVD and cable TV> Money and running. When it says, I usually love this kind of film, especially with this called cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacei, LLCool J, Cari Elvais, John Heard and at the distaff site, Piper Perabo & Roslin Sanchez. done to death, but the above film brings life to this violent film and it can actually be watched. Justin Timberlake is a good as a dedicated young journalist for the eviction of newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman, others are or guilty police officers, and politicians or a bit of decent guys, 2 ladies are friends LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and they work What is needed is quite violent, many murders etc., and not for children. In no case is it a great movie, but for what the actor is Definitely good, Ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out) of 10)
