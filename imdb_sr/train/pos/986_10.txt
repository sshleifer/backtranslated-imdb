If you like Jamie Fokk, (Alvin Sanders), "Date From Hell", '01, he will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and comes close to the shrimps (Jumbo Size) and at the same time a lot golden lever. Alvin Sanders has many eyes of the FBI who watch him and gets a bite shot in the fork, and David Morse (Edgar Clenteen), the "Hack" '02 TV series, decides to come down to the poor Alvin and use it as the so-called Fish Hook to attract criminals. There's a lot of laughter, drama, cold blood killing and great location on the movie and lots of expensive cars that are being shipped to Junk Iard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were outstanding actors in this movie and it was a great game through the whole picture.
