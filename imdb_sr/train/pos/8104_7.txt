This is an incredible 1936 movie. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for the modern viewer), the stylistic vision of the year 2036 that comes after the word does. However, do not plan to understand all the dialogue - the sound quality and accents (that is the American - but "American" of the 1930s) make it difficult. Basically, the story is a wide 100 year view of a fictitious American city called "Everytime." It extends from 1936, when war is on the horizon, by 2036, when technology advances and creates its problems. The first clock is a bit slow - although it's hard to tell which audience I would think then. Events, uncertainty and visual effects are fairly low in today's conditions. However, when it comes to the future, it's simply fun to watch. Great sets and a retro science-fantastic look of everything is hard to beat. Unless you have excellent listening skills, this movie is difficult to listen to. I think I understood only 80% of the dialogue. Can use closed captions. If you are a Sci-Fi fan, this is one of the classic genres and you have to see (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until the version with closed captions is displayed, and then watch if you like the movies of this time period.
