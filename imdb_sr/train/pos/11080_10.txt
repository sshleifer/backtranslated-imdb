First of all, when people hear "GUI RITCHIE", they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone is joining Guia Ritchie with Snatch. They do not expect him to explore new borders. This film REVOLVER is different from abduction; it's much darker and more complex. The reason I gave the grade 10 was because I had to watch Revolver 3 times to get it all. So this movie is playing with your head. It's very cleverly written. This film is different from Snatch. It's done beautifully, the cinema is beautiful, and you can recognize Guia Ritchie's own seal (style of directing). more questions than answers.
