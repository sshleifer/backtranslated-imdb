This is one of those landmarks that should be placed in the context of time. Darkness in Tallinn was made in 1993. It was a period of chaos, confusion, and rude disorder not only for ordinary Estonians, but for countless citizens of other former nations who were part of a powerful Soviet empire. In such a tense climate, a young country called Estonia was born. Mechanisms for filling their dirty pockets using their selfish means. This is one of the main topics of this film. Darkness in Tallinn appears as an Estonian film, but it was made by Finnish director Ilka Jarvilaturi. He tried his best to bring as many possible doses of Estonian humor as possible. That's why we can call it a comedy movie of political subtonas. As ordinary people are involved in this movie, we can say that this movie marks good against evil. is not a new concept because it is easily accessible in most religious books of different faiths. Darkness in Tallinn shows us that ordinary governments can also be ruined by corrupt people. Nice movie to watch on a sunny day.
