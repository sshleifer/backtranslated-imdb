This is an absurd dark comedy from Belgium. Perfectly shot in black and white, Benoit Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog) is in good shape as Roger, an angry, obsessive family father in a small, dark Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who, together with his young daughter, Louise, visits traffic accidents in order to take photos. He is also obsessed with winning a car by entering the competition where the competitor must overturn the record - and he decides that his son, Michel, must try to break the record of an unbroken walk through the door - even hire a trainer with overweight to train him. Michelle dresses like Elvis and has a place in a radio show called 'Cinema Lies', where he describes film mistakes. Luise is friendly with neighbor Felix, a pigeon. Roger is a silent figure while pushing Michel across the border during a shooting attempt, which almost results in his death. Widespread images through the film are unreal pictures such as Magritte. It is undeniably charming and worth your time.
