I love bad movies. Not only because they are often fun as "really" good films (such as Pirates of the Caribbean and other Hollywood patos), but they are often far better than these films. And that's why I love Italian film scrapping from the 1970s and 1980s. And that's why I especially love this movie, The Barbarians & the Compani. Director Ruggero Deodato has made some really good movies, such as House on Edge of the Park, and his Atlantis Interceptors and Live Like Cop, Die Like a Man are pleasing action movies. But this is really bad. Varvars are so idiotic. Peter and David Paul as brothers of the Kutchek and Gore brothers are very entertaining due to lack of charisma and acting skills. But if they can not act, shout and scream every time they do something important. In one scene, people try to explain brothers' brothers, and they flee extremely unusual. I can not describe how much I laughed when I first watched. Varvari and the company are a classical camp that everyone should see once. If you thought Plan 9 from the outer space was a fun camp, this would be the real killer.
