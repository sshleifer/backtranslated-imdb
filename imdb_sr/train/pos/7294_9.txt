After reading a few comments, I felt that I had to add two of my cents. "Sorrov Lost" is one of the most memorable short films I've ever seen. I got a chance to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this film was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short time. The story is centered on a young girl who is the victim of her father's abuser. Soon she was given the choice to "stop" the demon played by "Eitch Ebebari" Vitchblade. Watching the show, I was impressively impressed with my unique and different character. I never knew he could do such a good job! His character was deeply complex and he was very convincing. The acting was absolutely wonderful for him. The girl was fine and her father was decent. There is a death that follows a girl until she fails to escape from her future. The effects and cinema were absolutely full. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this. It's rare to see so high quality. The opening was absolutely stunningly comparable to any major feature film. This does not mean that it is not without fault - I thought it took a bit to go, and the introduction was a bit long. But this was stuck in the head for days after I watched it. There are very few short trousers with this level of quality.
