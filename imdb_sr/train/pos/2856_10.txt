This is one of the movies that are improving every time you see them. It's packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. As in Sabu's later films (I have not seen "an unhappy monkey" yet, but others are great), failure, chance and humanism play a big role. Cutting and assembly is inventive and artistic, and the film is not an "artistic" picture, it is very entertaining. When compared to "Run, Lola, Run," you must keep in mind that "Dangan Ranna" was created a few years earlier and was shown on German TV in 1997 ... so it's more likely to serve as an inspiration for the movie Team Tikvera, not vice versa. In addition to other reviews, I have to add that my acting and the end I like very much. This movie is very fun in many ways and manages to deliver a message without any boring or pretentious.
