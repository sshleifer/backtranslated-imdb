The whole meaning of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color versions of the movie opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it did a wonderful thing in it. The broader public would not remain silent because of a love story about two young exotic lover in ancient Egypt, if they would typically sang the famous music with typically 300 pounds of over 40 tenor and soprano with vocal equipment. Hence, the visual replacement of the beautiful principals (young Lorraine, the handsome Della Marra and the glamorous Ms. Makvell) make the story much more convincing, giving those who are not familiar with the plot or music a better chance of being caught in wonderful arias that would otherwise not be. All in all, enchanting an introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing it when I was in high school and it certainly aroused my interest in the opera, a form with which I was not well familiar at that time. I still think this film is unusual and I would recommend it to those who could appreciate the good music they follow better than average pictures. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for the audience she did not appear in any other movie.
