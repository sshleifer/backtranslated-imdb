After what was considered Dirty Harry's official trilogy with The Enforcer (1976), this is the last chapter in the series. Dirty Harry returned, older, dirtier and denser than ever since the original 1971 classic. But now he is looking for a new killer, a killer who wants to retaliate, killing attackers. The sudden impact brings a new meaning and darker tone to dirty Harry. Callahan is on a new case of murder that is circling back to the woman (played by Sondra Locke), who was brutally raped, along with her sister, who remained traumatized. Ten years after that, she is for revenge by killing attackers. At the same time, Callahan is in hot trouble with his superiors after challenging the mafia boss to a heart attack, from which the mafia hunts him. So, in order to extinguish the heat in the city, Harry was ordered to go on vacation in the seaside town, but at the same time a raped victim was in the city, while hunting his attackers one by one. Harry is in the investigation and believes that the killings are very similar, as he is on the trail of the killer. The sudden shock, in my opinion, must be one of my top 10 revenge movies, and that the second best Dirty Harry movie, far better than both The Enforcer and The Dead Pool. A sudden stroke has what original Dirty Harry had, a dark tone of amusing value. So, do you feel good, punk?
