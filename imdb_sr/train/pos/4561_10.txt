I've seen this movie three times now, and every time I see it, it's becoming more personal and more emotional for watching. Levis, an incredible actor. However, Brenda Fricker is a surprise. She catches your heart like the mother of a boy with physical disability, who is not able to walk, or speak until she is in her late teens. but I'll stop here. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys movies based on real events, or simply enjoy good drama in general.
