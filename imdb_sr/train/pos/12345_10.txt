Kurosava will intertwine a story that has different characteristics, like any Shakespearean drama, and acting is a true story, with each star playing its role as part of a larger story. It is touching, fun and intriguing in all parts. The development of the character is close to perfection, the cinema is lively and attractive, and the story attracts you. I want to say that they are "Samurai freaks" and they are obsessed with dynasty at the end of the 18th and 19th century. Stories about Japan can dismiss this film as Kurosavin's best work. Maybe he is not the best, but even in the worst case, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is based on raising the everyday lives of ordinary people during times of great change, that it is timeless, despite being placed in a not so distant past. I would sincerely recommend this to you. to every film lover, and especially to those who will probably continue to read the novel on which the film is based.
