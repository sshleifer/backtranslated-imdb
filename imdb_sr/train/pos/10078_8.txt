This is a story that could have happened anywhere, given the right circumstances. A street entertainer who draws attention to the famous opera star and friendship. An older entertainer finds / buys a male child to pass on his art. From there we follow them through rigorous challenges, but free life along the river. Traveling city to town, he performs and has a certain degree of fame. Despite the times and influences, the man is good and good. Overall, performances are in the first place, especially Xu Zhu, who shows the street performer. The child (Reniing Zhou) is beautiful and really strong and well tolerated open prejudice. Two protagonists, together with the support of a kind opera singer, Liang's master (interestingly androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting story of forgiveness, grief and love. Some mentioned the distant similarities of this film with BA VANG BIE JI (FAREVELL MI CONCUBINE); however, this film can not easily be sustained, every similarity is at best remote. My only task with KING OF MASKS is the end. He was weak, clich√© and subtle as a mall. The audience was already wrapped up in the story, for what is unnecessary manipulation? What a shame. To bring a fine movie performance so far, just to surrender to the emotional (and loosely) pathos. Frankly, this film was good, instead of classic, it should have been. Aside from, KING MASKS is still very valuable for your time. I was happy to see Shav Brothers still making good movies. Recommended.
