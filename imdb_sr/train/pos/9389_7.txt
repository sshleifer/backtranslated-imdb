Red Rock Vest (1993) Nicolas Cage gets involved in a deadly crime without first knowing it, and the dominoes lead to increased danger, adventures and accidents in the wild US west of the nineties. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and Cage draws a mixture with his usual sarcastic spirit and cautiousness. Is the plot above the top? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper Perfect Like a Crazy, Pretty Cute Killer? Yes. Does Cage have a chance? Well, you have to look and see. It never retires, and it surprised me when I first saw it. On yesterday's second look, I was surprised how well it was kept, how well it was constructed, and how terrible and fun it was at the same time. Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) Known over TV, but with Rounders, this film shows a skillful hand with sensational complications. It is preserved by its humor along the way, and cartoons. At least it's sleazy, the cops are suspicious. And do not miss the really inspired comedy of Dvight Ioakama as a truck driver.
