I saw this movie last night after I waited and age to be released here in Canada (only in limited edition). It was worth a wait, and then something. I am a very passionate reader, Margaret Laurence, and I was excited to see that this novel turns into a movie. Actually, I loved the film more than a novel. I loved that the character of Brama Shipli was a bit less rough and that it seemed to be a more loving story between Hagar and Brama, which made the scene at the end of the life of Bram much more moving. The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was no longer sympathetic to the film than in the book, but Ellen Burstin was a genius in this role. She was also the Hagar and through her. Christine Horne was brilliant and I'm sure she has a lot more great things. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrified. I could go on and on, a total of 9 * out of ten. Fantastic and I can not wait for it to appear on a DVD, it must have for my collection!
