"Bend It Like Beckham" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about another football, but English sports fans, it's equivalent to "Hit It Like Bonds" or "Dunk It Like Jordan". Every young footballer dreams of bouncing a soccer ball around a player and in the net for the goal, similar to star David Beckham, and young Indian Jess (Parminder Nagra), in Bend It Like Beckham. Jess likes to play soccer games, which was forbidden by the mother of a traditionalist. However, while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightlei) sees his game and invites her to try out a trip, a football team of all girls. After meeting Jonathan Rhis-Meiers, she is a team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. The film does not deal with disrespecting parents, but the girl who does what she wants, even if it is against culture, and not just for parents. The film is humorous, especially when Jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian. The film attracts a moment of clich√©s, since a big soccer match was played on the same day that Jesse's sister was married, but that does not separate from cheese, but of entertainment and light. Soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and the story of girls growing up in the boy's world, the football world will inspire some in the audience. The Beckham Band Like Beckham is not just football, but a girl who tries to find and meet her parents at the same time, something that turns out to be pretty difficult.
