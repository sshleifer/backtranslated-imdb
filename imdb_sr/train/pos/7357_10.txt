OK where to start? ... This movie has changed my life! The plot was flawless. James Cahill did it alone. In the beginning after the first look, I was disappointed that I did not see it on the silver screen. However, it was before researching many DVDs !!!! The film's commentary on my god Jakes Cahill was nearly as flawless as his acting. He talked about the industrial secrets used in the film and that you only got with experience. I was so impressed with other actors. The scene where the guard talked with a girl in the hall, he reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) films. I am definitely with Gangsta when I express my disappointment without any further extension. I'm still blown away with every review of the martial arts skills involved, which only agree with the sign that indicates the location of the library at school ... and probably the guy who plays retard! All in all, the timeless classic and the best film that comes out of Europe for years! where are Oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
