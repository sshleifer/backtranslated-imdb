Another classical study of the impact of wealth on the southern family is masterfully presented in writing in the wind. Kyle Hadley has everything. Wealth, plane, name. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, always pulled him out of trouble. Mitch graduated from college, Kile was thrown out. Mitch is not from a rich home. Kyle's family, with Hadley Oil, controls most of the city's everything. <br /> <br /> While in N. I., Kile meets the girl of her dreams, which is beautifully played by Lauren Bacall. After a vivid romance, he is married and brought home. There she meets her father-in-law who warns that Kile may be difficult. Kile sleeps with a pistol under the pillow. Beck's character encounters Kyle's sister, Marie Lee, a tramp if she has ever been, played entirely by Dorothy Malone, who was chosen as the best supporting actress. Rock Hudson plays Mitch, a faithful friend. / / The year of marriage happiness for Kyle and his bride ends when a doctor tells her that she can not have children. When his wife reveals that she is truly pregnant, Kyle, thinking that child Mitch, goes into a drunken rage and is accidentally killed in an unforgettable scene. Mari Lee, who always liked Mitch, is trying, but unsuccessful in blaming Mitch for Kille's death. In an unforgettable courthouse, Malone pulled out all the breaks and finally admitted that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. Her Oscar was deservedly deserved. Amazingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadlei, was nominated for the best supporting actor and lost in the victory of Anthony Quinn, as Paul Gauguin, in Lust for Life. Douglas Sirk was a master of soap operas from the 1950s. Written in the wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
