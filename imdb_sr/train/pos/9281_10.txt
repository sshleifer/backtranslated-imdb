I do not know how and where Iranian leaders get inspiration for such a plot. In fact, this is a very simple action that many directors could come up with --- but they might not be able to project it as Jafar Panahi did. The film is like two worlds at the same time, one related to another - a soccer match and a battle between the poles that is going beyond the walls of the stadium. Because of that, you feel like you're in the movie and you. You are one of the characters, and while watching a movie, like you want to look at a football game. She will feel exactly the same excitement and feelings as those female actresses in the film. Capture is in the way that you wanted to see the end, you want to find out the judgment, you die to see what happens to the girls. I love occasional conversations between a smoking girl and one of the military apprentices. It's like Venus VS Mars, it really shows the difference in thinking men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. This is the second Jafar Panahi film I've seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and I'm looking forward to seeing some more. I'm already hooked on Iranian films and this is mandatory!
