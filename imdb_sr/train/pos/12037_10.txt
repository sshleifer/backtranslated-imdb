The woman in black was the British for a TV film that was first broadcast on the BBC at Christmave Eve '89, and again in '92. I believe she made a round on American TV on A & E. He was released on VHS in Britain in the early nineties, but he disappeared. The US company later released it on DVD, but this version was also sold. According to the book's author's website, the rights to the film are now owned by someone else and will not be re-published, and that ebai is selling unofficial bootlegs. First I heard about this movie recently on the bulletin board and I had to check it out. I found a copy of ebai for about $ 28. It is certain that the forgeries from the seller in the Far East, although the DVD says, "made in Canada", ha ha. But it's a good copy, and you can not really blame the labels in the bootlegg for letting things that are rare, out of print, and lost in legal disputes. I love film. It's a periodical piece from the 1920s, with all the very authentic and strange British environment of that time. The woman in black is very atmospheric and dark. In most cases, the film is very quiet, but effective and terrifying. There is no self-indulgence, violence, or in general special effects, but Woman in Black is still able to create absolutely cold moments. It's a cool movie about ghosts of classical style. The film itself seems to have been made in the 1930s, except for color. Without the flick of all modern horror films, I'm afraid this film will always be just a lost gem. For me, she is becoming one of my dear ones.
