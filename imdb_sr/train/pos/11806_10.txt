Everything was better in the past. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock proves my claim very easily. At the time of writing this comment, I am fourteen years old, but even in teenage years I can not resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who really lived under the rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is about a horde of playful and stupid creatures called Fraggles who live incredibly - in the rock. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by many other species, such as the Doozeri laboratories and countless living plants. Outside the stone on one side lives the inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later acquiesces with Gobo Fraggle), and on the other hand the families of Gorgi-superiors of the Universe. Five major Fraggles Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (arts and calm), Vemblei (undecided and friend of Gobo), Boober (a pessimistic homeland) and Red (loves everything that has to do with sports and general feisty) in some strange situations each episode, while simultaneously singing and dancing their worries. Fraggle Rock is definitely a family play - plots can have tangible details that babies can not keep track of, but the song - And dance routines will keep their attention. The characters are strong and sympathetic, their conflicts are credible and their adventures are exciting. Gorgi are terrifying, Doc and Sprocket enlightening, Uncle Traveling Matt is hilarious (segments of postcards are 80's!) And the last episode, Change of Address, is really touching. Let's go back to Fraggle Rock again!
