I immediately noticed that this film is not really based on the Dodi Smith novel. In any case, it was a good idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now have their puppies. The sweetest of the Dalmatians was, of course, a small Snovball that was completely clean to the very end of the film. To be honest, I did not know what to think when Cruella de Will seemed to change completely. In fact, I often thought about the possibility of becoming friendly, but now that she soon turned into "myself" and announced that she was once again Cruella, I almost started really worrying about Chloe's Dalmatians. In fact, the scene in which the puppies watched the Lady and the Tramp as Chloe and Kevin dinner, she was much better than I expected. I also liked the parakeet who played for the dog, and it was amazing that the dogs learned so many tricks for this movie. Of course, I was pleased that at the end of the Dalmatians were rescued, but I would like to know what will happen to Cruel after losing all his property. And what, for good reason, a dog house could work with such a huge amount of money? Finally, it was very touching that Snovball had a place at the very end of the film.
