Erroll works for the Department of Public Security and his job is to check sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes the line in his business and fights sexual offenders. I do not blame him, but his boss is ready to retreat and Allison is coming. Errol is now training to do his job and it's like shadows of work. Allison is a little naive about the job at first, but she does not realize how seriously she is, and everything is Errol's fault. He began to go far with his obsession to find a missing girl when his job was not to be a cop. It's a pretty decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries and works out his "scope of practice". Erroll did a good job, but for security, Alison. There are some good mysteries about it and just when I realized it, there was more.
