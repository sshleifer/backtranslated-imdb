This film is shown in the very early episode of Misteri Science Theater 3000, but when I see this movie, I do not mean that wonderful TV series. I believe this was a surprisingly good horror in the early forties, with a very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67-year horror movie. In fact, I enjoyed watching Belo Lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife looking for a fluid from the ghosts of young potential bride, an old witch, and her two bizarre sons, a giant idiot, and another comedy dwarf (Angelo Rossitto) from Freaks from 1932. ). I also enjoyed a young reporter who is stereotypical, but still fun. My only problem with this otherwise decent movie is a plot, even funny and incredible for the movie. I do not want to spoil any of these movies, so get out and rent it, or, better still, buy for a few dollars.
