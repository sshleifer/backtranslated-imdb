Misfits at military school? Hmmmm, it sounds ridiculous, maybe offensive to some. You have characters there, Arab thieves, sex crazy teenagers, smart mouths, smoking pots, and do not forget, the guy who burns things. Throw into the strict nonsense of Sergent, the homosexual Sergent, and one sexy ammunition teacher, and make a crazy movie adventure. I saw this movie and it's funny because the comedy is about the facts If you try to work together, things will end. This group of students of incompetence in the Veinberg military school is housed here because, as Sgt Liceman quotes "because you are outcast, the shame for your family and community, the shame." One of the earlier performances of Ralph Macchio- and before Karate Kid and my cousin Vinny, with Barbara Bach performances, this film attracts teens and young adults. Excellent soundtrack keeps the movie moving.
