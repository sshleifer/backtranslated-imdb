Jake's Closet has the emotional strength of Kramer vs. Kramer in combination with the imagination of Pan's Labirinth. Even the initial special effect is like giving the air to Pan's maze. But it is a story that takes place in modern times, not in the sixty years of war, and in that way there is even more reverence today. Jake's closet is about a boy, the only child, practically alone on a summer vacation, dealing with the breakup of his family. It's a horror movie like The Others and The Sikth Sense, a horror movie for a thinking person. If you are looking for a slasher movie, this will not be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for a story that is both touching and tense with good acting, this is a movie for you. On the projection I saw, I swear it was a moment when the whole audience screamed. I recommend capturing this movie.
