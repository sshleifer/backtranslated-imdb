I did not laugh so hard in this movie for a long time. I had to go to the previous review, and I was thrilled because I was dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes with laughter throughout the film. The audience shared my laughter and applauded and shouted during most of the film. Happiness to Steve Carrell (whom I already adored). In this film his huge talent for comedy proves. He has a style that I have not seen before. And Catherine Keener is as good as ever. Thank God that there was no comedy from Vill Ferrell (I love him, but he saw him this summer too). In this film there were parts of comedy genius. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to writing (also Carrell). Wax and speed scenes with "an obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical. I will definitely go to the 40 year old Virgin when it's published. My advice: go see it for a huge laugh and incredibly enjoyable movie at the top.
