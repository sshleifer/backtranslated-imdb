I was hooked from start to finish. The great horror comes from disturbing images and organic shocks that were created without making you jump, but to make you go "What did f * ck just see?" All other commentators gave a short summary of what the film is about, so I will not repeat what has already been said. I told other people about this movie a few days after I saw it just because I was still being persecuted. I even had a bad dream after I saw it, and I am a true fan of horror, which can not easily scare me, like "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What gave me bad dreams was the discomfort I felt about what I would do if I were in that cell with these guys. What would be my personal horror? my subconscious took me there, and it was not pleasant. That my friends are what a good horror is shouting for you! The best part of this movie is that it's subtle. It's not about Bogeyman who is jumping on you, an alien invasion, or a ton above. That's the opposite. The horror you create in your mind. The irony for the four faces is that horror does not come from an external force that confirms its power over them. Simply, men ask for one thing they want, and they get it ... but not the way they imagined it. Thus, on the one hand, they get what they want from an occult book, but in the end they can wish they were not. Sometimes locking in a prison cell is the best place to be!
