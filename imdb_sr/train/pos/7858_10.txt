TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRI is perhaps the best movie of all the films Mari Pickford. At two o'clock, he was pretty long for a silent film from 1922, but you still are interested in about 80 years after it was filmed. Mary gives one of her best performances, sometimes the role looks like "the greatest hits" of performances with parts of Mary innocents, Mary of the little devil, Mary of the little mother, Maria spitfire, Mary of the romantic heroine, etc. They were used in one movie in the past. The film is surprisingly sincere when it comes to an unlawful child for 1922, and in one point our Little Mary is considered a barren mother! If the Academy's prize was around 1922, no doubt the best actress of the Academy for this year was Mari's.
