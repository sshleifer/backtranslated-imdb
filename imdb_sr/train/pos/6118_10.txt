Jack Frost is really a great movie. So ... Funny. Its Violent. and Veri Enjoiable. Most people say that it is rated, but that can not be further from the truth. It has excellent special effects and good performance. The only strange thing is, of course, Snowman's killer. I think this film was actually one of the best movies of the late nineties. Most of these films are missing masterclasses for Clive Barker these days. That is, be genuine and give the viewer what they do not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. Rating: A +. Ed also recommends filmmaker Jack Frost's fans.
