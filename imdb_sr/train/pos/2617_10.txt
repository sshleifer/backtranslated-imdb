I watched King Lyon many times than all my friends put in. Have a sister ... you know how she is. So far, I remember the plot and lines. After Lion King 2 came out, I was as good as letting me see ... the other was considerably weaker ... then I saw an advertisement for Lion King 1 and 1/2 .... After I watched 1 1/2 I was like a vow. All my expectations (for repetition) are broken. A real lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your headquarters all the time. I noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comic moments that ROFlmao would apply here 100%.
