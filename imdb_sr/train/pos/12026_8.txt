I must say that this film was a work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart was. So we are used to it, now that we have seen it in the sitcom and I hope that the TV station will soon re-screen this film because it will show Sabrin's fans that MJH is shining in drama. Viewed as we watched Sabrina now for 5 years and in order to give viewers the taste of her untapped talent, it would be a plus. Melissa plays her part so well that she wants her parents to "go" so she can be with the guy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice, Melissa works with David Lascher in this, much before assuming the role of Josh on Sabrina. So it would be kind of proper to see this now whenever it is broadcast again. I hope MJH gets some good roles in movies or even in several TV films, like Kellie Martin, who is always great in TV films. A lot of untapped talent is waiting to throw out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you're always shining Melissa !!!
