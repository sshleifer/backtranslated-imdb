Okay, so the look at the front of Checker's cab, probably a model from the 1930s. It has large triangular headlights. There's also the DeSoto cabin in this black-and-white, characteristic, almost musical love that made the story wrong. True pleasure is a look at the interiors of rooms and fashion from the forties and hotel lifts. Hairdressers, both men and women, are beautiful. That Dolly Parton had hair from Victor Mature could be great. There is an artistic attic that will enchant every Andi Varhol. If you are watching this expecting a great story about Casablanca or Sound of Music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. Below the model of the runway there is a beautiful story. My DVD copy with another movie for $ 1 was very visible. The title sequence was sweet, but not up there with Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Warl or Pink Panther. This was a RKO film, but it did not have a nice logo of the aircraft used by RKO. I liked Victor Mature in a million, BC, and Sampson and Delilah, and especially in the Violent Saturday. See if you can find it here. He was wonderful in comedy with Peter Sellers called Caccia Alla Volpe or After Fok. Richard Carlson worked on TV Led Three Lives in the early 1950s. Vic Mature is offered to Sampson's father in the remake of Sampson and Delilah. He was allegedly wondering if he would have any problems playing the role of his father because he was so well known as Sampson. Victor replied: "If the money is right, I will play Sampson's mother."
