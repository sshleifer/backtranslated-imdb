In ten years since Wildside was broadcast, nothing really came close to his quality in local production. This includes two series of pleasant but overstated Underground, which revived events in the recent criminal history of Sydney and Melbourne. The Blue Murder Miniseries (which also played Tony Martine, but as someone on the other side of the law) can be an exception. Vildside is currently being repeated late at night on ABC. I have not watched the play since, I am still impressed with her uncompromising tales and very human characters. The actors are excellent: Toni Martin as a detective who has persecuted his son's disappearance, Rachael Blake (who later links with Martin in real life) as a worker in a community that fights alcoholism, and Alec Dimitriades as a young policeman whose gig is gambling. Equally good support is provided by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mari Coustas (yes, herself Effie) and young Abbie Cornish. ABC unexplainedly released only the first three episodes on DVD. many years ago. The logic of this type of marketing is beyond me, but I suppose it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with original manufacturers. Great series that has grown extremely well. We hope that ABC's DVD department will connect. (According to moderator on the ABC notice board, some kind of further edition of DVD is in December 2009)
