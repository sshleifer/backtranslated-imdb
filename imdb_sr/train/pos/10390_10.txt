In addition to Star Wars and the Wizard of Oz, this remains one of the greatest fantastic films ever made. It is a real disadvantage that it is not as well known as the former films (perhaps because it is legendary stories, not on contemporary or science-fantastic settings, and that it is a Briton, which means a smaller market for films), but it is wonderful that he deserved this reputation. Like all great family movies, it can be a child, an adult, or even a teenager who enjoys this movie (I am 18 years old), but I should appreciate the first classic movies. I absolutely love this movie. It has incredible musical partitures by Miklos Rozse (perhaps my favorite classic film) that compete with any Star Vars result of John Villiams, with fast but not brilliant pace, nice sets, dialogue and coloring (sets and cinemas) of the Oscars), and top special effects (for the time, some are still stunning). And, of course, the June Dupr√©s look like a princess who opposes Catherine Zeta-Jones (even in some way looks like Jones). In conclusion, this is one of my time favorite movie (in addition to Robin Hood Adventure) and really deserves more attention. It's a real adventure of magic, and, along with Robin Hood, it's my desert island movie that I could watch constantly without disturbing it. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** Excellent)
