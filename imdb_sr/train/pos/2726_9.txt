This movie is up against the classics of all time. Music, camera shots and acting are great. Showing a film in black and white gave him a much better look and perfectly complemented music, such as Psicho. It is surprising that so few people commented on this film. I guess it's hard to find a movie. I gave a movie to 9. Watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.
