Albukuerkue is a film that has all the elements of Western Class A except one: a story that really belongs to Class B or C. This was acceptable at the time the film was shot, when people were thrilled when they saw it in the western color, but today it just seems very primitive. However, for people who enjoy old westerns, it's fun, the original color and sound are very well kept on the DVD that recently came out. Gabbi Haies is a good assistant, Lon Chanei is as evil as ever, and Randolph Scott is a bit cheerful than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque, you expect to see something that will remind you of the city, but the city shown here can be anywhere.
