OK - as far as 2 versions of this movie are concerned. Two people, John Corti and Bill Couterie, were involved in the production (George was just a producer - he really did not have such a statement in the movie - he just helped with the money) - the version of "Adult" would be enabled by Bill Couterie. John Corty did not like or approve this version (as it was done behind his back). Thanks to Ladd's films that collapsed, they did not advertise this movie and cast all their advertising money for The Right Stuff, hoping to pass through them ... ... and not. So this film has never had a chance. When "Twice" reached the cable (HBO) - they showed rolls with Bill's version, and John threatened to sue if it was shown more (did you notice that the adult version did not last long?). Shovtime got a clean version. The video and laser video version is a version approved by John (which has more power than Bill). It's a pity, because the version for adults is better and makes more sense. But it is very doubtful that it will ever be published in that version on a DVD (or any other color format). I'm sorry to disappoint you. I know all this information as I used to be the president of the Fan Club "Tvice Upon A Time" (I still have many items from the movie - who used to have their own version of "adult" in the form of letters in the box, but it was stolen - I only now have a partial a copy of HBO). 8 stars up to adult version - 5 for 'clean' version. Other questions, just ask.
