This is such a fantastic Western film about a man who cares about himself (Jimmy Stevart) who goes to the Klondike for gold. On the way, he is disturbed by the local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, giving a miraculously poor performance), whom he upsets. McIntirera threatens to be dead if he ever returns through his city, which, unfortunately, is the only way back to the United States. The main part of the story is about the quiet town of Klondike Davson, which turned upside down by new residents from the city of McIntire. Ruth Roman, for example, who came with Stevart and his companions (Jai C. Flippen and Valter Brennen, who plays Stevart's best friend), builds a salon (the Hollywood front for a public house) and tries to run a city restaurant out of work. She opens the road to McIntire and his bullying. In 1953, Jimmy Stevart and director Anthony Mann made one of the highlights of the Western genre, The Naked Spur. Far Countri is just a little bit smaller, and contains 99.9% of what made this film so special without, of course, feeling like cheap copies. Like The Naked Spur, Far Countri boasts a beautiful cinema on site. The landscape is beautiful. Stevart gives one of his best performances (almost equal to his greatest success in 1954, Rear Window). I suppose this can be considered a clich√©, because he begins to lame a loner and find out how this kind of existence is played at the end. Still, Stevart plays so damn well that this character makes it very human. And the accompanying performances are universally fantastic. In addition to the ones I mentioned, the great French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I have to figure out Valter Brennen. He seems to be specializing in playing the best friends. His relationship with Stuart is very touching, since he is, at first, the only character capable of pulling any humanity into a cynical man. The script is very well written, and the Man's direction is flawless. Masterpiece. 10/10.
