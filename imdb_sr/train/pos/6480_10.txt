This is by far the best war documentary ever made. From the very beginning of the first episode when Sir Laurence Olivier described the terrible events in Oradour-Sur-Glane 'The day the soldiers came'. Until the last days of the war, when the clouds of mushrooms appeared above Japan, I never missed another part of this classic series and I remember well although it was shown back in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy was thoroughly processed. . This entire series should be compulsory to observe as many world children do not repeat the tragedy of World War II and that intolerance, hatred, greed and intolerance do not interfere with patriotism or religious fervor.
