Originally I saw this movie a few years ago in Cinemak on Friday after the dark series (when the cable box was built as a keyboard) and it intrigued me. Although the aspect of the film is flawless, he was acting well. Performance Depardieu & Devaere are very pleasant. Together they have good chemistry and Miou-Miou makes a pink fur beautiful. in these politically correct times (at least not in the US), because it seems to be sensationalizing things such as violence, robbery and non-compulsive sex. This film proves that with a talented actor and also a talented director, a good movie is a good movie regardless of the subject. -Miou to Get Out Your Hankerchief.
