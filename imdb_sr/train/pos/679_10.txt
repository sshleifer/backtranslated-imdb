This supernatural Peter Veir thriller is truly one of the most interesting films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain works best here as a lawyer from Australia who defends a group of young Aborigines accused of murder. As the case approaches, he discovers more about the main defendant, Chris, and not just about himself. Chris tells him that Mulkurul, who looks like a race of supernatural beings who lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, extraordinary high precipitation seems to be confirmed by the Aboriginal propaganda of the arrival of the last wave that will drown the world. It's a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in supporting roles, as well as a guy with a hard name playing Charlie, an old Aboriginal that can turn into a owl. The highlight and the end do not disappoint, unlike many other supernatural trillers that fall after a long hour. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is a drama and speaks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. Master's work by Peter Veir, a master of visually stunning drama.
