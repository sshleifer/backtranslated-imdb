The fifth figure of Mitchell Leizen as a director, and he shows his versatility by directing a musical, after his previous films were heavy drama. He also plays the band as a conductor. You can say that this is a movie that has already been pre-code, and nothing similar has been done in the US sometime after (as 30+ years old). Leisen recorded music numbers so that they were what the audience could see - without wide screens or from above al-Busby Berkeley. What seems to me funny or interesting is that you never see the audience. As others mentioned, the tracks are rather impersonal, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie personals. Gertrude Michael, however, offers little spark. Musical numbers are interesting and some good (especially rapping raps is fun), but the drama is incredible and fake - three murders are too many and have a lot of minimal emotional impact on the characters. This movie could have been much better here.
