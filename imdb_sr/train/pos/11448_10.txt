For the first time I saw this absolutely fun documentary in his original release in 2001, and that really had a profound effect on me, so I forced several friends to see him with him on repeated screenings. Conclusion: None of my friends went disappointed (ever!). This star film talks about the Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsvorthi, who creates some absolutely beautiful works of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.). To create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (statement in temporary state of everything?). We see that Goldsvorthi creates several works of temporary art, as well as some of his long-term installations in large galleries around the world, as well as several works in the natural world. German film director Thomas Riedelsheimer directed, photographed and edited this meditation on a creative process that is a real treat for both the eye and the ear (with an ambient musical partit, composed and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is generally experimental / noise-textured guitar, as and capable ensemble musicians). Although this movie has been available on DVD for several years now, if you can find a movie that emphasizes the revival of this fine movie, be sure to look for it (it's just a movie composed for a big screen, an experienced sound system that really experiences this movie in the right way ). There is no MPAA rating, but does not contain anything that would insult (unless the live birth of the sheep on the screen is not destined to offend or interfere)
