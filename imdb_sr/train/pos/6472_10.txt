One of the best pieces of television drama in the last decade. For five hours, perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged while exploring many aspects of modern British society. David Morrisei is, as usual, brilliant. At first he came as a heavy hand copper in a heroin conflict, but then he turned out to be intelligent and caring while working with her in discovering the truth. I never saw Surena Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performances were magnificent, as she kept her humor and compassion while she was trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of motherhood care. I could continue to talk about every member of the acting team that contributes to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing scenario that continually raises your assumption of any character. Such programs restore faith to a television drama, and at the same time make it almost impossible to satisfy most of the garbage that increasingly fills air waves.
