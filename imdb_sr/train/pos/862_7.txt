Karla is a secretary who is essentially a deaf without hearing aids. When she finds herself overburdened at work, she can hire Paula to help her. Paul just got out of jail, and his past is not entirely behind him. To say a lot more about the story, which has many turns, would be a mistake. The most interesting thing about this movie for me is how the sound is used to point to when Carla can hear and when she can not - some sort of "listening point" (as a viewpoint). The early scenes that set that, as well as the early career development of Karl and Paul, were more interesting to me than turning and turning later, some of which are difficult to track and / or slightly raise credibility. There is an unpleasant violence. Returning to the positive side, the cinema was very good. Film is worth a visit, but maybe it does not require. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival, April 28, 2002.
