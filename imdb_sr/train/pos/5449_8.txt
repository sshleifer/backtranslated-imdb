Did you know that Anthony Kiedis (singer from Red Hot Chili Peppers) in this movie. Blackie Dammit, Anthony's father.

I thought, "Well, that guy looks like that guy from a movie I saw in the 80's, then I read more and said his father was an actor who had a few small roles. After checking this site and comparing it with I shouted on the Internet , I realized that this is actually his father in the movie, it's funny, because nowhere in the book does he mention that he is in this movie. I think his father, Blackie, did a great job in the show.
