Although this film is not classical even after a single stretch, it's very fun, as far as I remember. I saw him about 15 years ago at HBO and I liked the movie. It was written by the same person who wrote and directed "Arthur" and although not as funny as the film, he shows the potential that Steve Gordon has achieved with "Arthur".
