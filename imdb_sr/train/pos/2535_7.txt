Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) reveals Radium Ks - a powerful force used for atomic energy. Unfortunately, Rukh is contaminated with Radium and begins to shine in the dark - and his touch causes instant death. Dr. Felik Benet (White Lugosi) develops an antidote - but Rukh starts to crash over Radios and Antidotes and moves to kill whatever he considers to be wrong. The "effects" that make Karloff glow in the dark are funny, but this is still a fun little cooler. It starts fast, has a great atmosphere (notice Rukh's "house" and the film begins in a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. There is a good acting Franz Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So that's fine, but just below all the other Karloff / Lugosi movies. The plot is too embarrassing for me to swallow. Still, I behaved like this. I'm giving him 7.
