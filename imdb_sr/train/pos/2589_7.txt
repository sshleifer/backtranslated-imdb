Brothers with psycho-kinetic powers (yes, indeed) do not only fight for Debra Vinger's inclination, but rather the secret of their childhood that left them in conflict over their power. There are surreal touches (fire brigades that act like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor, wit and romance. Soundtrack is also great. And similar to the way the American Werewolf in London used every big wolf song they could get with a fire, and I do not think I'll ever forget Dennis Kuaid (mmmmm Dennis Kuaid), putting his trailer on the rock too. a lady '~ priceless;) The best line is missing in the section kuotes btv ~ "When you had a clown, you never come back!" I love this movie (I just ordered a DVD from the US) and if the comments written by the type of people who would be happier with Legalli Blond 3 would not put you off ~ try it :)
