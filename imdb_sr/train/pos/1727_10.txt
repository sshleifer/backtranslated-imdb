A wooden horse is a very clever film about a very smart and successful escape plan made by British prisoners of war during the Second World War. She is well-behaved with a distorted sense of humor, especially with the lines expressed by the acidic languages ​​of Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks at Mari Poppins) are as beautiful as two heroes. The direction is tense and fast moving. Recommended.
