This is a really cool movie! I remember seeing her for the first time when I was really young and I watched him all the time like once a week ... Shadov was my favorite character in the movie. Homevard Bound is really funny and it's really cool how to train animals to do all these things. However, parts of the film are sad (as when Sassi, a cat, drops down a waterfall, and when the shadow falls into the hole at the end). First. Shadow is smart, Sassi is, well, Sassi, and Chance is a funny idiot. I recommend this film to anyone who loves comedy or talking animals. This is one of the top ten favorite movies!
