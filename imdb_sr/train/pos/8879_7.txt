*** SPOJLERI *** This film always looks excessive, as long as I do not remember my college campus had an ex-Nazi-racist assassin-ever committed-suicide. and his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. Look at it in the Vikipedia - I've added several photos to their article about him. It's hard to believe, but these things are really happening. I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristi Swanson, Jennifer Connelli and Mike Rappaport were good.
