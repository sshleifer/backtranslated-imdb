Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, a funny, gentle, brave and lover. He gives a superior dimension to a movie that is even a masterpiece, as well as other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) as well as a story or rhythm. It's never bored, it always creates new emotions: for me, the best French film of all time.
