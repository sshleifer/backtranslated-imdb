Animation always looks like a rim. In Japan this may not be the case, but in Europe and much more in the United States, the animation has a large fat tag "KIDS". France is probably one of the comical-liberal countries, a home of classics such as Tin-Tin, Asterik, Luckie Luke, Valereon and so on (if you have never read them it's not too late, they and they do not carry a nerd-stigma DC or Marvel) It looks like a natural movie like this pops in France. It corresponds to my pre-judged picture of France as artistic, anti-USA oriented and talented filmmakers. Fortunately, there is a "Scanner Dark" that wants to suppress this view - it seems that art is quite international. In any case, as you can see, the Renaissance is artistic and French. If you are a normal person, it will scare you. However, there is no need for that! Below is a cool, elegant look, and there's a good thriller and a good movie. It was one of my fears for this movie. It's so easy to convert a spectacular animation into a trick, just as Sony & C: o work with your Picard rip-offs. I was expecting a confusing, sometimes boring and not very interesting movie, but luckily I was wrong. In any case, I would enjoy neo-noar things, but it was good that it was worth it at that level. NOTE: I saw a French dub that was as good as I could see. English could be more interesting with Craig and others. Last word of praise for animation. It was great. A futuristic, well-created, beautiful camera, smart solutions (eyes, for example, looked very good, which is hard to do) and so visually stunning that I felt like it was so damn impressive! And again, I really love the animation and appreciate the effort that the studio has left, so my judgment is a bit biased. Good movie anyway, definitely lives out of your "trick".
