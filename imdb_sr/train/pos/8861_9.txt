Andy says: "No one will be hurt, everyone will win." Before he says that, we know that the opposite is true: Everyone is hurt, nobody wins. This is a new branch in American films, or perhaps the old group that has finally been made. Consider the "Eastern Promises," "The Beings of the Blood," "No Country for Old Men". These films are dark, serious, extremely well made and do not care for happy endings. I love them. "Before the devil knows you are dead" corresponds to a general description, but creates his own atmosphere. Debutant script Kelly Masterson is the closest Hollywood movie ever to reach the Greek tragedy. Honoring his fellow veteran director Stanley Donen, Sydney Lumet turns profusely and soberly into the extraordinary, school drama of character. The initial footage, although a thick bookkeeper who writes his trophy wife, has the look and feel of a Dutch master. On the contrary, the drug sale center looks more like a set of Mondrian. All the performances are great. The man Charles Finneia feels a little overwhelmed, his eyes wide open and rise almost all the time. But then it's in deep trouble, deeper than any of the problems that most of us will ever find out. To compensate, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But, of course, I do not need to tell you that. Why does Gina want her to be with a guy like Andy, never told to us, but that's fine. Action is nevertheless a character. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this fine film a masterpiece. Do not miss.
