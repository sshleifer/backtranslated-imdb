As I have noticed with many IMDb reviews, some critics seem to demand that every movie they see has self-satisfying intelligent plots that go hand in hand. I'm not one of those people. If I watch an action movie, I want to see explosions, shootings and heroism. If I watch a comedy, I want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. You got an idea. So I'm watching a horror movie, primarily I want to be scared. Grudge is a very frightening movie, in both well-executed 'jump' scenes, and it's a freaking picture. For many years I've been a fan of horror films, and I'm talking about masters such as Dario Argento, and not about the directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that were thrown out these days. If you want to be scared, watch this movie. Worse than the original Japanese 'Ringa' (which I also think is a great movie).
