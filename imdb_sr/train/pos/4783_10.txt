"Straight Story" is a really wonderful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who rides his country mower to visit his alienated brother who is dying. But it's just a basic synapse ... this movie is much more than that. This was Richard Farnworth's last role before he died and will definitely be remembered. He's a stubborn old man, unlike many old people that you and I probably know. Straight Story is a movie that everyone should look at at least once in a lifetime. She will reach and touch some part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will do so.
