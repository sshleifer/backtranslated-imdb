Get ready for this: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm relatively unaware of other works by David Mamet (writer and director), but after watching this movie half a dozen times (I'm always glad to watch), I can without hesitation say that he is a genius. This film is extremely well written, and quickly attracts you to your mood of scams, con-artistry and crowds in the background. The feel of the film is very similar to the film The Sting (1973) and honors the film's night. It's a pretty psychologically complex movie and will surely tell you to think about different complications and motives. suspicious characters. Sometimes it's a little predictable, but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch. In general terms, the acting is great - especially Joe Mantegna - but someone I watched the movie with me noticed that it's not a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) which is not only a gambler, a smoker and a thief, but also a sports hairstyle of the bad 80s. I agree, but I think she is still outstanding in the role. The less you know about the plot of this movie, the better, just like Mamet's latest film, The Spanish Prisoner, because the end will be even more impressive. Just fall back and be ready to drive a film that comes dangerously close to brilliance.
