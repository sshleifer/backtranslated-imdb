I saw this movie after watching Paltre version. I found that one was very good, and I thought it would not be that good ... but I was wrong: the British version was much better and better! I discovered that Jeremy Northam is "more pleasant" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong catches much better Austen's Knightlei. In any case, both versions are good, but anyone who loved Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with * caaling *: Andrew Davies has changed a few things, but still remains authentic to the original. 10 of 10 <br /> My 2 cents!
