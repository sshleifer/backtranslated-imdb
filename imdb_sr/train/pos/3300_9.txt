Pakeezah has a very interesting history (well documented in the 'Trivia' section) about how it became. It seems as though the fate struck to test Kamal Amrohi (director) while at the same time secretly wanted to see how she was finishing her masterpiece. As a result, the intensity with which the emotions emerge reaches a dimension that does not have to be very real, but is very effective and leaves the spectator's influence. alone. Other stars of the film, beside her, are Ghulam Mohammed (music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background) and Joseph Virsching (d.o.p). Their music and cinema are silent. Pakeezah is a classic in world cinema. It reveals new layers to you every time you look again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and left us a gift.
