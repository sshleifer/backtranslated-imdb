BASEketball is one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen. It's an off-the-wall movie starring South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Most of the gags are really hilarious, but the funniest part of the movie is when players try to "throw out" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things. One drawback of this film is that the speed is too fast and after I've been watching for about half an hour, I found myself wondering "Wow this already?" Another hilarious part of the film was that Joe and Doug were continually harassing Skueak, a boy who was rising. BASEketball is a comic classic with several highly quoted lines, and it's very fun to watch!
