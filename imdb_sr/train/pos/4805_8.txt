When I first heard about this movie I thought it would be like Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Ioung Victoria I knew it would not be just a solid film. Almost everything in this movie is great, costumes are truly incredible, and the settings are also beautifully captured. The only thing that really disappointed me are performances. Emily Blunt (Devil Vears Prada) is a star of the movie, bringing Victoria to life and showing this movie as a great actress and maybe chooses her first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost mild as Prince Albert, but he has a great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettani is also solid as Lord Melbourne, although I expected more of him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson have auxiliary roles, but they forget. It seems to me that the film is unfinished. Perhaps the screenwriters have changed too much of the scenario, but I do not know, but that's what I think about the movie. by Emily Blunt.
