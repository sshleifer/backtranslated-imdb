SPOILER ALERT! This film, Zero Dai, gives the inside to the lives of two students, Andre and Calvin, who feel anger and hatred towards anyone and everything related to school. They go on a series of themselves Thinking of "missions" that lead to a vast mission, which is a zero day. The content of zero days is not determined by the middle of the film until the end of the movie. The viewer knows that he is serious and filled with hatred, but he is never quite sure to the end. Now we all know, if the film is based on the Colombian massacre, the ending is pretty obvious. And the ending is no different than any other movie about the attack, they go and kill many of their colleagues in the end. I saw many movies on this attack, and this film is Far is my favorite and most respected. It gives the viewer and inside view of the life of these two teenagers who hate life, and honestly, gives the viewer something about understanding and closing on a horrible event. Only 7 years of exposed events, I never knew that shooting was serious until my English class was assigned an essay or a story about determining the moment in our generation. Well, I knew everyone would choose the twins, but I wanted to be different, because the twin towers were tragic and very definite, but I did not think it was the right choice for me, because there was no way \ t Relate to that I was only in the third grade and I had no idea what all that meant. But the shooting left an effect. I remember the interview, the sky, the look at school, and the injuries and terror in the eyes of thousands of people. This film is powerful, down to earth and a terrible masterpiece, and I would recommend it to everyone.
