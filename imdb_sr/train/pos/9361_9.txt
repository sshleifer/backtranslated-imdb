Reign Over Me (titled after the song) is a movie that will surely bring tears to almost everyone. It was a shocking story about a guy (sandler) who lost his family in the attacks of the World Trade Center from 9-11. Years later, he encounters an old chemist who does not even recognize the post-dramatic stress that caused the loss of his family. The two flashed their old friendship and Cheadle's character, Johnson, realizes that he must get Sandler's figure, Fineman, some help before it's too late. time. It's worth watching, even after I look at it, I'm sure the viewers will appreciate more of his or her family.
