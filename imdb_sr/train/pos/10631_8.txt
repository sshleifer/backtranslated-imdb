This film was seen by my wife and I when we came out in 1978. That was our revelation. We actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children. Obviously, we made a mistake. Love can come from where you do not expect and you may not want it. But we both chose that love. And no, never changed our sexual orientation. Such things are for Christian fools. When we were young we both had jobs, but never with the opposite sex. As we grew older, we stopped having extraordinary jobs. This story is not far away. However, the suggestion that heterosexuals have become quite unrealistic. My wife and I slept together for 40 years. We're still gay. End of story.
