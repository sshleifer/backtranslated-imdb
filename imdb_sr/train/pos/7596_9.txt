The first episode immediately left a good impression of what can be expected of the series! Mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! I love the fact that they are gradually discovering stories of characters! I'm just explaining enough to stay awake! Of course this performance has some drawbacks! In the first two series there are some characters who for some reason do not appear in the third season! Many characters have decent sending, but some of them just are not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe he'll be back in later episodes! But that's a little inconsistent! What is said "Lost" manages to excite each episode (especially the first two seasons)! It's very hard to do! I noticed that in the third season, the focus is more on character development than on the mysterious aspects of the show! This is not a bad thing! It even saves some episodes of the boring! One of the elements that can be considered the power of this performance are wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But in the end, I will want to see some mysteries that need to be resolved and finished! The danger of canceling the "Lost" due to the declining rating is close! And that would be devastating!
