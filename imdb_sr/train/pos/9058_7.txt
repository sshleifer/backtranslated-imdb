I read the book in the 5th grade and now a few years later I saw a video. There are several differences: 1.Billi's Oringinalli assume that he eats 15 worms in 15 days and not 10 worms in one day until 19:00. 2.Billi I assume we get 30 bucks after eating all the worms. In the film after Billy ate all the worms, Joe must go to the worm school in his pants. 3. Joe assumed to lie some of the worms, but the movie does not work at all. Although there are changes, this film is still the one where children will enjoy.
