A wonderful early music film by Rene Clair, as funny and funny as his "The Italian Strav Hat". Using sound in an expressive manner, and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair has influenced early musicals in America (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). It should (but not) be seen by all the cin√©files, and the DVD from the criterion is just as good as you would expect. There are no tons of accessories, but most of the DVDs I've seen are useless, and I never saw Clair's disc on the disc. Take it while it's still there.
