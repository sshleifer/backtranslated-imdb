One of my favorite movies I saw in Seattle. Tom Hulce was incredible, without a word they can convey his feelings / thoughts. I actually sent Mike Ferrell some donor money to help distribute the film. Good. The system says I need more lines, but I do not want to give out graphics. I was in the audience in Seattle with Hulce and the director, the writer I think and Mike Ferrell. They talked about an hour. Not quite a dry eye in the house. Why Hollivood is still stupid I do not know. (I actually know, it's our fault, let's look at what we're watching.) So you get what you pay for the guys. Take this and look at it with someone special. It's a gem.
