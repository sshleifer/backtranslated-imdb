Nicholas Ball and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) are buying an old house where brutal murder happened many years ago in a very bad state with the intention of returning it. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley) and become friends of their neighbors Jean (Patricia Mainard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, at home, there are spooky events, including the death of Sophia's cat. In Sofia's birthday celebration, the tube passes through the blood and they leave the city, revealing the secret later. House of Horror. A fantastic craft, secret discovery and a tragic conclusion are really great. My voice is eight. Address (Brazil): "A Casa Kue Sangrou Ate Morrer" ("House That Blewed Death")
