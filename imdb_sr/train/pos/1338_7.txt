The year 2000 was a bad year for Indian films due to lack of quality and imagination of film directors. Except Mohabbatin and Kaho Naa Piaar Hai, nothing stood out. The CCCC had a lot of controversy over the financing of the film, and the fact that it did not really know what the film was, generated good publicity and advanced sales of tickets for the film around India and abroad. The only information was that it was a thriller. The film was released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly good. The main conspiracy is related to surrogates and is well handled. Salman and Preiti give good performance in which Salman does not take his shirt at all ... there must be special effects !! Early plays Salman's wife, but this is a somewhat less demanding role than Preiti who plays a prostitute who eventually becomes a surrogate mother. The three main traces confirm, after Har Di Jo Piar Karega, they have a solid screen and chemistry of the screen (looks). Salman Khan, a great player, plays a serious role in the film as a successful businessman and pity exploits himself as a vanity comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the Mumbai film industry partly because of the films he chose. The character's character does not know that Pretty's a prostitute to the end ... this is guarded from her and the rest of the family ... you need to discover the rest because it will destroy the movie if I tell you. The songs are well recorded, especially the children's valon and the main title song. Other supporting actors make minimal but fine efforts as a family that loves Salman. Abbas Mastan made a hit and processed the movie object tactically .. I say go and watch it or rent everything you love!
