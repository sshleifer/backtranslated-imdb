Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, it is a series of fans made available only on the web, and it contains mostly friends and neighbors who have computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines so that, as Mickey & Judy once said, they put the show. They are definitely friends and neighbors. Many of these people are not the most beautiful people you've ever seen, or the youngest, or the thinnest? some of them slam their lines as if they were walking around the balls? some of them have thick accents, or simply do not look good, at first glance, although it's virtually impossible to grasp the single word they speak. Still, you have to admit, for everything your friends and neighbors have put together, it's actually fun to watch. Yes, some dialogue is a hockey game. Yes, it's a little weird (although it's also a bit cool) looking at the two kisses of the Starfleet men (although it seems that some scenes of kissing go on and on.) Yes, you are a bit lazy when clearly stated ST: TOS, LPG, other shows and movies, or when you hear a theme from Galaki Quest that is played at the beginning and end of each show. Okay. We can get out of it. Why? Graphics is the first speed. Better than almost everything you saw. And sometimes the show or two really stand out? Some of them are really real tears. Hidden boundary is total satisfaction in every sense of the word? but you need to give people who have included a loan where the credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to make the production of this size. People, sets, costumes, graphics ??? this is a huge effort on many parts of the people. We look, we go back and thank them.
