Tour tour! OK, the kid who plays Oliver is a bit too cute! Beginning with great cinema, color, costumes and the most impressive performances, this is a movie that must be seen. I've seen several adaptations of this great novel, but this one stands above all of them and his musical lifelike! It's Master Fagan, who never leaves his character to do the song. You never know whether you like it or not, the same feeling as in a book. In other versions, you hate him from start to finish. Bill Sikes .... when you read the book, he's evil, so he's in this movie. Oliver Reed was a master. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went and saw his latest film, Gladiator, based on his many fine performances, not seeing a headliner. Music matches weather and mood. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You should!
