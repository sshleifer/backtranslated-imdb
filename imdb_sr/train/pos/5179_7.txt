The Indian Summer is a warm, multi-layered movie that will make a fine afternoon movie (with a bit of editing). The film begins in the past with a group of children who are portrayed as los, which perfectly sets the tone before it cuts into the present, when a group of adults from the "golden age" of the camp is again invited to spend several weeks of rest by the head of the camp, Uncle Lou. The film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as he recalls his time in the camp and forms new memories in his latest stay. Film succeeds in a great way that transmits its characters in this marvelous ambience, and allows them to evolve without worrying about plot development. Watching these people is reminiscent of this, and their relationship with each other is what is in the film and why it works well. Never goes to the top and melodramatic, always retaining its warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a movie in which nostalgia is so well caught, and I found myself drawn into it, although I have never been to one of these camps as a child. For a warm, nostalgic film, I sincerely recommend.
