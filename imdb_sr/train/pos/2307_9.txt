I must say that this film is truly amazing and cordial. Reese Vitherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not so bad! It's so sweet watching Dani fall in love and break my heart, and at the same time warm my heart while looking at the court in love with Maureen. However, it is even easier to watch how much he cares for Dani. I must admit that I wanted to eventually fall to Dani. It's just so cute watching her fall for him, but I did not want her heart broken so badly. but the biggest tragedy I've ever seen appeared in this movie. watching him die, I cried all day. I just could not believe it. however, no kind of affection has ever been shown in the film than Maureen and Dani. they can really go through anything. I'm giving this movie 9, because I did not want the court to die, but it's still one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
