When I first saw this show, I thought it looked interesting. I watched him, saw how he was spinning around Sarah, as the character sees the world ... who is turning around her. I realized, but he did not laugh much. On the stage and in her show, she is racist, rude, impersonal and very self-centered. At first I did not get it, and I took it all. Then I had to see her movie, Jesus is magic. I think it served as an example to Sara Silverman for me, explaining to me only which 'language' is spoken. She's like Marilyn Manson, working so hard to give us a face of terrible ideas and images, but in the end realize that it's not an attack, it's a statement. And once you understand this, you will discover that you are grateful that someone finally gave you the right. I do not think you suggest that only smart people will understand, or that you hate this show to prove your idiocy. Although I love many 'smart' shows, I still do not see humor Curb Iour Enthusiasm. I got the impression that this is good, but I just do not understand. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad I finally came. The creators of this show are working hard, each episode is filled not only with dialogue and complication, but with songs, or dream sequences, production numbers. These people do not make something that would fill the time and satisfy the advertisers, it seems they are on the mission to make the best shov, which can be put together. If I could predict the future of this show, I would say it will go in the way Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled before the time comes and lives in the hearts of the fans and on the DVD. But, take your heart, the creators of the SAA, your audience is there, and we will watch as long as they allow you to make a show.
