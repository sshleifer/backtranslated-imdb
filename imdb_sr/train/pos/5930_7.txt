The monstrous mother-son-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) is a shadow of the life-force of virgins, and their latest target is beautiful but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratches ... I've never been a fan of bad, overestimated bestsellers like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by Mr. Dung, is not nearly as close as it could be. Yes, sometimes it's horribly terrible, but in fact there are some surprisingly impressive touches: a good old-fashioned cemetery, a creepy sound record and a light-gothic house, a mirror that shows the monstrous form of villains, etc. Of course, the film is polluted by the angry dialogue of the g. Dung and the obsession of all-tactics-to-vc-seats to humiliate obese people, which leads to a totally meaningless paddle of the rapist's teacher, but there is also the rose between the manor.
