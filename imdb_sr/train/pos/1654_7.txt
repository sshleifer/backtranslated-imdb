The Sapphire Little Kai Francis, a married woman (Kai Francis), who works at a local kiosk, performs as the lead lady in her local hall, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When it comes to sex, it's important to have a real blast! Knows how to choose socks to match his suit is light on his feet knows how to choose socks to match his suit is light on his feet knows how to choose socks to match his suit what is needed, but "experience" to become a great star. Her husband reveals and strikes a guy who led to an unexpected death of an actor - leading to a murder trial and even more unexpected: life imprisonment for a husband. The next thing you know is that you joined the Burleskue traveling show hoping to get to Broadway one day and earn enough money to get human freedom - as long as the baby sleeps in the trunk! This film has a rather interesting plot, maybe a bit strained, perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all * greatly * enhanced by the strong, emotional performance that is Kai Francis - she's just making this movie. It also helps here well-played actress Minne Gombell in her role of "older forty" older ladies working Burlesque and acquainting with Kai. Worth to see, especially for fans of Kai Francis.
