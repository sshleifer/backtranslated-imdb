Neil Simon had a sense of dialogue and nowhere is it more obvious than the lines given to VALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON as the opposite types in THE ODD COUPLE - a mixture of comedy and sadness that completely depends on the credibility of two such disagreeable friends apartment. Lemmon is a founder of Felic Ungar, succumbing to suicide after divorce from his wife and reluctant to share a flat with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with some disastrous results. It seems that everything Felix says and drives the Oscars to the wall, and none can stand in the way of others, because Oscar is the most generous man imaginable, and Felic just the opposite. The most entertaining scene for me was when the giggle Sisters of the Pigeons in the apartment above them were visiting for dinner. The worthless interaction between Lemon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put you in the seams. Talented nude pigeons are the girls who voted for Gabble's sisters (a pair of geese) in Disney's ARISTOCATES, and here - their comedy time at the top of Lemmon's sad story of desperation is enough to turn the film into a hurry - where there is a lot of time. If you are Neil Simone's fan and enjoy other treatments on the screen of his work, this should not be missed. Matthau and Lemmon were perfectly acting (although they thought about exchanging roles before the beginning of the recording) and, of course, it's easy to see why he later became the most watched TV show. In short: Top Simon comedy, must not be missed.
