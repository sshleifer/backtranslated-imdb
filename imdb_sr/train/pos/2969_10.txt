This film is about two guys who made a sport on the spot trying to get 2 hot chicks. BASEketball becomes a national sport. Joe Cooper (Trei Parker) is a beloved captain, but he hates it when he loses the NBA from another rival team. She meets the girlfriend of her dreams, Jasmine Bleeth, and finally kisses her. The first time I saw this movie, I moistened my pants so funny. it definitely has to be seen for all fans of comedy. If you love South Park, you will like this! Perhaps not looking at the kids, it's a little unsuitable for little guys. some dudes give him 6 1/2 of ten, I give him 11 out of ten. I like the cage, he has to go, hi, thanks for reading this
