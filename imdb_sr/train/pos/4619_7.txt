First, I am a big fan of the 80s movies, as well as Jennifer Conelli. So yesterday I entered the local books and movies store and found a VHS copy. I read my back and sounded good for $ 3.99, it was good. So I took him home and put it in the VCR. What a sweet movie! In my age, now I'm more concerned with movies like "Last Night" or "St. Elmo's Fire," but I remember being 15/16 and in love with an older guy, etc. We are younger. And if it fails, we are broken hearts and we think that we will never overcome it. But of course we are. Many times. It's the kind of sweet quality I really got from this movie. Feel "Oooh! I remember when something like this happened to me ..." is all that. The characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend it to anyone who loves movies from the 80's, especially teenage films, or anyone who just wants to come back and remember a simpler time in their lives.
