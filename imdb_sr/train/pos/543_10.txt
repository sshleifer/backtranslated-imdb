This film is the best horror movie, bar-none. I love how Stanley just puts women in the lake. I've been a fan of Judd Nelson for many years, and he's been taking me away. It's a combination of horror, drama and romance, not so much comedy. His evil, yet charming look captured me right then and there. That look in his eyes, I'll never forget. There is something in it, I can not describe it.
