This magnificently swollen melodrama is Douglas Sirk in his most powerful stream. It avoids the soft comforts of "All That Allows Heaven" and the sentimental sentimentality of "the imitation of life," and instead goes on with feverish sorrow and overheated tension. And of course, everything is trapped in a living Technicolor. The story of the ball is related to the friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack, which becomes a rivalry when Hudson touches Lauren Bacall, but who really is paying attention to the story? Dorothy Malone won the best actress award for her brilliant acting performance as Stack's sister, who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will. The highlight of the film comes when this wild wild child enters an angry dance in her bedroom, unable to bear the restrictions placed on her by the middle class. As is often the case in Sirkins' films, the scene is unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity, yet again unusually touching in its effectiveness. and high eyebrows at the same time in the same films. His was a unique talent, and I do not know if he was still a film director since then. <br /> <br /> Rating:
