All I can say is, if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, then you're not a man! Even after I first watched it, I was hooked. It's an enchanting experience that's hard to describe, as I'm sure other fans will confirm it. After watching, you will cry, thinking that these two lovely ladies are no longer with us. At least we have Grey Gardens to remember them! I think we all have to have the long independence with which these two ladies were distinguished. Although I have always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she does not remain in your heart like Big and Little Edie. What a rare delicacy knows such people; I just want to have it!
