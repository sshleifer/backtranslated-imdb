Warning: contains a spoiler. A corny plot and in many cases a terrible acting. Fontaine is great, but some others, especially Richard Nei, Ivy's husband, are extremely wooden. Nejj lies in bed, dies of arsenic poisoning, with every hair on the spot. Still, the film is so juicy and so tense. More faithful books than most movies of their time. He threw Joan Fontaine as a poison (and the adulterer, who was shocking at that time - I was not kidding, children) was a masterpiece. She's just the usual Joan Fontainei. As the killers needed, she dies by falling "deepest legs through the floor into an empty space".
