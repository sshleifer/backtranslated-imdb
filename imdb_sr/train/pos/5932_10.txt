Stephen King's best film with IT, although this is more fun than frightening. This has everything: <br /> - an excellent actor with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a fun comedy from the King himself; - A well-dosed horror in a funny story; -Great use of music, especially Santo & Johnny's "Sleepwalk"; nowhere village; - a lot of humor. You can not be very scared because it's too fun at the top; - But really nice effects of makeup as they no longer work! 4.5 rating: I do not really understand. When was the last time a horror movie was fun like this one?
