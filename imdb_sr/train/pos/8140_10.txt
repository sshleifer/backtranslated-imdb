I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemi, NVA and other early raps and I saw CB4 in theaters. In any case, the promo for me was captured by the eye, and I wanted to see what it was about. Well, I immediately knew from the stick that it would be good (WARNING!) And I was right. The parody song makes this film worth watching over and over again (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie is great. You have to love the satire rap group (obviously NVA), a certain rapper (Eazi E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of three members of the NVH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It's a shame that this movie did not get a credit, because the CB4 overshadows it during their releases, but in my opinion it's a much better movie. If you know it as a 'gangster' of the 90's, you'll be watching for a long time and laughing with this movie. If you do not do or do not like 'rap', you will enjoy jokes at the expense of the genre.
