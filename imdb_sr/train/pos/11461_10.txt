In addition to all this, this movie has risen above all my expectations, this masterpiece of the cinema of history portrays excessive use of shit filters in the best edition! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a brotherly conflict with everything he needs. As usual, a woman shows her true intentions. The end came just as surprising as the murder of Keith Scott from his older brother. The scenes in the 'viking land' are just as I recall from the early journeys. - To be honest, my strong passion for trash films makes me have this in my never-ending collection. I recommend this film to all people who are in love with the fastest brother who played from One Tree Hill. -Odin-
