I loved this film all my life. It's such an intelligent story, with many classic allusions. e.g. The ship that disappeared for decades was called Bellerophon. Well, in classical mythology, this was the man who killed Chimera, a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures. In the FP, Valter Pidgeon is a clear chimera - and his Id monster. I love movies where writers clearly attributed the audience a bit of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbusters who spend $ 150 million on special effects, but about $ 1.50 per script. /> Cheers
