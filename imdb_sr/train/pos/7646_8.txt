This film is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices I have made and how my life will change that my choices are different. It is played precisely in the theory of "Multiple universe". The only thing that does not sound true is that Larry Burrows (James Belushi) has such a difficult understanding of what's happening, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
