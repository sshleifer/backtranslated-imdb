This film is very hilarious and has a great compilation of actors like Villiam H. Macchi, who always has such roles, maybe his most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney, who is a very good actor who shows his comic work in the film Cohen Brothers "Oh brother, where are you?" The result is one of my favorite movies ever! But it was difficult to find "Welcome to Collinwood", here in Mexico. In my city, there are no good places to buy good movies. I tried to buy it on the Blockbuster, but they do not know it by their original name, so it might be a little easier to find if I have a name given to me in Mexico, does anyone know? I do not remember! Cheers. A.
