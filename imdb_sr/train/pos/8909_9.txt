This is pretty well known, so I will not get too far into it. The basic story is about two teenagers who learn about a giant extraterrestrial clump that comes to Earth through a meteor. Human contact with this muddy sphere burns through the acidic acid. It also absorbs human bodies, so it grows. Nobody trusts the teenagers (Steeve McKueen and his girlfriend) and when it finally does, it seems that the blob can not be stopped. It's really well done for your age and unlike many other 50 moves, the pace is pretty fast. The story is very unique and it makes it unavoidable for any fan of old movies about fantastic and fantastic movies. If you can dig up a bitter horror from the 80s, be sure to check out the '88 'remake.
