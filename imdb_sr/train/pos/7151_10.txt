I read holes in the 5th grade, so when I heard that they were doing a movie, I was delighted! Of course, since I was busy, I did not get the chance to watch movie in cinemas. The holes were in the outskirts, but, alas, we were too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen him, and none of them invited me! Everyone said it was good, but I read great books that made shitty movies, so I was definitely worried. Suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it. That week it came out, and my parents went on a cruise, and I remained to guard the children. My sister, who is 9 years old, I watched her and absolutely loved it! Then I took him to the other people I was guarding at the house for babies, and their children, 9 and 4, also liked it. Even my parents loved it and they are definitely critics of the film. All in all, I recommend this film for anyone who understands family morality and loves hilarious game! This film should be at the top 5 "to see" the list !!!!
