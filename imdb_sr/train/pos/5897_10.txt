This film should be put on DVD. It was so funny and I liked it. Really, really sweet and fun. It's not real, but it should not be. The only thing I did not like was that the girl was too reliant on him. It is a way of thinking about the time period. I'm trying to get this movie for so long that it was unavailable for the US format only in the UK and will not play on US DVD players. This is unfortunately an exaggerated classic movie! Believe it or not, but this movie could easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. Too bad, we do not legalize certain things that really could save small countries or ours. Lindy is an indispensable, positive character that makes lemonade lemonade. She's funny and charming. She stole the show!
