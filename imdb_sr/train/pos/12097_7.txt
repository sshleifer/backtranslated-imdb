This complicated story begins quite simply, with an English journalist who accepts a bet from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he can not spend the night in the haunted Blackwood Castle. There the writer wandered in dusty rooms and corridors, until his music and the view of the waltz were taken into an empty room. He sits on the harpsichord and begins to play the melody he has heard, and is surprised that he stunned the incredibly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood on his shoulder. He informs him with a vague charming / spooky way that he prepared his room on the floor and it is always expected that this night ... Night of the dead. So begins the stunning series of supernatural events that confuse the journalists by the end of the night. SPOILER BACK: Probably not surprised too many viewers to find out that lovely Elizabeth is actually a ghost. This does not prevent him from falling in love with a journalist, but for them it makes it more complicated than for an average couple. This is a fun movie, with absolutely everything: ghosts, spooky castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence (although both have been relaxed in a version that most Americans saw over the years). Attractive, enchanting Barbara Steele is the main reason to see . She has strange charisma unlike any other that you've ever seen in movies. Recommended!
