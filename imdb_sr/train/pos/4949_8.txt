10 FACTS OR LESS is one of those 'under radar' images that are soaked in the simplicity that most independent films have: honest, ad hoc performances of their two names - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega who establish a rather complementary, if not probable duo. The great thing is that this whole movie looks incredible in spite of its roots 'road movie'. As an unnamed character, Morgan Freeman comes physically (not physically) to meet this jaded check-out girlfriend who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor (who also accidentally copes with her husband who plays in Bobbi Cannavale's role) is somehow left we testify more than we conclude and their witty joke - two people on the opposite sides of society - is deceptively simple. So, briefly, until there's a bang! the moment of the discovery of the Earth, this film is a strange piece of mood that is otherwise lost in the Indian movement that came out in 2006, but deserves to be seen, even for its sincerity.
