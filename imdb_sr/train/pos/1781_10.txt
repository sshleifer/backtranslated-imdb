... Romeo Division comes to change the paradigm. Allow me to say that I was short for this short film. I saw it by chance when I was in Boston at the Film Festival and since then I thank God for it. Indeed, I really believe I was part of the event, such as reading the Tarantino script before anyone else did or saw the first projection of the Mean Streets. or what the creative team has at its disposal for future products, but I hope they can be there for that. Again, truly incredible movie work.
