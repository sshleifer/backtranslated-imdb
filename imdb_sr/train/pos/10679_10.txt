The man about the house is a real situational comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy refers to a figure called Robin Tripp (played by Richard O'Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party, ending in the house of two women named Jo and Chrissi. Ironically, the party was held to get rid of their old roommates. Obviously it happens while it's moving. The man around the house was a pre-cursor on Cooke and Mortimer's spin off shov George and Mildred featuring two characters owned by Jo, Chrissi and Robin. These two characters would in fact prove to be the stronghold of a man around the house with Mildred (late and much missed Iooth Joice), especially taking some of the best lines in the series. A semi-regular character was a useless person who was always on the scruongge, Larry (Doug Fisher) and she just came in circle when he wanted to borrow something (and never return it). The Americans have the version called the three companies, but there is no way to compare it with this far more ridiculous original. Thames risked producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with two women in a very conservative time, but they should be concerned that estimates at that time indicate that some 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old-fashioned comedy with inspired castings and a sharp scenario. What damage modern comedy can not achieve this high standard. This program is available on a network DVD
