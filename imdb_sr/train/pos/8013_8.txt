Yes, it's another great magical Muppet movie and I adore them all; characters, movies, TV shows (this is the best comedy or music show ever) and all the artists behind it. But here they have made such a rare fatal error and I'm certainly talking about a strange ending !! I think it is very dangerous to engage so much in American drama and finish a love affair with marriage !! We, as well as all the poor viewers, feel so free or perhaps happy because of the lack of his anger, disgust and misery! We all enjoy these stories, which are gathered by two sweet heroes like a loving couple without a legitimate relationship such as Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So with all the previous couples and their lightings you feel safe, peaceful and peaceful. Therefore, when you look at what the creators of this film have already done, you will be crazy as I am! They have made poor poor creatures (Kermit) marry their nightmare, the most important woman ever (Miss Piggi)! This is a historical change in the measure of the American entertainment industry! And it was pretty normal to negatively affect an audience that only refused to bless or believe or to be happy with this sudden marriage (even a pathetic frog did not have the time or the appropriate opportunity to think or decide anything!). Therefore, it's no wonder you know that this movie is the weakest in their film seriousness, with just $ 25 million in comparison to 65 million that earned first (The Muppet Movie ?? 1979) five years earlier !! Simple in this movie have captured Manhattan, and my vacation too!
