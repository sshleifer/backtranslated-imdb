Perhaps there was no prize for the academy, though, it's pretty cheesy, but that's fun! Nothing makes me laugh like Bill and Ted. Ruthless, optimistic and hilarious, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. Death is a frippin hilarious and Bill and Ted are even more pleased. People mourn me because I love this movie, but only really pretentious filmmakers will say it's not a bit fun. If you like this, you will probably be a fan of Vaine's Vorld, Dude Vhere's My Car, and Dumb and Dumber. Admit, although you are stupid, they make fun of you and turn your tile box. So watch them just for blows and giggles !!
