"Panic in the streets" is a rather unknown little film by the director Elijah Kazan and was created before his classic masterpieces such as "The Tram called Lust", "On the Riviera" and "East of the Paradise". Kazan had already won Oscar in 1947, before this film, so at that time he was not completely unknown. However, "Panic in the streets" is mostly a movie that went under the radar. The great thing in this movie is the Oscar Scenario. It has a very good concept and excellent tense thriller material with the smell of elements of crime / film. The dialogue in this film is also absolutely magnificent and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. Palance in one of the first film roles. Especially Palance impresses as a gangster boss, with a very powerful face. Still, the film is a little dragged in some spots. The film starts very well, but after the start, the movie slows down and does not always make the right decisions in terms of the pace and viewpoints from which the story is apologized. Still, "Panic in Streets" remains a perfectly-watched movie, mostly because of the firm scenario and powerful dialogue that makes the movie persuasive to watch. For lovers of the thriller genre, this is a great movie for watching. 8/10
