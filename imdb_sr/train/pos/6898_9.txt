It's a face-to-face language from the very beginning with a voice that entertains everything that is French, and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Presented by the great Gerard Philippe, the young man who flew, fully believes in the fate of the damned ancestors Lollobrigida - in particular, he will marry the daughter of King Louis XIV. The problem is that La Lolo soon learns that she and she are in love with Fanfan ... Thanks to good fighting swords, kavalkadas and other lively action sequences, the movie is moving at a brisk pace and with many comic moments. Direction is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the film is so light and takes so non-serious that I could not give these shortcomings to another mind. Pay attention to Noel Rokueverta, a traditional French film, trying to steal La Lollo, causing discomfort and keeping the script to a pro-La Jolie reader! And what is the gem Marcel Herrand as a megalomaniac and lustrous King Louis XIV! That's not all: so many beautiful women in a movie make me wish I was in France and on the set in 1952! The film may have gone out that year, but his faith, face, beautiful narration, impeccable photography and unforgettable Gerard Philippe ensure that it is still modern and pleasure to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend to her grandchildren, let alone anyone who loves films in general, and especially bad guys! See it!
