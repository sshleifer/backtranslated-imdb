I would not be surprised that Soderbergh was under pressure to avoid Cuba becoming revolutionary as it was. Only reading a few statistics will fail with the younger audience. However, the first part, which almost completely fired in the jungle, conquers the feeling of that place, especially when crossing the mountainous regions of Cuba. I loved Del Toro's interpretation of personality Che Guevara. And the actor who plays Castra, Bichir, has also done a great job, against all looks. It is clear that Soderbergh does not look at these people, but it is also clear that he will not say that their case is "iankuis" far from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I read. As far as I know, Castro did not judge the Soviet Union until all attempts to accept the United States are exhausted. But with regard to other aspects, he is right, especially as regards the plunder by the emigrants while the island was under the control of other insurgents. The country's treasury remained empty.
