As this film is entirely on the Swiss dialect, for most German speakers it is difficult to follow this film. I am not from Switzerland, but I've been working there for several years, so I had the opportunity to understand this great evil Lord of the Rings. I've seen a lot of movies of this kind (for example, Scari Movie, a lot of Scifi podcasts, etc.), but this is the best I've ever seen. I give 9 out of 10. The only reason I can not give it is because there are few details that could have been done better and because they did not give any titles in any language on DVD so there's almost no chance for a non- Swiss to understand.
