I read the book and I have to say that this film remains true. I think this is the beginning of psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psyche. Cristina Raines gives a great performance as leading, and Burgess Meredith gives a great supporting actor as a neighbor. I've seen this movie at least twice and I think I'll buy a book and a movie for my collection. The tension continues to build up to the climate, a plant that you will never see. If you love movies such as Characters and Village, Sentinel will be a classic introduction. Also, what is interesting is the actors in the movie - you would not recognize them if you did not read credits. The late Jerry Orbach is excellent as a commercial director, and Jeff Goldblum is a great photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, who is underestimated but great.
