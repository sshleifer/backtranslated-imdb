Ghost Story (TV film - 1972) was a pilot for the NBC series. The film was well written and well-played, and I thought, when the TV season began 1972-73, if the TV series is half as good as a movie then NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie was available on the video !!) The series was a colossal disappointment - even with Villiam Castle. manufacturer. If, however, you have the opportunity to see the original TV movie, Ghost Story, check it out. You will not be disappointed.
