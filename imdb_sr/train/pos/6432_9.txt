Thanks to the smart script and the solid hand of writer / director Kevin Meier, "Perfect Alibi" is a fun and very cute mysterious thriller. The film begins methodically and creates a pair as traces start to discover that nothing is what it looks like. Terry Garr and Hector Elizondo are great as they unite to discover the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nora Charles, from the films "Thin Man". Kathleen Kuinlan is great as tortured wife Alek McArthur and the role of characters played by veterans actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsei and Estelle Harris are well made and provide many light moments at the right time. There is even comedy Rek Linn. All in all, I felt I was reading a good book next to the fire.
