No message. No symbolism. No dark underwater stream. Just a wonderful melancholy of music, nostalgia and good fun, which gathered people who obviously had a good time. It is a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious trash that invented the studies. Of course it's worth watching anything with the incomparable Judy Dench. A great jazz singing Cleo Laine is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. This goes to my movie shelf to get out again whenever I feel the need for warm experience and cordial good natural smiley. Just a wonderful movie!
