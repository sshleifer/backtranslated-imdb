First of all I tell you that before sunrise, like all movies, it's NOT a movie for all tastes. It seems that some people are less smart to acknowledge this fact, but it is incredible to think about some open trouble that this little harmless film generates from some people. For me, like most people here, before Sunrise hit me with deep accords, I was really amazed, pompous, inspired by it. This is a movie that ultimately brings more than one review. It creates some of the most unforgettable unforgettable feelings and emotions you can imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I have received from it. The film acts as a community of two fragile souls that begin to get to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspirational, not so much so that one conversation necessarily associates the next or the importance of the topics of Jesse's and Celine's discussions, but a little nuance, perfectly articulated responses that provoke one another. It records a sincere, romantic, yet short-lived human emotion that begins to flourish in a terribly elevated Vienna milieu; assures us that their long-term relationship could be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open to debate, but I never doubt that they will not again interact with one another. Accept and respect those who love this movie. Take a look and it can change your lifestyle.
