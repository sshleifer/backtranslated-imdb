Ok film about fracture syndrome. The mother has twins, one is very ill, the other is good, but there are falls. The mother does not think she can raise it to give it to some people who have 15 children! Mom does not like this and thinks she should be with her family (I agree) by taking her to court and the family breaks up and grandma and grandfather lose, it actually does not say whether Mom and daughter make up? I think this movie is good, but the plot is well known, it's still good and there are several unintended laughs!
