Believe it or not, in 12 minutes this film (for 1912) is a feature film. Very, very few films were longer than then, but this is definitely not what this strange movie differs from the rest! No, what's different is that all actors (with the exception of one frog) make mistakes ... yes, bugs! This simple little domestic comedy could have looked similar to productions like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Mak Linder, but instead, this Russian production uses bugs (or, I mean, models that look just like bugs). Chaplin and Lorel and Hardy have not yet been discovered and I assume that Linder was busy, so perhaps they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought incredibly well-and much more realistic than King Kong 21 years later! The film begins when the g. He goes to a rude club while his wife is allegedly waiting at home. But, unfortunately for Mr. Besides, he does not know this, but Ms. Beetle also leads a bohemian painter of a grasshopper. Of course, there is much more to this domestic comedy, but the shop is ancient and very fun for adults and children. Strange, but also very incredible and viewed.
