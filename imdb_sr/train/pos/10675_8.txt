For a long time I wanted to see this film, as an admirer and Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic underground plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines through this role. Thanks to the heavens for Turner Classic who broadcasted the show last week. I can imagine that there were many problems with children after the war, especially with the way things were in the 1950s. Some of the boys are a bit scary. I certainly would not want to meet them on a well-lit street, and even less in the dark street. There were some good insights into the feelings of a fire dragon, or as it is called, a firefighter.
