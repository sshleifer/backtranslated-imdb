I love movies and I own comics, comics are different from film, but I would still give it: 10 out of 10. It was great. If the movies became terrible. I'd have her babies. And I'm a woman. Read comics that you will not regret. Yes, in this film since when Brian P. the artist for her died, we do not get almost as good artwork. I do not mean you seriously misunderstand, these people have made great, but different versions for different people. Different moves for different people as the saying goes. Every guy who does not go to her is crazy, or does not like women, or you know only the plan for madness. If I could count on my fingers as much as I love and how many times I read the comics, I would surely have remained fingered, but it always has fingers.
