I'll keep this short enough not to ruin anything for you. This movie is great. From the beginning to the end, it is filled with true excitement. The scenes of the fight are fantastic, the scorching scenes are fascinating, and they move at such a pace that they really only feel slowly at the end when things are explained, but that's just because everything that preceded it. Damon is a shadow, and he really turned out to be a very solid actor, daring to not believe him in this role. He is this role. A complimentary addition to the series in David Straithrain (I hope I wrote so close to my right) as a disgusting agent of the CIA to kill Bourne. This is non-stop and will really leave you at the edge of your seat in most ways. Some things in the end are just a scammer's absurd, which denies the score 10. The ending is left open for the sequels and I hope that they will consider doing more than that, because none was bad. A great movie all in all and a fantastic ending of an incredible trilogy. P.S. The trembling camera did not hurt any action, but I still think we could have it without it. The good news is that you really notice it when people talk, not so much action.
