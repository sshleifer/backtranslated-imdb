Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I watched together "We want tanto amate" on the summer night: we liked it, but we did not like what we liked "Special Day". I believe Ettore Scola is rather underestimated: we often forget to remember him, perhaps because his latest films were disappointing. And so, yesterday evening, my mom and I were sitting on our sofa and enjoying this masterpiece. Writing, directing, cinema, stage design and production were sober and accurate, but what I liked most was chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They are both great actors and play the main roles of Antonieta and Gabriel. Antonietta is a housewife: married with a fanatic fascist, she has six children, but her husband wants to have another child to receive a reward for large families. Gabriele is simply anti-fascist. Together they spend a special day, that special day in 1938 when Hitler came to Rome visiting Mussolini. I do not want to ruin the plot again: go look for this movie!
