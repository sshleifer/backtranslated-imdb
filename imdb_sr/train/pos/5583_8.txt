I realized that at least a few people watched the TCM on September 2. If you knew Hedi had to change her name to avoid being associated with this film when she came to the United States. . I was watching because I just saw a documentary about "bad women", actors in the American Film Board in a film set in the early thirties. It seemed like they got out with much more than Hedia's "sensational" footage in "Ecstasy". In fact, Hedi looked positive in today's standards, and it was nice to see her early intact beauty. It was a nice, lyrical movie for relaxation. I loved what it was: a simple romance. I watched him after I first recorded him during the insomnia early March. I would like to see the first version published in the US for comparison.
