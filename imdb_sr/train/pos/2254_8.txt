Fok's epic lecture on one of America's greatest pioneering efforts comes to a DVD with some truly extraordinary "Ektras". BRIGHAM IOUNG ("Frontiersman" is added to the European edition), tells the story of a great pioneer leader who, under inspiration, brought members of the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after the mafia killed their prophet / The leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Purse), was brought to the screen in 1940, just as America should have entered World War II. It was a courageous move by the head of Fox, Darryl F. The craze and was the breath of the fresh air to the Mormon nation, because it was the first attempt of the film to positively show their faith on the screen. Now, Fox, working with James D'Arc, a curator of excellent film archives at Brigham Young University in Provence, Utah, brought this film to DVD format in a release that's far away. Mr. D'Arc, who made his doctoral dissertation a few years ago, gave one of the deepest songs ever made for DVD. He separates the facts from fiction and allows listeners to understand why church leaders have valued these films so much, although the decoration for the truth goes through the whole movie. One of the fun information is Dean Jagger, the acting actor. Many years after the film, he married a woman of the last saint and eventually went to LDS faith. Much can be learned from D'Arc's knowledge and it's great to have this as part of a DVD! The disk contains more than 100 images from the Fok & BIU archive, as well as clips of incredible premiere at seven theaters in Salt Lake Citia. Thank you FOKS on another great DVD - and thank you, James D'Arc for your excellent comment!
