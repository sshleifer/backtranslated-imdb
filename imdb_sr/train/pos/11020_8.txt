Director Rennie Harlin (Driven, Mindhunters, Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Master of Dreams) made a fun non-stop action picture. This film is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action picture with lots of dark humor. This was one of the biggest hits in 1993. This is one of Harlin's best movies. Lithgo is a great entertaining bad guy. Stallone certainly made a brief return of this sharp thriller. This is probably the best Harlin work as a director.

The DVD also has comments from the technical team. The DVD has behind-the-scenes function, two deleted scenes with the introduction of the director and much more. Do not miss this great action movie.
