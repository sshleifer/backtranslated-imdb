As one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Watching the movie without first getting to know the story does not take the film in any way. The characters have so much complexity, everyone can treat them in their own way. The brilliance of adaptation is that everyone is permitted to project their own perceptions on the lives of characters, instead of being subjected to an opinion. You can love them or dislike them, and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Beautiful performances by Ellen Burstin and Christine Horne truly bring characters to life. I would highly recommend it.
