I just saw this movie for the first time and I liked it. Her dance was very fun. I read somewhere that she got a role in this movie because she knew she was dancing. And the landscape was great. Ivona is such a talented woman and beautiful. We laughed at the stupid scenes of kissing, but that's what's great about old movies! I grew up with her on Munsters and I enjoy watching her in her earlier films. Perhaps they are not all the best there, but it's worth watching to watch her act and sing. I'm slowly buying all of her movies and watching them get them. I have a great collection of her souvenirs.
