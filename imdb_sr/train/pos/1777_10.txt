When I first saw the Romeo Division last spring, my first reaction was BRIEFLY! However, for future viewing, I got far more than mastering the film. This image has a unique voice that will echo through the history of the film. The introductory assembly provides a great palette that Helper JP Sarro uses to establish his art on this entertainment screen. Sarro really uses the camera as his brush while driving us on a ride that engulfs the audience in a huge action movie that goes beyond the traditional form we are accustomed to and deep in the dark issues of betrayal, revenge and the importance of socializing. This film is the dream of every director at the core. However, Sarro was not alone in this epic venture. The text given by Tim Sheridan's writer was equally breathtaking. The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such a presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically, the final scene (WARNING: SPOILERS! SPOILERS !!!) in which Vanessa finds out that one of the coalitions and villains all the time, is written in such a dark tone that he is one of the coldest finished I've ever seen. Sheridan is next Robert Tovn. In the last note, it is obvious that this production was not a small feat. Therefore, he must boast the producer Scott Shipleiu who seems to have the creativity and genius to follow Jerry Bruckheimer. I have never before been a witness of production that is so big with so much attention that is focused on every detail. Production work is one of the hardest in any movie, and Shiplei makes it easier. All in all, this film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterpiece. This is the art of film at its best. When the end of the film arrives, the only thing that is desirable is more. The Romeo Division is a revolutionary, masterpiece and, most importantly, the Romeo Division is truly an art.
