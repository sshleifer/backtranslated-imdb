If this film was shot only a few years later, I would have broken a point for two points because the sound quality was pretty bad. Sometimes the movie looked like a mute movie during the in-scene (normal ambient sounds are missing). But since it was in 1931 and a French film, it's pretty sorry. Especially because this is happening in later French films - as long as the sound difficulties should be fully elaborated (as in L'Atalanteu from 1934). , this is a cute little film about the missing lottery list and a long list of people trying to get it. And during the search, there are many incredible little songs that you can not help but love. A nice charming film all-in-all.
