Japan 1918. The story of a 16-year-old Riu begins with her father's death. How it will be discovered later, both of her parents have died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Riot's aunt has arranged a marriage with a Japanese man in Hawaii, whom they only know from his image. Her arrival in Hawaii reveals that her new husband is much older than in a photo, and that she lives in very modest circumstances next to the sugar cane she is working on. Riu did not get used to heavy work on the plantation, and in the despair of the situation in her new home, he was thinking about escaping. Soon he finds out there is nowhere to go. Friendship with Kan, her female associate, gives her new hope and strength. This picture is based on real events between 1907 and 1920, when thousands of Asian women were married to men in America, who only knew from their picture. This not so well known image was well written and worked. The location is stunning. This film also shows Mifune Toshiro in his latest appearance on the screen as Benshi (a silent movie narrator). This film gives insights into Japanese culture here and across the ocean. Must see!
