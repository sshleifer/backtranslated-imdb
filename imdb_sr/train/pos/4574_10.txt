Allow me at the outset to say that I have cerebral palsy and that I have entered this film, expecting that it will have to allow guidance. I left the theater half convinced that they acted as an actor who played the role of cerebral palsy, although I knew it was not the case. The performances were generally great, with a special focus on Brand Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I believe it's called) as young Christie Brovn. Kristi is talented, arrogant, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and rude - in other words, a man. This film, along with Gabi: True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are great views of life with the CP. In no case is a complete portrait, but fine examples of disabled people as human beings. Most recommended.
