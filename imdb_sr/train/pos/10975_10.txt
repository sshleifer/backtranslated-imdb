Daughters say poetry: "I can not go to another year. I have to go to the hotel room." "I lost my blue scarf in the sea of ​​leaves." "The marble faun is moving ... he just gave us the washing machine. That's the deal." "I am turned into dust by these latest things." "... arcoons and cats become a bit boring for too long." "... a little rat nest, a mouse hole I would prefer better." And there is wisdom in the mother's words: "... that pleasure is all mine." "This little book will keep me straight, just like the color." "Always someone has to do everything right." "Where did you come from, hell?" "... bring me my little radio. I have to have professional music." "I'm your mother. You remember me?" The relationship between mother and daughter is drawn in this magnificent film. This is a film about mother's day.
