Sharp, a well-made documentary about Mardi Gras pearls. I've always loved this approach to making a movie - conveying the idea of ​​a bigger, more complex and often unattainable phenomena by breaking the problem into something that is well known and close to home. I'm sure most people have heard stories about workshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and the impact of globalism on the poorer nations (no matter how people think about it). Instead of explaining this topic and meeting on a soap opera (not that something is wrong with this, except that such documentaries usually preach to the converted ones), this documentary simply shows Mardi Gras Beads, how they are produced, from which people, and under what conditions , and then how consumers use them at the end of the process. It explicitly and sharply explores the motivations of everyone involved in the process, including workers, factory management, US importers, and ultimately, consumers at the end of the chain. ; as well as the Mardi Gras revelers, but also the way in which workers in China accepted their situation as normal and a pair of courses (even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). A special impression was left by the street cleaners who finally cleaned the beads from the streets. But it was just my reaction; I see how someone else could read this documentary a little differently. Unlike other documentaries on this subject, I do not think you need to have any specific political opinion that could be affected by this. This is the end of the story of human beings and our relationship with the goods we produce and consume. If you've ever bought a product made in the Far East, that should give you something to think about. Extraordinary and highly recommended. We need to see more documentaries like this one. Honor everyone who is involved in making this movie.
