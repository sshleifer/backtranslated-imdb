The "Protocol" is a hit-and-miss picture starring Goldie Havn as a colorful cocktail waitress who rescues the life of a visiting Arab from one night's assassination attempts. The woman immediately becomes a famous personality and gets a new job working for the US government. Will the corridors of power in the capital of our nation ever be the same? Havn is as good as usual, though the "Protocol" is not so funny as her best movie "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I laughed a lot. *** (out of four)
