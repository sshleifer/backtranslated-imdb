I saw this film at the International Film Festival in Brussels. I also met the film director. I heard Ed Vood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thought it would be his masterpiece - his triumph. Well, if you take a movie seriously (as Mr Vood did), that's really one of the worst movies you'll ever see. And this is cool. The big joke and Vake Up Early The Dai I Died Diing is not even trying to be a decent movie. It makes the movie very, very good. The scenario is filled with nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. The role of Billy Zane is absolutely excellent. You see, this is either high art ... or low stupidity. **** / *****
