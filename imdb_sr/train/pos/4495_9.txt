Outside the household is a different world and the family struggles to cross the border between the authority of Dad and their hopes and dreams. Period is imprisoned; Bakelite light shuts off, Georgian floorboard, picture rails, wall paper, short skirts, brazen boys, mini van, shiny modern patterns ... The location is trapped; The wind is a ridge-covered stone landscape, the walls of local stone, communities, freedom. But there are many more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deception, machismo, manners, maturity, loss, poverty, victim , horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and parenting are here. (And without a certain order!). This film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are relevant today as before. The fact that some of them are not directly involved is a testament to themselves in relation to today's attitudes, but the fact that they are all here, testifying about acting skills, stories and direction. If there is something bad in this movie, it's that all this deeply rooted and beautifully carried tension is slightly too light towards the end. Maybe I do not understand - the fate and darkness that many teenagers feel are actually disappearing if they are being treated with it (**) - maybe the film is trying to send that message - it's good to work. Is the movie trying to say? Children: Parents are also young, parents are also struggling, all mistakes are made, everyone is learning, things change, the fight can be successfully completed. Parents: Do not try too! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well-being. Sounds Easy, Is not It? Sometimes the film feels so, but then notice how causing it and revealing it. Film is a classic. <br /> (**) - No problem.
