I did not have much expectations in the movie, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a very different role. He left hungry armani suits for a funny look and paid off proving he was a great actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play great with each other, and have made one of the best couples from time to time. Humor is dark, the appearances of Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are great, mix it with the touching element of the friendship story, and you have a great movie. This is probably one of the better comedies for a long time. This is a movie that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era of Brosnan's career.
