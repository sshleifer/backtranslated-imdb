This - and not a bit overestimated Southern Soap Opera - was the biggest epic that came out of Hollywood's greatest year, 1939. I will not repeat it obviously - Cari Grant, Victor McLaglen (who is Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. gives superior comic performance. However, I want to mention two more, less understandable elements of this masterpiece. The magnificent final battle, as the divine Sam Jaffe climbs hard to the climax of the temple to blow up his trumpet and warn the regiment, it's simply big. Never amazes me. Another underrated element in the film is the appearance of Eduardo Cianelli as Guru. This is not a Fu Manchu caricature, but well drawn, articulated, historically informed ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Mauria? He defeated the armies that Alexander left in the Great"). Indeed, you can see the parallels between this mystical, the evil nationalist and some famous personality of the thirties (German, not the Indian). Gunga Din, anti-Nazi tract? Not really. But still, a huge, fun, moving ep.
