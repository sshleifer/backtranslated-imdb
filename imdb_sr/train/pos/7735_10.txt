An excellent interpretation of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-nth thriller has all the necessary elements - a disordered ex-boxer who turned into a tramp, an alcoholic widow with an evil desire, a former policeman turned a small thief, and a plot for a hijacking set for failure. Still, the film never goes into the clich√©, but it remains fresh and intriguing. All performances are excellent, especially the role of Bruce Derne as the evil sweets, Uncle Bud. There is a tense uncertainty in the motion of a movie that, deliberately or not, adds to the dark process. Recommended.
