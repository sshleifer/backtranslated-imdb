No, this hilariously terrible clinker created for TV for the 70's is not a deadly demon dessert from desserts. However, this extremely awesome, but indisputably entertaining, and thus a pleasant cathode bumper reaches the peak of absolute absolute, tireless nonsense and cruelty that is quite tasty in such a cruel - it's - really - a terrible way. Richard Crenna, who looked exhausted and probably drunk, and Ivette Mimieuk, who behaves as though she had never overcome the brutal rape that she suffered in jail in Jackson County, slowly portray a disgustingly beautiful and honest suburban couple with her strange, boring little city of existence it breaks up when the sweet German Shepard accepts as a pet, it turns out that some ancient deadly evil spirit. Soon Mimieuk and her two rebelliously exhausting children, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (psychic extraterrestrials with Disnei's "Vitch Mountain") adore a gruesome crayon drawing of a nasty, ugly dog ​​enthusiasm. Boy, does not that sound really scary and disturbing? Well, scary and disturbing is ridiculously ridiculous, but it's certainly fun, thanks to Curtis ("Night Tide") Harrington's hopelessly weak direction, cartoon (not so) special effects, an almost painful risible'n'ridiculous plot, and a play that bravely fights with absurd story (in addition to traces, both Martina Besvicka and RG Armstrong appear briefly as members of the Satanic cult, and Victor Jori has a nice piece as a useful American shaman). The favorite scene: the malicious Mephestophelion mutt puts on Crane noise, practically forcing him to snap his hand into a wild sweeper. While snobboppy fans who suffer from snobbish disturbances can hold their noses on the perfectly brazen smell of this, though a stinking slap, pious fans of TV garbage should consider it to be disgustingly disgusting with the inside of a tube identical to Alpo.
