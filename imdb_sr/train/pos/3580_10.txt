I think a movie like this would not be published today. It takes time to present the depth of characters, and the action is not full of turns to keep you on the edge of the seat. But, what this film has: interesting to explore how families deal with grief. How will the language for healing and the resulting huge loss leave us silent, and instead we rely on raw emotions. Sorrow without reason and patience is rage, even hatred. And unfortunately, the main character (the young man who accidentally shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than his fair share. In the end, she leaves and moves to her grandfather (William Brimley) who tells him that this is by chance. I had the impression that this young man knew it in his heart, but he had to hear those words from his parents, and receive their forgiveness. There was a huge emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the movie allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors. Something we can not do with today's movies. <br /> <br />
