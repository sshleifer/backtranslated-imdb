While most people will watch a movie, it will be a little interesting, but of the hundreds of films dealing with magic and occultism in one form or another, this is probably the best in many ways. From Golem to Zanat the subject is immensely interested in the film industry. Most of the movies that touch her in any way make it childish (for example, "Honeymoon", a real piece of dedicated garbage in every way) or getting transcendental elements like cheap excuses for cheese special effects or villian cartons (cf "Varlock") . More often, the theme appears in a hysterical religious context (in various Revelation-oriented films, the antichrist is an inevitable advocate of some kind of New Age practice). It's rare that the film shows at least some transient experience with magic as it is practiced in real life, but the presentation of occultism in such films can best be described as allegorically, not literally, or symbolically, or ... Not exactly. I watched this movie again after many years tonight. I've already seen it on VHS; it's a dark, nasty piece, and after watching DVD, I would say that if you intend to watch this movie, watch it on a DVD, do not look at it on VHS. Dark and sulky are in VHS, but in DVD, the movie gets a completely different tone. I think Veir deliberately pushed the dark side of the style, but when the film turns into a VHS bottom color medium, it crosses the edge. DVD re-animates the movie and I saw it differently. In any case, looking at it as the first time, I realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie. It's hard to get into all the reasons why, I do not want to take the time to do it. For anyone who is curious, anyway, if you want to see how it is in real life, this movie is quite right at countless levels. And for anyone who is not, you've really spent a lot of time reading up to this point.
