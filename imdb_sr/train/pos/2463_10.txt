Villiam Shakespeare would be very proud of this special version of his drama. Not only is it the best movie version, it is also the only complete version of Hamlet. Hamlet Kenneth Branagha is simply brilliant. Not only because he wrote Shakespeare, but also because he had the courage to do the whole thing, even if only four hours passed. We all know the story of the Danish prince and his conspiracy to revenge his father's death, so I will not enter the details of this story. However, I will tell you that the best part of this Hamlet version is not a breathtaking or stunning photo set, but an interpretation of each actor. I doubt you will find a better Polonius than the great portrait of Richard Brier. In addition, you can not make a mistake with Julie Christie and Jack Lemmon. Also, Derek Jacobi, regular among Shakespeare's adaptations, is magnificent as Hamlet's antagonist. Of course, we have to talk about Kenneth Branagh. He delighted the audience when he came to the scene with his first trip with Shakespeare, Henry V. He surprised Hamlet. Of course, Olivier's presence was fascinating, but I think Branagh's performance is wonderful. When you look at him on the screen, it's almost as if he knew exactly how Shakespeare wanted to play a role. How he was not nominated for an Oscar is a total mystery. At least the film won several nominations, and even an unusual choice for the script. I suppose they know good writing when they see it. All in all, you will never find a richer and more luxurious production of Bard's best gigs. To say that the technical aspects were terrible, there would be underestimation. If you love this show and worship Shakespeare, you should check this movie. Even if you do not really care about Shakespeare, the pictures will keep you busy during the duration of the movie. Maybe you do not think you'll be able to get all this all at once, but soon you'll discover that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more.
