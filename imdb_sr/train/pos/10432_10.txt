I must admit that at the beginning I was somehow restrained from watching this movie. I thought it was a stupid, little, romantic film about a French woman who meets the American train and decides to visit Vienna with him. Actually, I was not enchanted with this kind of scenario, because I continued to believe it was just a movie. Still, I watched him! And I was amazed ... "Before sunrise" is one of the rare films that dare to speak in a rather philosophical way, wondering if we were sentenced to death at the time of our birth, or that this is the central idea that a couple should stay together for eternity, or that we humans, sometimes, can afford to live in fairy tales. The place is beautifully chosen (we do not know whether we will meet again in six months, at six o'clock at the Vienna station) - in our optimism we sincerely hope. The actors acted very well, so I started to believe that I, like myself, could live a love story like this.
