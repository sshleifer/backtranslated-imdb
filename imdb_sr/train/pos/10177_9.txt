'De Grot' is a great Dutch thriller, based on a book written by Tim Krabbe. Another of his books, 'Het Gouden Ei', was made in the great Dutch mysterious thriller entitled 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') in 1988. 'The Vanishing') but has time to get closer. Especially the opening moments are brilliant. We see a man, later we find out that he is called Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huet), who comes from a plane in Thailand. When picking up his bags, it's pretty clear that something is smuggling across the border. These scenes are perfectly focused, photographed and acting. There is some sort of uncertainty that you would otherwise not have in this open-air scene. Later, we see Egon doing his job in Thailand with his wife, both saying that they have never done anything similar to this. We see Egon, as a child (here playing Erik van der Horst), is dating a guy named Akel (as a kid played by Benja Bruijning). We learned that they grew up as friends, and that Akel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon in the meantime goes to college and settles with his wife. At about that time, he sometimes sees Akel, but he does not want to do anything with him. The film is somehow chronologically. He shows Egon and Akela as children, but as students, young adults and mid-30s. But from time to time, as I said, the film is coming back from the time they were kids and jumping forward again. Every time we see them as children, it explains something that happens when they are grown up. Less spoilers. This gives the movie a happy ending, although it's actually not so happy. As in the beginning, the end is great. The middle part of the movie is fun and in a way draws attention from the first scenes, to get back in the end. Just editing gives the movie a happy ending, although we can say that the dramatic ending is happy in some way.
