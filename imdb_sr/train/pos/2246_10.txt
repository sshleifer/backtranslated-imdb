Wonderful surprise of Spanish film. I never thought Jordi Molla could be such a good director, after all, I really do not care about his choice in movies. However, this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all ... something I always enjoy! He did not enjoy many good newspapers and I really do not think he will ever be published on the US market. We will have to get satisfied with DVD or VHS if that ... I do not want to talk much about this story, because I do not want to spoil it, but basically the movie is about a drunken homeless person becoming a new messiah just for hitting and getting money From it (as it was sooooooooooooo), before he finds out, he is immersed in a life he did not count on.
