The female department of a large hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where life begins. This almost forgotten drama is a fine little soap, packed with comedy and tragedy. , everything is related to the lives of the maternal staff and their patients. The honesty that solves the subject indicates the pre-Code status of the movie. Miraculous Aline MacMahon, as a nice head nurse, is a tranquil center of the film, the stone around which the current flows. Capable of solving any crisis or emergency, she is the best mother, sometimes the last, friend. The environment of MacMahon is a passion of excellent costumes: Loretta Young as a convicted murderer who came out of jail for a long time to give birth; Eric Linden as her frightened young husband; Glenda Farrell as a lady who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother in her sixth birth; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as imaginary, sympathetic doctors, and Frank McHugh as a comic frenetic father. <Br /> <br /> Movie mavens will recognize Bobs Watson as the little guy who wants to see Stork; Paul corrects as a nervous husband who promises to act as a "little soldier"; Gilbert Roland as the troubled Italian husband and wife Elizabeth Patterson as a doctor interested in adopting Farrell's son - it's published. ; Farrel becomes blatantly drunk at the Department, but it seems that none of the staff does not notice; obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will - but it really just reinforces the strange entertainment value of the film and prevents things get too serious.
