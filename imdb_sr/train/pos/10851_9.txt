I found that 'Still Crazi' is amazingly fun, and not just for those of us who lived through that noisy era in the late 60's, in the early 1970's. My 15-year-old daughter looks at me every time I pull out a DVD (do not worry, it's only three times) and she loves it. It is a truly beloved, touching and hilarious nod in the era, and each actor hits his notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nigha and I'm glad that something similar to Love Actualli attracted more attention. Bruce Robinson was as incredible as Brian, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of a stereotype of a rocker that was damaged by drugs. It was interesting to see that Robinson made his name as a writer. I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after I first saw the movie, I ran into Billy Connoli at a local mall (at that time, he lived here) and told him that it was one of the my five favorite movies of all time. He called me to sit with him in the food court and we talked about the movie for some time. We even talked about the idea of ​​a remake based on America before we wisely dismissed it. Why mess with the original? My only problem with 'Still Crazi' is that it was not extremely popular in theaters and too many people who missed a wonderful experience.
