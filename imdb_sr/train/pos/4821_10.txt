One of those beautifully intense films that attract us so intimately far, ends soon! Then the others watched the screen like, "No, they are not!", Lol. Good performances all around! The acting is wonderful when Emili Blunt is simply extraordinary! I knew she would give a solid, convincing show that would capture Victoria's youth, her temper and vulnerability throughout the film. Also, production is remarkable in every aspect: style, essence and sensitivity. An extraordinary view of the incredible time in Britian history is told through the very personal and touching biography of the princess school age until her reign as the Queen, who later marries Prince Albert, and then ends with the birth of the first of nine children. He had a well written script and flawless editing. Rupert's friend, young prince Albert, who is so patient and compassionate, who was trying to attract the attention of the young queen, rather than to secure his love before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettani), was preoccupied with watching. Equally engrossed was the relationship between teenage Victoria and her mother, who was sometimes angry, as well as with her mother and King Villy (who also did not like her mother). The acting and the scenes were amazing, highly emotional. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the historical and political situation that existed in that period, and certainly, anyone who loves a true romantic story
