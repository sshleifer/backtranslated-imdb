This film was impressive. My first experience with a foreign movie was neither too long nor too complicated. I also enjoyed the titles; and the plot was surprisingly cool. The story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and a retarded brother after a long separation appeared at first glance as a clich√©, but it turned out to be very touching and realistic. There was some subtle humor in order not to depress or bore the audience.
