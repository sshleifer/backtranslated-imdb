I love this movie, but I can not get what this movie does not like. People who dislike this film must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe this is Mr. Carrei behind everything. And I'm sure most of the actors and actress in the movie made a movie before this. And the movie is a new face. Tailor Momsen playing Cindi Lou Vho. As it opens, Grinch (Jim Carrei) comes out of hiding. And it causes some kind of fun for those in Vhoville. Sicne knows that those who love Christmas. While Grinch does not like Christmas. And even ridiculed little Cindi Lou Vho (Tailor Momsen), the daughter of a city postman (Bill Irvin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And the voice of the narrator was done by Anthony Hopkins. And Muppets From Space was appointed as the mayor of Vhoville. Who does not like to talk about Grinch near Christmas.
