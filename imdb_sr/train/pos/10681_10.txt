While the British in the 1990s made some hilarious little comedy - Ab Fab, Men Behaving Badly, One Foot in the Grave, etc. - The 70s were a real golden age. In the 1970s, there were completely new territories to be explored, including a sexual revolution, feminism and a slowly evolving consciousness of the need for "sensitivity" which, twenty years later, would become the Political Correctness. Attempts to tackle the confusion of this modern day world were subtle and not so subtle topics in everything, from the sketches of Monty Python's Flying Circus to sitcoms such as the Man of the House. (Until the late '70s this "capture" resulted in more meditative and bitter-sweet sitcoms, such as the masterpiece of Butterflies.) The man about the house is a perfect example of the good Britcom's time - a bit hugely, rude, fresh, imaginative, sometimes unheard of, with some well-made observations of contemporary life. Compare it with a cynical show of the nineties, such as Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe that these two were born in the same country. The man about the house is one of the great Britons of the 70's, up there with Good Neighbors, and the O House of George and Mildred's house. His quality is evidenced by the fact that - as with good neighbors - his creators, writers and many of her actors continued their success in British television.
