Aim For The Top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series that is written throughout the classics. I really liked this series, and to this day she is still my favorite anime. And while it was not the first Gainakov animated product, it was their first OVA series. Pays as a serious drama to the end of episode 2, when Noriko Takaia is forced to experience the death of her father, who was killed in the original human encounter with the insect race with which humanity is waging war. Because of her father's death, Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her lack of confidence sometimes finds her way and she breaks down. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even doubts that Noriko was chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, believes in her. And he did his own personal mission to see that she was able to become a pilot because she survived the battle that killed Norik's father. Other characters are Jung-Freud, Rus A combat pilot assigned to serve with squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who was killed in their first robbery, and Kimiko Higuchi, a Norik friend from childhood . Kimiko's interest is also interesting, while while Noriko is in space, Kimiko stays on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the weather, Kimiko stays normal on Earth while Noriko is relatively old when she left school. By the end of the series, Noriko has about 18 years, while Kimiko is in the mid-fifties. All in all, this is a great anime series to watch whether you are a fan of huge robots. mecha and Gainak animations. If you like the other shows of Hideaki Anna, or you are a fan of the artwork Haruhiko Mikimoto, then give a chance to this show. It will grow on you.
