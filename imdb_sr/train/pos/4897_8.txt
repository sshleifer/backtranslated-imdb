This movie attracts you from the beginning, because it attracts attention by acknowledging that, that this story opens with a cliché ?? Funeral. In hands other than Judy, I would not give him 8, because this material is over and over again: a great gathering once famous, choose one, please, a team, a military leader, a theater group, a singer , the band. But this film never comes down to cheap sentimentalisation, and when you think it will take it in the other direction. The case is the flowers that Judas sent the admirer. Members of the band are an interesting band and are driving above the clichés. One is in prison, one has found religion, one is alkie, and one has sunk into dementia. But the joy Judy rediscovered, inflamed by the interests of his granddaughter, brings us and makes us overlook the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot. The actors are who talent, Leslie Caron, incomparable jazzist Cleo Laine with her incredible high notes, the latest performance by Joan Sims, Joan's lock, sweet as a floppy button Ian Holm with a ball, and Olimpia Dukakis as a distributor of money living in the hills of Scotland Ghillie and her whiskey, the Final Scene is the standard Hollywood price, the crucial children of the stars turn into cute entertainment enthusiasts, old lovers reunited, the young begin to listen to the music of old times. Life should be so simple. But I would look at him again, and intend, with my grandson. For in the right hands, sometimes we just love these old old clichés. 8 of 10
