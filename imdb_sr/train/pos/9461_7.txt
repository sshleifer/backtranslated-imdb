Steve Carell plays as a person with whom you can connect to Real Life Day, a movie that I expected I would not like, but ended up loving him. It's not that the movie laughs loudly, just having a big heart. We all love Steve Carell, this is not what Office fans would expect from him, but you know what this film I liked. Carell plays as Dan Burns, a father who is a widow, and his daughters do not like him. One weekend, he and his daughters travel down to see his family. While there, she goes to a bookstore and falls on a woman. When he returns to his house, he finds out that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) comes out with that woman (the game by Juliette Binoche). a bit incredible. Is the Burns family really the kind of people who work together and play social games and work on a bunch of other family things? I would very much doubt that. I do not know any family that is like that. Is that stopping me from raising it? Not. Day in real life: *** / ****
