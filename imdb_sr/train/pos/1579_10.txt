I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival where it got ovations! This film narrates a story that, as far as I know, has never been told before - namely, Rosenstrasse (Berlin street), the uprising of German Jews who married the Jews at the end of the Second World War. As such, it is a unique story, and moreover, it's the only holocaust film I've ever seen showing that there were GOOD GERMANS (an ancestral family in Anne Frank, for example, it was a Dutchman) that did not support the Nazis and, in fact, they had the courage to oppose the immorality and brutality of their country during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their lives. The acting is excellent in all areas, the story of framing in New York is interesting and intricate, the direction of Von Trott's master in every scene, as well as the production values, including extraordinary cinema. Of course, a family in New York can speak German. Many immigrants in this country decide to speak their mother tongue with their family - which is a common occurrence. So criticism is unjustified. To say more, it would ruin the experience. The film is long, but I did not watch the watch once. I hope this movie will get some sort of distribution in North America, because not only is this film a masterpiece, it can actually help to cure any animosity people have against the Germans for their support of Hitler. If this movie is playing in your area, I RECEIVE YOU TO SEE! You will be glad you did it!
