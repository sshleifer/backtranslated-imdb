Thanks to Varner Archive, I can see this mammoth variant that throws everything apart from the kitchen sink. (However, the bat is present.) This film gives the screen time to any person who was then contracted with Varners. If some of the artists seem to be unfamiliar to some, it's because they were great in silent days, and most of them faded because of the popularity of these speakers. There are some really outstanding artists from the era of guitar. You will be most impressed by Vinnie Lightner, who performs two numbers. Also, there is a French star, Irene Bordoni, who sings a love song in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the biggest features of the two-color Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy", which was restored for this version. It's really wonderful and played by Mirna Loi and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is also the final finale "Ladi Luck" which lasts for almost a quarter of an hour. This is truly an epic early-talk history. Any old movie lover will love this.
