Teenager Eddie spends her life and is abused and humiliated for her obsession with heavy metal music. Someday he finds out that his hero Sammi Curr died, allegedly burned by an institution that wanted to stop his music. But Eddie has his latest album, never released, and when he plays, he begins to receive messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors. Soon Sammi discovered that he intends to return to life at a local party for Halloween to revenge the city once mocked. Sammi is the original horror of horror, playing on "evil obsessions of rock music" of the 80's. It's worth watching.
