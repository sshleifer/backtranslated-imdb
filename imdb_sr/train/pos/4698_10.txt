Like wine, "Johnny Dangerousli" is getting better and better every day. This clever, witty, well-acted movie could very well fit on its own - but as a parody of the gangster genre, it is truly remarkable. In fact, this is obviously the best film of its kind ... the funniest mocking of mob movies, even for a certain period - although, of course, this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar and boring pseudo-media as "Jane Austen's Mafia ".
