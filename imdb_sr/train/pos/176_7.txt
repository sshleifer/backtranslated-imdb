BEVARE SPOILERS. This movie was fine. Goldie Havn and Chris Sarandon were the best in him. Okay, so the funny side is a guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with a biker because of his clothes was ridiculous. The head of this type was also good. But the film really belonged to Sarandon and Haven. These two should have more time on the screen together. It was chemistry. The bathroom scene-VOV! Romantic, sweet, delicious. Havn is a stupid waitress who rescues a stranger and ends up in a white house in the midst of complications for the greed of politicians. Talking about Saranda would be a lot to take away. SPOILERS This is a rather atypical romantic / political comedy and satisfies both one and the other - a political party much more than a romantic. She deals with political issues, and scarcely scans in romantic areas. <br /> <br />
