Ang Lee clearly likes to ease the film, capture action, characters, and set himself on the hoof, as they appear. Covering the accidental ending of the American Civil War by random actions of a young police force, unformed in mind or masculinity, this is an ideal approach. The film turns out to form personality, adulthood and relationship. Lee also shows beautiful panoramas of the middle south as a silent character, sustaining a quarrel like a hard parent. James Schamus's script is probably the standard bearer of this movie; Behind him is a large number of well equipped performances that carry him remarkably. Only Jeffrey Worth's name could have taken this film for me. He is brilliant here, but in a slow-burning role: instead, we are treated with very good (if not uncovered) performances from a large, often recognizable ensemble. For example, to watch if you do not like the harder, more bitter-cold Cold Mountain or The Claim. 7/10
