"Stanley and Iris" is a movie that warms the heart about two people who find and help one another overcome their life's problems. Stanley's life is difficult because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widower with two teenagers who work in a bakery where she meets Stanley. She decided to teach Stanley how to read in her home in her spare time. By the time they become romantic. After Stanley learned to read, he went to a good job in Chicago, only to return to Iris and asked to marry him. It's a really good movie without nudity, violence or cursing, which is rare in today's movies. Good movie. <br /> <br />
