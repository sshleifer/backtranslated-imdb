I have to be honest, I expected failure so bad, because it really sounded like they were trying to milk the original movie to get the money. But this was not the case with this rather funny (sometimes weird) movie. I loved telling the story of Timon and Pumbai, the story with Simba and his sleeping problem was ridiculous. A whirlpool with a jacuzzi, and when the Pump leaves, the bubbles stop. It's a harmless fun, good for children and adults. I think this movie will take some time because it's pretty good for a direct video and DVD movie. While the movie seems to be a little weird and kind of trace, it works. 8 of 10
