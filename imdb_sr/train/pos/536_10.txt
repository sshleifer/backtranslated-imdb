Several movies can be seen almost 60 years later, but they remain as interesting as this one. Technological progress has not been given to this classic love story. The special effects used are remarkable for the 1946 film. The acting is wonderful. David Niven, Kim Hunter and Roger Livesei, in particular, are doing a fantastic job. The use of black and white / color contributes to the creative nature of the film. It has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people are aware of its existence. It's my favorite movie of all time. The waiting and hope for the DVD edition of this movie for many years is, in itself, "a matter of life and death."
