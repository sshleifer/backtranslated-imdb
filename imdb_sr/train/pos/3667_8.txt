Hollywood North is a satirical view of the time in Canadian film history when the Canadian government offered enormous tax incentives for films made in Canada. In most cases, this was treated as a tax haven or a cheap way to film American films. For example, Porki came out of it. In any case, Matthews Modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved Canadian novel. However, in order to get the money, he needs an American star. He gets a free ride and teaches that he has to compromise to the extent that the film no longer looks like a book on which he was originally. It has good results in Canada, but can not be understood outside of the Great White North. The Americans will think that we are imposing, but we will miss the point that we actually deserve them. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
