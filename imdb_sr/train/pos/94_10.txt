I'm John Denver's big fan. I have a great collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas event when it was originally on TV and I loved it. I have an original vinyl album and CD. I have an original CD and later edition. Later edition lacks several songs. I see it was released this year with all the original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. VOV - think that Christmas Cd would be worth so much. For me it's not worth selling this treasure. It's my favorite Christmas CD. I've never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I wish I had any version. If someone has one available, please let me know. thank you
