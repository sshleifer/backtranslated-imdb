There is some spectacular photography on the heart that stops a beautiful sight and animals, from the Arctic to the tropical and everything between. The camera's techniques are diverse and visible from close-to-air activities to aerial work. The editing is huge, and the comment is on it, with the right tone and some dramatic stories about our world. Where the film descends a little, it seeks to capture and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories, and hunter / hunter interactions in different environments. In the end everything becomes a little bit and unconnected. All in all, it's worth seeing especially with regard to the covered issues, but do not expect Oskar material.
