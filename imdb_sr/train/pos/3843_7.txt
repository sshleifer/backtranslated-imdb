The first time I watched this movie in the theater at a foreign film festival, I considered it an intriguing, fascinating, sensitive bi-sexual artist. So very European, so very Dutch! I recently rented it for another look, and I could hardly keep myself from laughing at that overpopulated theme of a crazy writer with a complex of persecution of religious-sexual orientation. Saberi! This guy is a catcher, he's alive from society. I suppose that the real reason he had these fantastic nightmares about "pauccinacy" is that his complex fault is dealt with after a year of ignoring your mother's advice on entering cars (and beds) with strangers! Not only does he make an incredible amount of robbery (probably without a tax) for inventing a story (a false guilty journey), but it's too cheap to pay for a haircut, so it captures the owner of the beauty salon. Then he has the courage to complain about it! But I also doubt that the world has changed much since this film was made. On a serious basis, it was fun to see some of the recordings by Jan de Bonta and one of Paul Verhoeven's earlier films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed so much?
