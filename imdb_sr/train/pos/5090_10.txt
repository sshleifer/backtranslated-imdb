I loved this movie. Great story and actors and good movie sets. The story is told in a way that I can easily understand and pay attention, without falling asleep. I would like to know where I can get music. I can not find her anywhere. Please send me an email if you know where to get a soundtrack. Except that I did not manage to find music, I thought the film was fascinating. Svaize did a great job. I think this is his best work. His past films were fine, but this one really told the story of a change. It will enter history as one of the best television films ever emitted. We congratulate producers and writers on such a great work.
