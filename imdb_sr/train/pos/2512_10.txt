As a big fan of Japanese singers Gackt and Hide, I was awfully excited when I learned that they had shot a movie together and made it my life mission to see it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film has far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hide were singers, and not actors, I was ready for brave, but not very fulfilling performances, but I am thrilled to say that both of them managed to impress and believe in the story. Moon Child has the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious moments. I can not say I've ever cried over the movie, and these softer moments are lovely acting by the couple, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. The battle scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are moments of uncertainty to start, you will quickly enter the film and begin to connect with the characters. I recommend this film to everyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hide.
