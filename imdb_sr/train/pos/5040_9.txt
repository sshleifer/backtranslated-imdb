For the first time I saw Frailti trailer on Yahoo Movies for a long time, after I heard Stephen King praise him to heaven. I'm not really a fan of any other star, but I still wanted to see her because I'm a big fan of the triller. I was not disappointed. The act was wonderful, especially from two young men. I usually do not like the children actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were great. Bill Pakton really did well. It was nicely captured. Must also notice the plot. Three turns eventually hit hard and fast, and I did not see them coming. The final turning of the film, coupled with the seriousness of what was just discovered, gives me winter to this day, even though I've been watching the movie again so many times. Real jewel.
