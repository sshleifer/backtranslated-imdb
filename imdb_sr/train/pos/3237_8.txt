Following my experience in Finland for more than a week, I would say that this film very accurately describes the nature of the Finnish society. I'm especially aware of the phenomenon of young couples-serious problems, because I personally witnessed the same thing when I was in Finland. The relationships and problems of people, the fragility of a marital institution, the drinking culture, unemployment and the problem of rising money are all well placed, without any subjectivity or exaggeration. There are some points in a movie that is not necessarily easy to grasp and tie to one another, but the shared picture is nevertheless rewarded. Not every short story is exciting or deep, but as mentioned above, the big picture does not fail to provide the feeling of "real life" and fascinates the viewer. I accidentally think in a quiet moment: What's happening in the lives of all those people on the street? Well, this is happening. Such films are good for feeding your imagination. It would be safe to assume that this film could be applied to life in many countries, but this particularly reflects Finland as it is, and quite damn good. One commentary on the act: Being a fan of Finnish movie in the cinema itself, I have never seen any of these actors in any other movie, but I found that acting in this function is close to perfect for all. Perhaps not a masterpiece, but a very good crew attempt. I will follow future editions of directors and actors. 7.5 / 10
