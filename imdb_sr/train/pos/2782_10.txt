"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that is very little exposed here in the United States. This was probably due to the fact that the film was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and has dealt with a lot of football (some football), which some may have problems in the US. more coverage here. I think that the basis of the story (after the dream) is something that many people can connect to and eventually "Bend It Like Beckham" proved to be a good feeling for a movie with a source of inspiration and a really good acting. I was not too excited to see this movie initially, but now I'm sorry I did not see it before. I recommend this film!
