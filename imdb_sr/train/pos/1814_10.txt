All dogs go to paradise, in my opinion, the best animated film ever made. I'm not really a big fan of animated films, but there's something about it making it better than any other animated film I've ever seen. Music is wonderful as performances by Burt Reinolds, Dom Deluise, and especially Ken Page as King Gator. "Let's make music together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any musical I've seen. This is definitely necessary for people of all ages.
