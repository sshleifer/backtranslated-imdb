Gundam Ving is a good anime for me. It's a bit slow moving (especially around the middle of the series), but most favorably. Now before someone jumps on my case and calls me "wing", I will admit that I have watched all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, 08th MS Team and Gundam SEED. I admit there were several problems with talking a story, and a few characters might look like a "parachute" (i.e. Zechs Markuise in the original Gundam Char), but this is an alternative universal display based on the original series , such as SEED. If you want to look at this series, make sure you first look at the original Gundam, and then you know that you are watching the AU series.
