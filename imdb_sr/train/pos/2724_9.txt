Many of the classic films in the late 1960s did not retain their ability to harass and oppose the audience. "In cold blood" he lost little of his power. Its extremely well made, but it forces the viewer to think. Some complained not only of the film, but also of the source of Truman Kapote's "novel without fiction", that the central message was unbearable. This may be true, but this is definitely a case in which the lack of ambiguity does not diminish the film at all. Refreshing, especially considering today's simplified and manipulative moral drama, watch a movie with a convinced political voice that is not afraid to force the audience to consider their point of view. To be honest, I'm not sure whether I agree with the central message of the film, but I still admire his insolence. Even if you disagree with a death sentence, there is a lot to go for Film. The operation of two water is great. Scott Wilson (still one of the least developed actors ever) is as cold as a nihilist leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake also settles down as subordinates, and the one with conscience. His character obviously has a voice of reason, but he is afraid to go against Wilson (there is a good number of homoerotic subtexts on his character). The cinema is brilliant, elegant but persistent, and it really leaves the impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic score from Kuince Jones, and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
