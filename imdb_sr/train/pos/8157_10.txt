Rated R for strong language, violent content and some nudity. Kuebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A Fear of Black Hat is one of the funniest, most original comedies I've ever seen. A pity. It's a shame that many people have not heard of this movie jewel. If you can find this film anywhere, do not hesitate to buy it even if you do not like rap music. I give the perfect 10/10 for. The only people I can remember at this moment are this movie, clerks, the world by Garp, 40 years old Virgin and chasing Ami. This film is a hilarious stereotype gangsta rap The film is about a woman named Nina Blackburn who is shooting a documentary about the fictitious rap group NVH (N **** with hats). They are basically a rap group rapper that makes many controversial rap songs about killing fear of a black hat is an excellent comic movie and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of a gangsta rap scene. Too bad this film is not in the Top 250. Runtime: 88min 10/10
