OK - you want to test someone about how comfortable they are with their adolescents and unpleasant and maniacal changes - then you will get their immediate reaction, seeing that this surgical doctor says that children make socially relevant horrors in the suburban 80s. More than any movie I have ever seen, the film deals with burdensome sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human, never boring, and fascinated by the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is discouraged by the horror of an adult world, the youthful youth is accredited to all, from madness to perversion. It seems that the mini-mogul Darren Stien is looking for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and suspicions as a patriarch of a strict children's world. What's in it and others is not always nice - but it shows how it can be improved and reconciled with age. What does change without thinking? I love this movie.
