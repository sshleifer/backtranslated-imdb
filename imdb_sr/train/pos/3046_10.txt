All good films "inspire" some direct video footage. I was afraid that the "Gladiator" was not such a good movie, because I did not see any movie that had been in any way resembling any novel on the new shelf for months. Then I noticed the latest offer of Full Moon, Demonicus. I'm a fan of Full Moon's Puppetmaster series, and Blood Dolls, but I've never seen one of their puppet films. In any case ... Demonicus records what happens to a group of campers in the Alps. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with the old gladiator artifacts, and feels forced to remove the helmet from the corpse and to test it. He becomes obsessed, and as a demonic gladiator Tiranus, he is forced to kill his friends in order to revive the corpse, which is the true Tiranus. budget. Sometimes the editing and direction was so amateur that I swore I was watching the Blair Vitch Project. Attempts to cut limbs and heads remind me of Monti Pithon skit. The weapon, though obviously really, looks really plastic. It literally appears to have been shot by a group of friends with a digital camcorder over the weekend. I agree, there is nothing wrong with filming this kind of thing, just do not rent this in anticipation of a technical masterpiece. It seems that there have been attempts to research for the script, because, although Tirannus does not really act as a gladiator to the end, at least he speaks Latin. All the way, actually enjoyed this movie. Perhaps not as a killer puppet movie, but Full Moon still brings! The only thing that disappointed me was that in the end there was not a full Moon Videozone!
