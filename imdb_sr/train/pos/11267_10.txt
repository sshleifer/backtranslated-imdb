Robert Wool is delivering a class of film students at the University of New York in Manhattan, New York. It covers misconceptions about history and truths that are no longer widely known. I'd like to see a lot more of this show. It's very fun. Mr. Wool uses examples and "shows and speaks" to cross over his points. He explained that the person who really was riding in the midnight ride of Paul Revere was not Paul Revere! Henry Vadsworth Longfell used the name Revere because it sounded better. I watched Robert Wooll for many years, from the time he worked on the stand-up comedy and up to "Arli $$" HBO. He's a good actor and a good stand-up comedian, but he's a great teacher! I recommend that you watch an episode of this show. It's well worth your time.
