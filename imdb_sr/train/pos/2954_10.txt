This film, though critically praised, of course has not yet been released in the US on DVD, as another "Housekeeping" by Christine Lahti of the same year. But if you can support the Region 4 (Australian) DVD, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the Internet. Davis is complemented by an excellent story, as well as unforgettable performances from her auxiliary actors, especially Claudia Carvan and the late, great Jan Adele. Astonishingly, or maybe not, this film and its stars have remained unrecognizable at the time of awarding the Academy Awards, as well as "Housekeeping", but afford it both - you will be glad you are!
