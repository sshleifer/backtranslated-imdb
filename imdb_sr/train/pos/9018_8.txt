Despite the low-key issue in this country, and apparent neglect in other countries (the rating 'R' in the US could not help - frankly, just because HBC uses C-word!), This is actually a fine masterpiece. Sentimentalism occasionally threatens to suppress it, but it is overcome by the game of two traces. It's easy to win recognition just because you play physical or mental disabilities (Daniel Dai-Levis, Geoffrei Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter may not realize the physical degradation of MND, but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional instinct completely compensate. In fact, almost all of her performances take place through her eyes (and what eyes!). This is an intelligent turning point from an actress who quickly destroys his reputation as an English rose and appears as a figure of some old man. The awards must surely follow, though not, unfortunately, for this fine performance. Branagh feels, he never completely gave his best on the film (except possibly 'Hamlet', and here his game was diluted by a big cast). Here, however, he outperforms his other performances, playing on the handle of a self-satisfied, unstable, at the end of a flattering man with a subtlety he has not always portrayed, and exposing both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him, just like we do not believe him as Frankenstein, as a priest in 'Provision,' as a lawyer in 'Gingerbread Man', even as Andrew in 'Peter's Friends'. This is certainly his best performance - why would not he produce goods much earlier? As a movie, it looks more like a television offer, and without its stars it probably would not mean a lot. But it was a pleasure for me to see this couple doing these socks, and I'm eagerly looking forward to more of them (though not 'Lost's Love's Lost' ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.
