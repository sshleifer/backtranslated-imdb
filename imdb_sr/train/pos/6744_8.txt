A stupid cop accidentally kills a murder suspect, then conceals a crime, but he must deal with the guilty conscience as he tries to solve the murder case. Andrevs and Tiernei re-unite with director Preminger in a movie nook, which is as effective as Laura, their earlier collaboration. Andrevs was perfectly thrown like a serious cop, a good man caught in unhappy circumstances. The act is good everywhere, including Malden as the hard captain of the police, and Tully as Tierney's patron saint. Hecht's scenario, a great and prolific scriptwriter, is tense and tense, and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
