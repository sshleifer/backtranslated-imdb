James Caine's Master Treatment "The Postman Alvais Rings Tvits" as Luchin Visconti's first film shot primarily around Ferrara in a desolate war-ravaged Italy. It was considered that the original negative was destroyed, but Visconti preserved the impression and, fortunately, we can see this early neo-realistic work today. Unusually handsome Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who recently discovered her breasts in La Price delle beffe (1941), act like sensually charged and unhappy lovers who plan to kill her husband, do not pay, is paid in a way that is not directly related to the crime . Great director, screenplay, acting and cinematography. It was not as good as the French "Le Dernier Tournant" (1939), but probably better than the American version (1946) with Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles.
