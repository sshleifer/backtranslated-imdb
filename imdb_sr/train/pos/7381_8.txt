IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alekandre Borges) are partners in the company together with ESTEVAO (George Freire), but the first is to contract a professional killer, ANISIA, to kill ESTEVAO (conspiring, at least initially, right?). explain very well why). A man does it after receiving the money, he begins to blackmail two partners, appearing in their company and saying that he wants a job there (as a supervisor or something like that?). At the same time he meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter ESTEVIA, and begins to have fun with her! In this story, where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can be a victim, except MARINE, who is the only person who does not know what is happening and has not betrayed anyone ? This sarcastic film shows the sad and cruel reality that exists in a large metropolis like Sao Paulo, where crime is a daily presence. We can feel the irony, but also the truth in characters such as ANISIO (greatly played by Paulo Miklos), who blackmails the guys who paid him without scruples, and even flirts with the daughter of the man he killed! He really has to be a monster to do something like that, but of course I know there are people like him in Brazil or anywhere else? It's a very good movie, cruel but true, about sad reality? The play is a great and sound background.
