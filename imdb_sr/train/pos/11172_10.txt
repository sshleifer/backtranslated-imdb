Personally, I absolutely love this film and novel (I first read the book and decided to watch the movie). First of all, the plot is truly genuine and unique. The acting is also great and I love the actors. Judd Crandall (the game of Fred Gwinne) perfectly fits into your role and really sells it to you. There are also several stripes (Idk if they were meant to be drunk), but they will really ease the mood and laugh. The Maine Atmosphere is truly the perfect place to shoot this movie and it draws you through the movie. Not only will you like it, but you will want to see it again and again, I recommend this 100% to every fan horor !!
