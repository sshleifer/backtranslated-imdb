White man + progress + industrialization = BAD. First Nations + nature + animals = GOOD. Simple formula. In fact, in the past days, the same type of propaganda was used to defend the status of the house; now used for attack. However, in view of this, I think that the film manages to overcome the perverse politicization because it plays on the issues of freedom and the original nature in a way that suits everyone. Perhaps you will not be able to watch a film about an obstacle in the revision of how the West has won. But everyone can feel the feeling of longing for days when horses can freely run across the western plains. (The movie also conveniently circumvents the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of animation - especially the introductory footage - is incredible.
