This has some great points, but the length of the movie can not withstand a tiny plot. It's another sailor on the go, zippier of Astaire's 'Follov the Fleet' but not as good as 'The Tovn'. Kathryn Grayson is mild, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their 'If you knew Susie number' is hilarious as they make a song while singing. 'I Begged Her' is also fun with the Sinatra, which shows that he was skilled in swimming. Sinatra's solo songs are boring and appear to be inserted to show his singing, not as part of a story. Luckily, they have been supported by actors such as Gradi Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and incredible but unyielding Jose Iturbi as he himself is, to watch it. The third is charged and it's interesting to see him interacting with children, which Astaire never did. Dean Stockvell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and cares for the character of Kelly. He also visited the school which resulted in telling the children a fictional story about his life in the Pomeranian Navy (!) Which leads to his beautiful dance with animated Jerry's mouse. In the second scene he dances charming Mexican Hat Dance with a sublime little girl, Sharon McManus, which is wonderful and sweet. Very pleasant, but for too long. There were better musicals.
