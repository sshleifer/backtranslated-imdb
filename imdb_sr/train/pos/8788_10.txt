Well, I'm glad to hear rumors that this can finally be released on DVD. When this happens, I do not know, but I'll catch it when it's released. In my humble opinion, this is Erro Flinna's funniest film, especially when "Gentleman Jim" Corbett's ring career begins in the film. Then it goes from a good movie to a big one. Few people can play arrogant men and still appear like a nice good guy, as Flinn could and this movie is a perfect example of it. Apparently, this was Flinn's favorite role and I believe in it. You can feel how fun it is here. Vard Bond also seems to have really enjoyed acting as a famous John L. Sullivan. Bond, too, was never better. Here is just the right amount of action boxing scenes and they are pretty well made. And Corbett's family is fun to watch, as they continue on the stands during Jim's matches. From the arena, the constant arguments and lashing of Corbett's family can become too loud and boring, but they set the stage for a suitable conclusion. Speaking about the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after a great fight is a very touching and climax of the film. Some indecent critics (Variety, for example) did not like that end or the fact that most of the film was invented, but - most of the films are fiction, whether they like it or not. And in this case, it was a good story and a nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very soft, real gentleman, nothing like Flin's portrait, but Flinn still makes him a good guy.) This is one of the more fun classic movies I've ever watched and I I'm eagerly awaiting DVD.
