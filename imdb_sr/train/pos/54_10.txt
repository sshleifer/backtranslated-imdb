The home room deals with a high school shootout in Colombia, but instead of permeating itself, the film shows the consequences and what happened to survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial. * Spoilers * The shooting itself is treated as an unexpected conclusion, with no action footage except the reaction of an almost teenage SVAT commander after killing a killer in a high school. The film has three protagonists; a detective investigating a crime that is not allowed to convict and two teenagers who survived the incident, played by very young Erika Kristensen and Busi Philips. Two girls do not have anything in common except shooting is made for this and a drama arises. Erika Kristensen, although only 24 of them were nearby, so many viewers are familiar with her firm and reliable style of acting. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and a totally unknown menu, took me with his huge dramatic power and presence on the screen. This girl was part. It is an excellent movie and connects with you with its intimate focus on the fragile, but growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. Elephant Gus van Sant (2003), although good, looks almost superficially and insignificant compared to the Home Room when it comes to dramatic talent and acting. What I can see in this movie has very little time and exposure - so much more loss for equally traumatized America. Ten of ten
