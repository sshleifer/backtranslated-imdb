Kurosava, fresh in color, loses sight of her usual theme of truth and perception of reality and decides to depressively take on Tokyo straw. Kurosava extends to a style that, in my opinion, is his antithesis - that is, I feel that Kurosava wants to make Oz picture. Poor pace, poorly designed, this movie is a rare dude in this author's body of great work. While Ikiru, while she was worldly and depressed, was still interesting and well-kept, and while Straight Dog portrayed the slums and social poverty of Japan, without being too hard or boring, she had every doubt that she would could expect Content, without any redemption quality of earlier images of Kurosava. Be warned, this is not a movie by which Kurosawa should be tried.
