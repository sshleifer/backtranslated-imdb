This film talks about human relationships. Charming, fun and well written, with meaningful text. Morgan Freeman seems to be having fun on the set. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and smart woman. I really enjoy her acting. A woman like her is a good motive for learning Spanish. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets with sweet Veg Veg, the view is taken on an intimate journey with two foreigners who learn to take care of where their life is moving. 10 Items or Less is about the desire of life. If you enjoy this movie, see The Pursuit of Happiness with Vill Smith and his son. It's not an action movie or a comedy act. Everything about human relationships.
