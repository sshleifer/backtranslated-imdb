On October 24, 1955, a hardworking geologist from the oil company Hadlei Mitch Vaine (Rock Hudson) met with executive secretary Luci Moore (Lauren Bacall) in the office of her boss Bill Rian in New York City and calls for a conference with alcoholic plaibo and the son of tycoon Chile Hadley (Robert Stack). On the way of the meeting, he admits they traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the desire of the ruthless Kyle, who is his best friend since childhood, to eat a sandwich from Club 21 and the meeting was just an excuse to Kyle's father Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love with Luke, and Kyle unsuccessfully uses his money to impress the Luci; then opens his heart and proposes to Luci. They marry and travel to Acapulco, and the uncertain Kyle ceases to drink. In the meantime, Kiel's sister Marille (Dorothy Malone) is an easy woman and has an unhappy sympathy with Mitch who sees her as a sister. A year later, Kyle reveals that he has a problem and can be sterile and begins to drink again. Jealous Marilee poisons Kylie to say that his wife and Mitch have a love affair. When Luke finds out she's pregnant, Kyle believes that the child belongs to Mitch, and his distrust leads to tragedy. "Written in the Wind" is an overestimated melodrama soap, with artificial characters and situations. There are at least two great movies with drinking problems: "Lost Weekend" (1945) with the amazing performances of Ray Miland and "Days of wine and rose" (1962) with a great performance by Jack Lemon. Robert Stack has reasonable performance and the motives of his character for drinking are shallow and clich√©s. In the end, forgetting "Vicious on the Wind" is just fun and never nominated for the Oscars. My voice is seven. Address (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
