Why can this kind of compact, fun mystery not be recorded in the new century? Keeps the viewer thinking and speculating all the way to the end. Actors are a great ensemble. Villiam Povell shows true star quality. Who knows - maybe he trained his future as Nick Charles. He is a joy to watch. You can see why Eugene Pallette recorded more than 200 films. He is an excellent actor for support, and his excellent chemistry with Povell is fun to watch. Mary Astor works above average and works in a non-meat role. All the other hands of the chips make this a completely pleasant way to spend 73 minutes. I guess Michael Curtiz had the ball that led his. Well done!
