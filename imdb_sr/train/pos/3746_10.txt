I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is incredible! My favorite parts are the French song and in the introductory title when a thief soldier shouts "SPONS!" I break it every time. I would recommend this film to fans of Knok Klaimation and people who enjoy other Jason Steele films. His style of animation is very original. You need a few views to see the detailed background. His humor is also hilarious, and it's definitely not something you'd hear earlier. Like Mac deformed Spatula that has a sound and light system in its head that radiates colorful lights and happy music whenever it talks about its miserable life. This is a great animation for watching anytime and anywhere.
