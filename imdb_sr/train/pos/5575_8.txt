I did not expect much from that, but I must admit that I was rolling around the country several times during this film. If you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes, this could be a movie for you. Likewise, if you are the type you would enjoy watching Amanda Peet pulling the cards an hour and a half. This is certainly not a significant comedy, but given the low-budget indie genesis, it is masterful. To equalize the comparative playground, imagine that all study films with a budget are reduced by a factor of 100 or so you can see what you will get! Respect Peter Cohen and his network to see it. I look forward to his next effort.
