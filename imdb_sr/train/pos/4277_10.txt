"Who is singing there" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Tragicomedy with very profound implications for the fate of humanity that is shown by the eyes of a seemingly ordinary and ordinary people from the blessed Serbian province just before the start of the Second World War. I saw it in a small cinema in Russia, where the film had a very limited distribution, and since then I had no chance to find it. It's so bad that this great movie is almost forgotten. I was looking for a VHS or a DVD copy of it many times, and unfortunately - I did not find anything. I would be very grateful to other fans of this little gem of film creation for suggesting how to buy a copy.
