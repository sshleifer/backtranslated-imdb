A really great movie and a true story. Dan Jansen Biggest slider ever. Touch and have a nice movie that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens in the fight against cancer and Dan Jansen love for her sister. The important promise Jansen made to win a gold medal to prove that his sister Jane was right when she believed in his talent in a quick skating game was justified. This picture is worth the time. I'd like to make more films of this quality. Thank you for a great movie with great actors and a great story. This is a very touching story of wonderful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for the youngest son and his sister.
