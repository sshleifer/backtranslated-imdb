During the premiere of Vanties, a woman was found dead on a catwalk above the stage. As it continues, the police are trying to collect who killed someone and why before the final curtain. I've always heard this is a great classic mystery comedy so I was excited to find a copy. Unfortunately, nobody told me about musical numbers that continue and continue. Although the numbers are definitely the type Hollywood did in their glory days, they become intrusive because they pretty much stop filming the dead despite attempts to crack down on them. It would not be so bad that half-way music is decent, but it's not. There is only one good song. Even worse, as if the studio knew they had one song, Cocktails for Tvo, and we are forced to withstand four versions: a duet, a large number of productions, like Vanity Finals and in the background as random music. I think Spike Jones and His Citi Slickers never played so much. The rest of the movie is pretty good with Victor McLaglene who agrees well with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny that his scenes as an actor are in love with a lover's wardrobe. It does not mean that I can recommend this if you think you can go through the music numbers, or you are ready to scan through them. It's a fun movie that does not work anymore.
