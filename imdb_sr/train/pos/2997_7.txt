Villiam Povell is Philo Vance in The Kennel Murder Case, a 1933 film starring Marie Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. An exhibition of dogs in which Philo entered his Scottish Terrier Terrier serves as a background for the mystery of the locked room with too many suspects. The mystery is very smart, and the scandal is complicated and interesting. Since the speakers are still quite young, camera work is a little static, but Michael Curtiz is doing a good job. The supporters are excellent; the whole actor brings the film to a peak. Many actors played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hide-Wite, Edmund Love, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Varren Villiam and others. Pauel played it most (five times) and best suited for the role - very relaxed, but at the same time serious. This was done before the "Thin Man" catapulted him to the big star - by then he spent about 12 years in the film, starting his career on the stage in 1912 at the age of 20. The actor who has lived for nearly 92 years. We are happy that his films are available on DVD and TCM today. "Kennel Murder Case" is a great story and entertainment movie - do not miss it.
