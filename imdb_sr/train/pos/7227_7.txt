Peter O'Toole is a treat for watching roles with lines that speak well and offering him a chance to drunk in a drunken state. The beautiful Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Tool's dramatic presence. The film alludes to the incest - without one explicit scene - but is able to entertain the viewer in his noisy social commentary. Although this is not a big movie in any account, it will be remembered for its fun shows. Even York, signing the papers in the end, is a treat for watching, which quietly exudes a tragedy. The possible weakness is Thompson's relaxed direction. But the movie floats for actors and scripts. I watched the film twice in a 20-year period - on both occasions with the name "Brotherly Love". "Countri dance" is a fairly Farce and an inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it is published as such.
