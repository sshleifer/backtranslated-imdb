It's sad to watch this movie now that we know how ANC got from international capitalism. Biko did not die for anything. Voods did a little. Yes, the absolute apartheid has been abolished, but all power apps have been reserved by minority whites, leaving the ANC government more or less impotent. As Naomi Klein writes in Shock Doctrine, in conversations between black and white leaders, "DeKler's government had a dual strategy. First, relying on the Washington Consensus that there is not just one way to run the economy, it shows key sectors for making economic decisions - such as trade policy and the central bank - as "technical" or "administrative", and then used a wide range of new policy instruments - international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs to control these centers of power allegedly impartial experts, economists and officials from the IMF, the World Bank, the GATT and the National Party - anyone except the liberation fighters from the ANC. The statistical results are terrifying, with many changes which have not been achieved and AIDS has flourished. Watching Cria Freedom in this light is deeply ironic - in fact, tragic. ANC has transformed itself from the solution to the main problem.
