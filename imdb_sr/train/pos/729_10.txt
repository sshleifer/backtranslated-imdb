I seriously love this movie so much, I never have the trouble to watch it. The only line I really can not tolerate is when Riff calls himself a teenage lobotomy, but everything else is perfect. I've never been a fan of PJ Soles and did not help me hear that she did not even know who Ramones was until she filmed this movie, but I can ignore her sharply little face for the most part. Most people who watch this again and again are Ramones fans and really .. that's the only reason I love him so much. I never tired of DeeDee ruining his pizza or Joei screwed up the teacher's name over and over again, haha. One of the best parts of the movie is to see them singing, whether you want to dance, down the corridors of high school .. I love it. A special edition of DVD has a good retrospective, it's surprising that PJ Soles is not on it. Maybe she worked on another project * laugh * Anyway, a great movie, even better if you are a Ramones fan.
