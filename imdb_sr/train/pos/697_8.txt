This is one of the first independent films I've ever seen. For such a low budget, it was good; As an insomnia, I can sympathize with the main figure, although sleeping problems have never been so intense or disturbing. Well-directed, well-acted, a theme I have not seen much in cinemas, lighting and set both perfect for movie setup. There are several noticeable nonsense, but they can be intended; You'll see it after you watch the movie. The movie is very personal and worth watching twice. No film is flawless, but Hollywood version can not better tell the story. all in all, 8/10.
