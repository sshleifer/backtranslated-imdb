Although this movie is pretty old, no matter how many times I watch it, it still makes me laugh. One special quote in the movie stands out. When Danny (Joe Piscopo) comes to da's offices and parks at a disability site, Danny's partner says: "I can not park here, handicapped". Danny replies: "I'm handicapped, I'm psychotic". It's one of the many lines in the movie, no matter how many times you are watching, Johnny Dangerousli stands in my top 5 comedies / podcasts to movies of all time. As an additional bonus, includes the legendary actor Peter Boile's cast. So watch this movie and love yourself and many others who watched it, you will be hooked.
