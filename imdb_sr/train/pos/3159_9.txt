... and the series allows you to forget all of this. I am three years older than children who are shown in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage, and I got my first post-faculty job during another gas shortage in 1979. - Paid jobs with discharged thirty and something, horrible music, worse clothes. It's ridiculous that this series does not ignore any of this and still makes the 70s look fun, for those of us old enough to know better. He succeeds to watch the 70th directly in the face - along with time-authentic clothing - yet fills the show with a young hope and things that make high school and college the best times and the worst. Then there are also parents. Two young lover lovers - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - really have terrible parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward, although they are conventional for a decade. They represent what happened when the sixties finally reached the outskirts of the seventies. Donnie's parents are two people who waited for the sixties to show their whole life in order to give their strange legitimacy. Erik's friends Fez, Kelso, and Jackie round off a group that represents reluctant, good-natured incompetence and snobbery. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a play on the suburbs, but he is largely someone who has to play the cards he gets even when those cards are mostly absent and neglected parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons, although the season eight lagged behind because of the lack of Eric.
