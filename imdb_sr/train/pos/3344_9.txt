I went to see Fever Pitch with my mom, and I can say that we both liked. It was not a typical romantic comedy in which someone was complaining about another, and blah blah ... You did not wait for the first climatic kiss or to finally meet. It was more real because you saw them through the connection, not the whole movie about how they meet. People could actually refer to the film because it did not look like extraordinary circumstances, or an impossible situation. It was really funny, and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. All in all ... I would definitely recommend it!
