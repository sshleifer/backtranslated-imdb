Raising Victor Vargas is a movie that you should definitely see. It was a very heartfelt and I had a lot of humor that brought you to suction. It's just like real life with what teenagers have to go through. Victor, a confident teenager, but with a good heart in the end, deals with love in the right places dealing with girls and family. Ultimately Victor learns the true meaning of love after facing an old-fashioned grandmother and a girl he wants to use in fact and he uses it. That feeling has this movie. One heart felt the moment when Victor's grandmother threw the winner into something simple. Viktor was really a heart and could not believe he would do that. I felt really sorry about him as if he was real. All in all, I give this film B +
