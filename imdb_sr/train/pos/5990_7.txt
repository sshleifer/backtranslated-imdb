I do not have much to add to what was said before, but it's largely a movie about time and the first (and probably only one) time when the studio completely put off the movie on Dead End Kids. > Varner gave a lot of help to boys, from Raio Enright's director and "A" budget, to almost magical actor support for actors. At each step, we get one of those gamers coming from the right professionals. There are too many of them on the list, but it seems that everyone on Varner's lot (without the biggest stars) go through this picture. The only high-end performance is always reliable Eduard Cianelli as a mafia boss with a messianic complex. He plays this character almost exactly like that of Thuggie's leader in "Gunga Din". He's something to watch! And Marjorie Main is great and gets the best role from "Dead End". My offer for this is another feature on a dual account with something like "Citi for Conquest". Warning Hour!
