Here's a favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon perfect for Halloween. I know that there is not much horror, but there is a "trick" in "Trick or Treat," as Jerry did to Tom with a window shade and a vacuum cleaner with a necklace that hung on it to look like a ghost; but I still like to put it on my list of Halloween cartoons. In this short, Tom listened to the "Vitching Hour," a program for ghost stories on the radio, and was scared by the story of horrors. Halfway through the story, the drama (the hair was standing in the end, the heart jumps into the throat, the ice-spinning on the spine) begin to happen to Tom. . . literally. Jerry watched the whole thing and laughed at himself, he thought Tom was scared by scaring him. I love the end, it was a little funny. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mamma Tvo Shoes; the rest were Lonesome Mouse, the mouse at home and Nit-Vitti Kitti. And this brief is the first of twenty-five cartoons in which Tom speaks. The rest are The Lonesome Mouse, The Zoot Cat, Million Dollar Cat, Bodiguard, Mouse Trouble, Mouse comes to dinner, Kuiet Please !, Happi Happi, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Tekas Tom, Mucho Mouse and The Cat \ t mouse directed by Chuck Jones.
