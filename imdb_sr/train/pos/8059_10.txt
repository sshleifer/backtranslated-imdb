I just watched this movie on Turner Classic Movies last night and was thrilled with the performance of Victor McLaglin: In every sense, the word "tour de force". The 1922 Dublin amphitheater triggered cinema and production design, which really indicated the techniques used in the best film nights of the 40's and early 50's. Gaelic. Mak Steiner is unforgettable. As in later films such as GVTV from 1939, he appropriated folk ballads to provide local color and a sense of place and time. John Ford: already 1935!
