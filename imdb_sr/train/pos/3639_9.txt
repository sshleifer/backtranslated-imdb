This film is a family for me. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself but also for his family. I can not tell you how I could tell my little girl that Dad is going to Kansas City to cover priest Holmes and chiefs of Kansas City. She thought it was the best thing, as Morris's son did. Living with family is what it is about. I think that only a father who has close relationships with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
