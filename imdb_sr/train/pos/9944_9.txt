Of course, the plot is not Oldboi. It seems that only these "great" films these days are incredibly shocking or high-budget / in some ways more expensive. Spin Kick is a drama / comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into this queue up. No matter what you expect from this movie, you will surely feel inspired by the work, pain and expectations that the characters force to experience. Although comic sometimes, many moments and characters are beautifully shown: there is an old guard who takes things too seriously, the hooligan turned into a good guy who just wants a second chance in life, a meek replacement for a team that will die happy if I just won one in her life, and many other well-rounded characters with her problems - but most importantly, her own hopes and dreams. While the action and goals of the film are simple, these aspects of the film merely emphasize the development of characters while surpassing their personal and interpersonal struggles. In short, this movie will make you feel fresh, resolute and satisfied.
