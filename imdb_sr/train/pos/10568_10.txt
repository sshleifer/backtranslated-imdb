I loved this movie, seen tonight on the big screen of cinema! The crowd laughed loudly to some very interesting things, and the fastest pace was most comfortable. I, as a singer and music director, ask the question of one piece of vocal by Robie Keeler in "Bi the Waterfall." "The key was modulated, and she suddenly sang much lower, a very mild voice that had no similarity to the slightly higher crisp voice it used in all other vocals. Does anyone know if this is exceeded the other singer? That sounds to me. I wish I knew. Thank you very much.
