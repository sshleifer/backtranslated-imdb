I discovered that this is the most fun Muppets movie, because I felt that it was the brightest and that it had the best comic delivery on most lines. Muppets try to go to Broadway to sell the original music material they have written, but by the way they fall into common problems, including Kermit's memory loss here. Although there are not so many brilliant robots here as in the original "Muppets movie", there are some of them, including Joan Rivers and Dabnei Coleman. The simple time and delivery of so many lines is great, and the situations in which the Muppets are found are hilarious. Original songs are also good here, and the ending is satisfying. There is not much to say about the film, but fans of Muppet should surely see it. It's the most fun Muppet movie and it's safe for everyone. *** 1/2 of ****
