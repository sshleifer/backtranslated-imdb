I can not believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite show manager, hands down. I hate celebrities and generally do not like talk shawls, but when Hal Sparks hosted Talk Soup, he had to see TV for me. I rarely missed an episode during his race, and I was sad when the visiting hosts began to roll (although most guests continued to do a good job). In any case, for all people who do not like Hal Sparks, I suppose they have never seen specialties for the weekend. It was an hourly episode of Talk Soup that included the best pics from the whole week, and they were accompanied by comedies. The original parts that Hal Sparks did were hilarious. In one he was obsessed with a bad demonic comedy, and on the exorcist as a scene his head turned around while he was talking about food jokes for airline companies. One episode was dedicated to Multiplicity, because a bunch of cloned Hal Sparks continued to multiply through the episode, outwitting the studio. Okay, maybe this does not sound so funny when I describe them, but all I know is that, apart from Talk Soup, the other two shows I've consistently watched these years were the Simpsons and the late night with Conan O'Brien. So, if you like the comic styles of these shows, you would probably like Talk Soup for years Sparks. However, Henson and Tiler were also excellent hosts. All three hosts brought something different to the table, but they were all good comrades in my opinion. Of course, over the years of Tilera and guest stars, my interest in this show has begun to disappear, but I catch the Soup, the spiritual heir of the show, here and there, and surely the new host can bring some pretty unexpected laughs from the time. Okay, I missed enough time talking about a television show that is no longer on the show and on a channel that I generally despise. Go look at something else!
