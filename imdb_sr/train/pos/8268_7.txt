This is obviously another remake of this film, which was filmed before 1911 and 1918. In many ways it reminds me of a later film, IANK AT OKSFORD. Both films deal with an imaginary blow that comes to one of the best schools in the world, and both, in the end, show an exhaustive, slow learning about teamwork and competence. In this film, Villain Haines is "Tom Brovn", and his main opponent "Bob" is Frances Ks. Bushman. And, in the supporting role, Jack Pickford - is always remembered as Mary's brother. Of these three, Pickford is the best, as a nice loser who becomes Tom's friend - he actually has several decent scenes, as well as a dramatic moment before the Great Game! All standard clich√©s are also featured here, because this has been done many times before and since then, it offers a little surprise. However, it's a nice movie and it's nice to watch. In my opinion, for a better film for college, try Harold Lloyd THE FRESHMAN - his football scores are genuinely exciting and Harold is much more sympathetic and compassionate than boring Tom Brovn. FRESHMAN is probably the best college image you can find from the era. Another reason why BROVN AT HARVARD is a smaller picture is that Villiam Haines played essentially the same unpleasant and bombastic character with the same complication over and over and over again (as in VESTPOINT and SMART SET, among others) - and if Video I'm one of these movies, you've seen them all. Well done, but surely NOT original! And because it's just a repeat of his other films, anyone who gave a 10-point movie, SLABNO is advised to see these other films. 4/25/08 == I just checked and saw this little movie was the highest movie on IMDb from the 1920s! Talk about an overestimated rating! There are dozens and dozens of better movies - how this movie became # 1, it can be assumed.
