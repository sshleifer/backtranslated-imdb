A charming, funny movie that gets a solid score. I recently saw a video of this movie at work. It was so nice to see this film in contrast to all the horror horror movies I see every day. So much for what I thought I would write. I'm not sure if this movie goes to theaters, but I hope it will. It's a nice movie to see with friends, his charmer, and he has some funny jokes. The acting was great (especially Hovard Hessman and Larry Dorf. The director was pretty good (not a movie that was supposed to be overrated), and the joke between the characters is smart and has a nice rhythm. As an ambitious screenwriter, I notice these things! I'm a jerk) Anyway, really sweet movie I recommend.
