I was 10 when this show was on TV. It was far from my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alekandra Bastedo was wonderful ... I'm just ordering a DVD (15 episodes). They did not have super powers. They only had superior human skills (strength, hearing, vision). Three actors were very good in their rolls, very convincing. Every episode was a good story. Then there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script should have been good, and the characters were great. There were no fancy things, like in other shows. They did not try to joke every 2 minutes to make a light shov. I recommend this show to all who love good things.
