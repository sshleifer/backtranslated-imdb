"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housevifes" ... the list goes on and on. This, and a bunch of other high-quality shows, proves that we are in the middle of a golden age in television history. "Lost" is pure genius. Incredible layers of personal and psychologically sustainable stories, accentuated by sublime cinema (incredible use of this word when describing a TV show), killer score, excellent performance and editing. Anyone not involved in this is missing one of the most important creative expressions on television. Perhaps he has his problems when he only watches one episode a week, but DVD format is actually an incredible way to look at this. I hope it will continue (as I'm sure).
