This program is very fun and the title track is so appealing that it can not be removed from the head. When I'm older, I see that wrinkles do things that attract me, and these four are excellent in their endeavors. Some of what they do are unheard of, but brilliant considering that nowadays in our PC world we would never be able to do it in real life. I always know something from the shows. But if you love mystery, drama, comedy and a bit of forensic work, you will love this show. It reminds me of Kuinci, ME in one way, and Barnei Miller in another way they work and interact with each other. They fuck a lot, but they're doing the job, and that's important.
