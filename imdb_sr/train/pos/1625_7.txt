Amazingly good movie! There are lots of good jokes through the whole movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extreme to show how stupid the two actors are. We realized, dumb blacks, continue! A barely scattered parcel is called "run-off". And boobies are always a plus plus movie for some strange reason not playing with that card, even on the line of the plot introduces two black-haired women who act as the evil counterpart of our two blondes. <br /> <br> All in all, a good movie for watching. I almost gave 8/10, but let's not crazy.
