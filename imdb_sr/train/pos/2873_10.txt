This is one of five Disney animated features, in my opinion. Cinderella was the perfect return to a feature animated film (unlike 40-year-old films), and the depth of the multi-plane camera returns to the movie in no other way. Although Disney adapts the story to a bit of liberality, you collect the idea of ​​an era through a dress and a stylized stylization --- a clear time period when the story unfolds. Cinderella is more mature than Snow White and multidimensional character. In fact, all the characters are somewhat well developed, except the prince - who left the most subtle - we know he has a sense of humor and a big smile, but that's all. Like Snežana, Disney has a constant impact on the story in popular culture --- in most versions of Cinderella, the stairs are attractive, but not as beautiful as Cinderella, and their character takes away their otherwise beautiful appearance. > <br /> Favorite Disney Accessories: Mice! Also, the continuity is appreciated - Cinderella always loses the shoe throughout the whole movie. The addition of a home-made dress, as well as the next attack from the steppe, as a child was always terrible - I remember that Master Master showed it with a black background and a great red light on it! The broken slippage shows the unwillingness of the evil Lada Tremaine to renounce the Cinderella and acknowledge the defeat --- Audlei would continue to characterize the most dangerous of all Disnei's villains, the satanic witch of Maleficent, in Dusk's Beautiful.
