Starfucker (who writes "Starstruck on my side") was the most incredible movie I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. So why not 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why one of my favorite actors is in this very interesting way to the darker side of Hollywood. I forced several others to watch the movie and everyone agreed that it was an extraordinary movie.
