About the new Hidden Frontier agency have been reported and reported by several news agencies due to their long-standing commitment to creating Star Trek's best stories and providing an example of the community that was Gene Roddenberri's mission. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war and acceptance of different races is equal to or greater than that of other Trek films and films. The value of production began to be smaller and thrilled, but during the seven production season, the performance improved, the stories were more complex, and visual graphics became shorter and more impressive. In season 6 of episode 1, Countermeasures, there is one of the greatest spaceflights in Trek history. Ships are well executed and space battles are impressive and exciting. The real design for Frontier are not ships or backgrounds, but these are people and interaction and character growth. There are also nodding in other Trek series and movies with places and characters we all know. I recommend any Trek fan to check Countermeasures and you will be hooked!
