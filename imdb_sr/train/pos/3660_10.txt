This vague de Sica delivers goods. It is said that "the meek will inherit the earth". This story of surface instruction, but really allegory for all homeless people who settled in Europe after a great war. They are homeless, but happy, in societies that are too poor and selfish to take care of them or acknowledge them, cats for Italian bags. de Sica decides to tell this as a fairy tale, the story of Cinderella. I did not read the book on which it was based, so I can not predict whether the deus ek machina is a construct of a writer or Vitoria. It begins with the words: "Once upon a time ..." to illustrate the timelessness of his story, because the story could be placed anywhere and everywhere. The cartoon sketches of aristocracy that crumble to the bones, the homeless nature of the homeless, especially when they begin to fulfill their wishes and ending with Spielberg paintings, make this buleg a delight for everyone. De Sice's best-selling image is one of his best. Leaving neo-realism, he is always futile between this and a pure good creation of a film, creates a film that breaks the heart and at the same time fulfills it with the desire of hope that it should continue to go to this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
