Not only is this movie entertaining, with a great comic acting, but also politically interesting. It was made at the end of the Soviet Union, but it ridiculed the Soviet mentality. The story is set in the early days of the Soviet Union and calls into question the rationality of the revolution, both in cultural and practical terms. Of course, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the bizarre strictures of Soviet society were already relaxed, but ideology and mentality are still alive and healthy and ready for some deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all this deep philosophical comment is embedded in a fun and fun package! Jur
