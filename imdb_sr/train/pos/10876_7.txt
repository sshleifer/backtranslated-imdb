I was very excited to see this movie. I thought Australia finally made a good movie .. but I made a mistake. It was the most pathetic attempt ever made film. I'm sorry Molly Ringwald must come to Australia to make a horrible movie. The act was terrible (especially the Australian guy who was trying to speak American accent) the shop was also pretty bad. When I first heard this film coming out, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like siren movie "Stab" in Scream 2), but I was willing to leave it to slip if it was It was a good movie. WARNING !!! BIG SPOILERS! Probably the worst thing in the movie ending. I expected a great surprise about who the killer was ... but the killer was not even a man .. that this realistic film in horror turned into a horrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. You'll probably be disappointed!
