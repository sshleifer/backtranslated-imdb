I saw a movie before I read the book Michelle Magorian and I enjoyed both of them. The film, more than a book, made me approach tears several times. This film touches the deepest point of the human soul and never let it go. I encourage as many people as possible to watch this masterpiece as soon as possible. I give her ten stars.
