I had no place to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I would probably miss this movie if I did not choose Air Canada. I looked at the small screen in the back of the seat in front, I found this amazing and enchanting. I made moves in several places and I had to skip, but I had to keep an eye on the end. Now I'm looking forward to a DVD release in Europe, but will I be pretty desperate when I can get out of the door, it just needs to be discovered! The photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and 'fills' the story that photographs tell. It is recommended (if you have time on your hands).
