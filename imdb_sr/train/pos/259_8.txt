For a Danish film, I must say that this is a very good movie. It is in its class, but it has international potential. The film has a big budget, and plays the famous Danish actors, and a few newcomers, who play very well. It can be viewed by anyone who loves adventure, and a little 'spiritual' film. Do not be afraid, be enthusiastic!
