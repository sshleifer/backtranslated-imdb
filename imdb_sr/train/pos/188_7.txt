I am a great fan of classic film, but I only go into silent films. Many silent films do not keep my attention, but Shov People is an exceptional exception. Marion Davies and Villiam Haines are simply beautiful in this picture. Davis, in particular, shows a wide range, because it is transformed from a giggling little city girl in an old-age, which is somewhat taken seriously. Show people is fast temp. some of the greatest stars of the silent age. The film immediately attracted my attention, and in fact I forgot that it was a quiet movie. (I know that does not make much sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their work that a little dialogue is needed. Shov People is a perfect introduction to mute movies. It's a fast and interesting movie with two best stars of a quiet age. Add in Hollywood and Shov People satire should be on the 'must see' list for all fans of the classic movie.
