A typical Claus film, but it's not typical again. Clausen writes, directs and plays one of the leading roles. This is a really great movie about normal people living in normal life trying to get the best out of it. The four primary actors were fantastic. Fric Helmut was persuasive. You believe he is really sick. Sonja Richter plays her sister who is truly an actor, but it turns out she is the best sister to care about the old man. Everyone has problems, and those who no one believes in it will be happy. But nothing good comes easy, they have to fight to win their lives and love.
