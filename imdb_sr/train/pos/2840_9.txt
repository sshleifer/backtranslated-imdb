I just saw the movie's pre-film and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not often that in one movie I see all my favorite actors in a single movie. I really enjoyed the pocket scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Haiden together. I think that their chemicals on the camera are the direct result of their common time. My favorite scene was far (surprisingly) piece by Brett Ratner ... Not giving too much, I'll just say there is a surprise that leaves you hanging ... The old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they spent their entire life together. Both the Chris Cooper and Ethan Havke segments filled the surprises that look realistic and similar to the experiences I had in a big apple. First of all, the movie is a great place to meet ... especially if you already love the city itself. I can not wait for the next in the cities of love.
