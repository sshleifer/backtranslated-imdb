Disney (and the wonderful people in PIKSAR, of course) offer a nice, humorous story in combination with the best computer animations. I admit that the 'faces' of the bugs were a bit more static than in 'Antz' and that they had only four legs (in 'Antz' ...). But the backgrounds were great and the animation was breathless. But let this be a lesson: it was not the computer that managed to succeed: it was the man behind the machine, who added nice small crafts, which I missed in Antz. Some of the most important things were, of course, 'bloopers' at the end (so keep on looking at the end, worth it!), Which were very entertaining and original. The 'Full Frame' line was intended for a more attentive viewer.
