This is a very light comedy about a wonderful family with a son named Pecker because Pecko used food. Pecker likes to photograph people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Md, and manages to attract the attention of a group of lovers to a photo from New York. Pecker has a sweet sister who simply crazy over sugar and is actually ADDICT, taking sugar spoons from the bag. There are scenes of men who show their bugs in a jockey, while grinding movements and gals do the same. It's pretty hard to keep your mind out of this gutter with this movie, but who cares, it's just a movie that will give you a few laughs in a simple picture made in 1998.
