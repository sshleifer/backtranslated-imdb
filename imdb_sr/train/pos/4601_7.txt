Police Story is an amazing series of pieces for Jackie Chan to show off his unique talents and courage. Some of the stunts here are among the best and most dangerous Jackie's comeback in shopping malls, probably Jackie's biggest single sequence, more brutal and less comical, then say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain Impact. But, unfortunately, the rest of the film can not boast of this quality, as it is a rather formal policeman with some comedic elements. I always love JC in movies like Project A, through which his natural comics experience. In serious restrictions on some elements of a police story, it simply does not work for me. Still, although this is still worse with Jackie's best movies for the incredible stunt and pure spectacle. As usual, avoid movies in Hong Kong from the English version of DVD because it's really terrible subtitles. Brilliant stop, OK movie is a good starting point if you have not seen JC movie before and it's good to watch any movie fan
