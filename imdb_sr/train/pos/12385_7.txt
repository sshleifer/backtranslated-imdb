Man, I really like the new DVD that Universal points out. I've never seen THE SENTINEL look so good because I've had to endure shitty, grainy VHS tapes for years. Unfortunately, there is no addition behind the trailer that looks pretty worse to carry. AND AVOID THE Goodtimes DVD at all costs. And that's bullshit. In any case, the upset fashion model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moved into a devastated NIC brown stone, only more than just haunted. It is also a portal for hell and the Vatican holds the old blind priest (John Carradine) to guard it and take care of the devil and the angels do not escape. This is an actor of all stars full of old actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer etc ... as well as the cameos of the upcoming 80s including Christopher Valken, Jeff Goldblum (who was the voice is mysteriously covered) and Tom Berenger. And you will not even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAV & ORDER. I had to make a double take when I was not in the place where I saw it earlier. Beautiful scenes of Alison cut across the eyes and nose from a rotten rotten dead father who was obsessed with the devil. And there is a neat end where deformed, deformed people are trying to persecute Alison to commit suicide so that she will not be the next to keep the portal. Alison's troubled past seems to have made it the main candidate of the Vatican to become the next guard. Excellent, creepy classic of the 70's from director Michael Winner who should not be missed. I also recommended him for those who want something a little more imaginative than the usual stupid teenagers and horrible comedies. 7 of 10 <br /> <br /> -
