White made 9 images for the Monogram, but only in OVOM, the fourth, things began to unite. Everything else in the series would use this as the basic template for the production, writing and character development. From now on, better or worse, the series would deal with one essential theme: the scientist (usually White) is experimenting in a basement or in an old house (sometimes in the basement of an old house) that causes the flow of things. This was also the first time art dealer Dave Milton was given the chance to spread his wings. He came to BLACK DRAGONS, the one that he worked on earlier, but this is where he will have to click on. Levis created a great atmosphere for almost nothing, and was there for all other Monograms. Casting is the key to this, and here's a pretty good B movie. You get Barclai and Harlen (also from BLACK DRAGONS), along with Russell, who will feature in the Levtons CAT PEOPLE .. and Rosetto, from SPOOKS RUN VILD ... a fine talent for poverty. If you have limited time and budget, start with this ... it sums up everything you learned to this point, and gives you something to compare the rest. The plot? White steals the juice from her glands to keep her young wife young. They both like to sleep in coffins. If you read it and smile it, the rest will be easy.
