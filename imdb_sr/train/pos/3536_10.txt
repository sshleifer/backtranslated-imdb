EA has shown us that I can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the world of the 60's. Game graphics is extraordinary, and voice recording is very professional. I got this game April 2007 (two years after the release), and I'm still impressed with the game. It's a shame that EA will no longer make 007 games. I give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the level of "Consulate". I would recommend this game to anyone of 13 years or more. The only thing I did not like in the game was the level of the Russian ship, too much pressure. I like the game A LOT !!
