Red Skeleton is another great star who has easily moved from movies to television. Start the show with an introductory monologue. After that, we would have different characters. You remember Gertrude and Heckliff in a monologue? How do we forget San Fernando Red? I remember one episode in which, as King Red, he presented his queen thinking of her as thick. He lost his son from leukemia at age 11. His wife, Georgia, died of suicide.
