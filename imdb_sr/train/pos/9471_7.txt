Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, an uncle of agony in newspapers and a dedicated father for three girls. In a large family house, Dan is meeting his perfect wife, only to find out that he is in touch with his brother. What should a man do? I like the "Real Life Day", but I imagine that the success or failure of this movie will be reduced to whether you are ready to accept Steve Carell who plays relatively flatly and restrained, instead of going through wide comedy moves, he made it so successful. If you can not accept it, do not be afraid, "Get Smart" will appear later in the year, but for the record I thought it was very good. The "Real Life Day" begins as your typical, randomly entertaining, family drama, but it becomes more funny and funny as it goes further and Carele's frustration with his situation is rising. It's not massively original (but if you just watched movies with original ideas, cinema buying would be very rare, would not it?), But "Real life day" is a fun and good actor (who would not fall) in love at first sight with with the dazzling Juliette Binoche?) use a sufficiently deep-seated script that contains many thoughts about the meaning and passion of love. I hope that Steve Carell is pushing and doing something interesting again.
