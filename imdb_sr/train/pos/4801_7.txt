I watched this with my whole family as a nine-year-old in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember that my father noticed that "it could have happened - Adam and Eve." I vividly remember when Adam found Eve, her eyes turned red. I asked my father why her eyes were blackened and he said that she was tired and hungry. Since I did not see this episode in 45 years, I still remember clearly - TV broadcasts back and forth with the mother planet, the scene of bombs shaking the headquarters, and the last scene of the two of them leaves, Adam carries his pack and Eva. Perhaps it was not a theater artwork, but it certainly made an impression on me all these years.
