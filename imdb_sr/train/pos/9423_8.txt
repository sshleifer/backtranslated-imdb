I can not say whether the British comedies produced in the Second World War produced in the studio Ealing Studios have acquired the taste or not, but I am completely dependent, and the Man in the White Dress is one of the best. There is no need to go into the familiar danger story that represents the textile industry and textile unions with indestructible fibers resistant to dirt. It is enough to say that the strips and arrows, which Sidni Stratton suffered as a naive idealist in search of a polymer's vision, led to a comical pleasure. Many celebrities from the world of British actors - nervous Cecil Parker, crazy crazy Michael Gough, and openly merciless Ernest Thesinger - have put on wonderful performances. Ginis - as always and forever - is wonderful, and Joan Greenwood is as great as Daphne (the only way she speaks the word "Daddy", makes her a whole movie worth watching). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!! !!!!
