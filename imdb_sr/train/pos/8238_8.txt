I really enjoyed this movie. The actors of adult actors were brilliant, although the main child was somewhat stiff. But he was well dressed because he was a new talent. Humor is very sublime, not in the face of most Hollywood comedies. So. Professor Nutti. If you have a short range of attention and get used to typical Hollywood things, you probably would not like it because it's a bit slower. I picked it up at Blu-rai and I have to say that the image quality is top-notch. Probably one of the best Blu-rays I've ever seen. And the statistics were cool. They've erased a lot, but that's probably a good thing because most of the deleted scenes did not add anything.
