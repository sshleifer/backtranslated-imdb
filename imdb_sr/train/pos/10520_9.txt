I saw Jane Austen's addict and always felt suspicious of the cinematographic presentation of the complexity of his novels: well, this transposition is simply precise, intelligent, delicate, attentive, tactical, honest, intense, in a word, perfect! "Emma" is one of Austen's most beautiful and entertaining novels, thanks to the overall situation and character. The film respected this subtle irony, not neglecting the comic element (primarily Miss Bates). What hired me in a novel, and the film clearly shows, is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist, and the modern look of women, men and their relationship, and it is astounding if we think that a novelist from the 18th century , who lived an almost lonely life, could understand such a depth and truth about life as she did: that is what most fascinates me most. We can sense this modernity through the film: just replace the costumes and use a more current language, but situations, feelings, ideas would be extremely modern. I'm thinking of a morbid interest in someone else's life, or about that insinuating envy that now, as always, rules on women's relationships, and still has difficulty in discovering and expressing feelings, especially love: every situation gets universal and beyond. The game is truly talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: young Gvineth Paltrow is especially suitable for this role (today it would probably be too mature for it), Toni Kolet is simply great. And how I envied them for the wonderful dress they could wear! And then, the English breathing villages, in which every situation gets such a magical dimension like a dream ... a really nice and rewarding movie.
