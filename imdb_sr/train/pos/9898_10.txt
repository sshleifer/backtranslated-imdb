My 10/10 rating is just for the fun factor and assumes that you have decided that you like "Slaughter High" even before you watch it. Yes, it's a typical story of revenge-more-years-after-dirty jokes, but how can you not like something of the things that pull out here ?! I could not foresee that scene of a bath in a million years. Okay, maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie does not offer anything new. Well, it does not turn out. It's a type of movie that characters in "Scream" were probably watching, and contributed to their rules on how to survive a horror movie. After all, who does not like to see how people are suffering from these things? It is obvious that there is some reactionary subheading because people are being punished for what the '60s' fought. But still, you have to love these things! So, with the apology to Don McLean, this crazy guy did not sing for the king and the queen!
