I liked this movie. When a figure who was robbed by a $ 40 million bank in gold dies, his colleague from the cell is used as a "bait" to take them to a crazy partner for a crazy killer (with the tracking device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge). It's an action, spy film with enough comic scenes to be bright. It reminded me of the enemy of the state. Good behavior was also a good enough plot.
