When a small town is threatened by a child killer, a policeman goes for him by pretending to be his friend. As she becomes more and more emotionally involved in the killer, her psyche begins to take a beating, causing her to lose focus on the job of catching a criminal. Not a movie about the excitement of high voltage, but the solid work of the police and a good display of the defective mind of a psychotic loser.
