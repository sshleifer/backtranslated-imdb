This was different in its originality. I'm seriously tired of watching Hindi movies that are a bunch of Hollywood and British films. Some disadvantages were inevitable, however, this film is unavoidable. Suri's portrait of a clean, conscientious policeman (unlike those who faked, who are usually hungry for money) was terrible. She's far from work at Nerukk Ner. The movie I liked so much that I had to own it. I do not usually deal with films about foolish violence, I somehow felt for every character, and therefore I can not call it 'foolish' violence. I do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most of the Hindi and Tamil movies. I absolutely loved this film because of the lack of it. The reaction of ACP Anbuselvan to the loss of his wife is not excessive, it is a disturbing heart and makes me get my eyes out. There are certain times when I watch a movie when I want to press the FF button. Many times I wanted to do it at the cinema hall. I never wanted to watch this while watching this movie. I hope Ghajini will soon be announced.
