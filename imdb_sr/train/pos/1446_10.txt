Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be imprints for a top cinema. This is a good performance he has ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller that is as good as they are. There are no good guys and bad guys. But the system has its irreconcilable effect on people who think they are leading it. Not only is Pacin's performance incredible --- the hymn to the funeral of a dead child is incredibly powerful - the film has a fast pace, a persistent realism that enhances the fine performance without resorting to tricks. This extraordinary portrait of the big city's politics also manages to provide two hours of top movie viewing without unnecessary violence, overheated sex, or speech. There is murder. There are bad people. But they find themselves in an effective way without crossing the border. Such a film returns my poor faith to Hollivood. I do not allocate many tens. He deserves this richly!
