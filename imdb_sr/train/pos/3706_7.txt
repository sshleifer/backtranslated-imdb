The greatest surprise in this film was the show Daril Hannah. Instead of playing stereotypical blonde roles, it usually plays a street, intelligent, tired world. She does not have a huge role, but she does a great job showing Lois Harlan as a tired woman, although accustomed to hiding her boss's indiscretion.
