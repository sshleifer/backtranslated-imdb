I remember seeing this when I was seven or eight years old. I must have found a circle of characters, because they left the impression in my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie. And the end, now that's sad, so ... for a boy of 7-8 years old. I had the opportunity to re-see this movie lately, and found that the plot was too simple, character, two-dimensional ... I suppose it's a movie that you can only with the innocence of a young child ... Damage ... I recommend this for all parents with small children ... (I saw it in the original French version, so I can not tell you whether the translation is good or not.)
