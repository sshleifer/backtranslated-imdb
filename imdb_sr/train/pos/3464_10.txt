* WARNING * Spoilers in front ... The writers of this story knew these people well. And the actors displayed them very well. The result is that you feel like you are actually watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney to the end of the movie. Expected tensions are there, especially at unpleasant first moments. But as these two begin to relax, the old friendship that made the Beatles start to appear so well. The bitterness is still there and sometimes interrupted, but as John gets the idea to take Lorne Michaels into his offer to pay the Beatles $ 3,000 to appear on "Saturdai Night Live", these two can be the same boyfriends who terrorized Liverpool together as teens, and survived playing in rough nightclubs in Hamburg to reach Superstardom. But in the end, this wonderful fantasy gently obuzima us. We recall why the Beatles gathering was probably never possible even before Lennon's murder: The two driving forces of the group grew out one another.
