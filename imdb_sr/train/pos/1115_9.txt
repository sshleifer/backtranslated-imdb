This is one of those unfortunate films that have suffered more sad, unhappy death at the box office. I saw this film in local art cinema, in the form of revival, shortly after it fell into the main cinema halls. He certainly deserves to be approached a second time (or even a third). Sandra B. It brings to the limit by pronouncing the spoken words and downloading some of the famous songs in this piece (its version by Hank Villiam 'I'm so lonely I could cry' would easily move you to tears). Perhaps one day the audience will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously (but not without some well-placed laughter). The film is moving at a pace (thanks to some nice montage), so some viewers will not find it boring and boring. Maybe it's just a revival in progress.
