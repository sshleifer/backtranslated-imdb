A great melodrama of the murders of the period, with Fontaine who effectively opposes his earlier naive type of vallflovers, in the role allegedly Olivia DeHavilland refused. That's fine, because Fontaine is wonderful. Written by Charles Bennett, who wrote in the 1930s for Hitchcock, and later wrote an excellent script for the classic British horror movie Night of the Demon. The introductory scene, where Ive visits the notorious prophet played by the beautiful Una O'Connor (spokesman James Vhale of fame), is a tour de force, and the film retains interest in numerous malicious intrigues. I hope that one day I will see this film on DVD, but desperate for it because it seems to be an undeservedly vague film. Fortunately, I had to see it at AMC some seven or eight years ago, but since then I have not seen it. Get him if you can!
