Perfect. A true and true presentation of the life of a pioneer ranch in the western plains with an emphasis on the role and place of women. Moving film, with love made, based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget, independent film; He never made money. Definitely not a romanticized, unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneering life.
