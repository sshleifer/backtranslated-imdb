This is unlike any other movie, the closest I can compare with Voody Allen ... But, as Voody Allen constantly understands human defects, Bret Carr seems to be trying to find a way to get caught up with this one crippled the uncertainty that defines us better or worse. In the case of Lou, this is the main cause of his stuttering, which can be traced to the trauma of a unique baby hood that is revealed through the flash of the back. There are so many weird neurotic people in I believe that everyone deserves a chance of redemption, although the diversity of human character ultimately makes the world so intriguing, so perhaps we should not repair our neuroses more than we should to repair our noses or breasts. /> <br /> This is an indie movie that was shot on long coats, but the production values ​​are huge as the volume of the movie. I feel like his weird gem for the self-help market. I really am looking forward to seeing what this film director will do next, I could imagine a career modeled on Voody Allen or Alberto Bruce, although usually when a guy like this goes, he leaves and the real "KS MEN" and his modest freak originated soon forgotten or are .... Ks Men is a bunch of freaks if I remember well :)
