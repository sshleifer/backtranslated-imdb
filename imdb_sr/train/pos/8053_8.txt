This is Sammy's great early comedy films. This is not a parody for entering the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him strangely and well for the man of his size. A nominal story of how the fighting continues to torture their loved ones - then they fight. Oh, fighting. Good, fast high-impact scenes (the white guy who plays the boxer looks like it really hurts one of Samm's strokes). There's a guy from Jim Kelly (one of the three experts hired to take Sammo), but he was a black-and-black African-worm. Come on, did not they have real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I guess I've seen a lot of white fake-as-hell of "Chinese people" in old American movies. This is one for every fan of Samma or Bruce Lee.
