Looking at how two brothers communicate and feed each other through the entire movie, I look forward to personally living in a rural area, as they did in the film. I watched this film in a wasteful way and had a book next to my Bible. After watching a movie, I agree that this is one of several movies that make justice. I recommend to everyone who has the opportunity to go to Montana to fish or to be outdoors. That's incredible. I can not think of anyone else who could play a role better than Brad Pitt. Make yourself righteous and watch one of the best movies in the modern movie era. STRICTLY RECOMMEND As a guide to fishing trips in Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to fly fish from the movie scene, because although it looks great on the movie, you have no idea how much it practices and the skills actually take. Thank you for listening. Watch this movie please if you want a long sad movie.
