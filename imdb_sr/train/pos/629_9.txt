The fourteen-year-old in me is immensely happy that now they can make truly fantastic fantasy films, and that they are all angry, what about the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Chronicle Narnia cash at the box office. This year, you will see (and already see) a few more, especially the Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on Neil Gaiman's novel, appeared this week in cinemas with just over one peep. I did not see any reviews, just a few commercials. A critical reaction is a kind of blah. I would not even see that I do not have to wait for a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and nothing else has opened up this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive a horrible dash, the stars are probably right aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a big movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your basic fantasy quest (the hero moves in search of a star-studded star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic line, the story is vivid and imaginative. The purpose is simply to be a fun and charming little romance. And it works beautifully. There were many great films this summer, but none of them was as entertaining as this one. Much is happening, but the story is well-told and almost completely coherent. It's not a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of terrain as something like Princess Bride (although I do not like it just like the previous movie). It's so much fun to be here if you are a fan of the genre.
