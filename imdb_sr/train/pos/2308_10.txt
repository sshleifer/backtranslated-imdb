I checked this as an impulse when I examined the movie store and I could not be surprised! My mom and I watched this movie together and we enjoyed it. It's not a typical "chick-flick" with a subtle love story and tears to the end, but definitely touches the nerve in the turn at the end. This is where, although unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film is not hurt. I think Reese Vitherspoon was a great actress even in this movie, her debut, and this is definitely worth watching! I did not recognize many supporters, but they all play important supporting roles. "Man on the Moon" is such a convincing story about a young teenager who first falls in love. Most women definitely can relate to everything - from Vitherspoon's words, her subtle views, and her not so subtle emotions (angry as a typical teenager). While playing the character confused about love, he does not encounter this as a stupid and immature person, which was highly appreciated given the many films today.
