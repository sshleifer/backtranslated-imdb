Beautiful Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter traveling with her team (Karen Lamm and Lois Ioung) in Solvang, California, to cover the Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodation has collapsed and all hotels in the city are full. They travel outside the city to a remote location and use the hospitality of seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (phenomenal Sidney Lassick). Would you not know, Ernest and the loving partner of Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) hide a great secret in their basement: poor, deformed, "Junior" (Stephen Furst, in remarkable performance), which finally terrorizes girls. Deliciousli unhinged Lassick plays a true monster in this disturbing little horror movie. It builds slowly but surely at an intense clash / pinnacle, releasing horror in small doses for the past half an hour. The hotel and the ominous basement - a great echo of "Psychas" here - great settings. Most of all, the perverse plot includes incest and patricides, allowing the movie to take on really dark quality. Nevertheless, it also becomes touching as we realize that Junior is not one-dimensional evil bahayd, but the same number of victims as girls. The last shot is particularly sad. "Invisible" is a solid little horror that is worth discovering. 8/10
