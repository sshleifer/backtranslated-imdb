I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw the Secret Voting (2001). Now I know about four times more (I doubt I have learned the whole story of Not Without My Daughter (1991)). Offside is a wonderful budget Iranian comedy about a group of girls individually) to attend the decisive football game for their country in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to attend football matches, so the armed forces of the nation are mobilized to save all women trying to get themselves out. Some (teenage) girls try to stab the party with clothes like boys, but they are caught. The film is usually placed in this pen, in which girls are detained by soldiers, waiting for an indefinite punishment (though the girl dressed as a soldier claims that there was one mark far from execution!)> The film explores the absurdity of the situation. The reflection that women refuse from football matches is that it is a too rude experience for a better sex, a philosophy that is not unknown in the West less than 100 years ago. This farce comes to a head when a girl should go to the bathroom so that a soldier who follows her demands to cover her eyes so she can not see the graffiti. Conflict is not fully tied to the battle of the poles: at one point there is friction between rural soldiers and urban girls. Fortunately, this film was not too culturally esoteric that comedy was lost to this neighbor and cultural relative of the Great Satan. You have to be in favor of it, but nobody should avoid this film because they think it will not get it.
