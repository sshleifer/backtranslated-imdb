MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about the great man, General Douglas MacArthur. This, of course, is a story of one of the great American military figures and a figure that has become known to me from the earliest moments in my memory. Although there is a question of continuity (maybe others), e.g. MacArthur's speech, presented in the film as a reference to the 1962 US Military Academy on accepting the Thaier Prize, did not contain the phrase "old soldiers never die, they only fade." (That was in his speech before the Congress after his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged disobedience (these two had not seen eyes in the eyes!) Gregory Peck was incompetent as the general who promised to return to the Philippines in World War II. The film quickly and easily starts with the general, his family and staff from the beginning of the Second World War to the end of his career. This film would have a much greater significance for those who knew the Second World War and the Korean War. Nevertheless, Peckov's portrait of this great man who fought with the double evil of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can remember is truly unforgettable. "There is no substitute for victory in the war."
