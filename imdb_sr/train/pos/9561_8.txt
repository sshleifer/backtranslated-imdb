"Ranma Â½" is my favorite anime Rumiko Takahashi. A woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, it's not just a comedy, but an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, Ranma is engaged in Akane because of the agreement of both her father, who are great friends and trained together for many years. Akane is the youngest and most sophisticated sister of Tendo: Kasumi is the oldest and very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and likes to win money regardless of everything. Ranma and Akane are constantly struggling, especially because they both have a very bad time, and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when it is sprayed with cold water as his father becomes a panda, many new characters and situations begin to reveal the cause of transformation: while wrinkled, Ranma and his father fell into the damn river, but not only did they have such a fate ... If you were watching Ranma 1/2 and loved, I would recommend you " Inuiasha 'and' Maison Ikkoku ', two more good creations from Rumik's hands.
