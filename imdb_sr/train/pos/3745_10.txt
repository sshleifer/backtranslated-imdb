Many mysterious stories accompany a standard journey: murder the worst, collect traces, build up potential perpetrators, spit red herring, and the inevitable clash between a clever criminal and even a smarter criminal. "Forgotten" leaves a well-beaten and gives us complex characters who may have committed or may not have done horrible acts. The fact that at the end of the three episodes we do not have easy answers and that no properly bound package could frustrate some, but for me it was an indication of an intelligently made story that sounds, disturbs and persecutes the question: What does an evil person look like? Excellent acting and production combine a mystery that can not be easily ... forgotten.
