Refreshing the 'lost' gem! With effective dialogue combined with great acting activity to identify characters and engage you enough to take care of what will happen to them. Douglas and Vidmark characters are real heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence. Vidmark won on the battlefield with fisticuffs, a car hunt that lasted less than 60 seconds with a "logical" end, and a long hunt on the footpaths that embarrass the overlapped sequences of the chase of modern Hollivood. You know how it will most likely end, but uncertainty and interest are maintained. The end of the pursuit is one of the most realistic ones you will ever see. It seems that the movie slows down the past, but stay with her for rewarding.
