This movie is fantastic. Finally, well-written characters you can love for all your good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is hysterical in this self-supporting role. I think that's the best thing he ever did. He also performed other roles that showed the nuances that were capable of this type of work, but this role ultimately gave him a place to work. I almost died when walking in the lobby of the hotel in the underwear and boots. Both Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are a couple who are also trying, as well as actors who are striving. Kinnear is so cute that his line in the end is really satisfying. Good actors give you a good job to play and they give us something more.
