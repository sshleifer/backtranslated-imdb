I really liked this movie. All three stars (Conneri, Fishburne and Underwood) give credible performances, and Harris enjoys on top. Lighting and shooting angles in some Harris scenes make his face look truly devilish. Surprisingly, turning it off makes it interesting. It's not a good movie, but it's nice. I gave her 7 out of 10.
