I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on it, so I thought I would check it. I thought it was a really wonderful movie and I can not wait to see it again. actors were really good and I loved all the music! there was not much talk in the film, which was at first somewhat strange - but when I entered it, I thought that the story and the acting were really emotional and meaningful and thought she had left a lot of imagination. I want to look at the movie again, because so many things happened that I forgot a lot of things, but I know I left the theater thinking about the movie. It was captured beautifully and the whole thing was truly unique.
