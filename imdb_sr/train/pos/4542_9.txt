Focused in the downtown and on the slopes of Detroit, this comedy I found was a great new comedic duo. 'Noriiuki Pat Morita' is a very funny man, who is by accident a cop from Japan on the thief of industrial secrets, who stole the proto-tip turbo super charger, reluctantly leaves for the United States to follow the thief after his commander ordered. Pat's character collides with 'Jai Leno's character, quick conversation', but all the way to the Detroit cop's businessman. However, when they cross the track, the honest Japanese meet a comprehensive Detroit police investigative 'Mode'. The two of them first stumble and cross over to each other, but then they develop a "rhythm" that turns into an explosive two-layer credible team that solves the case, cold. After fighting with a city criminal for stolen 'equipment' and closing the case, the two go from mutual contempt that friends and do well together. Slightly worse for wearing and the need for extended rest at the top of everything, they succeed in winning the closing ceremony. I evaluated this 9. The Levis direction makes this "almost perfect comedy." Fun for all ages. I recommend him high. (***)
