Gillian Holroid (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she was attracted by a completely normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stevart). She throws a spell on Shepa, which forces him to leave her bridegroom and fall for her. Things are going well until Gillian finds out that she cares about this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Heep react when he finds out that he is "deceived" to fall in love with Gillian? As far as comedies from the 1950s, Bell Book and Candle are good, but nothing spectacular. It's a pretty cozy clock and you should like almost anyone sitting with him. Just do not go into the film, expecting the biggest thing of sliced ​​bread. The film is cute, sometimes funny and in the end touches. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have real chemistry. Novak (as others highlighted) looks pretty incredible in an undervalued way. Support with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester is often ridiculous and ludicrous and steals a lot of reflexes from Novak and Stevart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can not completely decide what kind of film it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? If director Richard Kuine had only one approach, the film could be even better and more memorable.
