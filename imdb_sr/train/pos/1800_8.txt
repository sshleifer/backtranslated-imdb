All the dogs go to paradise at the ranking of Vatership Dovn for the scary movies of the boys. Both were gloomy and pretty mean, but at the same time the most enchanting experience a child can have. This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I was in love with Charlie, and in the age of five or six, I admit ... I fell in love with a cartoon dog. All dogs tell a dark story about the merciful Cad Charlie and his partner in the Itchi crime. The story starts with Charlie escaping from death to death and flies to the closest club to gamble. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this movie. I loved songs and animation, but as I grew older, I began to wonder why this film did not interfere with me as a young man. She deals with pretty adult topics - gambling, murder, hell and prison, but in the world of good Disney movies, it's something that every child needs to look at once. Yes, there is some crazy Transvestite crocodile scene, and hellish scenes scare me more when I was small, but it brings such a sharp message that parents can not ignore!
