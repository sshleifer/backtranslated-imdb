but I want to say that I can not agree with Moira. What a wonderful movie. I was thinking about this only this morning, trying to give advice to some small drug who lost money on his debit card through fraud, and wanted to say 'Keep your money in your pocket' and realized I was talking like James Mason. Even he did not say those words, I still think you would! I never forgot 'Do you carry?' in his reconciliation with his son, Hivel Bennet: 'You always have money in your pocket!' Good advice. Insufficient children have fathers with such unbearable but beneficial attitudes. Or any father. It would be good to re-establish 'you', 'yours' and 'yours' in our language to show that we care. It's the same as 'tutoier' in French or 'du' in German. Addendum: I just realized that many of my objections were about James Mason at The Familie Vai! I think that's because I mixed Susan George with Hailei Mills. Well, a bad mistake. I stand by the comments. Both spring and wine from Port are very similar to the family road. When you took the girl into the pictures these days, you really had something to say and talk about it later, something that influenced your knowledge of the world and your personal development. Theater experiences are almost real. and they are important in helping young people to grow up. Now that does not happen, I think teenagers can just go to the pictures as we are.
