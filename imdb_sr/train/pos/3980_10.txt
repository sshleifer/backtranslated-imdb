I watched this every night on VH1 last week. This is great revealing a portrait of the drug epidemic and how drugs were shown in the media during the late 60's and over 70's. Vh1 created a complete tangled picture of life and time during "Other Iears." From the Sanfrancisco Bai Area to Study 54, this documentary shows the evolution and progress in drug dealing and death and a new life that has breathed in American culture. Hippie movement, conservative resistance, and how drugs affect art (music, movies, etc.) With many fascinating interviews and newsletters. Madness Blov Boogie Nights
