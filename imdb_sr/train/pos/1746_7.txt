White Lugosi plays one of his rare good guys in a series based on a longtime radio hits (which was also the source of a feature film in which Lugosi played a villain). He did not get more roles in which he could be a good guy. Here, Chand is coming back from the East to help Princess Nadja, who is hunted by the leaders of the Ubati cult, who needs to bring back the high priest of their cult from the dead. This is a series that looks good. To make sure that the pacing is somewhat relaxed, more like one of the principals (production studios), then it's a rush of adventure, but it's still pleasant. This plays better than two feature films that are cut out of it, because it allows things to happen at their own pace, rather than feeling abrupt or feeling that "hey I missed something." One of the trilogy of three good series made by Lugosi, the rest were the SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Marines
