Really cool. Obligation for any snob of music. You really do not need to know about the bands to enjoy the movie. Before the movie, I heard only two songs from Dandy Varhols. The only thing that needs is an open mind. The film revolves around the massacre of Brian Jonestown. Dandi Varhols has a role in the film as "rival band" but are the second guitar for BJM. Dandy Warhols do not play such a big role in the film as I initially hit, but again, they did not have the element of excitement and unpredictability of BJM. and his very charismatic frontman, Anton Nevcombe. By itself, it is an insightful movie and is studying the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy it.
