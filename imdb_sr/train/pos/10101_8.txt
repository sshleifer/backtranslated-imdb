Dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictory film. The story through four parts combines a foolish action, humorous humor, touching humanity and philosophical issues that give rise to thinking. It's hard to believe that there was only one director, because the style changes from episode to episode. A movie that must be seen for anyone who loves anime.
