A very entertaining period in the thirties, it's a turning on the classic series of cliffhanger, just as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", only on a low budget and much more than the director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes combine the liberal amount of Gothic art, which preceded Batman in two decades. In the main role Ron Eli (Tarzan) as a perfectly performing hero and beautiful Pamela Hensley as the local Latin Mona who found our hero on a golden pursuit in a non-existent Latin American country Hidalgo. The best line, our hero Moni, holds a fist in the chin just as you expect to be gentle with her and hug her: "Mona, you're a brick!" ham and cheese, the captain must be an absolute pleasure. Expect a little "Raiders ..", a dash of "Batman", a little "The Lost Vorld", a little "Lost Horizons" and a lot of work and you will get it right. Beware of Michael Berriman's cult favorite in a small part as a funeral and enjoy the use of the patriotic music of John Philip Sous. The main candidate for the DVD edition is definitely too late. An indispensable treat for the whole family. 9/10
