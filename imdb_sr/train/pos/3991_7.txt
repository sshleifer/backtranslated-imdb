"If I sit down, I will never rise again," says the mother (her head) to her son when she tells her to rest (she's just a widow). He thinks that resting is what a woman of his age and in her situation must do: to rest in peace, to ignore herself. But she is not in favor of "rest", not yet. She also has a daughter who sues her for every disaster in her life ... Suddenly there is a discovery: sex and passion in the shape of muscular carpenters 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, the new James Bond) when "she thought no one else would ever touch ". It is a story that leads you to think about many things, especially about what a woman should do with her life when his husband dies. It seems we have not progressed in that sense. I mean, no one was surprised when Sean Conneri had a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think is different? Old woman, young man ... nah, you're not ready for that, do you? The film has intimate tones along the length, except for 2 or 3 sequences in which tones break down and some explicit and misdemeanor dialogues emerge. These vulgar touches and the way the son and daughter reveal the mother's love affair (pretty absurd - you'll know what I mean when you look at) - the only inconsistent elements in the "Mother". My rate: 7/10
