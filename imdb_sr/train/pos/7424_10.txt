I was 16 years old when I first saw a movie, and it was always my big favorite movie. Of course, you can not deny Christofferson's appeal in the film - HOW A FINE MAN ???????????? Sheesh. It's still. He's a bad guy that every woman secretly wants. His action is flawless. He played drunk / drug only in the way someone really went through it - and he is - '76. He finally got into the car, so everything was real. The music is EXCELLENT and although in later years I thought Streisand was something that was not the right person for him in the physical sense, I think it's more of a problem for male viewers than for women. We girls just look at Chris - and of course the guys are looking at the female interest - my husband can not watch the movie b / c of her - she does not like her look. But I made him sit only through the red Ferrari scene on the way to the end, just to see how it was done well - the camera's performance was so perfect and you were completely in the car with him with music - It should have been I see on my 50-inch plasma - VOV !!!! And finally, the quality of the transmission is GREAT - an anamorphic videscreen and really clear with brilliant color and very low noise except for the dark areas that is normal for all the movies. > <br /> I returned some great memories to my mother and I on this movie together, I bought her a copy for Christmas. I'd like to watch her last night. I'm trying to sit through the original with Judy Garland, but I guess I'm watching this first, I just can not get in the previous period Watching all the concert footage in '76. time. I work my way through Streisand's comment, but it seems to only talk about myself and hitherto I barely mentioned Chris or details about the scenes in the movie. Her voice sounds exactly the same as then. Check if you are adult at the same age as I (born in 1960), you will like it. Wendy
