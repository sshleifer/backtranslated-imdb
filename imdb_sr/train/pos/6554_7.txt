OK is what I say: The movie was great. I am a great fan of the Nancy and I read all the original books from 1-56 and I continued to read more. I'm now at 96. Beware of the villains who give this film a lower grade than they should. All the traces point to a wonderful movie! I loved the whole thing. So, what is the Nancy in the present time. She's still old-fashioned like she's in the books! People who have not read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's view. I read them all and I think that Emma is perfect and that the Nancy was perfect. I found parts of the film of the ghostly. I loved exciting car loves and got the roads. I loved the tracks. I solved the mystery myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you see it because people who complain do not know anything about what a good movie is and B about Nanda Drev. Go see. Maybe Oscar is not a decent, but really good movie.
