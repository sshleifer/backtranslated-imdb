For my project in the field of humanistic studies for the school, I decided to trade with people. After some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching and I'm still thinking about it. All I can say is "Vov". It's such an attractive story about a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric trying to save her. The ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not happy, it's really realistic. It's incredible and I recommend it to everyone! You're really dating Holly and Patric, and your heart breaks for her and for what's happening to her. I loved him so much and now I want to know what will happen again!
