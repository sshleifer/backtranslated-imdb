Verhoeven's film was complete and complete garbage. He's a disgusting hacker of the director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, he bored and decided to make everything from scratch. Heinlein would NEVER support this trash that he was alive to see it. Basically, she's stealing a name, ruining the politics of the book (which is a good part of it), and throwing some T & A, so the American average idiot does not get bored. This anime is not perfect, but at least mostly accurate, the best I know.
