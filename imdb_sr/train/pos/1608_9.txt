Observation of "Moon" after so many years is a reminder that this movie was sweet and sensational funny when it first appeared. Who knew Cher could play? Who ever heard of Olimpija Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was director Norman Jevison. <Br /> <br /> The only really flat notes in this great work is "" Moon "is like a big pizza," Amore ", a song that is too often sings in the film (sometimes it is already too) and that had a long life in popular music. Cher is - excuse me - sensational as Loretta Kastorini, a widow who wants to get married and does not have to fall for the groom. Aiello (Johnny Cammareri) is obliged by suggesting that she offered her a ring as a substitute for an engagement ring , and then went to Sicily to be with his mother who was dying. He accused Loreto of taking care of his tain brother Ronni attend the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronnie and quickly falls in love with him. In the meantime, her father (Vincent Gardenia) cheats on his mother (Olimpia Dukakis) by Loretta accidentally revealed when Ronni calls in metropolitan opera. <br / > <br /> Everything works in the end, as it inevitably does in films of this genre. in the meantime, all the actors are wonderful left to the audience to enjoy. in his own way, "Moonstruck" is a Hollywood was at its best: a fun game without of any social significance. If they only lost "It's Amore" by the way, it would be perfect.
