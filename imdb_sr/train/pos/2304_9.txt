I thought this film was very well made. From the mid-1950s, everything seemed to me exactly. She was good and convinced. I usually do not care about this type of film, because they simply do not have any depth, but I felt that this film was dealing with characters and that you could feel how they feel, you must really know them and take care of them. She brought me back to my youth and let me remind myself of the innocent time. This film could be enjoyed by both male and female and all age groups. At the end of the film, I wanted to have another part. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This film will surely be a classic. If you have not seen him, try catching him when he is on the TV or renting it ...
