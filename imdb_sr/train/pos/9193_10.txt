It's very true with the original manga of the same name, called (Tramps Like Us in the US), but it can still be enjoyed even if you have not read the manga. It's a different type of tail, showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else. However, because of her external power, she fears she will show her inner feelings and so that they around her are hurt by their dull comments. The only one who really stands out and who can be relaxed is her new pet ... human ... Momo. If you want something different from normal boring things with some amazing actors / resumes from J-Dorama (Japanese drama) then this is definitely a watch for watching ... and reading!
