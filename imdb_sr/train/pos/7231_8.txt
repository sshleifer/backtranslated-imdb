Common feline and mouse ludor abounds until Jerry jumps into the bottle of invisible ink. He got a great idea to torture Tom without knowing it. The cat becomes wise and tries to do something to "see" her, even if it's not foolish. Of course, Jerry gets Butch aka Killer aka Spike the dog (even if he's late in the short term, and his contribution is really minimal). . Most gags work and everything is violent as it would be good and good. This hilarious cartoon can be found on the disc of one of the DVD's Spotlight collection "Tom & Jerry" My Rating: B +
