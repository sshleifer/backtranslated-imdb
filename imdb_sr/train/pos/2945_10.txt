I watched this movie several times in the nineties and almost broke every side. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this is something else. He's so funny. Even P.C. The brigade would consider this ridiculous. It has to be watched, and even better if you have guys or girls on a drink. Michael Jackson's take-off is like him, if you close your eyes, you believe he's singing. The things she describes are true for life and you would seriously have to overcome humor if you thought it was not funny. My local video stores no longer own this video, but I would like to grab my copies to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to value humor. In any case, highly recommended, I hope you enjoy it.
