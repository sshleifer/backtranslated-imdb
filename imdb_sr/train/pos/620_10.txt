Neil Gaiman (writer MirrorMask) wrote a nice story about Stardust, and this is a really good story. I think it would attract all fans of the labyrinth, princess or the 10th kingdom, yet it is completely unique and standing on its own. And I feel that the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was portrayed in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I will not spoil it. The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and slave slavery kept by the witch in the realm of the villa. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a star-drop, Tristan promises to return her to the girl he is in love with. She is not aware that the star has assumed the shape of a girl in the world of villas and that she has others. Three older witches, who want to use her heart to become young again, and some princes who argue. It's a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visual impressions. It is charming and I feel that it is possible to watch children and adults of all ages. It's just magical. It's a classic fairy tale, which I have not seen in cinema since the 1980s.
