I'm not wholly picky about horror films, and I'm ready to watch almost all of them. That does not mean that I am willing to look at them again, or that I will not have any criticism for them. This film is nasty and very well made. In fact, I think this film would be an excellent double account with Session 9. I should specify, before I get to my comments, that I was watching this alone. I started looking at it before I went to bed, and I got about 15 minutes before I realized it was too effective, so I kept the rest for the morning. Even while he was looking in the middle of the day, he was still creepy. However, I can not guarantee how effective this will be when looking at a larger group. After the death of their daughter, the couple move to the remote cabin as a means of trying to come up with this death. Let me record this death - this is one of the few films that does not fear the death of a child. This is much more important, because it determines the tone at the same time, as well as explains the many acting that spills the film. The couple does not go well. The woman moved away from the bond and her husband was doing everything she could to try to get her back. While some comments complained about their actions - one stated that they acted more like a father and daughter than a husband and wife, and that is legitimate. She tries to give her more direction. It is a role that men sometimes take. In the film there is a lot of fear, and the majority is quite non-violent, although grotesque in some way. The story itself feels very simple for most of the film, and it's a strange turning point at the end. While the turn is not absurd, it's certainly not what you expected from the way things progressed. Moody, atmospheric and very well made for something that appears to have been filmed on the video.
