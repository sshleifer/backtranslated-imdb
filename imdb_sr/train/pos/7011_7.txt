First I liked this movie. It was good of all. However, I do not understand the comments I hear from people about the sudden ending. I did not know anything about this film, except for some of the "I see" recommendations, but I knew where the plot went in less than ten minutes. (I will not mention what caused me to break a good movie for others.) However, despite its obvious obviousness, I constantly watched. It was nice to see how everything is going on, filling in the details and motivating the characters in later scenes. I do not hate when I assume that the ending is early in the movie. I hate it only when the path to resolution is lined with boring landscapes. The staff of the Vill Smith screen is simply delightful, even when playing such a troublesome figure. He is energetic and convinced of everything I've seen. Seven pounds is another great performance. Rosario Davson is a solid performer, showing an unusual, rather optimistic character despite the terminal state of the heart. Beauty is in the eye of an observer, and with Rosario, if you do not find it, you should consider replacing your eyes. It was nice to see Woody Harrelson on the screen. I have not seen much of it lately, but it could only be me. The ward did not have a huge amount of time on the screen, but he sold his cheerful, piano, blind character to everything that was worth it. Perfect. Brief research on the jelly box tells me that his poison is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic, and dermatonic. I think this is a questionable choice for both the pet and the plot. All in all, I have to recommend this film not for drawing, but for some very good performances and for the fact that it has to provoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid.
