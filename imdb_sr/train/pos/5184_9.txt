A deeply witty but sincere comedy about the crowd of adults (Bill Pakton, Julie Varner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who are invited to spend a week in Tomavka, a camp in (Ontario) Canada from their former Consul (Alan Arkin). Writer / Director Mike Binder used his experience in the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and intelligible yarn that makes sense. Also, the movie has many funny moments, some of which are quite bizarre as my favorite, which is the use of a masking tape. Nevton Thomas Sigel ("Common Suspects", "Three Kings") gives the film some impressive footage of Canadian wildlife. Among the actors, Sam Raimi, director of the films "The Evil Dead" and "The Gift", appears here as Arkin's untidy right-hander. One more thing, this film convinced me that the camp does not have to be a place of bloody murders.
