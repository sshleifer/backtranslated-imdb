If I watch a movie and I do not watch the clock or hour once to see how much it will last or when I hope that the last scene is not the end of a movie, it must be pretty good. I am not a film internist or a film dissenter. I watch movies and if I'm interested in the end, then they are pretty good, because some of the most attractive critical films are bored to death (English patient, Shakespeare in love, reconciliation, crash.) This film was interested and absorbed. The show is great, the story is Absolutely original, the technique glittering was very affective, but Citizen Kane was inserted into it when Hoffman destroyed his apartment after Tomei left him, but I forgave him for seeing him as Loyalty, not breakup, Orson.
