I would not like to comment on how good the film was or what the disadvantages were because I am not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge to make films. What I know is that such a film in the first shot is a great achievement and I want to congratulate the director on this. However, in some of the reviews I read, the critics complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not emphasized, and his brothers and sisters were completely erased from the story. Now I really want to raise a point here, as the name of the film suggests, it's not a film about Hiralal's brothers, it's a film about the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son, Hiralal Gandhi, nothing more. If we begin to complain that some characters are out of action in the movie, it would be a bit unfair because these characters do not fit into the picture, no matter how relevant they are in real life. So I think it would be better to stick to the main ideas and to stop satisfying the critics in ourselves. Enjoy !!!!
