This film plays well with the audience. Especially when it starts running. In addition, Trevor Howard with his clever, clever charm and Jean Simmons with his innocent behavior and piercing eyes are brilliant together. The film starts as a psychological drama, but after the assassination it turns into a thriller for a hook like two guiding the head for the border. Some may think the pursuit is superfluous, but in fact the drive is crucial because it helps to clean the mind of Jean Simmons by pulling out of the oppressive household, plus helping to make a real killer - who suddenly puts himself in such a position that they have to finish the job . The killer rightly believed that when he arrested Simon's character, he would be removed. And the truth is that its lack of control in the household - and the evidence that shows her way - there is no way to get out of the charge of murder. The potter that creates helps to discover the truth. This is a fun movie. Find him if you can find him.
