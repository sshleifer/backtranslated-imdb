This film gives a strong comment on the Italian people of that time. The use of mirrors to improve the discovery of characters is wonderful and I can not mention the beauty and magnificence of Sophia Loren and Mastroiania. I love them both. Their way of interaction is so beautiful and natural that you can ask if the camera is actually there. The husband, in his short role, is also well represented as a fascist Italian who commands his wife and children, but in his own way, the father is full of love. The initial scenes with Hitler in Piazza Venezia with all the Italians are incredible and really set the film historical. I loved a movie and I agree that it is funny that it is not known.
