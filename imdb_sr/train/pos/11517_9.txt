If you enjoy Cleese and all the British 'Pithoneskue' humor of that time, then this little gem is absolutely funny. Arthur Love is a real treat! I saw it with friends on TV when it first came out, and its classic quotes formed a part of our joke for 30 years, and it will forever! I have it on a tape and I constantly appreciate it. Maybe some reviewers take it too seriously. I can not believe it is now available only in the US (NTSC course), not in the UK, where it should be an essential part of the history of British humor!
