Okay, the movie will not win any prize and it's pure chewing gum, and it's a modern version of "It's a wonderful life". But it just turned out to be a cheap edition on DVD and has a lot of worse ways to release $ 13. You get a movie that has a surprisingly strong role, but for the majority they were another year or two after they became famous B list. However, this is a pleasant way to pass an hour and a half, just do not think too much about it.
