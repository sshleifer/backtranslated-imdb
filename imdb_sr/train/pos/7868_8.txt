Again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you to drive to the wild. It is remarkable, literally and figuratively. sharp focus here. In a typical tabloid fashion, their worlds are unveiled, with every colorful story that is itself a smart subgroup. a pedophile businessman and his neurotic woman, journalist and captain of the police; all the shades on the screen and innumerable nuances between. Atul Kulkarni has a shot, as Boman Irani and Sandhia Mrudul. The Sen Sharma concourse is effective as a former reporter in the former crime scene, but it could have been a little isolated in line with job shifts and party cars. a refreshingly different movie, worth the money.
