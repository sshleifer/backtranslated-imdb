When I first saw this movie, it was a long time ago on VHS-Video. I liked this movie because it was funny and exciting. A few years ago, I saw another film, called: * The Incredible Adventure of Andy Colby * In this film were the parts * The Wizard of the Lost Kingdom * in which they were used. I started looking for "KOR" for many years, because I wanted to see a complete movie, not just the parts that were used in the movie * Andi Colby * -Movie. None of the stores produced this Kor-Movie, and none of the stores knew this film. For many years I watched my old VHS cassettes I had at home, and what a miracle ... I've had this movie for many years at home, but the film had a different title, because in Germany there are 3 or 4 titles. So I was lucky to find this tape at home and this time I had a lot more time to look again at the KOR Conqueror. Music is great during a movie movie, but the best part of shooting in combination with music is this moment, when KOR is walking drunk through the green forest. Background music had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson, and the boy who played Simone in the movie. Both of them did their job well.
