Okay, it looks like the Oskars get a little more every year. And I cheered on the Gosford Park to win (come on, Robert Altman has earned an Oscar for years!). In this regard, I assume that it was high time for an African American to win the best actress. Unlike the previous reviewer, Halle Berry's role in the "Monster's Ball" was far more original than Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; I would never have thought of calling it anything, especially in the year that I saw "Mulholland Dr." Among the things I predicted were the attacks on September 11; I knew he would say something about freedom. Yes. Robert Redford should know better. But contrary to the previous reviewer, Vhoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (among the past hosts was Bob Hope, for whom I have no respect); I really liked her blow to John Ashcroft. Well, although I would not give "A Beautiful Mind" the best picture, "The 74th Annual Academy Award" I'm still satisfied (I have to admit, I enjoy the Oscars more than my birthday). And the afternoon, while my parents and I walked through the apartments in Bandalier, New Mexico - it was springtime - I thought to myself that when Jim Broadbent won the Oscars, most people are looking to ask "Who is it?" I wonder if Voody Allen ever again attending the Oscars.
