I have never seen a movie of Barbara Steele that I did not like, and I have always been a booster for a good story about the house (especially for such wonderful pictures as "The Legend of a Hellenic House" and the original version of "The Haunting." " so that I had the feeling that the "Blood Castle" would be in my alley. And the boy, was it ever? This French-Italian co-production, although it may not be the classic of Steele's first horror film, "Black Sunday ", it remains to this day, it is still an extremely atmospheric, cold item in the ghost genre. It was shot in black and white technics The film deals with a journalist betting on one Lord Blackwood and an author named Edgar Allen Poe who can spend the night at Blackwood's castle on the night of All Saints, when the spirits killed in the castle are reviving their fate again. The viewer can see these deaths, and they are mostly horrible. The film is really sending the thrill of the theater spine, and in the uncut DVD that I just watched - thanks to the good people in Sinapse - it even has a surprising scene in toples and mild lesbians! And Barbara is wonderful in this movie; her second-class beauty is well-used to play a nice spectrum. Her very presence turns a furious story of ghosts into something truly unforgettable. Nothing is called the Queen of Horror.
