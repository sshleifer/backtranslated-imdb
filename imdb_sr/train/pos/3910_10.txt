So at home, I switch channels one night, and I encounter this guy who wears heels and makeup, standing in front of the colored background on HBO. Of course, I made a double shot and decided to watch a little. I did not change the channel until it was over, it was so incredibly funny. The next time I was shooting, I made sure to film it so that I could watch it over and over, and it remained one of my favorite things to watch. In the first few minutes, you can say that the audience is not quite sure what to think, but quickly conquer them with their incredible humor and wit. While many stand-up comedians gather in my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it's nice to hear jokes about history and puberty when most comedians hold up to date events. His broadcast was with me after that. I went to Italy over the summer, and the only thing I could think of was that "the Italians are always on the scooters that go" CIAO ... "" 10 out of 10. See. You will not regret it.
