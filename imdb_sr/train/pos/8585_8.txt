Engagement, the story of a captured army of the American army that has to prove its innocence in order to avoid the executioners. Paul Riker avoids friendly fire in a seemingly condemned attempt to convince a military court that he is actually an American spy in a secret mission in Korea. In the spirit of the classic courtroom drama, "Sergeant Riker" is an extremely well-formed mystery, skillfully led by exceptional acting power, with the constant momentum of the director of the Kulik and with effective complications and bandages. this revision in the presence of many "names" of actors, and some action sequences. Dilman, who has reiterated his role, is on the spot as a suspicious defense attorney, whose attention is sometimes drawn to the personal situation of Riker's support, but somewhat distant spouse, played by Vera Miles. Rounding the front line is Peter Graves for the prosecution, and Norman Fell and Murrai Hamilton on key supporting roles. Reverse behavior is questioned by the desperate circumstances in which it is located. Marvin fits perfectly with resigned indifference, passionate determination, giving a convincing, often intense performance that is the culmination of this otherwise small drama. This performance should raise the film on a platform where it occupies the spot on the best court drama lists. However, despite the apparent ambiguity, "Sergeant Riker" remains a tense and remarkable overview, as a book you just can not let go. Recommended.
