I did not see the BSG, I tried to look at it once in the middle of the show, but I could not get into it. However, yesterday I saw Capric Rebirth I lost a little bit, so I decided to watch Pilot today and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising performance and the only side effect she has had on me is that I now want to watch BSG. hardcore BSG fan to figure out what's happening on Caprica. From what I read in the network, they tried to reach the female population as BSG reached more men, and at least in my case, I did it. watch the show from the beginning, starting with Pilot.
