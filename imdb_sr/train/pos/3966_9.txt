JAMES STEVART plays the FBI agent who started working with the agency before he was called the FBI, and the story includes dealing with Ku Kluk Klan, the Era ban gangsters, German and Japanese spies from World War II, etc. years of history; far superior to all the films that were made these days. Of particular interest to older viewers who are familiar with Washington. In the scene about 20 minutes in the film - where James Stevart learns from Vera Miles that she is expecting their first child - the scene was filmed at the Herzog's Seafood Restaurant on the former Washington waterfront, the only film in which this historic film shows the location. Shortly after assuming office, President Kennedy decided that Southwestern Washington, a 99% black neighborhood, be thrown in the eye and be demolished. According to a decree that corresponds to his position of an undisputed royal family, the whole area, including the popular districts of restaurants on the coast, but excluding 3 historic churches; was reduced to ruins. The black people who were thrown out of their homes moved as best they could and without the help of the Federation; Likewise, businesses are simply out of business, and several have re-located them. The restaurant Rov was turned into a sidewalk, and Washington had no water (restaurants, seafront boats, boats, etc.). About 10 years ago. As a lifelong resident, the Herzog restaurant was our first reason to look again at this fine movie.
