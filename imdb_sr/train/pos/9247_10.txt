I expected this film to be a romantic from the 1930s. The boy meets a girl, falls in love, the boy loses a girl, the boy is conquered at the end. That was not the case at all. Clark Gable plays concert artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and futile eyebrows. He is hiding from a cop when he enters the flat Ruby (Jean Harlow), that he finds it covered with bubbles in the bathtub, no less. Current chemistry. She plays very hard for a while, but a girl can resist that smile for so long. The heat between them is obvious and there are some scenes that are definitely a pre-production code! When the work of blackmail goes bad and Ruby ends up at the "upset girls" boarding house, she is miserable and, owing to the fact that her roommate gives it, she begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays great Ruby, who speaks fast. Never allows Gable to get all the good lines! The scene is particularly moving with her playing "their songs" on the piano that behaves perfectly. I cry every last fifteen minutes each time. A really sweet romance.
