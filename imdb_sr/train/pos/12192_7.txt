This 1947 film starring and directed by Orson Velles (with a funky Irish accent), and also starring Rita Haivorth with less attractive short blond hair. So, I had previously been in contact with Orson in the Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man, etc. But this was my first interaction Rite Haivorth. Our first meeting went well, she is doing her job well frightened by Else, married lawyer of the rich. Mike (Velles) and Elsa fall to one another. She wants to run away with her, she does not know if she can live without things that money can buy. Elsa, her husband, and his partner are arguing and biting, just like the sharks that Mike describes as attacking each other, and his prediction proved to be too true. A few turns and shifts follow this mystery of murder as we reach the climax of the fun house. (Think of the final shooting in Man with a golden pistol, which has hardly borrowed this scene). I was not sure who the killer was. This film is like shrimp in white port and lemon. The center is centered on the sea, subtly, sour and strong, all the way to a great effect. These may not be the best, fresh shrimps, but quality frozen scampi from Costca. Tasty sauce increases the nature of pink shrimp while filling a healthy, but full alternative to ordinary, common dishes. 7/10 http: //blog.mispace.com/locoformovies
