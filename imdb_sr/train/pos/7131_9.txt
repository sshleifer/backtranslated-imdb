This movie made for TV is great. This is probably the best and favorite role of BAFTA winner John Thaw (Kavanagh K.C. and Inspector Morse). Tom Oakley (Thav) widower lived in the village for some time since his wife and son died, and now landed with the evacuated name Villaim Beech (Nick Robinson). As he introduces this child, he begins to develop friendship. While Villaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) does not want him back. After Tom cares that Villiam does not contact him, he goes to London to find him. In the end, Villaim gets her home with a loved one (or daddy). During the Second World War, this is a great movie. He was nominated for the BAFTA Lev Grade Award, and won the National Television Award for the Most Popular Drama. John Thav was number three on the 50 biggest television stars. Very good!
