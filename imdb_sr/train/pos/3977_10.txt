Personally, I've been watching this video for the 60s and 70s. It was fascinating to find out how the drug movement actually began and became pop culture and possibly an uncompromising force in life. Interviews with classic rock stars are wild and witty. You feel as if you are in secret and are kissing your head at the same time ... because it is so well known. I loved it, all segments from the 60's to the present. I recommend this for all aspects, including rock music, hyper-movement, politics and good history. I marked a box that says it contains a spoiler, just because I have no idea what some might consider as a spoiler or not, since I was discussing what is in all four segments so I wanted to be sure.
