This movie has a very simple but smart premise - an unemployed man trying to steal from the store, and a shopkeeper caught him in the act ... the thief escaped with the seller right after him. All the time the shopkeeper is in trouble with a low rank of Iakuza chinpira (gangster). In pursuit of a thief, they caught Iacuze who was looking for a shopkeeper. The story is then moved to high speed in the form of Tom & Jerry (cat and mouse), but it is added to the dog that catches the cat. Ceo 2. akt D.A.N.G.A.N. The runner (it can be translated into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS") is about the pursuit, and the pursuit continues to the extent that by the end of the second act, the boom forgets why he escapes, and Iakuza I do not remember which of the two boys he is he remembers why he is running away from him. Like the SABU's later movie POSTMAN BLUES, most of the movie is simply all action, with lots of physical comedy and dark humor injected to keep the audience engaged. What's missing is the end where the hunt ends when three men remain steamy and one of the most chaotic Mexican stalemates you'll see on a movie that looks almost like Sabu honoring Tony Scott TRUE ROMANCE (written by Kuentin Tarantino).
