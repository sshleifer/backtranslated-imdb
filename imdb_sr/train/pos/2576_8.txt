I am the "generation of Christopher Reeve", it's fair to say that he was the best actor who was still playing Superman, but that does not stop me from enjoying other actors in the role, and George Rivers makes a pretty good bidding ticket Chris leaves the top, although it hardly lags behind. This does not stop me from enjoying this movie, there is much to do with it. She has everything she needs, a plot with the beginning, middle and end, plus all those parts are intelligently written. The film is sharp and in the acting and story, something like film-noir, but with hoolaho. The story is both exciting and meaningful, this is a movie with a message that is not too unreasonable. I'm still amazed that it was filmed for more than 12 days, Hollywood's celebrity days, when we did not have to wait for 5 years to see if the film would fall into hell ... The film is polished and expertly developed, directed by Lee "Roll" em "Sholem, best known for direction and speed and efficiency. It never allows the limitations in technology to slow down, in fact there are some creative things that are made to create the effect of the flight, including putting the camera on the boom on the truck and recording a high and fast trip that would look like we see from Superman's point of view, also a few George's major plans in the work process, and a long shot of the animated Superman. This is now available on DVD as an additional feature of the first season of the television series George Reeves. DVD worth of possession, inclusion of the film as an original whole, is a cake on a cake. Bring Blood Today God Blessed!
