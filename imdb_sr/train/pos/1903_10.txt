Okay, even if you can not handle Lisa, this movie is really hilarious! Scenes with John Gielgood are compensating Lisa. One of the true romantic comedic classics of the 20th century. Dudley Moore seems to have drunk and irresponsibly looked cute and fun and it's damn fun to watch! One-liners are the best.
