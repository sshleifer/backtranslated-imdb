this film was almost a great imaginative film. A mixture of Shakespeare's, pop, jazz and faerie stories. This film was a fantastic twist on the Cinderella theme. With a powerful acting team, headed by Kathleen Turner, this film had everything to do with it. All except production values. I almost never think the movie needs special effects or big budgets, but with such a high-end production, it came to the same quality as every other made for a tv movie. Apart from better cinema, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
