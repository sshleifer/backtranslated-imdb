If only the thought of Arthur Askei takes your courage, do not worry, you can still watch and love The Ghost Train, like the equally beautiful Back Room Boi, it's a movie that's just too damn good to sink one performance, even an actor. I personally love Askai, maybe because I go to his world, rather than unreasonably expecting to come to my, which is a mistake that many people make. The train of ghosts is so intensely atmospheric that you can not watch it without being overwhelmed by the deep, dark world you are transporting, it's a dive in a way that a few cheap and cheerful flags managed to be during the desperate early forties and it's a movie that I would imagine that a few people have ever watched only once. The actors, without exception, are exceptionally good, maybe Linden Travers puts it a little dense, but on the background of a lonely railway station in the war, she was scarcely able to play and did not stand out. The sad passion of the lovely Carole Linne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible movie and now it's really in the past, but patiently waiting to press the paychecks.
