"Fox" is a movie that is remembered for the portrait of teenagers in the late 1970s. Since I'm exactly Jodie Foster, I was referring to this movie. It deals with frustration, temptation, relationship and rebellion of young people. Soundtrack is excellent with an inspiring rock, for example. "More Than a Feeling" from Boston and sad numbers like "On the Radio" by Donne Summer. The music of my late teenagers. Yes, I will always remember this, even if it was not huge.
