For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a hidden gem at TGIF (and later, early school afternoon repetition). Each episode had a maniac, energetic energy and a quick fire that overcame a casual unpleasant joke. Melissa Joan Hart sang a sharp talent for physical comedy, especially in facial expressions. Her two aunts, played by "straight men", or as straight as they could be two witches, had excellent comic timing and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, as a vocal cat, was free to deal with any crazy scheme he was interested in, and he could laugh and take it all step by step, for he was, after all, speaking as a cat. Sabrina's friends rounded up their social experience in school, which included a typical "evil supporter" and "totalitarian principle". Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to combine pop culture (eg Bands of that era, Jerry Springer), archetypal human condition / morality (eg The Importance of Friendship, the Spirit of Christmas), and literally representing similar metaphors in the Magical Empire. Unfortunately, like many other shows on television, the show has peaked during the first three years, which coincided with Sabrina in high school. Beginning from the fourth season, the transition to college marked what would be a sudden decline in the overall quality of the show, especially when the writers decided to meet Josh as Harvey's rivals and inventing a thin excuses for Aunte and Zelda to remain on the screen as key players. The final season, in which Sabrina works in a pop culture magazine, was unequivocally disappointing. Nevertheless, in the end, Sabrina (especially high school years) remains a unique entry as a hybrid situational comedy with magic elements that rise above the boring tariff that is produced each year in this genre.
