Tom had a desire to make a movie for a long time and he did it. it's as if he visualized a dirty and exhausted notebook full of big little ideas that he filled and wore about 10 years ago. there is no character transformation, no Hollywood ingredients are just life and little magic. balance, in speed, in the wonders of comedy and drama, is perfectly measured. this movie takes you to a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was. the music is great and your eyes will be equally pleased. The fact that this movie is nothing, just a series of sketches of people who are mostly connected by a game of one of the characters makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining, brilliant because it is empty. between rows is happening. to see or not to see, is it?
