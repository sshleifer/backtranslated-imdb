dear story ........ voted ten against all the average for my year and a half ... not all that comedy is comical (compared to the almost humid film), although it's funny enough. I do not really love musicals, probably a bit too much for me, but they give you time to take a drink or juice without missing anything important. Perhaps the version of the fifties when Harry met salli? Ahab is not really, but if it's in your top ten like mine, you'll love this movie. she really just leaves you with a warm feeling unclear, reminding you of what romance could and should be, something to shoot. my summary best describes in a very few words ..... quite charming
