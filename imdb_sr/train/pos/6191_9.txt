Hartley's films seem to have been hit or missed in most of the audience. This film will not be an exception to that rule. Fai Grim is the sequel to Hartley's 'Henri Foole' in 1998. The focus of this time is on Henry's ex-wife (perfectionally always welcomed by Parker Posei), to whom the CIA is blamed on Henry's unpublished book by his suspicious work. In the meantime, Fai ends in odyssey, deals with international spies, etc. The film was stuck in the second half. If in the past you admired Hall Hartley, this should not be missed. For a newcomer to the first traveler Hartley who just heard of his movie technique, you may want to look at his earlier films before you download this (especially if you have not seen Henry yet). I admired working with cameras, which sometimes reminded me of a certain early Man Man photo.
