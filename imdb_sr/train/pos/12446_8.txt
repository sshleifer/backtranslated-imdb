When I heard about Modesty Blaise, but I never read a novel or comic book, my husband and wife loved the film very much. He delivered, in an astonishing way, a good introduction to the character and its background. Although it has some elements of action, it's a much more intimate performance, greatly written. Unfortunately, this is also where the great lack of film is revealed. An intimate game lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the actors. While Alekandra Staden did an excellent job like Modesta Blaise, her colleague Nikolai Coaster-Valdau - as a criminal Miklos - is not. Laughing through the plot, as if it were an extended commercial toothpaste, she failed to build an atmosphere of anxiety that would make the film a masterpiece. The support is somewhat similar, from some stereotypical gangsters and hooks to the decent performances of Fred Pearson as Professor Loba and Eugenie Iuan as Irine.
