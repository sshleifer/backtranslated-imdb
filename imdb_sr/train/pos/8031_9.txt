This is a military drama I love a lot! Tom Berenger plays War Beckett Thomas Beckett. This Marine is a nonsense, in your face, and there are no questions that would ask the type of person who would do the job. There you have Billy Zane ("The Fantom" and others) playing Richard Miller, the former SVAT format D.C., works for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! When these two are steaming, sparks should fly. And how. However, Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat how it works. When a second sniper strikes, it's a savvy against a cat, a cat against a mouse, a gunman against an attacker. And when an experienced sniper is caught, Miller is putting politics aside and saving him. Who needs a policy when you are a professional like Beckett, he received orders from none other than himself, played by rules, not a book, and mutual respect was made in spite of politics. The film was a direct hit. Watch. Rated 4 out of 5 stars.
