went in 60 seconds. where to start, keeps you in the movie with some good actions and some great cars. people say it's not a good movie, and I disagree with the certainty that it has some cheesy parts, but what an action movie does not do. I gave him 8 out of 10 causes of action and a comic relief if you like Rock or Face Off, but this film is right on your street cage dose a good job together with one of the most impressive actors in my mind - Roy Lindo. I think that sometimes people look far into movies sometimes you have to sit back to enjoy the movie and after a word ask yourself if they achieve what they are showing. meaning if those going to action were an action pact. are they where they try to make a movie to change the way movies are made and try to win every prize from their well? I think they made an action movie that they intended to do, give it a chance and you will not be sorry.
