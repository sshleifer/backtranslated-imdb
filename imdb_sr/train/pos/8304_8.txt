I caught this movie late evening / Sunday morning with my brother. We drank. This is one of the best separation movies I've ever seen. From the 'luxury' ocean, which is actually a roll on, roll off ferry, complete with iron iron all the way to the door with sticky stickers that the staff tells, and then watching the same doors are used for something else in the second scene - this film is a stone! ! Continuity is so poor that you can not help but notice it, you split into a face with holes. In the last scene he jumps from a ferry boat in the distance. Cut to his son and a new girlfriend (PR director of ships who knows kung fu and was once in the police, but he was fired because he did things in his own way - exactly) on a ferry that goes very quickly from the explosion. Then Dad hugged them. How???? Who cares, his magic. There are no buying functions in this movie. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with a casino table. When persecuted by villains there is only one place to hide, you have guessed. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One, continue to fire on four fruit machines and a small bar (corner bar at the casino - fantastic). They pass along the only hideout so our Casper can bypass them and "take them out." Give some friends, drink a few drinks, put this movie on and wrap.
