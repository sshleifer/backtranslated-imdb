"Match Point" and now "Scoop" convinced me that not only Voody Allen was doing a tidy job in England (and that Scarlett Johansson was a true member of the acting team), but to uphold what I know for years: he did not need I did not focus on rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays a journalism journalist Sondra Pranski, who is put on by magician Sid Vaterman (Allen) in his missing box where he meets the spirit of the murdered reporter Joan Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells her that the serial killings that tortured London was a millionaire Peter Liman (Hugh Jackman). So, she met him, and ... well, I do not know how much I can tell you, but I'm not leaving her. But I can say that this is probably the funniest film of Allen for years. There is his ubiquitous unique style of humor (especially the line about his religion). So, you will definitely like this movie. If nothing else, it will make you fall in love with London. But mostly, it's so damn hilarious. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you have to love this.
