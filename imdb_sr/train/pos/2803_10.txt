As a former world champion of the Okinevan karate, I love movies about sacrifice for sport twice. But this film is much more. This film is so good and so deep. Recently, very serious injuries and rather catastrophic lack of passion have bothered me. Almost the lights for me. And this stupid movie touched me so deeply that, like stunning, he reminded me of what life should be. This is a film about life. Live your life for yourself and respect for others. Empowerment. God, bless the "Band like Beckham" I think it's a real gem.
