Such a film of beauty that is difficult to describe. Perhaps this is the absence of excessive dialogue, or perhaps absolutely starry music, or perhaps just the feet of Meena Mumari, but it's a pleasure to watch this movie over and over again. I have never seen another Indian movie that has approached him, and it is little from any country that opposes his perfection.
