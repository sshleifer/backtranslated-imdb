This is by far my favorite movie of all time. This is mainly because we are not afraid to deal with some very politically incorrect topics (such as jokes and female obedience) that other mainstream movies are too plagued to touch them. It seems that nothing is forbidden in this film because the director freely develops the story without any concern to possibly offend the viewer. However, I do not think anything has been done here solely because of the shock value or deliberate insult of anyone. Sean Ioung turns into a great and brave performance. Most of the established actors would not take that role or would require some major script changes before they accept it. Other members of the band also do a good job. Have you noticed that this film did not appear on cable television since the mandatory short work one year after it entered the cinema? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it does not fit into today's political atmosphere. It seems ironic that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (which is increasingly approaching hardcore pornography) but will not carry a mainstream movie like "Love Crimes". Unfortunately, even though this film is only 11 years old, it probably would not be possible today. <br /> <br />
