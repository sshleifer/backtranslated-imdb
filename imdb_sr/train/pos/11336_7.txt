Answer: In spite of the fact that this film was written and directed by a woman, your ex is creepier, nastier, and more irrational than any zombie who has ever loved the country. The acting in this independent movie is actually pretty good, despite the modest scenario. It takes a pretty good actor to deliver a transcribed, clich√© line and make her sound unclear. Young Anthony de Marco, like Jake, puts on a particularly good performance. Fortunately, the plot of this film is much better than the dialogue. Try, especially if you are not a fan monster. This is not a terrible tune. Although all adult females are rather monstrous, and although all adult men act as if their brain is eating in an earlier zombie movie, "Jake's Closet" is suitable for adult adults. this time is much better than the sum of its parts.
