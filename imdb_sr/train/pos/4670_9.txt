Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or professional raconteur, it would be good to look for this charming piece of satire sixties. Ustinov plays convicted of fraud (the first time we've seen over the last days in prison where tax preparation warden) who, feeling that the future is in computers, is (due with the clever phishing) as a computer expert and intends to infiltrate the American multinational company . <Br /> <br /> Ustinov (who wrote the script) is in top form, as is the wonderful Maggie Smith, this unusual cocktail thrown as -sparrov doll bird. Bob Nevhart also presents a fun show as a suspicious executive who has a design on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden pleases with pleasure as Ustinov and Nevhartov's female boss. What do I particularly like in this movie? Not only is this a well-thought-out 'caper film', it's also a touching little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing, because the two misfits in love (the whole scene with a deck of cards especially effective.) <Br /> <br /> So, what not to love? Well, the script is not computer literate than most films (that is, hardly at all), but illustrates well the experience of 'big iron' from the late sixties. Also, there are several minor perfume errors that you probably will not notice before the second or third viewing, but I think that these are small disadvantages. <Br /> <br /> As I said, this is a film that is well worth it to look for, and once you see one, you want to see him again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
