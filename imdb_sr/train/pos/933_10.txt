I saw this film in the sixth grade around Christmas, and I was very excited to see it, and when I heard that George C. Scott, I was very excited, because I really love George C. Scott! When I and my class watched this movie, I really embarked on it, and when I finished, I was really impressed, I thought it was fantastic! This is the best version of the classic novel by Charles Dickson, which I've seen so far! Performance by George C. Scots like Scrooge is something else, I thought it was the perfect choice, it's Scrooge, it's the definitive Scrooge! I saw two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other one with Patrick Stevart, but this is better! What really is great about this is acting, I thought that actors are phenomenal, they are all, ghosts, Tini Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone, they could not find anyone better than those who worked the parts! But the best part of the film was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was absolutely the best! He's the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge, I do not think they could find someone better! I do not think they could have found someone better to replace anyone in the movie! This film is probably the definitive film adaptation of Charles Dickens, and I really think that you will agree, you will think that this film is incredible! I'll probably have to buy this movie on DVD, because I thought it was totally fantastic! I strongly recommend that you see this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol, a period. 10/10
