"Casomai" is a master story that shows the story of a young couple walking through the blurry waters of marriage. The story is very credible when it comes to the unusual sight between forgetfulness and the continuous interference of others, which is quite typical in Italy (it may be asked whether such events differ elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Allatri were very good at writing, and that's one of the strong sides of the film. The cast of Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo are sober and brave. And the figure of a lovely priest is ridiculous and well rounded. All in all, a truly respected film, probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
