Modern viewers know this little film primarily as a remake model, "The Monei Pit". Older viewers watch him today with nostalgic tapes: Cari Grant, Mirna Loi and Melvin Douglas were "superstars" in a lighter, less complicated era. Or was it? Time, of course, has a way to modify the perspective, and with so many movies that today really ulcerate with social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversies in older, seemingly less provocative films. In "Mr. Blandings builds his dream home", it can be, moreover, more than the audience sought in 1948. There is a political comment, no matter how subtle. Finding a house at the end of the forties was a really disturbing experience, only slightly softened by the arrival of Levittown and the like. Politics in the movie? The children of Blandings always seem to be talking about the progressive ideas they are learning at school (which in real life led teachers to be accused of communism). And in real life Mirna Loi was an activist for housing, democrats and feminists. Melvin Douglas was no less democratically hot: he was married to Congressman Helen Gahagan Douglas, who was accused by young Richard Nikon of being mild towards communism (and destroying it). Jason Robards, Sr, plays a minor role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, younger, would have been a very active liberal democrat for many years. Almost weird colleague was Cari Grant, whose sharp conservatism reflected the majority political feeling in Hollywood that had already fallen. But that was in 1948: Communism was a real threat and the black list was behind the corner. It would take another ten years before political activism would reappear in mainstream films, and then not so subtle.
