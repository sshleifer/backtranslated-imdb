This film is the second immersion of Damian Szifrone into films after a great character study in "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes" he creates extremely well made characters, far from prototypes and unprecedented between them. I saw Szifron's talent to present every character in a carefree way, but sufficient enough to involve us emotionally in them. His control over them is magnificent, so he returns the movie to a great direction and a whole brilliantly polished script, the characters laugh and cry with the right feeling and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on the screen. Spaniards take over the English language, the city landscape in Buenos Aires at night replaces Hollywood sets, and the premise is as interesting as any other, so we have a film that dares to compete over Hollywood machines. <br /> <But I want to watch a movie mainly because I have never dealt with such dear characters, all of them. The script seems to fit perfectly with the actors and vice versa. I really believe that filming such as this Argentina is truly a competition.
