Really, I think this film is more an example of a lighter target than a really bad movie. In fact, the film has been done very well in many aspects and is very fun. Yes, the script is a bit intricate, but it's a genre. The film has a noir atmosphere focused on femme fatale. Like all the old classic noirs, this also has a script that turns you around so you do not always know the sense at first sight, and it can also be stretching if you think deeply and try to put all the pieces together. It's a genre. Generally speaking, the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer retained by negotiation and, apparently, was surprised, without leaving the viewer. The truth is that it looks great and speaks your double-tasking dialogue so that I go to something mysterious, sexy and fun. Direction is more than passable, because let's face it - you have to keep the audience interested for "Is she or not?" question for two hours. In addition to the hidden scenario and fun of Stone, this is achieved through the direction of creating an atmosphere that is simultaneously dark and very sharp and modern at the same time, with straight industrial lines that go with Stone's. seki curves. The frame is always nice - click on the break anywhere and have something interesting for the eye. The film also efficiently builds on things that were tricks in the first movie and turns them into something a bit more, especially sex. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how shocking!" here it is treated much more, and typically, the sexuality of the film is used for a better effect. It's still wild, but it's not done ready for a shock value and a buzz like it did in the first one. I'm not saying that it's still not a trick, because, face-to-face, this movie should be fun. And it's a fun movie. It can be an easy target, but if you look at the way it is: noirish, femme-fatale drive, twist, splash, did-she-or-did-she vho-dunnit, you will surely enjoy it (not intentionally).
