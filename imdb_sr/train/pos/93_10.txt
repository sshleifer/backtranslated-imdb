My first child was born in the year when this program came out, and I played the album for the guys every Christmas after that. When the CD came out, I bought dozens of copies and I still give them friends and relatives as they start the family ... it always becomes their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (made on DVD-R from a video cassette, probably) for sale on eBa. The one I bought was an excellent copy, and it was so wonderful to see again after more than 25 years. There are some songs that are not on the album, and some of the songs on the album are studio versions of the same songs in the show. But CD and DVD will stay in our library as the best Christmas party ever.
