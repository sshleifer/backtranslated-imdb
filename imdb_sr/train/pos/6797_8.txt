Some bad reviews here for this and I understand why, but treat it as a movie with a series of killers with a low budget and you may get more than that from the majority. I thought it worked in some way, because I felt dirty at a later date and I wanted to dry out a bit, so that's some degree of success, right? I would say that here is just the right level of sleeves to break under your skin, although the acting may be somewhat uneven. David Hess is just in this Briefly, so do not be too hopeful if you love Last House. In addition - worth a look.
