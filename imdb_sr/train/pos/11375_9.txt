This film talks about an incredible story with history and compassion. From a careful description of the crime scene to the mental health of the lead investigator, you will be fascinated. This is an absolutely compulsory place for anyone who is interested in criminology. Relations with Interpol and the way agencies work together are also great. Not too much done. I recommend it to everyone who is interested in Russian history. As the police work with the political party as it was ... It's really fascinating and frustrating. The settings are pretty. It's been a long time since I first saw this movie. This does not diminish his influence. It's not too dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough imagination, so, you'll see.
