Those French and Germans certainly have a long history of dislike. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Drugovanje was translated in 1931. Just a few years later, Hitler surrounded Germany and began to take over the world, and France was the victim of its ambitions. But these are times of tranquility in relation to the future. A group of miners at the border is trying to cross into France to get hired. They were thrown back, and later in the nightclub by their French neighbors. Then there is a catastrophe in the French mines and a well-written and written scene, and a group of German miners decided to come to salvation. A simple story is not? Pabst was a silent film poet and I'm not sure whether this is his first soundtrack or not, but his poetry is there to discover. He is not unsettled, but leads to harsh realism. It is even a return to the World War II event that calls for this story. Allegedly based on the actual event, the film happens events with pride and directness. Smetimes, that's what the movie should be.
