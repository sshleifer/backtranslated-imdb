Although this film came out a year before my birth, it's definitely one of my favorite comedies. Redd Fokk plays a father trying to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he does not know anything about what it means to be gay and has all these stereotypical notions of what kind of gay people are. His son, Norman, has now grown up and lives alone. When his father, Ben, finds out that his son is gay, he pays his son a visit in the hope of changing him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie - when Ben comes to Norman's apartments, he gets into a female prostitute and thinks he's his son in love ("Norman ... is that you?"). The film laughed me from the beginning to the end. Redd Fokk is great. Although many content is stereotypical, I have not found anything offensive about the way it is handled by the material, and it even has a good ending. Recommended.
