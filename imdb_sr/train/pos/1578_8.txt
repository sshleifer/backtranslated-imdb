Rosenstrasse is a moving story of courage in hardships. Reichdecke women believe that their Jewish men were locked up to deportation. An aristocrat whom the family rejected, Lena Fisher, is among the mob as well as the sister of General Gudarjan. But rank and privilege do not deserve special consideration. Neither serving Rajha as a detainee whose husband on Ostfront will learn. In one of the most terrible scenes of the film, the guards take a bridal band given by her military husband. Not to think that this is typical German brutality, in America today, Mrs. Bush commands the arrest of the mother of the golden star (the mother of American soldiers who died in action) because their presence is superfluous. Unfortunately, however, it has changed a little in 60 years from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. Fortunately, eight-year-old daughter Ruth escapes. Waiting for the cold at Rosenstrasse Lena Fisher initially reluctantly accepts Ruth as answering a way we consider typically German. Even Brother Lene Fisher, Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who is aware of and opposed to Holocaust, warns Lena about it. but Lena decides to accept the idea of ​​American rebelliousness even by renaming Ruth, which is the Aryan name Helga Lehmann. Years later, Ruth's daughter Hannah is in search of her mother's past and is meeting 90-year-old Lena under the guise of personal history writing. It was interesting to me that Hannah wanted so much to look for a family, but you never checked the fate of her grandfather known to have served on Ostfront.
