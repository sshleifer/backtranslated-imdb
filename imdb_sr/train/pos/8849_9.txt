Brothers Hanson - Andy (apparently has a joint appearance) and Hanka (obviously they do not play together) need money. Andi comes out with a plan to get a dough that will have consequences for the entire Hanson family. This film brings. This is a layered, punctual run of a slide that knows exactly what it is doing. As a criminal drama / thriller I would like to compare it with 'No Country for Old Men'. Although both films have an extensive drama of character and excitement, 'Devil' is more on the thriller side due to the fast pace. 'No Countri' is a cooler and weaker movie that can truly admire, while 'Devil' is a bit more comfortable. There is definitely less violence in the 'devil' than 'no country'. And the actor brings it. Ethan Havke, sometimes wood in the past, brings excitement, sweating and a look at the deer in the headlights of the besieged Hank. Philip Seimour Hoffman, like Andy, has the most difficult scenes in the movie and quickly becomes an actor, whom you believe can do everything. He jumps back and forth without confusion. Events go out of control, but the film never works - writing (from the first timer Kelly Masterson), director (veteran Sidnei Lumet) and editing remain firm as a drum. In many categories, this is a reward for the caliber of things, although movies such as 'The Departed' and 'No Countri' have pushed this out of the center of attention. If you like it, you will like this.
