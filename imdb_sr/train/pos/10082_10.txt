The film is really sharp, unique and exciting. The story is universal in that it is a battle between good, evil and the world between. THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is that her rating is wrong, wrong, and tragedy. Blockbuster estimated that it was a Ks label movie. The truth is that she is closer to G than PG and that she sees children who can read clear and simple subtitles.
