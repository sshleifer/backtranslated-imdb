Ben Thomas (Smith) plays the IRS agent who practically gives his surprise. What is an IRS agent? Most of us heard the line from the IRS agent, "Hello, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help." Our smile then spreads in a laugh that says, "Yes, it is." As you progress further into this story, you can not understand this type. It's easy going to those who are under review. What is his motive? Is he from another planet, an angel, a rich man who wants to do well? He helps so much that we want him to be our auditor, if we are revised, of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (I'm joking, I'm joking) The film's tempo is perfect and it's so much that the traces that ignore what's really going on are ignored. Intensive, intense, focus was on Ben and stays there. Whole movie works only for Ben as we try to discover it and I have not seen any clues (what are you talking about, Villis?). Do not read the box before watching a DVD movie was a better way to get here. By the end of the film, I finally got it all together. Well, then it was obvious. And yes, it's over the top, but still a great story, mostly because of Villa Smith. Vill Smith was to be nominated for the Best Actor Award. And the other actors were very good. Yes, it's over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you have to understand that the message of the movie is completely wrong. What's the message? Believe me, you will not need too much clues to understand it. I'm not. Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing about it. Bland. Golotinja: No. Language: No
