That's what i.v. should. And pushing marijuana lives up to these expectations. A beautifully designed and well-designed show, Pushing Daisies is one of the few shows that remain in a striking term that has integrity, is good for the whole family and provokes your imagination. It's not about normal actions, sex, money or the killing angles of every other show on the so-called. It's a show that's thoughts and laughs, but although the basic action may be impossible, the concepts are real for all of us. Wanting something you can not have, hoping someone will want to, run away from the past and look for a family, even in the most unlikely places, etc. essentially canceled this beautiful performance at this time, and most likely it will be replaced by some shows outside of the integrity point. I guess everything comes back to money ... It's a pity that now there are no other shows on ABC that actually make you good after watching.
