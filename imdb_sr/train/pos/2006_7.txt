At this point it seems almost unnecessary to claim that Jon Bon Jovi delivers a solid, powerful, impeccable performance like Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor was previously established by his critical praise in other films (Leading Man, Without Viewing). But, in case anyone else is asking, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can behave well and that's what he expected. It's easy to separate Derek from a guy who extracts hits on VH-1. <br /> At all I would not watch a horror movie. I have come to expect that they focus on the sensationalist mountains, not on the dialogue and the plot. What worked me the most in this movie was that there really was a good plot. Blood is not so much to become the focus of the film and there is no disturbing realistic quality of films with a higher budget of technical effects. Therefore, the fans above could be disappointed, but the fans of the story will not. and really worry about what will happen to them. A few scenes remain unexplained (like Derek's hallucinations), but you get the feeling that certain aspects were the basis for continuing. Unfortunately, due to the lack of Hollywood interest in this film, this sequel will never happen. These few cases are excusable knowing that Vampires could be a continuous series. Is this the best movie I've ever seen in my life? Is it a good way to spend about two hours of fun? Yes. He will not leave a person who is afraid of horror movies by insomnia and will not leave a horror movie lover completely disappointed. If you are somewhere between a horror genre and a horror genre fan, this movie is for you. It reaches a happy medium with effects and talks balancing each other. <br /> <br />
