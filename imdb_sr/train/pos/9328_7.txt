The perfect son is a story of two 30-year-old brothers, one that seems to be "perfect," and the other that is essentially mourning often goes down to rehabilitation centers. After their father's death, the couple are gathering after a long absence and re-appearance of the usual rivalry. Only when the "perfect" brother makes an astounding discovery that he has an Aid, an irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to bring life into line and assumes some responsibility. Film works A good job of chronologically recording the "return" of a younger brother, although sometimes it may look somewhat embarrassing (the beating of drug addiction is never so easy). What makes this film even more attractive is AIDS treatment, a topic that has become slightly behind in the last 5-10 years in cinema. Also, the development of the almost sweet relationship between the two former brothers is very convincing and well done. The two main actors were very competent, if not terribly charismatic. The powerful first appearance of director and writer Leonard Farlinger whose brother died of AIDS. The place is well executed. <br /> <br />
