Something wonderful in the fact that the film made in 1934 can be the head and shoulders above each of the Tarzan films that followed, including the swollen and boring piece Greystoke of the 1980s. When the viewer passes the first three scenes, which are boring, Tarzan and his Mate go as a shot, offering non-stop action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and goes with the movie. Veismuller is also solid. Recommended.
