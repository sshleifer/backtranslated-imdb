This is not the worst movie ever made, the actors are not afraid, and the script and the director are not completely incompetent. It's not the best movie ever made, the actors are not great, and the script and the director are not completely brilliant. It falls somewhere in the middle. Fun somewhere. Pleasant, somewhere well built. No need to say "do not take it seriously" or "so bad it is good" or "it was not terrible". None of these comments are relevant. Rez has an atmosphere. This is an atmosphere that is truly unique, and one truly original aspect of the film, which personally makes a movie for me.
