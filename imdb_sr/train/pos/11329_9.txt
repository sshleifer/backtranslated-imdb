The combination of the extraordinary black-and-white photography and 'Eugene Onegin's complication' made this for me. The atmosphere created mostly by very dark contrasts with an occasional, very brightly pre-exposed white, was rough. There was a wonderful moment in which the transparencies - apparently conventional holiday recordings, but on which the faces of the actors unveiled the character and the situation subtly, but currently - displayed in the presence of Lensky's cordial aria from the Tchaikovsky opera Eugene Onegin. For me, the sign of a good movie is that it should take advantage of the opportunities provided by this medium, which means that the story is often less important than the image and atmosphere - last year in Marienbad is a good example of such a film. . She is crowned in the same mold.
