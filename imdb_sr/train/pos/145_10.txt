The continuation of the "Kingdom" is bloody and even more distorted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and I could not sit through all 5 1/2 hours), but I liked what I saw. Ghosts, blood, killing, poisoning, mutated babies, voodoo ... this has everything! If you have a strong stomach like strange movies, this is for you. Also, you do not have to see the first part to understand this ... you will understand it! > <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon movies in the theater is tiring. Unfortunately, there will probably be no "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after it was filmed. But you never know!
