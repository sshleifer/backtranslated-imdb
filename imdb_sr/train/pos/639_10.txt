This is a good family performance with great actors. It's a nice break from the Blitz Realty Show recently. Nothing else is similar on television, unless you think Joan of Arcadia is similar because it has a teenage character. In any case, Clubhouse is worth seeing because Jeremy Sumpter's main character (Pete Ioun) gives some kind of sympathy and naivety that is attractive without being too cute and lazy. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Vinningham and Kirsten Storms round off the rest of the main cast members, and each one is great in his role. I really like Kirsten Storms like Pete's sister Betsi; She is a real pill, but she still takes care of her mother and brother, although she hates to show it. It may take several episodes to really find his legs, but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows that will emerge over a long period of time, so check out the people - you'll be glad to do it!
