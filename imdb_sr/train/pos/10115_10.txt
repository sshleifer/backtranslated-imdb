This film deals with a crime in Derri 30 years ago, which is usually called a bloody Sunday. It's closest to the truth we'll get until the outcome of Saville's investigation. The film puts the crime in the context of that time. It also shows the savage of soldiers on the day of the crime. And the shameful white wash, which was the Vidgeri Tribunal, is also being tackled. When Saville's report comes out, look at this movie again to see how close it is to the truth.
