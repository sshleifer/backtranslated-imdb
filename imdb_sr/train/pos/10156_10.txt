This big movie failed to register a higher rating of 5! Why not! This is a great picture of Christ's life without ruthless sensationalism of Christ's torment. The film lasted less than a month to film the film, because Johnny felt that God guided him through it. Billy Graham, the Crusade, said he was high enough to use it as the main source of education for new Christians. Thanks Foku for production. A frivolous masterpiece. In short, I believe that this film is one of the world's greatest documentaries because the honest, honest, and great witness of Christian faith is shown!
