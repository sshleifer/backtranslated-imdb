Unbelievable ARTISTIC NEVER CAN NOT HIS IT. It seems to be the perfect biggest and greatest music ever made to listen to beautiful songs that are quite poetic. The Americans were the best and for that I absolutely show my dedication to you with this film. there are words that describe the perfection of this film. Suddenly my heart sings, what makes the sunset? I fall in love easily, jealousy ... and the scene with Tom and Jerry. largest without reserve. if you do not know that your eyes are not open, my friends must see and appreciate it ... wake up!
