Unfortunately, this film never came on DVD. I saw it when it first appeared in theaters in 1983, and then again when the VHS was released in 1992. I was not disappointed. First, obviously: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to watch. But then, the film takes you to an unreal world where you have to think about your values ​​and decide what is really important for you. The film is about many things. It is about how the World Bank and large corporations exploit and capture developing countries with their capitalist plans to force them into debt that they can never return. It is about how our economic system usets us by compelling us to borrow from credit cards, mortgages and car payments. This is an attempt to preserve the innocence we may have never had before and perhaps we can not really save. It's about good and evil, and how often it's difficult to say one from the other. That raises many questions, but does not give answers. I think this is sometimes good. For this reason, this is a movie that really is worth saving and seeing.
