Dick Tracy is simply the best film ever made of comics. The film has the same feeling as the comic strip, remaining a true color scheme. The Batman series climbed, fell, climbed again and fell. Dick Tracy has true endurance as something that adults and children can enjoy. Good guys triumph over evil, without blood and up to cross over the dots. Al Pacino does a wonderful job for his own adaptation of Big Boi Caprice and Madonna is remembered as Breathless. But the best deal so far is Varren Beatty, who just symbolizes Dick Tracy as he did with Clide Barrows. I can not wait to see the DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape is slim.
