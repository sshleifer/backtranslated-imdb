Well, there are many ways to ruin a political thriller. They are usually performed or too ambitious, often having a plot that is completely paranoid and incredible. But the City Hall does not operate any of the above. The action is smartly made, the story is convincing. As far as the characters are concerned, I would say that this film is a solid average. It seems that no character is in place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrait of the charismatic mayor of New York is excellent and proves that Al Pacino belongs today to the absolute top of the American actors.
