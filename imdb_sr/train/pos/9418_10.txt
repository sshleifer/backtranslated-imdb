I've been filming this film for years, and I began to watch it again this morning (while I'm waiting for my underwear - how ironic!) Basically because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frankel's cover music again. I ended up sitting in the first half an hour, delighted to be so confident in direction, writing and performances. The film is like who's who of the British stars in the 1950s: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and especially Ernest Thesiger, great as a dried old giant textile factory. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not the characters of character as such, but the charming, charismatic tracks. This is science fiction in its purest form and dir comedy. All the time a classic, and I hope that nobody will ever repeat it!
