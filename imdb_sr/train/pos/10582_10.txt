Sing. He's got a drama. He's got a comedy. He has a story. It's one of the best movies ever made ... a period. If you can not enjoy this movie, then you have to be either asleep or in some sort of mental disorder. In "Iankee Doodle Dandi" James Cagnei sings and dances his way to Oscars; but in this film he's BETTER! This is James Kagni at his top BEST! It's fast with one liner! It's fast! It's a continuous action. And songs and dances are classics, especially "Shanghai Lil". And the backing is great; and the whole film is optimistic, it moves quickly and exudes self-confidence. Although this film was created more than 70 years ago, it can still be watched today. And of course, this film contains Miss Rubi Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She is the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Povella! If you love optimistic, fast movies, with lots of singing and dancing, this is a movie you can watch.
