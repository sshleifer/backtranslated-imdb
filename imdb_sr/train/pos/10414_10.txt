First I discovered the fantasy of Alexander Korde (1940), TAJF BAGHDAD in the early 1950s on a re-edition written as "The Wonderful Emission of the Century!" Both Korda Technicolor films, TAJF BAGHDAD and JUNGLE BOOK are shown on a program that is never forgotten. Miklos Rosse's music has improved both films. Technicolor in everyone was incredibly beautiful! TAJF BAGHDAD has stayed on my list as the best fantasy movie ever made. As the years passed, it became increasingly difficult to enjoy the color of the film in the way it was originally presented. True Technicolor gave way to Eastman's color process in the mid-1950s. Both Cinema and Samuel Goldwin re-released the film both theatrical and video. However, Eastman's paintings were more pastel-like and dampened the life of original Technicolor. The Laser Disc edition of this title also looks like a pastel - nice, but not the way it should be. USA comes the question of M-G-M DVD (December 3, 2002). TAJF BAGHDAD again has a wonderful Technicolor look on a DVD that is nothing else than STUNNING !!! It was so exciting to see this again, once I looked at a DVD, I looked at it once more. The only "Ektras" are the Spanish Dubbed version, subtitles in English and Spanish, and a beautifully made original theater trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this extraordinary DVD release. Now I can only hope that Korda-ini FOUR WAXES and the restored version of Cord's JUNGLE BOOKS will soon appear on the DVD (which will replace poor publicly owned publications in circulation).
