This movie attracts you and lets you keep your eyes on the screen. The writer / director is brilliant with narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives that all contribute to the strong attitude he will have for you. Insomniac's nightmare is genuine and refreshingly different from any other movie you've seen. Is it a dream or a reality? This indie will prompt you to discuss about crafts and turns through consciously and unconsciously. He has a feeling with his dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan really became an insomniac. He is a great actor who is not sharp and for the eyes! He has really invested his whole in this role. From the story to the way it's captured, this indie makes one of my favorites. I recommend it very and impatiently to see more of this innovative, creative writer / director / cameraman !!!
