I came across Insomniac's nightmare while I was looking for unusual independent films, and I'm happy to say that it did not disappoint. This crazy ride of half an hour brought me to the end, and the end was great - one of those NOOOOO moments that really stay with you. I showed this to a large number of people and it seems that everyone agrees. A little girl with ghosts was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. She ran out of me, I can say it. Nanavati has perfectly done this short circuit. All the pieces are simply falling into place and you can say that she is an excellent writer from what she did with this script. SO well written. It is undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. The director was excellent and the acting was pleasant, but the most important factor here is the power of the script. Good job to this girl, I can not wait to see more!
