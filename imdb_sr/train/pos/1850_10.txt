This is my favorite movie IKADA. I looked at him at least 10 times and cried every time. My family begs me not to look at her, so I will not have a cry. I think that I love that true story written by Antwone himself, just like a movie. The acting is top-notch, and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie so far. I took care of a little boy who was also born in prison. He was the most precious boy I ever met. Now it was adopted by a wonderful family that fought for him for nearly two years. I saw this film as the fight was still going on and his future was not safe and I am so happy that he is safe and loved. And so I am happy that Antwone is happy and has found her family. I would love to know more about him and how it came from encountering his family. I can not say good things about it !!
