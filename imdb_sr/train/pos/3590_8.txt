I just watched this movie the day I rented it, and I thought it would be just another movie with a girlfriend trying to prove something, but Diane joined the box because she wanted it. I thought this film was good. I gave her 8/10. It's so good. Plus the movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even if she was only six years old.
