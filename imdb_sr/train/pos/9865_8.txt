I saw a movie with two grown children. Although it was not as smart as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. In the cinema surrounded by children who were in the spring break, there was no sound, so I know that the children liked it. And the parents seemed engaged. Death and apparent death of the characters led to proper sighs and comments. I hope people will realize that this movie was made for children. As such, he was successful even though I liked him. I personally liked Scrat !!
