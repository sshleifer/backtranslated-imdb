Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great team on the screen and this may be their best movie together. Yes, Hold Iour Man can be cheesy and predictable, but that's not what I like in the movie. I like to see Harlow and Gable together and in this movie they are simply beautiful. Obviously, they really enjoyed the joint work, and that's part of what makes this movie so beautiful. Spirited dialogue, great script and attention to detail are other things that make this good movie. I loved this film the first time I saw it and at least always noticed at least one new detail at every next glance. For me, it's a sign of a great movie. Dialogue and script are better than most films from this time period (early 30's). I love classic movies, but I admit that most of them are just average and sometimes they do not care about me. Keeping your man is one of the exceptions. This has a lot to do with the fact that Keep your man's movie "pre-code". (Hais code was not applied for up to a year after Hold Iour Man.) This movie could not be made under code. Well, it could have been done, but that would be a completely different story. Thank God that the code was not applied until 1934. Otherwise, we would miss this gem.
