I'm sick of the people who have been booing about Evokes! True, they are not the best thing ever happened to Star Wars, but they've happened, so be careful! Besides, they are sweet, and I do not care if they are being sold. Iubb Nubb! This film always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end can not be better. I am excited about the Phantom Threat, because it will suddenly focus the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how it is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved. So, those who complain that Vader's helmet has been removed, think about it. It's very efficient. Vader, the man who hid behind the mask for 20 years, finally discovers himself as a man of a sick look. He is not a complete machine - he is vulnerable. I do not know how the casting director chose such a good actor in New Hope. They all do it well. These are convincing characters. Hamill works greatly on his dramatic character. Fisher does a good job as a female model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when many others failed!). Harrison Ford - should I say more? The music is great again. It's very touching and important when you can choose topics in different parts of the movie. The best culmination is when Luke shouts "NOOO!" and hoped to fight with his father in the final battle. John Villiams is nothing more than a genius! What an incredible man! Already now the film has much more meaning for me due to episode I. I can not wait to finally see him in the movies (can I wait ???) and then look back at the original trilogy. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
