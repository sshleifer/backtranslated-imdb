The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is again brought to the screen and many in the cultural world will notice. The director puts us in touch with the story of Alexander, an absent study of the addiction to chess. She is on holiday in a marble resort where the chess championship is held. She meets Alexander by taking a piece of the queen who throws her coat pocket. Magnetic attraction is evolving, and he suggests the next day, the mother alerted her husband's telegrams. He arrives and interrogates Alexander, and we get these pale in the past, kum II, where we see a young Alexander, a miracle of a child. He is caught under the wing of school teachers and exploits his genius for 10 years and makes huge sums. Aleksandar's reflection reached its peak, left him, but became a legend. The old teacher returns to the evil, trying to give victory to his old rival, Alexander. In a serious chess game in which the World Chess Champion's victory is one of the ways of immortality, a chess clock, the time of the match ends on the next day. That day is Nastasia's wedding, the old teacher hindered, and Alexander was sent on a nervous breakdown. Nastasia, holding her stomach and looking through the coat of her love, finds her strategy for the game and follows the moves. Although the film unfortunately swings from its Russian roots, its low-cut dresses are wonderful, Alekander plays his role sublime. an opposing king with his three paws and a king, sacrificing a castle for a partner. There is a great match, but I feel that his conclusion deserved more intensity, but perhaps the emotions were right when chess meant more to him than to her. The Luzhin Defense elegantly gives honor to Navokov, the complexity of his work in paintings is a worldwide event that is not missed.
