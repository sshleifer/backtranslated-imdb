This film is by far the sweetest I've ever seen! Beautiful animation and beautiful characters (even the bad guys were sweet!) They did this as a winner in my book, as well as in the books of those I saw with him. I still want to see it again, but I did not have time. Better than the Toy Story, which was also good, but not good.
