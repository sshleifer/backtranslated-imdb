Fred Gwynne, Al Levis, Sid Caesar and Ivonne De Carlo star in this funny, funny movie. The late Fred Gwyn is truly wonderful as Herman Munster, who lives with his dad Munster (Al Levis), his wife, Lily (Ivonne De Carlo), and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is funny as the owner of wax figures museum that has an entire section devoted to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and Santa begin to terrorize the city, they all blame the two of them. Now they need to clear their names before it's too late. You laugh as loud as I do.
