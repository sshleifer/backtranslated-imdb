"The color of purple," it's really incredible. There is no such thing, and I think it will never be. It's a costume for the emotions and pain the viewer takes. Actors are flawless and directing is brilliant. I absolutely loved him. The movie never made me happy. It's beautiful, that's the best way to explain it.
