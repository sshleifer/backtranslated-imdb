A well-recorded, well-acting, firmly scripted film about uncertainty. They brought me to the edge of my seat. I really liked the main actress, and I thought the bad guy was very well done. There is not much chewing gum here, but if you just sit down, turn off your brain, watch the fantastic work of the camera and enjoy the complication, you'll be well done. The shop is well out, and ordinary visitors will probably know more or less about ten minutes. But that did not bother me because I enjoyed watching how it was going. In old times, perhaps they were not so firmly focused on just two characters, and there were some tempting moments when I hoped that some other people would have several rows. But these people were probably right to keep the film so firmly focused. The plot started prematurely, and I never let go. It's not a good idea to think too much during or after the movie. because I'm not sure it makes a lot of sense. Just sit and enjoy.
