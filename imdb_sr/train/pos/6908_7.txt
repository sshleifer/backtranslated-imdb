Richard Dreifuss plays "Moon Over Parador", and in 1988, Paul Mazurski also stars Raul Julius, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Vinters and Charo. Dreifuss plays in New York's actor, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean Parador country to make a movie. When suddenly a dictator dies, the head of the secret police (Julia), who actually controls the dictator and the land, has drawn Jonathan to play the dictator, noting the similarity between them. Soon Jonathan is in the palace like Alphonse Simms, and Simms's girlfriend from the prostitute Madonna (Braga) who realizes he will help him in any way. mother, gives us an insight into how the CIA operates in third world countries. The character of Winter, allegedly the seller, is actually a CIA operator. The film, however, flirts with, but it does not actually go on very serious terrain and is more sent and hilarious. Richard Dreifuss does an amazing job like Jonathan Actor and Alphonse Dictator, creating two separate characters and sticking both of them. Wonderful Sonia Braga is great as Madonna, and Raul Julia handles in a haunting funny show such as Strausmann, a man behind a dictator. It's one of those performances in which you never know what a character is thinking - it can be nice or turn a psyche at any time. Charo is at hand as a maid and manages to be ridiculous and unobtrusive at the same time. Very good movie, not a big hit, but very fun.
