*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two such excursions ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Dirti Harry seems to have regained his step in a "sudden blow", an exciting thriller who wisely plays his The advantages: Clint Eastwood's charism, who also directed, and a story that spends enough time on exposure and retains its energy for big scenes. One case takes Harry. outside his native San Francisco (where he is again in trouble with his superiors for his "shooting, asking questions later" tactics), to the hamlet of San Paulo. There, (WARNING: Potential spoiler), a group of low beings was abominably killed, one by one, by a woman who raped years earlier and whose sister was in a state of catatonia from the attack. The killer is shown by Sondra Locke, and the character Jennifer Spencer makes an interesting mixture of sympathy and cold-bloodedness. Locke's cold eyes and a cold voice, when they tried to comfort their own hospitalized sister or retaliate by rapists, are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman who was wrong, whose years of suffering and anger now begin to carry deadly fruits. > The rapists are despicable, and especially the leader, who has "psycho nutting" practically imprinted on the forehead, and a lesbian who looks almost like one of the guys, despite the anatomical incapacity to take part. Scenes with flashback, although not graphically explicit, are gloomy enough and apparently intend to let the audience cheer Jennifer while killing his attackers. Some will reject the "sudden shock" as a garbage: mindless, manipulative revenge revenge. At a certain level, that's true, but it's a well-made garbage. The advantage of the film is the strength of Sondra Locke's performance, which gives us a complex character whose wounds are more visible on her images than in her gestures or speech. What we have here is an action movie with a point of view. You can take or leave the idea that some injustice deserves to be punished by any means, but how the mystery behind the murders becomes clear to Harry (the realization that he is wise, not proclaimed by dialogue) he presents with the choice - what to do with the killer whose motivation he can sympathize, but whose behavior is obligatory by law does not tolerate. That's why the story is more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry tariff. The second film that was used by the film is Eastwood's direction. This is, after all, Dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood is better than anyone else. The film is oriented with style and wit and arranged to give a great deal of action scenes. Some of the best "Harry moments" in the whole series are here, including Harry's most famous line, "Come on - make me a day." Sudden Impact is a film that has the courage of her beliefs in presenting the story of the abominable crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It is also a detective story that is well made and well-informed. And it's certainly not bored. By these criteria, it succeeds exceptionally.
