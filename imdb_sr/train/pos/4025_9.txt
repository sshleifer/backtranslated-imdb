Divan. Initially, I thought that, given the communist tendencies of Amrita Pratam and the nationalistic film dr. Dvivija, to be more honest than the novel, but when I read the novel, I was surprised when I discovered that this was the other way around. not to be a pseudo-sec, and to dr. Dvivedi be objective. This film touches the delicate subject in a sensitive way. The victims of every war are women, as some poet said, and this film personifies it. It is also a sad commentary on the Hindu psyche because they can not oppose the hijackers of their girls or a Hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his torturer. On the other hand, he also shows the economic angles behind the split or, in fact, why the girls are kidnapped. I think the kidnappers thought that the kidnapping of the girls would become the legal owners of the houses and thus the new government. they will not be able to ask them to return home. This, in addition, should greet the courage of the characters Pura and her Bhabhi, that they are two simple village girls who do not know the outside world and risk trying to get back after being defected. Because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in India. No wonder the woman had to understand the pain of other women.
