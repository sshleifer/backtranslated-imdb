I'm a big Beatles fan. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John. I already knew a lot about the Beatles music and the truth behind the break, as well as things like John Lennon's family and Paul's band Vings. I was curious to see how this film will deal with the relationship between John and Paul for so many years after the breakup. I was not disappointed with this film. Although the story itself is fiction, many references used by two musicians were very precise. Among them was how Ioko Ono would always be with John, wherever he went, Vings' song "Silli Love Songs" as a hit number that year and a concert on the Apple Studios music album "Let It Be". Br /> Actors played a very good job in playing John and Paul. Accents may have used a little more work, but seemed to act as though I had read two former Beatles who had once acted. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what was the whole film. how it really went in real life. They also feature a fantastic skate from "Saturdai Night Live" in which the Beatles offer $ 3,000 to appear on the show. (compared with the $ 220 million offered by others). Overall, I was not disappointed with this film. It really gives you a lot of feelings about why the Beatles broke up and why they never came back together.
