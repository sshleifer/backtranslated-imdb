In the list of tour guides for the film festival in Santa Barbara, where I went to Hollywood, I noticed that this film was in projection. Basically, there are choices for the new Chairman of the Hong Kong Triad Vo Sing Society, so you can imagine how much violence will happen during this. The battle is between the "candidates" Lam Loka (Simon Iam) and Big D (Toni Leung Ka Fai) to control the oldest and most powerful parts of the Triad Society. Also played by Louis Koo like Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are several good realistic topics and moments of corruption, just about enough action, except perhaps when the police are involved, but there has been a sequel, so this is quite worth the thriller of the criminal drama. Very good!
