Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 was excellent only for the performance of Sean Williams Scott as Stifler, but after that the quality dropped. Band Camp kept the standard relatively high, while the characters you were worried about, but Naked Mile was the same joke and recycled drawings (Erik Stifler's sexual problem is like Jim's). He had a few fun moments like a soccer game against the dwarf and a 'penalty' by Coozeman, but the whole was lacking in originality, and 'Mile' was just stupid and stupid. Not to mention an irritating girlfriend who does not want sex. Anyway, enough about Goli mili. I looked at the Beta house with fear, because I thought the series could rise to a new level, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, there is no real plot, but it's filled with hot girls (Ashlei is incredible) and sex jokes. Yes, it's formulaic and jokes are old, but Dvight Stifler (Steve Tallei) raises at least with lush performance. The Greek Olympics are fun especially for penultimate and final events, while Christopher McDonald's casino is hilarious. However, there are weak points. Coozeman is irritating as it was in the first one, and I'm still confused how I ever got a role. While Coozeman is bad, Erik Stifler is worse. John White made Naked Mile the pain to be watched, but in Beta House he moved his performance to a whole new level. First of all, he lacks charisma, Stifler's precondition. You really do not care about him. The only reason I was worried about his relationship was that Ashley could be on the screen! She shines above him like the rest of the actors. Seriously, John White is the peak in bad acting and has so much charisma as a dead fish. Saying that the movie is entertaining and Coozanov's fear that his girlfriend is not exactly a girl, is brilliantly funny. All in all, this movie is worth renting, invite a few of your friends and laugh at the event that caused the vomiting and delight the Erica 'loser' Stifler.
