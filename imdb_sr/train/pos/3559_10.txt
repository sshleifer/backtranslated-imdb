I love this movie. The only thing I disappointed was that some original songs were changed. Frank Sinatra has no chance of singing so much in this movie, but it's also nice that this is not just another movie about Frank Sinatra. where he mostly sings. In fact, I thought it was better to use Marlon Brand's own voice because he had a voice that fit and I could not see someone with this wonderful voice that extracts the gangster feeling. his voice. Stubbi Kaie's "Sit Up, You're Rockin 'Boat" is a tappin' foot, sing-a-long that I'm just love. He is a difficult act to follow with his version and I still like him the best. Vivian Blaine is great in this part and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite song. I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I would not consider it first, but after I saw it in part, it made sense. Michael Kidda's choreography is timeless. If it was set up in 2008, I would not change anything. I think that many times something has been lost from the stage version to the movie version, but it kept the feeling of the scene, even though it was on the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was good. I have performed in regional versions and this is one of my favorites of that period.
