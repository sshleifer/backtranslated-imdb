This is just a great, fun, wonderful movie. It records the true essence of the decade and people and tells a beautiful love story about two sisters with two sailors. Although this film can only be in black and white, it is definitely not counted in the present. The basic purpose of the film is timeless. This film has great acting, beautiful songs and dance numbers, and excellent design and film footage. Follow Fleet is also comical, there are funny moments, moments that will make you laugh, but also other moments in which the acting exactly brings you into the story. It's amazing how this movie can be set in a decade, how it can affect them today. If you want to see something big, look at this.
