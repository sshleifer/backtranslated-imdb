One of my favorite shows from the '70s. As far as I remember, he went on Friday (or maybe Saturday) to Nine NetWorld (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGuin and Simon Oakland were great together. Each episode usually reached a peak when Kolchack had to handle hand in hand with some supernatural opponent. To their credit, the writers put forth effort to move as far away from the usual vampire and ghosts as possible. I remember one episode in which the opponent was the spirit of the ancient Indian chief. who "returned" as a massive electric current that began to kill people in a city hospital. The last clue was that Kolchak tried to build the 'beast of power' in the middle of an explosion of sparks and flames that flared up. Oh, well ... you had to be there at that time, but that was an interesting idea. McGavin always had a lot of energy and enthusiasm in his roles and it was one of his best. Br /> Definitely deserves a place in the TV "Hall of Fame". To quote Tony Vincenzo ... 'You're on Kolchack' ... Or, in the Hall of Fame, 'IN it'!
