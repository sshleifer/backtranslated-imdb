I am from Romania and I will try to speak English. All I want to say about this movie is that it's also going to be my number one all the time. I've seen it at least 30 times and will see it for many years. She has all the things I like in the movie, she's very crying with me. It shows a lot of twisted love and questions about love and reality, and true things that are important to different people. It happens that for me this is the most important, love, the soul of man, the inner being, and I see this in this film. Perhaps this is much more than a movie for me, that's proof in my mind that there really might be, and that you can make the most of every moment in which you live with a related soul. It's far from reality to sci-fi, but ... what if. What if all capitalism disappears and the economy would fall? We would all be worried about other issues, and my thought is that on your death bed, the more you remember, it's not wealth, not adventure, not the country you visited and the people who remember you. But true friends and your true love and hope that, after you die, you will be damn perfect and that people will be good and worry more. SEE THIS FILM and will probably guide you through your life as it did to me :) Hello from Romania
