I've seen this movie many times and I like that all bad teachers want to give him ten out of ten, but they think it would be unfair to other good movies. However, I think this is one of those rare gems: a perfect comedy. It was one of the biggest comic books of all time. Matthau and Lemmon fit perfectly and do not match. The script is so sharp that you have to stop bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other comments. The two guides give exceptional performances, the girls are great and the situations are quite funny. No cursing at sight (mark this Hollywood, you do not have to swear it's funny, you must be witty) and the transition from the stage to the movie is seamless. They do not do more like this. Timeless.
