I love this episode of Columba. Perhaps this is because Ruth Gordon is in that and she is wonderful as a successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, the American version of Lady Agatha Christie. She is delicious when she looks like a rude, cute author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in an accident of drowning. Blames the nephew's nephew. He plans to kill him to curb her death, because the police have left her. I would love someone other than Mariette Hartlei to play Veronica. I never personally dislike Hartley. And, of course, with Columb, there is a laugh like when she is testing Veronica in the dance class of dancing dancing. Ruthina Abigail is a smart wanderer and she agrees with Columbus who always plays beautifully with Peter Falk.
