This movie is very fun and never boring for almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and other actors are great in the film and are very persuasive. The violence was a bit extreme in the film, but then it showed how much the crime was the drug trade at the time of the film. The ending is incredible and maybe it's one of the best scenes ever. You're a great movie and you'll probably enjoy it.
