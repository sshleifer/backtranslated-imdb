I must have been only 11 years old when Mr. Peepers started. It was mandatory for the whole family, I believe in the Sun. night. Repeated edges opened the closet to Rob (he had to use a gauge or pointer to make the right place on the other cabinet and do other things, finally hit the place where the door would open) and remove the needles from the new shirt at the beginning of one episode he would open a package with a new shirt, and for the rest of the hunt, he would have found one pin behind the other one that he missed when he unwrapped his shirt, the time was all and the needles got a lot of laughter.) I remember the aunt who was driving Rio as Jack Benny and always she wanted "Sonny" to say something familiar one. He would think and design a "semi-permeable membrane" or an osmosis that would make him say brilliant. (you have to be there). Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on the screen. Why did not they continue the series from their POV when Valli gave up (he was afraid that he had been molded, but by then it was too late) I will never know. Somewhere I saw that the first TV wedding (though great) was Tini Tim on the shore of Carson. Horsecocki. Rob and Nancy (I have ever had hots for her) and I remember she made the cover of a TV guide and got newspapers in all the newspapers and great magazines. Traveling to the Broadcasting Museum in New York a few years ago, it was disappointing that at that time they had very few episodes and they may have disappeared. I still remember that it is wonderful and I want to be a little older.
