You play as B.J. Blazkovicz, an American secret agent of the hard guy who was sent to uncover Nazi secrets and turned to the tide of World War II. This means everything from the outbreak of the Nazi dungeon to the collapse of Hitler's war machine, and even the fief itself. This is probably the most influential game of your time. This is because it literally inspired the obsession. Many games existed at that time, and even more today, but often you get the right catcher. This is one of them. Just like Tetris before it and recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost every way, but footage heard around the world that led to one of the largest tidal waves was fired by B.J. Blazkovicz. Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Mak Paine, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys on the ID. Whether directly or in most cases indirectly, but still working. Even with its old look, very old graphics, a super simple game (this is really a game, the game now borders with "experience") level ") and high rectangular levels, the scope of all six episodes provides many fun. Especially revealing secrets with the mild and wizard in them. Also: "Stop!" * bang! bang! bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" never grow old. --- 8/10 Volunteer rated PC-13 for "deep slaughter". However, it is extremely lively compared to today's games.
