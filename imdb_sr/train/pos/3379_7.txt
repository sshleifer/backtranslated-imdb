In the seventies, Charlton Heston acted in sci-fi shifts of varying quality. Soilent Green is one of the best. The role of Robert Thorn, detective at Nev Iork in 2022. In the future, most foods are so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soilent Green. But when Thorn found out the unsuitable truth about this product, he found himself on the run. I assume it is natural that this film today looks like a dated. Still, there are still interesting questions about what our agriculture will become. Also featured are Leigh Tailor-Ioung, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in his final role).
