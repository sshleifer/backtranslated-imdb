I watched this during the Christmas period, I do not know why, but it reminds me of Christmas and I watched it, so we are here. Arthur is a movie I watch all the way with a big stupid smile on my face and its mix of special performances, great music and script that complements the wit and charm that it causes. Dudley Moore is a character who can easily hate (spoiled, rich, lazy drunk who is pitied) but turns him into someone you love. Liza Minelli is as great as Linda Morolla, a waitress of the queen who manages to pull a coarse / soft inner lady to whom Arthur has almost renounced his world. John Gielgud gets all juicy lines and polishes them with pleasure. I can watch Arthur over and over again and always feel good, check if you need to lift his beautiful movie.
