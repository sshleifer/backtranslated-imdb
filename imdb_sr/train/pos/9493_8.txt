White Fire has so much to do with it. With Larry Bird similar to Robert Ginty, who kept charging blazing away with his phenomenal hair and super-musty mustache, the movie rose above other low-budget shareholders. The charisma he has in this makes Tom Selleck look like a putz. With the Ginta victory over everyone, the film only rises in an incredible situation when the story of diamond intrigues enters the game. Then add Fred Villiamson, some frontal shrub, chainsaws and some great incest topics ... this flick ends on all cylinders. If you are looking for some great B-Action, that's where it is located. Now, if I can just get that soundtrack.
