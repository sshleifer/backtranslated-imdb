Many critics here explain the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in some details, so I will not do it. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life. At first, Myrtle Gordon remembers how it was "easy" to act when she was 17 when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. The experience left her emotional fragility, wondering what her life was and, indeed, if she could still live. A tragic accident causes a personal crisis that is almost overwhelming. Almost - but not quite. Eleventh Hour again reveals the power of his art and reaffirms ("I'll bury that bastard," she says about her actor Maurice while going on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Mirta director prevented people from helping her when she came hopelessly drunk for her first appearance. He, however, knows that he must have the courage to do it alone, if he ever wants to do it. Some critics are wondering if this triumph is just a temporary break on Mirtle's descent. I believe this is truly her 'opening' - it opens up as a flower with new possibilities of life and action, sees the way forward. It's moving terribly. Gene Rovlands is remarkable. The movie is great. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
