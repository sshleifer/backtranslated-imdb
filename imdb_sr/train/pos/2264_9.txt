Vonnegut's words are best experienced on paper. The stories that weave are gossemar, silk, neither words nor expressions that can not easily be translated into the world of Marilyn Manson or Jerry Bruckheimer's explosion. His words have already been well treated, in an excellent slaughterhouse-5. The mother's night is probably one of the three novels Vonnegut wrote in order to go to a desert island, along with the slaughter-5 and Bluebeard. The film version deserves 10, but the books are so permanent part of my inner landscape that I just can not do it ... some of the scenes that are omitted from the film are part of my memory ...
