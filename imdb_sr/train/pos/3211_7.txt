this movie is fine if you love a mindless action, stupid acting, and a very small plot! Special effects are decent given that this film is director of Event Horizon. The costumes are like a crazy movie movie. None of the soldiers are talking, and others say what to do. In the end, he ended up as a big shot in a movie with explosions. I personally liked it better in "tango and cash" "escape from la / ne iork" and "executive decision". He has to watch this movie, leaving your mind at the door for an unusual movie of science fiction !!
