There is no way to confront 'Zabriskie Point' from a rational point of view, or we try to describe it by using words and conventions that you would use for other films. That's because it's not a movie. It is the idea and the feeling that filmmakers have to somehow turn into a facility as a world film. What we see is not revealing complications, but a series of events that we do not see in movies every day, but only imagining that they are going to be a background that we will supply ourselves when we hear about some tragic events in news or from a friend. We see our imagination of people who are abstractions for us - no one we do not know, but we have undoubtedly heard about them in a book or on television or somewhere. And what do we see? Events. We see people fighting, driving, and inevitably fleeing. Only escape is something of an intangible - it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of civilization has allowed to exist even though it is laziness, or ... human nature. Set in the late 1960s in Los Angeles, our players act against and in response to the self-indulgent misery of modern existence. These beings are actually blank plates that can show any traits we can imagine if we want to. Although the actions taken can be considered criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not criminals themselves. They are human beings looking for a return to a familiar, unproved existence that is beyond normal everyday experience. It's not that they are ever happy or sad, but they achieve a type of actuality when they cross and separate themselves from the suicide of modern life. They only achieve real life in the natural world, although this is the next victim of modern existence. Finally, 'Zabriski Point' is an eulogy of humanistic attachment to the natural world. As even the most horrible parts of the earth are subject to our ideas of progress, we lose our soul on the road to the death of the human spirit.
