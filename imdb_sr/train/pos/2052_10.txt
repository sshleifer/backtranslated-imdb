I do not have much to add to my summary, this film is at the top with Top Gun as one of the most entertaining films ever made until it tries to be. I do not think it should be taken seriously when one sees that it is very pleasant. I do not think it brings the reputation of Christopher Valken, or how his reputation has been cautioned anyway. . It should have been "Pulp Fiction" awakened by the dream he was in. As for Michael Ironside, he was in some of the biggest laughs until he was trying to be a serious movie. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I think is incredible is the budget of this movie. Scenes and actors and explosions, etc. They are pretty incredible, so it's obvious that someone loved him a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever he or she is, I love them because I love this movie! If someone reads this information about McBain (and I seriously doubt that it will be too much), just know it's a hilarious movie and you have to watch it with a smile on your face!
