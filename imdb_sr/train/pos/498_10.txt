That's what I was expecting when the DS9 premiere was a star. Not to reduce the DS9. It was a great show in its own right, but it never really gave fans more of what they wanted. Enterprise is that show. Although it has a similarity to the original path, it differs sufficiently to be original in its own way. This makes research ideas exciting for us again. And it was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved. Another ingredient of success was the relationship between crew members. The spectators really worked deeply on the crew. The company has many promises in this area as well. Chemistry between Bakula and Blalock looks very promising. While sexual tension in the show can often become crutches, I feel that tensions on the enterprise can lead to much more and say much more than is typical. I think that when we deal with such extensive characters of different races or species, we get some very interesting ideas and television. Also, we should mention the performances, Blalock is very convincing as Vulkan T'pol and Bacula really has the capricious and powerful character that brings great performance. The rest of the actors also had good performance. My only fluctuations are the following. The theme. It's good that it's different, but a bit to the light of heart for me. We need something more. It does not have to be orchestral. Maybe something with a little more electronic sound would be enough. And my other complaint. They sell too many extras. This could be corrected by selling fewer ads, or it would all show two partners. Otherwise we will end up looking at the final act that appears too fast, as was one of my objections to Voiager.
