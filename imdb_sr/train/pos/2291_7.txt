It is likely that the two main meanings of "Elmer's Pet Rabbit" are that the wacky leporid in "A Vild Hare" now has a name, and that he pronounces his famous "Of course you realize that it means war!" for the first time. The bunch of Terme Teras was mostly trying to figure out what to do with those long fools. This is certainly an indispensable place for the fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to be interested. But do not make a mistake, it's pretty funny that Bugs Bunnies make it eternally gullible Elmer Fudd. Clear shades of things that will be enriched during caricature. I recommend that.
