The question is, can a movie that is this fun really be regarded as a "bad" movie? My husband and I bought this in the video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box was written by Vestron Pictures on it (Vestron is highly regarded as a sign of quality since the first time acquired legendary films "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984 "). We did not expect a film full of victory, as it was. Your basic complication is as follows: Grange, this goombaque force from the planet Earth, takes away the "shore of the moon" and is sentenced to a criminal colony on a distant planet (I do not even recall the name of the planet) for the bauxite mine and other minerals. The "governor" of the said colony and the owner of the mine exploit the prisoners for work. Walker, a blackbird hunter (it looks like one of only three on the planet) reminds prisoners that there is no escape, because there is only one shuttle from the whole planet and they would have to deal with it. Then there is a nameless "Colonel", a retired blackmailer who suffers from a terrible nightmare. A large part of the movie centers around "futuristic" automobile drives (dunebuggies with plywood slammed from the side) with explosions in abundance. The planet itself seems suspicious as Hemet, California, or one of those other dusty outposts of the inner empire. But what makes the movie really great is surprisingly great music with several LA punk bands in the mid-80s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack has ever been pushed to vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying a movie just for a soundtrack. I can not even remember the names of the bands (they are listed in the points) except the Exploitation Take My Mouse, because it was the only one I heard before I saw this movie, but I'm definitely looking at Basically, the film is definitely not a waste of your time and it would be best to enjoy 12 glasses of beer and a few of your closest friends.
