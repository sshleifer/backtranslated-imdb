That was definitely the case with the Angels in Outfield. Last night, it was on TV and I believe I did not see a movie since my second year in high school, and now I'm in my 4th year of college. Although the film has many drawbacks, it's so touching that you can not help but sit, watch it and enjoy it. He's also hilarious. Danny Glover is so excited that you can not help but you can loudly watch him in the most time. He adds to the film and I'm sure that's exactly what the director wanted. You really feel about the characters in the movie, although the development is not the best. She must see. I recommend. 8/10
