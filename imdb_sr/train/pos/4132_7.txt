The comedy that worked surprisingly well was a small British effort "The Divorce of the X-Files (1938)". It marks the first mating of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before this little film about uncontrolled passion in English barricades of the 19th century. And while Olivia and Oberon are not particularly suitable for comedy, it all flows nicely. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up in a private lawyer, Logan (Olivier), in a hotel apartment through a foggy English fog that prevents travel. She does everything in her power to irritate him - but, by a crazy movie, he falls on her. And she falls on him. But a serious case of sinful identity occurs when Oberonova "Lady X" (that is, everything you leaving Oliver in a note) believes Olivier as a married woman. To make matters worse and more fun, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier, seeking to divorce his wife, whom dear Larry thinks is Oberon! There is some good gender dialogue and a fun study of sexual politics. You see that Olivier is not too confident in comedy, but in real Olivier he is a flawless professional and delivers. And he manages crafts and turns, maybe not easy, but with enjoyment. Oberon was a big earthquake as an actress, but it is usually not sufficiently competent, and despite their indecent indecency towards her, she worked well with Olivia. This was taken at the beginning of Technicolor, which looks very primitive today (everyone looks even worse than Michael Jackson), but it may be necessary to clean the print.
