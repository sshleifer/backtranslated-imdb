I loved this movie! I'm biased when I see that I'm a big Disney fan, but I really enjoyed it. Action starts at the beginning of the movie and continues to continue! This is a little departure for Disney, they do not spend so much time on character development (my husband pointed it out) and no music numbers. This is a strict action adventure. I have thoroughly enjoyed and recommended it to anyone who likes Disney, whether it's young or old.
