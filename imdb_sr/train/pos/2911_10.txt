This is one of the best music concerts that everyone will ever see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was brand new and was being heard again by the original artist today, and that is the measure of Sir P Mc's power to drunk any audience of any age. This documentary goes far behind the scenes to show us life on the road not only for the band, but also for the road. I saw this type of live in Aussie in 1975 and I assure you that his performance on this DVD is no less than it was almost 30 years ago. I have a huge 5.1 surround system that works this justice and I would recommend this to everyone, especially the Beatles fan. This is the closest you will get at Beatles' concert today. Singer, songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, only pure genius. There are few entertainers who can stand alone with one instrument and hold a pile in their hand. If you want to write perfect music, buy a studio recorded CD. If you want to hear raw music that is intended for spontaneous audiences, with all the excitement and emotions of the audience - this DVD is for you.
