Another comedy about a tiny little country struggling through the jungle of a modern (in forty) global world with only the domestic spirit and the resourcefulness to lead them, this is a good entrance to the Ealing top. Terri-Thomas, as a common spark in his head, as the careless man of the ministry led to the edge of a disaster when the nation for which he was allegedly in charge of attracting the world's interest, Ian Bannen makes a great romantic advantage, says Peter Sellers one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politician and uber-suave John Le Mesurier plays against the guy as a rude revolutionary leader. Everyone has a lot of fun, especially the viewer; maybe not in the very top of Ealing classic, but rather high.
