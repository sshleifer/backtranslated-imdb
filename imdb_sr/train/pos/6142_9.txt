A wonderful Disney movie with Angel Lansbury in good shape as a medieval young daughter whose interest turns into sorcery in England's 11th World War. Lansbury had 51 years in film time and she is ideal for the part. She is again Jessica Fletcher, but this time for the welfare of children and mothers of England during a great danger. The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a professor. sorceries in an attempt to get certain information about sorcery. These 3 small gifts sent to live with Price to avoid London bombings are wonderful in this fascinating movie for all of us, regardless of age. There is so little work in this expensive movie. I really thought about Ben Stiller's movie - "Night at the Museum", at the end of the movie when relics revived in the fight against Nazi invasion in a small British seaside town.
