I do not want to stay here for a long time here around the plot - you saw a trailer, and if you are not online. I do not recommend watching it - it was badly made and it did not pack any laughter or magic from the movie. So those who avoid this movie because of their bad trailer, should give a chance to this. It's really funny. I was thrilled with the wisdom and originality of this film. The first 40 minutes was on the floor in hysteria - my only problem was that I unnecessarily developed into a bad Austin Povers film in the final 20. However, this is one of several films in which the end of the camp did not make me the unpleasant rest of the film (which is usually the case). Everyone gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack), and there are really great moments. I personally plan to see him again when he goes out - just to grab all the details that I laughed at during the first watch!
