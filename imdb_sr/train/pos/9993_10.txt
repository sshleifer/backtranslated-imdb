The most colorful and funniest Brooks film I've ever seen. I can watch and watch the video again 100 times. I laugh and go and cry for moments. It's really a good and fun movie, and if you love Brooks - this is a must! In short - Brooks (billionaire) enters the streets as a homeless person for 30 days to win his poor neighborhood from his competitor. Reality bites, but in the end - it's about warm relationships between people ... Highly recommended!
