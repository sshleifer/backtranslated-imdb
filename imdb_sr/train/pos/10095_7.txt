My parents took me to this film when I was nine years old. I never forgot it. Never before did I see anything nice like Elizabeth Tailor. (She was twenty-two years old when she made a Walk to Elephants) Remember, I'm nine years old, so the feelings are not sexual, I could not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit under her feet like a puppy and look at her. She began to show her age, (she's almost seventy-four years old), but I still believe she is one of the prettiest and most beautiful women they ever lived. Since then, it's a gloomy melodrama. What saves it is, of course, the beauty of Miss Taylor, the magnificent landscape, the very impressive elephants of the stampede and the well-made point on the human arrogance in front of nature. - spent hours watching a movie channel or rented video.
