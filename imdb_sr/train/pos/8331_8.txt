this film is a very relaxed, romantic comedy, which is completely pleasant. Meg Rian is doing a very good job like the genius nephew of Albert Einstein, although she believes in her abilities. Tim Robbins performs the same good job as a mechanic who falls in love with her when he comes to his shop with a fianc√©e after her car is boarded. I loved Valter Matthau as the only Albert Einstein. This film has a very relaxing feeling, but it still has some kind of seriousness (if it's really possible, it's happening here too). old scientists - I thought they were fantastic and hilarious! This movie seems to be underestimated. If you have a cheeky sense of humor, this is a movie for you!
