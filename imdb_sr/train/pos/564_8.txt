Colorful west. Cowboy Wyoming James Stewart moved to the territory of Yukon to dig up gold, sell his oxen and try to find a way out with the pretty owner of the salon Rutan Roman, if he could shave the tail of the rotten Sheriff John McIntirer who wants Stevart's cattle. Beautiful cinema in collaboration with Villiam Fritzsche and Bill Daniels. Good Technicolor adventure from Universal-International, directed by Anthony Mann. Also starring Corinne Calvet, Connie Gilchrist and Walter Brennan as Stevart's assistant.
