I will not go into too many details about the plot of this film, because other reviewers covered almost the same field. I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the movie. The performance of Peter Falk is a sufficient reason to watch the movie. The little 'road trip' film with Falk and Paul Reiser in New York in the autumn, is the setting for most of the action in the movie. Very well written with target audience for adults. A lot of humor based on reality and some well-played drama give the movie a feeling that it could be your own family. I really can not say enough about this film, except that it's a shame that a wonderful movie does not get more exposure like this, while other trash trashs work there. It's great to see Falk with a big lead and he makes the best use of it. This proves that his famous friend and writer / director John Casavettes was right when he played Falk in many of his basic films in the '60s and' 70s.
