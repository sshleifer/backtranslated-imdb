I did not mind all the walking. Then people really walked in places. She borrowed authenticity in this period and some views on Martian technology. I was also disappointed with the effects, especially the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider to be one of the most exciting in the book. But I can not boast this film because of his loyalty to Wales's story! It was about time. Actors are cute and performances are charming. Also, this movie is very worth watching just to hear a really great piece of music by Jamie Hole. It was interesting to see how the same actor plays both the writer and his brother in London.
