A powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and the breakaway Broadway's Bessie and Sadie Delani, two "colored" sisters who lived under the age of 100. Beautifully played in the ages of Rubi Dee and Diahann Carroll, they are telling their story in the flashbacks of Ami Hill Hearth (played by Ami Madigan), a white reporter for the New York Times. Flashback and today's scenes do not have so much inspirational value in them as in a book, but they are really powerful. However, certain aspects of the lives of sisters, such as their mother's racial background, and the reasons behind the sharp, sharp personality are not clearly presented. You must read the book to fully understand these things. What is good, because the book is just as good! Apart from these defects, she is beautifully performed and performed, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational film.
