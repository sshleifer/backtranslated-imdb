Although the word megalmania is widely used to describe Jenna Kelly, and sometimes his dance is too rigid, you must admit that the guy knows how to perform. In America In Paris, he choreographs some extraordinary numbers, some that stop the action, but are nevertheless incredible. (Make sure Gene Kelly "gets out of bed" for Gene) Gene Kelly plays GI in Paris, he stayed there to paint, soon a gigolo rich woman but really likes someone else! A safe story, but music numbers preserve the show here! I really liked the voice of Georges GuÂ¨tiar doing this. His 'Stairway to Paradise' and his duet with Le Gene on 'S Wonderful' is wonderful. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron can take or leave. All in all, pretty good but not a dynamic movie.
