This is the best of Shelley Duvall's high-quality series "Faerie Tale Theater". The ugly half-sisters are a comedical comedographer, and Eva Arden is the personification of the evil stepmother. Jennifer Beals is doing a great job as a real Cinderella, especially on the stage with Matthey Broderick's garden. Jean Stapleton plays a fairy tale, although I'm not sure that the "southern lady" is characteristic of some of the lines. The comedy of Steve Martin as the conductor of the Royal Orchestra is essentially Martin, but is a little lost in the flow of the show. 15 and more years. With a few small bumps, the performance flows well and lives happily for the rest of their lives. Children under the age of eight will continue to follow him after the parents eventually tired of it - I found three times in a day to be a little too much.
