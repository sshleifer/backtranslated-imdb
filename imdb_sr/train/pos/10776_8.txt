"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also directs the film and writes music - of course. Film is a portrait of life in the north of Italy, in the region of Emilia Romagna region. We were 1975, the time of the first free radio stations - one of the boys of the film is creating "Radioraptus". The wishes of young people, friendship, love, sex, individual drama and unemployment are among the topics, but the film also talks about drugs - Freccia, the main figure, is a victim of heroin slavery. No boredom and moralist, the story runs very well; The spontaneity of actors is a strong and directing way. Apparently Luciano "League" Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a film professional, primarily a musician. But it manages to make a good product. Unfortunately, she will not repeat the success with her second film "Da zero a dieci" - not at all good at all. In "Radiofreccia" actors are generally not very familiar, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular young Italian actors. You see, in the small role of yet another Italian songwriter, Francesco Guccini, he is a good communist bartender and football coach!
