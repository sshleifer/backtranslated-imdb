Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sidov (in a small role) are great in their performances. Sutherland is particularly skilled in this type of role, where he has to display a character whose morality, initially, is uncertain for the audience. As is often the case with Sutherland characters, we must ask ourselves, "is he villian [in this case, smaller], or a hero?" about incompetence and terrible bureaucracy in the old Soviet Union, which hindered the efforts of highly competent people. As Sutherland's character notes starkly, "the measure of bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions." The "committee meeting" (between Rea and Sutherland characters) after the perestroika was carried out, with its discoveries, has a huge emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of dedicated people who worked in that system. A lot of dramatic scenes featuring members of the victim's family adds emotional resonance to the influence of the story. This is rarely a feature of the film with this disgusting theme, but it effectively reminds us that the victims lived and were loved. on television history of Canada.
