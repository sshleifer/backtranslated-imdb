A wooden horse was one of the first "big" stories of WWII escaping, which spoke the true story of Eric Villiams and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. on VHS from Amazon in England and transfer it from PAL format to the US. I read the book when I was in high school, after I saw a part of the film in the early 60's on TV. to escape from Germany during the war is more realistic than the cracks shown in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure that should be made available to the American audience.
