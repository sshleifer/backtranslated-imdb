For a long time I enjoyed a series of laws and the order of the Criminal Intent. Kathrin Erbe, Det. Alekandra Eames, the detective is pretty heavy and seems a little bit bitter in a series of criminal intentions. See her other side in this movie. This film shows the strange soft side of this talented actress and if you are a fan of a criminal, this movie is a delight in her acting and you get a pretty good Yarn family strain game in the south. I did not like the role of Albert Finney in this film because he did so convincing the acting work of an older junior colleague who is hardly guided and intolerant and unacceptable for the changes. It reminds me of so many men from my youth and the portrait is divine, but you will probably find it hard to love in this movie. Katrin Erbe is easy to love in this movie and why I recommend it's 10 stars for criminals, lovers of law and order.
