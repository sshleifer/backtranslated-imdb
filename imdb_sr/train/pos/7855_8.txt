Tess of the Storm Countri was the Mari Pickford vehicle I intended to get for a while. I finally found a VHS copy for a reasonable price and I had to enjoy it. Mary gives her a typical stinking, innocent sexy portrait of a girl with the wrong side that wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time the roles are greater: the charge of false murders, the illegal child (and the case of wrong motherhood), and suicide thinking. You can see why Pickford wanted to repeat this. The story is a true story of morality, the one she liked to play. Controversial topics are not always clearly pronounced; the viewer has to pay attention and collect tips to capture everything that is implied at first sight ?? although everything is eventually explained more or less. The only negative remark I could give would be related to Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, seems to be around 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger next to Mary, of course!), Is sent on the run in panic when a 60-kg chocolate lab runs at him! Then, in the end (or perhaps justifying his confusing fear of the dog), he succeeds in clinging to the ground and somehow hurting him so hard that he is still struggling to get up much later, like a bad storm! This is the same kindly lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and marries Marie! However, Mary later dropped boiling water into Ben's face, which barely slows down! Okay, I opened up about Ben and the chocolate lab! In addition, the film was quite touching and it certainly attracted my attention. Pickford's support was strong and convincing. This is certainly among her better films.
