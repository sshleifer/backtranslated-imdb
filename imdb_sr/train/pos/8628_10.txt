"Der Todesking" - the second feature film "Jorg Buttgereit" (the first was a notorious "Nekromantik") has no central character or character, but a thematic continuity in the act of suicide. Divided into the days of the week, it consists of a set of set-pieces, each of which contains the self-destruction of a complete alien. Yes, the production values ​​are low and disturbing, but in many ways, "Der Todesking" is extremely effective. More important than pure entertainment. Unlike other Buttgereit works, it's not very bloody, but there are some unpleasant images such as the scene of castration in a Tuesday episode, the decay of corpses and various acts of suicide. and full of pain! - incredible, if you want my opinion.10 out of 10 - check this postmodern swinger! Disturbing art in the purest form!
