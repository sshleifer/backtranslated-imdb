I saw this movie on television and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and of course Mccomb. At that time, I was thrilled with watching this film, and since then I have been trying to VCD for this film, but I can not find it. The huge African lions look in his film and we will be spellbound limited by the size of these animals and their grace. All parts of the audience can watch this movie, especially the children will enjoy this movie. But some scenes involving Mccomb force parental guidance for this film. It's a nice holiday for everyone.
