It starts slowly, showing the gloomy lives of two housewives who decided to rent a castle in Italy in April, but do not give up. There is nothing much happening, but time goes by extraordinary, and there are also many crafty jokes (my favorite is ride in a storm in a storm, which I find ridiculous). The film is fantastically romantic in many senses of the word, the landscape is beautiful (like Polly Valker), and the resolution in the movie is very satisfying. The film takes several freedoms with the book, the biggest thing with Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but I actually loved this version of the movie (maybe it was more sentimental, but I felt that it was more in line with the tone of the story , and anyway I like the feeling when it's done well). Excellent movie, especially as a movie for meetings during bad weather.
