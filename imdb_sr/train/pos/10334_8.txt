Never before did I watch this movie at TCM and found this story about Poland and a small town that had to suffer the Nazi occupation of local cities, as well as many other European cities, for example: Norway. The First World War is over and people in this city have still suffered from lost soldiers and wounded by the war. Alekander Knok, (Vilhelm Gimm) "Park Gorki" returns from a war with a lost leg and was a former teacher in the city. He was raised and was not very pleased with the Polish people and they did not fully accept him again. As Hitler's party became power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazis in order to return and punish this little Polish city for their treatment of him, which was really in his head. Marsha Hunt (Marja Pacierkovski), "Chloe's Praier", played an exceptional role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically tied to Vhilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazis destroyed the families of people and their whole lives. Cattle cars are shown in this picture with the Jewish people who go to the Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie, and like this item, give it some time; this film is very grounded for a 1944 movie and a story you will not forget too quickly.
