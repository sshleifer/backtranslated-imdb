Belushi in his most interesting and Cortex Coke before Friends has a small role. I often think that Belushi is not sufficiently used in Hollywood and that this film role is one of its best. For those who watch his TV show, this is a very different and cute character. The film itself is not a devastating country, nor is the message new, it is sweet and dear. Supporters of well-known faces and unknown names are perfect balance, although Lovitz's whining can become tiring, and Michaele Caine's charming spiritual guide has a slightly malicious, if not benign edge. Hamilton, like Belushina's wife, is, unfortunately, two-dimensional and wondering why he married her. In addition, Renee Russo is futile and not terribly persuasive in the "Queen of the Prom Night" that escaped. Still, a nice way to spend two hours.
