A fierce, shockingly intelligent work from the gifted British writer Hanif Kureishi who wrote "My Beautiful Laundry" (this is the best thing he has done since then). These are intelligent people whose lives do not contribute much. They spent what they got and are mostly empty ships. The only character on the screen who is alive is the mother of the title, but she feels dead inside, while a rude master does not show her affection and wakes up to the joy of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treats him with much compassion. This is a movie in which people and places feel familiar, where characters exist outside the boundaries of the screen. In some aspects, it's a bit like "Sunday, bloody Sunday," but it's a tough job. Director, Roger Michell, allows scenes to instinctively build. And that's wonderful. As Anne Reid's mother issues her lost life in every gesture. There is no false note in her extraordinary live performance, and this very good actor Daniel Craig displays shadows to his character than even Kureishi listened to them. If the film finds a fake note, it may be, in the form of a daughter without talent, caught in a messy affair with a man her mother seduces (or should be vice versa), and even a messier life, but she is so acting Cathrin Bradshaw, but he teases you. The movie is also extremely nice to watch (DoP Alvin Kuchler) and must be regarded without hesitation as the best British film of the year.
