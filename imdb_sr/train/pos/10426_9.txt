I like about my recent personal experience. Especially the idea that everyone is free and everything is limited. Characters in the company did not really enjoy their "real" lives, but they enjoyed it, i.e. The film has done a good job making this simple day a good memory. Good memory not only includes romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but certainly a deeper discussion of their life values. Many films are like this in terms of discussing the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some kind of silence. Before Sunrise did it in a good way, the viewer stopped and thought, adjusted his breath and continued to watch the movie. Before Sunrise did not try to get a certain idea in the head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues in your everyday life and give you some alternatives. Thus conversations between characters were interesting, and not only typical grievous complaints or stupid ideas. You would still be thinking about these issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. However, the end was not important. You can get something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies should be comfortable. This is a nice movie and it's worth your time to watch it. I'm on my way too. The film somehow presented some part of me and answered some of my questions.
