My observations: the vamp outfit in the end is beautiful and beautiful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette was wearing it well, and even with naive Nelson. The boat that fell on his balcony was good for him. The costumes of his female mafia were designed to be surprisingly good, especially according to today's standards. In 1942, a costume designer did a great job. Main song theme just lovely. Caution for negative posters: 1942 was the time of the Second World War; Pearl Harbor happened a year earlier. The United States is just leaving the Great Depression; he had to go out and spend that hard-earned money on the diversion of singing, dance and, fantastic fantasies. Despot dictators tried to rule there in RL, destroying their freedom. Thank God that the audience had these fantastic movies for dance performances. The film was a privileged treat, in those depressing times. When you, negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have room for conversation and criticism. Jeanette and Nelson's films resist the test of time. Angel wings are beautiful, on the right angel. RL wings on a costed party are not so hot, but they are great for Jeanette with respect to SL. Jeanette's dance was pure pleasure. 15/10
