As another IMDB reviewer noticed, this movie starts a bit slower, but it becomes much better going on. Yes, it was published by Roger Corman, and yes, it goes on some of the same themes as well as many higher budget precedents such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVI. However, opposing her husband's career as a singer in the rise of the blues against the husband's loneliness and his almost Freudian need to fill the emotional and physical "emptiness" or "hole" while she is absent with the wise use of minimal effects and settings well done. Using a very small number of locations and characters, as well as using water in almost every scene and as a metaphorical symbol of cleansing and drowning, this film, although obviously suffering from a small budget, reminds me in many ways of a fuller and even more recent scenario, namely, the French film " POOL ", which seems to me at least, may have lent liberalized some useful ideas from" UP AGAINST AMANDA ". With a smaller set of tools, UP AGAINST AMANDA maintains its uncertainty with a rudimentary, fatalistic view of surrender by occasional lullabies, but it achieves either better or better than other films in this genre. The band that has abused Amanda in the past (again, very Freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction to Amanda's condition of this aspect of the story. I think the acting is excellent. <br /> <br />
