The film was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a famous girl. In her endeavor, the eldest sister meets a drug dealer and a street hustler called Satin, whom the Sister leaves because he believes that he is "a great time" who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted from life. Although he could have been charged with killing her, he really only kills his spirit and will for life, after which he becomes a drug addict and eventually dies of overdoses. The story does not deal with street life or an Italian mobster who is trying to buy Stika, but threatens him, it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as shown in the poem and style and character that was life in time for young women who are then trying to "discover".
