I went to see this movie twice a week and I can only sum it up with a single word (which I do not usually use): Great! In my opinion, the best film ever made. Who deserves Oscar and other awards, if not this Swedish team that created the film perfection in the last scenes of the film, when everything that is said (and not said) is accumulated through the story? Just as the figure of Daniel Dareus causes so many feelings and long suppressed feelings within people around him, the film does the same to his viewers: You go out with your head and bang your heart. Great stuff! The next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life," perhaps think about how you feel after a lavish experience such as in the sky: Happy, satisfied, fulfilled. To say that with Mrs. Dalloway from Virginia Woolf: "Such moments are enough."
