Sarah Silverman is like a completely manic Zooei Deschanel and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you loved Jesus is magic, you will be pleased with this. If you're not, what about you? It is a honorable comedian channel because it showed me in the face. My life finally has a meaning, and "Your car smells like farts" is my kind of humor. I'm a happy guy. In the first episode I hysterically laughed and I look forward to the next week. This is like Grease happiness South Park. Totally unheard. Sarah Silverman is someone I can watch reading a phone book. Its delivery is precise and so ridiculous. Never skip the rhythm. When I think about it, it's not so much her choice of material. which, after all, is really a good thing, because it is the way it wants it. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thank you, Comedi Channel!
