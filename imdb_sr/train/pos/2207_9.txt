It's not a bad word for this movie. At first, I was not impressed with it, but it grew rapidly. I really like it and I think it's a pity that many people do not see the past of the fact that it is banned in some territories, and mine is one of them. The film is shown in the shock department, in the mountains and in the atmosphere. The result is a beautiful piece of apparatus for uncertainty. It seems fair that Chris Ioung was one of the best composers in this business. The acting in this movie is somewhat of a high standard, if in some places it is a bit woody, and the effects are very real and big. All this is great praise for a good movie in my book. In some reviews, I noticed that the film became serious, and that the famous killer was killed. And I'm asking: WHAT HAPPENED WITH THEM ??? It's a classic clip that evokes fear into any good fan of this genre and is great for keeping the identity of the killer secret. The only thing that stops this movie from getting the top marks in my book is that the surprise craft (the detected killer) is not solved with more worries, I think it just happens fast, although the big performances make it credible. Besides, PRANKS is a great movie (although I prefer the original title) and it's a shame that so many people are cheating on him like cheap shit. That's more than that, but only a handful of them know he's lost in the fog of the early eighties. What a shame ... It's really good movie people! Trust me!
