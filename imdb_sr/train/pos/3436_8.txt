Letters without a destination end in another world found in the back of the mail. Here, Alice manages to go to work in the hope of finding her lost father. What she discovers is the tortured soul of her boss, Frank. A quiet little Aussie flick that came and went to the cinema. Now you find him in the deep dark corner of the video store, overshadowing fifty copies of that terrible GODZILLA movie. It's a shame because it turned out to be a satisfying movie that talks about a courageous story with strong simple pictures and effective performance from the two tracks. This film was successful where the second attempt of the dead letter of Garry Marshall DEAR GOD (1996 - USA) failed, and he approached the glare, not Kevin Costner, but He Jianjun POSTMAN (1995 - China).
