This is one of those films that they have promoted too much. If you watch TV, then you may not watch a movie. Almost all the funny scenes are broken in reviews, except for the one that is accidentally Jennifer Annisten. It's typical Jim Carrei humor and it's really funny. Just do not watch this movie, expecting it to be surprised. All in all, if you like Jim Carrei or comedy, this is an indispensable place, otherwise just watch the shows and you will be satisfied.
