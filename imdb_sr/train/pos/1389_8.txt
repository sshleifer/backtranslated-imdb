The Villiams family lives on a ranch located in the middle of a remote desert. They are in great danger when the city is suddenly caught up in a time whirlwind in which the past, the present and the future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film on an incredibly mysterious note and gradually allows things to become unknown, crazy and exciting until the story of cunning takes place. Moreover, Cardos fills the screen with a multitude of brilliant visual effects and makes a nice job of creating a sincere sense of awe and wonder. A great sincere acting from the acting game is qualified as another great plus: Jim Davis as cordial patriarch Grant Villiams, Dorothy Malone as his happy wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as concerned Richard, Marci Lafferty as his beautiful wife Beth, Natasha Rian as a cute little girl Jenni, and Scott C. Cullen like Guti Steve. Funky Special Effects offer an inspired combination of twisty miniatures, neat stop-motion animations of the monsters (these creatures include a small, no-hair, big, lumpy, carnivorous, and skinny lizards) and elegant matte pictures. The Richard Orchester's orchestral score really guesses the place in which he is moving. John Arthur Morrill's sharp, sunny cinema also makes a trick. Funny movie.
