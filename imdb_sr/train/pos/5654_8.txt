I watched the show 10 years ago and I loved it !!! Now I'm in the possession of a DVD and I watched the series, and waited for the scenes I knew were on the show (when Lucas confronted Gail at his house) and realized he was gone - suddenly I watched the seduction without the lead up there. Then I went to the line to check all the BIOS stars and came across comments on the issue of malfunction. Thank you!!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Some commentators say "Dumper number 19, then Triangel 20, when others had it in another way." Also, Potato Boi 5 and Dead to the Vorld 6 were also inverted. Can anyone explain? "
