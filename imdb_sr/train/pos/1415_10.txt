I saw the German version of the film on German television and I was really stunned. Mostly I like to watch the documentaries, but I can not remember seeing something better than the Earth. I knew some scenes from Ioutube videos that I found by random search. I also remember seeing parts of a movie in multimedia stores that are displayed on high-definition televisions. After watching the movie, I obviously why the video is so popular among Ioutube users and multimedia retailers: It's so terrible and spectacular that you can not watch the screen, whether you are interested in Nature Documentary or not. No hesitation 10 out of 10. There are certainly still exciting movies, but in terms of documentaries, 'Earth' is definitely one of the best genres.
