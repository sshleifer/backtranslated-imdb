At two and a half hours, this is sometimes a slightly motionless film that was interrupted by huge battles for the sword. The struggle between darkness and light is marked by a constant motive of the blazing sun and is demonstrated with a thoroughly demonstrated three-dimensional battle of "demons", bandits and soldiers in the forest during the eclipse. Be ready: after a stunning battle with swords under the swollen sky, the end of this picture will scare you astoundingly.
