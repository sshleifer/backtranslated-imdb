I saw a movie a few days back on the video tape and although it was hard to swallow it one time (because of its length and story), I really liked it. I was first impressed with the script, and then with the realization of this scenario. The movie takes you for a ride, but it's not a light, joyful ride; it passes through time and different political regimes and shows their influence on the lives of ordinary people. What I loved was the internal logic followed by the film; logic, which, just like logic in life, was sometimes illogical and confusing, but in the end, when I was thinking about it, all the events and reversals made sense. However, it makes no sense to try to recount a story that has been expanding in more than 50 years. I also liked Nikita Mikhalkov, Alexei, and the way he played it, as some critics would have seen, with a restless departure. What I did not like was that I think he later played characters that remind me of Aleksey in films like "The Cruel Novel" (The Furious Romance, which I really love) and to some extent in "Enemy and Hurt" ("Unizhennie i oskorblionnie "). "Sibiriada" shows, I mean, what big film maker Andrej Konchalovski was before he went to Hollivood and made forgetful films such as "Tango and Cash" and less forgetful than "Runavai train". I would rather "Kurochka Riaba" for them ...
