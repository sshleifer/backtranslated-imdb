This is one of the first films I remember, or maybe the first one. It's this beautiful type of film, rather than the boy, sweet, realizing the world of violence and addiction when we live. Little Babe, Casino and Constantine, all this is well mixed in the box, and we get this. I do not know if she is really ranked for kids, but I think it was very cool, very funny and interesting. I hate when a movie (a spell box) can have a good end and its destruction, because every character must have a happy ending, even if it sounds weird (I'm not a bitter person). These are all critics. His good movie is something new. very touching and I have to go
