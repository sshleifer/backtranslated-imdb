Miike makes a children's adventure movie, unlike Neverending Story. It's actually one of my least favorite film directors. Even the worst Miike is better than good films, and the Great Iokai war has a lot to be recommended. It's at least as loud and disgusting as most American bosses. Perhaps I think that the children themselves would love it too much (DVD contains an English dub), but, like all Miike's films, it can move very slowly. This means that you have some strange unevenness, where there is sometimes a loud action sequence, and the next scene will be dragged forever as signs. The story itself is not very good, and Miike's constant mistake in unity emphasizes his ugly head. Most of what I liked was from the technical side of things. This must be Miike's most expensive movie and it looks fantastic. "Iokai" are Japanese ghosts, and they come in all different, fantastic forms, and costume designers, special effect crews and all the others who have participated in the design have just done an extraordinary job. I saw a 1968 movie that was allegedly based on (Iokai Monsters: Spook Varfare), and a cheesy monster with a rubber suit that you can find there has turned into more convincing subjects using the most up-to-date makeup and special effects. I especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), Agi, who deals with black eye shadow, a narrow, white suit, a white hive and a whip. It was by chance accidentally played by Chiaki Kuriam, whom you may remember as a teenage daughter Lucie Liu in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The hero of the movie is Riunosuke Kamiki, who gave voice to Miiazaki Spirited Avai and Hovl's Moving Castle.
