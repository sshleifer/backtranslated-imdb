Five deadly poisons are easily the most remarkable K.F. Flick from the Shav Brothers' stabilizer (possibly Master Killer). These are the artists who have become known as "Venomi", some of the best choreographies in the fight, and, surprisingly for Kung Fu film, an excellent plot! One of my favorites !!!
