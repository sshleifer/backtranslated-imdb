Okay, I saw this movie as a kid and I really love it. My parents never bought a movie for me, but I think I'll buy it now and buy it. I am a fool for animated films before 2000. In any case, on the review itself. WHAT I LIKE: There was a real display of heaven and hell, one of the few that I saw in animated films. Character development existed! It's easy to classify the characters in this movie (for example, Charlie is a selfish jeweler, the itching is cynical, but he believes Charlie, Carface is obviously merciless villain, etc.). I also loved the song of King Gator. I've always loved loud, boring, shiny guys. This song may have been coincidental, but it was so fun. Finally, the detail of the animation was fine. It could be said that Charlie was rude and that the backgrounds were beautiful. WHAT I DO NOT HOW HERE: A true portrait of the sky: the way Charlie reacted to it, "without any surprises," he managed to seem very boring. He denied the place in the sky and STILL had to return to him in the end. I remember several lines of some songs like "... you can not keep a good dog down", "... let's make music forever," and "... welcome to be dead", but I can not remember most of any from them. The songs were not so attractive, to be honest. Vhippet Angel: She's boring and this NECK! EVERYONE! WHAT PARENTS CAN NOT DO YOU: Some very scary (depending on the viewer) images of Hell are shown during the film. Carface is pretty dangerous. Beer is also implied, but it is not really a DUBBED beer. Gambling is a key element of the movie. A good guy is dying. OVERALL: I love this movie, even if it is sometimes a little forgotten. Scary children's animations are always my favorite. This was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to give children some a little fear. Today, this would probably be rated PG. Children under the age of 8 (or easily disturbed children) should not be watching this. Besides, I give her 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> <br /> Happy watching!
