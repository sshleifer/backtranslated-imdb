Intensive actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward make up this modern film noir winner. Of these three, I do not know who was the most interesting, because they all offer good performances and intriguing characters. Vov, that just makes an interesting guy! It looks stupid, but it's not. The department is a wicked, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate co-founder of the hijacking plan that goes bad. Bruce Dern is also in the mike, and Dern never fails to fascinate any movie. I do not like to normally depress movies. What I found was an unusual movie about crime. Look and see if you agree. This is a pretty unknown movie that should not have this status because it is just a good story and well made.
