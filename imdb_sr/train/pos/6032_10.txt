Antonioni actually showed some 'cojones' when he made this movie. He went to America working under the most expensive studio contract (MGM) and made the most cruel portrait of an American society I've ever seen. Since LA was first seen, it is the most accurate view of the crowd, the overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni met Bill Hicks ... Later burying of the studies is understandable, after such a large investment and sad return. It's sad that people no longer see this movie as I think Antonioni is proven right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in America's politics. Everyone is much more interested in what enters their pockets and ruthlessly spreading the living space in an uninhabitable (but beautiful) desert and wider. How would I like to see the interest in this movie again I set on a lavish DVD edition. Please people to watch Zabriskie Point with open mind and open heart. We have a truly unique movie that comments a milestone in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet, and we forgot about it. Unexpected jewel.
