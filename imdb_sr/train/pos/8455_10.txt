While I was an impressive young man when he first experienced the Gundam Ving series, after re-watching the series, I again confirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, gundam design, character design and depth of character are masterfully executed. Although initially appearing as a kind of children's band, the stylistic appeal of characters can be partly attributed only to great art, with some individuals creating clear and precious differences between characters. Accordingly, it is extremely easy to become attracted to a certain character. Personally, Heero liked me for his stoic personality. Although I can be biased with the sentimental attachment of this play to my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Ving deals with deeper issues of war and life in general (how can we get peace?), While we offer actions in large robotic suits. , which is, at the very least, excellent.
