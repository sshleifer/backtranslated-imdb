This is not "so bad that it's good," that's pretty good! For those who do not understand why, you have the intellect of four-year-olds (in response to a specific comment ...) In any case, Killer Tomatoes eats France is a parody of yourself, a parody to you, and a parody of me. This is the most genial text in film history. I also have three signs that sit on my DVD carrier next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines everything that you or I call the standard. I am writing scripts and this film has opened a comedy genre for me, which we have never seen before. It can only be taken to parts ... of its kind of exploitation ... so far I am only trying to get a minimum of ten lines. My comment was over some time ago. I hope it works when I give it now.
