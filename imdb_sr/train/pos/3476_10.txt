Let's go hunting: If you're a baby boomer, you've inevitably spent some time wondering if in 1976 McCartney had a chance to fall into the life of his hermit and spend the day with him. You also wondered how things went. I heard the same reports that the writer of this film heard from John and Paul's perspective, and I admit that I reconstructed the meeting in almost the same way as this film. But none of my fantasies could buy me tears in my eyes like this incredible job and acting. I found it incredibly realistic, perfectly acceptable and 100% free of saccharin. Can anyone explain why I did not hear about this masterpiece before it was shown to the CBC last night? I mean, for three years, for God's sake! And yes, if you are a fan of the Beatles, this is an inevitable performance! Even the subtle paraphrasing of Beatles' melodies in the background is inspired.
