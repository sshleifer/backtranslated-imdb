This and "Her soul of pilgrims" are two of my favorite episodes in this new Tvilight Zone zone. As I mentioned in my commentary on the new series, something in the new series is missing. Perhaps they too emphasize the lesson to be learned. It's a bit feline and more sentimental than the Serling version. However, this episode can also be considered quite sentimental. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, lovers can never unite. I remember that I was not surprised by the Korean film "Il Mare" (later transformed into "Lake House").
