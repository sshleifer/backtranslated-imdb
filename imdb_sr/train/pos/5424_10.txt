"Gunga Din": one of the greatest adventurous stories ever told! The story of the British foreign legion in the 19th century in India and the humble "aquifer" of Gunga Din, a local resident who aspires to be like his military counterparts; three British sergeants whose loyalty and friendship stretch away from the limits of full patriotism. Their true and lasting friendship is one for each other and everyone would be willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of another. Gunga Din also wants to be a soldier, especially Bugler, but he can never achieve this act due to his subordinate social position. However, the heroes are not created in accordance with their social convictions, they are created through their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others. Gunga Din tries at every step to prove his ability, but will he ever achieve an act that he so passionately seeks? .... "You're a better man than me, Gunga Din"! One of Hollywood classics and perfect 10 !!!!
