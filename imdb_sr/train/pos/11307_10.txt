To get in touch with the beauty of this movie, pay special attention to the soundtrack, not just music, but also in the way all the sounds help in weaving the pictures. How a beautiful introductory scene leading to the extinguishing of Gin sets the subject of moral ambiguity! Pay attention to how music introduces characters like we are guided within Giovanna's marriage. Do not expect that you will find much about the political life of Italy in 1943. That's not what it is about. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to music of images and sounds, you will be brought into a word that extends beyond neo-realism. By the end of the film we have moments similar to Antonioni's landscape that has more to do with the inner life of characters than with real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
