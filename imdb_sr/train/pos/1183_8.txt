A man adjusts to life again after 45 years of marriage. He also has to solve the problem of the family cow's militia, Tulip, who refuses to allow her husband to muse. As long as she does not imagine her wife who used milk Tulip. Tulip is based on the true story told in Griffith's family, about the generation of her grandparents. The film is a nostalgic review of the disappearing lifestyle, in which people still feel the sense of responsibility for each other, located in a lush green Victorian (australian state, not in the era) village. Writer and director Griffiths obviously has further ambitions in both areas, and this multi-award-winning short feature film of 15 minutes is a good start for her reel.
