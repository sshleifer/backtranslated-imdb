The comical joke between Villiama Povella and Jean Arthur is the culmination of this mystery of murder, which has one of the most beleaguered and unbelievable conspiracies. Powell is probably the most accomplished detective of the thirties, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a string of tiny rings. They are extremely entertaining to watch, so you take the courage of a plot of grain with salt and enjoy watching it unfold. Eric Blore has comic rebounds like Povell's butler. Pauel's contract with MGM included a clause that allowed him to refuse to be loaned to another studio, but he wanted to work with Arthur again and he liked it by eagerly accepting the task. Together they worked in two Paramount films of 1929, The Canari Murder Case and Case Greene Murder, in the Philo Vance series.
