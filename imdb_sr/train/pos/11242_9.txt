Anyone who is interested in pop music, and is not familiar with the British music trends of the late seventies, should definitely watch Breaking Glass at least once. The film, about the search for a young woman to realize her seal in the music world, perfectly captures the time, from open sexism, hard economic times, social reversals, to the shift of pop culture from rude punk to terrible fase. and pretentious futurism / a new romanticism. The musical and fashionable styles that are created every day in Britain in the late seventies are still rediscovered and recycled (since 1980, there was indeed nothing new). This was a brilliant time, and Breaking Glass tells a very personal story and explores the cultural landscape, and both of them are extremely good.
