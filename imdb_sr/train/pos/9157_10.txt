Jane Eire has always been my favorite novel! When I came across this movie version at the end of the 90's, I was thrilled! This is the best and most complete version of the movie book! This version is a bit long to sit in one sitting, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is incredible as Rochester. I was glad that they acted as a normal actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane, not a glamorous person. I love kits and location. For anyone who is a true fan of Jane Eire, this is a version for watching !!! For those interested, I just found this version on DVD. I watched my VHS copy almost to the crack, so I was thrilled to find it on DVD.
