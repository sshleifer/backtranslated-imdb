Today I saw a special progress. I need to inform you, I'm not a big fan of Dane Cooke or Steve Carell, so I did not have any expectations. I've experienced it quite a bit. The real-life day is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with their family. While in the bookstore, he met the wife of his dreams, only to find out that she was his brother's girlfriend. This film is pretty well made - sound recordings, cinema and acting are all top-notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem is that there seemed to be a lack of character development, mostly character of Dane Cooke. We never looked closely at the relationship between Dane's and Steve's characters, and I felt that this could have helped a bit to show what Dan's inner conflict was about Danin's girlfriend's fall in love. In addition, Real Life Day is definitely a solid, sweet movie - definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we got this year.
