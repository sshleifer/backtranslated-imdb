This film could be one of the most unwanted films about Bollywood history. This blockbuster from 1994 had all the good performances, music and direction. people who played their song "Ooe Amma" on their loudspeakers at the highest level. If anyone who likes to watch Neko Voli Vruca and is angry with Marilyn Monroe, he needs to see this movie. Thumbs Up to Govinda. the blockbuster will hit the Silver Screen. With movies like this Indian comedy they could never be dead.
