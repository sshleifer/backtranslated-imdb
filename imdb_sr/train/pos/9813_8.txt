This episode led Holodeck into the world of TNGs. The Jarada must contact and the precise greeting must be delivered or will offend them to a great extent. Tired Picard decides to head to Holodeck and start a wonderful adventure. The settings are great and almost as in the movie. Really, the Jarada probe sent shortly thereafter to damage the holodeck and all its safety devices stop working. Picard and now guests have to outsmart mobs of Gangland's 40's America and return to the Jarada randv. Picard correctly greeted Jared, and a new day begins between humanity and Jarada. This gem of the first episode of the season has set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures
