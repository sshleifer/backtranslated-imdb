Lately, a lot of shit is coming out of Hollywood. The friend sends me movies over and over again, like a surprise, it's great. I switched it on and could not stop watching, it's a drama, but with a strange turn. Imagine that Romeo, like in Shakepeare, had super power. It is both sad and poetic. Hollywood should pay attention to the new Russian cinema, tell stories that do not involve large explosions and cgi. She takes a simple basic premise and tells a story without a spectacle. This is much like Asian movie with a dark Russian craft. Of course it's not perfect, but nothing is. You know what power is, but it never explains, or is fully realized until the end. This becomes secondary to the story of the story. I do not want to see the remake, it's too cool, the Hollywood system would, as usual, screw up. The acting is at the top. Directing and working with the camera are far above most of the shit that's there. Honor everyone involved and I will turn many people into this independent ep. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find me, watch it.
