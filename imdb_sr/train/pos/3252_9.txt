The story of "The Woman from the Nigga" is quite simple and quite adapted immediately from Eastern Spaghetti Western: a mysterious alien comes to a city without a law that leads the king's king and begins to shoot at that place. Even the opening and the music have the spaghetti: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. Really interesting sites are that the stranger is beautiful (!) Woman, Saki (Rioko Ionekura) on Harley, and the location is somewhere in the city somewhere in Japan. In this action there is a considerable amount of pistols, some of them are good, some predictable, and other places are a bit silly, but fun. Rioko handles his pistols with conviction and self-confidence and gives debtors his duties. There was not a lot of acting challenges for her, because it was a physical challenge, but things worked well. She shows her acting career more like Otsu in the NHK drama "Musashi". I recommend the movie if you are a fan of Rioko Ionekura (which I adore) and / or a "girlfriend with a weapon" movie fan and it holds up to repeated reviews. For me, there is something strikingly and unexplainably attractive about the movies of "arms girls" such as "La Femme Nikita" and "Long Kiss Goodnight". And have a beautiful girl like Rioko who plays in it, and that's just a bunch of icing on a cake.
