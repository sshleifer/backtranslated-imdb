I was quite surprised that I read some comments on this work, honestly. Some people were looking for land? OK, when this video came out more than a decade ago, I watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. No plot, nor a central story. It is quite an artistic anthology of most feature-length videos, and they all worked smartly or creatively. Michael Jackson can be considered a freak today, but, after all, it was the man who gave us the Thriller (which many consider to be the biggest music spot of all time) and set the trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who worked with him again took his musical and dance moves to create some lively entertaining things that included claims, special effects, live performance recordings, and even self-parody ( "Badder" sequence). And for those wondering what Joe Pesci was doing there, this video came out just before he became a host, and was one of his unforgettable appearances on the movie. And, IMHO, I think the Smooth Criminal sequence (choreography) has won everything Michael Jackson did to that point!
