A bit slow (somehow like a movie from Sofia Coppola), but still a very amazing film about discovering sexuality in three teenagers. The magic of the film lies in its ability to bring back many memories of how their age was felt. Confusion and insecurity are presented in a very simple way, but they are so true. The music is perfect and the acting is incredible. The camera also works perfectly. I recommend it to those who are not afraid to look at this period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also say that this is a good movie for young people who are going through that period. So many films have been made about adolescence, but this really includes the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexity.
