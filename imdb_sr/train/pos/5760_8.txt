My roommate ordered me to get this off the Internet, and finally I looked at him. That's disgusting. It's cheese. It's pretty stupid ... but it's fun too. I mean, this was the most fun thing we've been watching this kind of film since the "City of Walkers" many years ago. It was like the old Drive-In Theater again! You could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the terrible zombies. This guy has all the clich√©s and tricks of those movies in one, and that's fine, because SUPPOSE is like that. The factor of the cheese is high, the flow is up and the laughter rolls! The effects range from the messy to the good, with the one in which a man is separated in half, and the one in which his heart is pushed through his chest, and both are excellent! The acting goes from terrible to pretty good. There are not many complications, only a lot and a lot worse. This model is modeled on zombie films from Italy and Spain, because they are always reserved for rough scenes like this film. If you like Troma movies, things with B-grade, then you can not look at this wrong. A nice way to lose Friday!
