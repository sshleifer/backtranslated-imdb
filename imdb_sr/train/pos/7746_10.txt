Those who know the dEUS group know the singer Tom Barman. He directed this film a bit like creating music, it's a mix of everything. This is a comedy, although mostly absurd and cynical, drama, none of the main characters has a happy life at its very least, and in reality there is no goal. The film begins on Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes from several people, some of them have nothing in common, but will come into contact with each other during the day and night. There are several main characters: no one reads a teacher who writes books, a young morbid taste researcher and his sister, owner of the gallery, two young men who are in constant contact with the law, a man working in the cinema and two young women. Through the film a man has to do with the wind. All characters have their problems, with their family or friends, or just with their lives. The film is set in Antwerp and shows several beautiful city and port images. The events of the day are not easy to explain, I advise you to simply watch a movie, it's simply too much to say. But I can say so, Barman has a great use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, not really rock) to set the mood, especially the fun filled with great music. This film is an experience in itself, it will not leave you wiser about life, you may just have to live it, not spend it, or have any false moral truths. In short, you see, it's definitely worth it!
