While Rome is maddening and celebrating Hitler's visit - uniforms, bands, parades - two outsiders stay at home, in a large building and end a meeting. She is Sofia Loren, the wife of a brutal civil servant and mother of six children. He is a Mastroian, a radio loudspeaker fired for his homosexuality. Both of them need a company and understanding, and both find them in each other. The film covers a range of several hours. The color is faded and everything takes place with the soundtrack of military marches and hysterical radio speakers. Interestingly, the Nazi anthem - Horst-Vessel-Lied - has become a romantic musical theme. Divan movie, excellent recreation of a special era in the history of Italy and a touching, sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we expected, and Sofia Loren is doing a great job, very far from her usual driver truck driver, Naul's personalities of fish animals. Do not miss.
