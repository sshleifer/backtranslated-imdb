Cross-eied is a very original and fun movie. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the genre of comedy and really makes it a good way. This film is smart, concise and constantly fun and fun. As a writer / director, Jones shows complete control over his characters that are both absurd and cute. The story is definitely something you did not see before it was good. He is unique and fun, and he works in visually fantastic elements, as well as a long lost slapstick genre together in the form of a cordial comedy. Very promising first film.
