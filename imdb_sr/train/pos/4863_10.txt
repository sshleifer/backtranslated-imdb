When the musicals were not showcases for choreographers, we had wonderful movies like this one. Being a great fan of Vodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was delighted to finally see this movie. Not exactly the connection between Vodehouse and Hollivood, but close enough. Some of the American hummus, slapstick, and not a witty joke, clash with Vodehouse's British sense of humor. But, in general, the American style joke makes American characters seem real rather than cardboard cartoons. because of the lack of Busby Berkley above the top dance number. They look much more realistic, if you can ever imagine that people start singing and dancing as real. The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore does not damage the film, but allow a different character dynamics to emerge. It's also nice that we do not have wise cracks, stubborn love interests. Instead, we have a gentle stubborn interest, much more in line with the young aristocratic females Vodehouse.
