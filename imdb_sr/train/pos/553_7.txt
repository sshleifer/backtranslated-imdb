After losing the cattle herd for a dishonest lawyer, the head of the track may appear on the golden fields of Yucono with a bad reputation and little chance of returning to the States. While his fortune turns for the best, until the spooky happiness from the past comes out. Good western with many favorite old faces in the post.
