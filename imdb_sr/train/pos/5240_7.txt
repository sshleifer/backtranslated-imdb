Some of the actors were a little suspicious. I recall that Assipe Alekander Valker (Evening Standard critic, yes, OK, is now dead) launched into this film about it's a shame that shows NO protesters as killers. Now, when it comes to all Protestants, NI, this film was loosely based on Shankill Butchers (who were loyalists) and wandered around Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they were not called the butchers for nothing. my main clinging to this film is that it does not show the air of light or hope, everything is ruin and dark, I think the little girl eventually had to die. Perhaps this sounds futile, but it may have been taken that all Prods and tiags are not good or bad.
