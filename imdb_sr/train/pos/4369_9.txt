I loved this movie. The landscape took a breath, the shop had some nice crafts, and the characters were well rounded. On two fronts, however, Rob Roi was far above the average. First, I rarely saw a "popular" movie in which the quality of the dialogue was so high. There were many verbal pieces and shots that were followed by a great choreographed fencing. I could give a lot of examples, but why would I? Just watch the movie. Secondly, this film has understood a principle that is rarely recognized. In order for the drama to be successful, it needs not only a hero, but a really faithful villain. If you do not have it, there is not much joy in cheering for good guys. And "Rob Roi" had none, but three - Count of Montrose, his assistant Kilairna and Archie. Not even one-dimensional villains, but fully developed and very nasty. It takes a bit more patience than "Braveheart" - it has more dialogue, and the accents are a bit heavy, but it's much smarter and subtler. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
