Cameron Grant is one of the best directors working on adult films. His only opponent is Andrew Blake. Celeste is a dynamite through the film, but the order of the DR offices with her and other ladies is incredible. Almost the same is the performance of Asia Carrera with a construction worker. I highly recommend this film and gave it 9. It's almost as good as the Cameron Grant ELEMENTS OF WISH I've given 10.
