This film is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. Votes for animals are wonderful. Salli Field and Michael J. Fok is brilliant as a skinny cat and a young inexperienced dog, but the real look is Don Ameche as an old, faithful golden retriever. This film is an excellent family movie, because children and adults can appreciate and love him. Humorous and tense, and guaranteed that every animal lover will cry! (happy tears!)
