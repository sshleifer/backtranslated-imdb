The Trinity vignettes were discerning and pretty pleasant. It was curious to see so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young. The performances and attention to detail were great for watching. Observation. In the film, it is not necessary for the original material to be consistent with modern times in order to be interesting or worthwhile. The narrating of the story of "little morality" is strange (or modest) only in the eye of the observer - fortunately. The content of the story - well-stated - can overtake the time, subject or place. Ironically, today there are many contemporary movies that have not overcome the convention or harsh customs of today's era. Inserting the contents of "low morality" - occasionally - can provide the missing dimension.
