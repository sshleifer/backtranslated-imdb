Although this does not necessarily have to be the so-called "classic" film according to today's standards, it's still worth seeing. The main reason is that after experiencing this movie you get the feeling that you have experienced the counter-artistic idealism of the sixties, no matter how good or bad it is. I accidentally saw this film on English Literature at SUNS Geneseo, and although at first glance it seems to be just a meaningless composition of the 60's, the film is far from being simply "thrown together ". if you leave the film feeling unhappy and confused, the film has done its job: he has passed a vision of the future that leaves a feeling of insecurity and anger. Perhaps it was the same feeling that the film tried to explore in the youth he had illustrated. As such, "Zabriskie Point" may not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters can be one-sided and predictable. However, she so conveys this kind of clich√©, rebellious desire to get out of the existence that Mark and Daria must share. Even students against the institution are inauthentic as the government opposes them.
