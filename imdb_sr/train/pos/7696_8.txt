When "Good Times" was premiered in 1974, it was the first black family sitcom. She was focused on the poor Evans family in Chicago and their fight to end. Most of the early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and their fight to provide the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were great actors and they had great chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J. J., Thelma and Michael. J.J. he was a jumper skipper, but a benevolent son of a teenager who compensated for his lack of subtle artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, cheerful girl who was constantly trading insults with J.J. Michael was a miracle of a child who was well educated about social issues and was destined to become a lawyer. This really changed the focus, not the good I could add. Emissions began to focus more on J.J. and his behavior resembled the cunning that angered the black spectators as well as Esther Rolle, who went after the next season. Instead of a play that focused on the key African-American problems that existed in society at the time, the viewers showed overloading with folds of skirt and thick jokes. they showed even more. Although it was still visible, it was no longer a major revolutionary show that was once. Although Esther Rolle returned for the 1978 season, it became apparent that the show was on the back legs. . All free ends were tied during that season and the show quietly faded out of the air. First Three Seasons: A. The last three seasons: C +.
