Varvari may not be the best movie that all of us have seen, but really ........ It's so funny ... I can not describe how I laughed When I first saw her. The director is I really wanted to make a serious adventure movie, but it's also a bad thing .... so bad it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. so my advice is that you should see ..... and if you did alredi, it is again !!!!!!!
