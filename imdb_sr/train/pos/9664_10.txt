Bette Midler shows her talents and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I'm delighted to have taken her and I can watch her whenever I want to. It has what it takes to keep the audience in captivity. Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will really impress you. The highlight of the show was her song "Stay With Me" from her 1979 film "Rose". You can feel the emotions in the song and in the end you will have a crowd. The show will leave you with the desire to go out and rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of the albums Bette Midler.
