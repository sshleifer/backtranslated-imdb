This film is a version of the 1950s Brutti sporchi e cattivi. Less sex and less realism, but a story with great humanism and warmth. I would not call it a neo-realistic picture. He is very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and probably should be classified as a comedy, although he deals with serious things (somewhat like Chaplin or comedy from 1930). Typically Italian, very emotional and difficult to resist except for a stone cold person. This sentiment was a disappointment, although this picture should not have been a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or a biker thief. But this is a lovable and hilarious comedy, with good music. 7/10
