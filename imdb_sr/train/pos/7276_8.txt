When I rented this movie I thought I would watch a horror movie. However, in this typical mysterious drama of the seventies, directed by the strange James T. Flocker's a little horror. The beautiful look of Matt Boston carries the picture with his fine performance and the typical strange atmosphere of Flocker films is ubiquitous.
