You can find this gem in your video. Human Condition in Modern Times LA. There is no overwhelming drama, just a collapse of events that can happen to any group of individuals over time. It helps you understand the joys and despair of city life. cutting is top-class. Cinema and music closely follow the mood and situation. I CAST !!! Excellent casting and great acting. Nobody is in place or out of character. It is NOT exactly as much as you would expect. I gave her 7 out of 10. <br /> If you did not see it, DO!
