************** Possible spoilers ********** There is only one reason why I watched this movie, and that was because I fell in love with Richard Belzer. I do not know much about humor.) There were some parts that were ridiculous. Like Barbie and Ken Spoof and dealers and president skit. Keep in mind that this is sometimes indecent (Dare, I say raw?) It was funny, but it could have been better. Probably having spent more time in humor and less time for women to pull off, the movie would be ridiculous. Some sketches just make you want to clutter yourself, and get stuck, other skitches make you smile and wonder strangely enough. Unfortunately, this film is dated. If you fall in love with Richard Belzer (worth it), it's worth checking and watching chevi chase.
