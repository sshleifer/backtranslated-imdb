I was attracted to this film the moment I saw him on Oscar. When I read about Kei Polak, I was hooked. We Americans are naive to return. I realized that this film was a big shit in Sweden. As a very provincial American I can only speculate about the reason. Perhaps this is because of the provocative joke that Lena characterizes at the beginning of the film and other social commentary, but perhaps it's because of the central message that I believe has the same appeal everywhere in rich societies. <br /> <br The message of this film for me is the same as the movie Titanic. Life is short-lived and as far as we know it's all we have. It can be taken away at any time. Is it not a waste to spend so much time hiding behind the walls that separate us from other people, because we are so afraid that we will not be hurt? The demolition of the walls is painful, but the feeling of life lies on the other side of these pitiful walls. A sense of life is worth the risk. Come and get it. So start living the United States. Many people criticize this film for lack of characterization and other disadvantages. I say that you are all pseudo-sophisticated. Accept people, it's a parable, a fairy tale for wealthy Westerners who are materially rich, but whose souls are in extreme poverty. those are less happy than you. Expand joy and make the world a better place as you go out and talk to your loved ones. Checking checks is not enough. By the way, we are a social kind. Even the most modest human beings can affect you in a way that you never thought possible. Solid individualism has its place, but it is overestimated.
