Even in the 21st century, the birth is dangerous: women have abortions and are born prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, it was not unusual for women to die during labor. It's the theme "Life Begins": a look at the "difficult case" of the maternity ward. Loretta Young plays the main role, the woman brought here from prison (what crime she did not do is not suitable for conspiracy) to give birth; she is in conflict with the fact that she will have to give her baby after birth. She is in the ward with a few more women who share their joys and pain with each other. Although Loretta Ioung is a leading, outstanding performance, as usual, puts Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women of the 1930s, appearing quite in support of the role, and sometimes leading in B films (Farrell played Torchi Blane in several series of "Torchi" B series). Farrell plays a pregnant mother who does not want her children because she will only bother them. She does everything that can interfere with nurses, including the smuggling of alcoholic beverages into the department (of course during the ban's day), and drink like a fish - it seems they have never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back to Interestingly, unlike most films from the early 1930s that women do not mind the idols to stand in the way of heroic men - this situation is reversed, with the expected fathers who shake the jelly piles. (See how the actor is veteran Frank McHugh as one of his father's fathers.) "Life Begins", as an early speech, treats a theme with a fair melodrama, but it's a pretty charming little movie. Turner Classic shows it, although rare; I saw him appear for a few days in honor of Loretta Young. However, it is recommended to look at it when it appears.
