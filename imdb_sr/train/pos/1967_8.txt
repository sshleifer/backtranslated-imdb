I do not understand why the reviews of this film are so badly universal unless I'm just on my rocker. I found it sick, brilliant, distorted and psychologically sophisticated. You will not go deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie than in this one. It has layers inside the layers, a shaded act from the Ston, and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's finished. People should go beyond the fact that Sharon Stone is 48, and that Michael Douglas is not in this. I predict that this movie will be a big hit on DVD when people see it themselves and stop paying attention to professional reviewers. Shoot, you may be glad you did!
