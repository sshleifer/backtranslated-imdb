Well, the main reason I was watching this movie was because Trey Parker and Matt Stone from the South Park fame did it. However, as soon as the film began, laughter began to emerge from my belly. From subtle gestures to scarf, to apparent toilet humor, along with constant reliance on some very witty insinuations. This film could ruin an event that is the hottest poker face, let alone its poker lingerie. Some of the funniest blinks and you will miss the jokes ever shown in Hollywood, with constant criticism of yourself cast in the contract. I only show that not only is Trey Parker skilled in writing. He is not too tattered in the old acting. I was surprised by the amount I absorbed in this movie. However, I am very concerned that it is not available for online shopping here in the UK. Sort the guys! I am and I will continue to show it to all my friends who boldly point to funny parts, and occasionally they sneak into my bar. All in all, a great movie if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. However, if you do not have a sense of humor about stupid or rude things, hold on well! However, I'm sure the inclusion of Jenni McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could push you alongside these prejudices.
