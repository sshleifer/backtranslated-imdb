I loved this movie. I'm a Mexican and I insult him the least. In fact, I think this film should be shown at the police headquarters across Mexico. It is sad that our police system is as dead as a three-month corpse. It makes me angry that in the news, I read that killers, kidnappers and other mucus free the payment of a false sentence or live like kings in prison cells. They should have someone like Creasy, a character of Denzel Washington. The bodyguard turned to the vengeful avenger. The abduction is here a flourishing industry (at least in big cities). In fact, I want real-life hijackers to suffer the same fate as the one who did his good job. That would be so wonderful. A MAN ON FIRE is a movie you can not miss. It may be difficult for some of you, if you are not used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do this all the time while watching American movies), but the effort will be worth it. Some of the editing is somewhat vague ... similar to TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant view of how Mexico is corrupt). The film starts a bit slower, but the pace is accelerating in the second half. I swear you will cheer as you watch Denzel Washington's sending the wrong executives. Its performance is nothing less than excellent. The end (without the spoiler, OK !!!) is a little sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best movies of the year. "Must Have" for DVD Collection! 9 * from 10
