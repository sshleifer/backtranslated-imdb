It can not be denied that Ealing comedies are good, but for me, this film stands out as one of the best. The premise of the movie is that a small piece of Pimlico in London was discovered as part of Burgundy, not the UK. We are then monitoring the lives of residents in their struggle to get the goods found after the bomb explodes and prevent black traders who soon realize that there is no exemption from the British law. When they become prisoners in their own street, because the government has decided to close the border, we see them fighting the system. They are forced to submit water and food at their booth for what is right. In fact it's getting worse than it was before it all started, it's the place where morality comes. When he loses all the food he thinks are beaten up and calls for surrender, only the whole of London responds to their condition by sending food, a lot. This allows them to continue their fight. This film is the right note, the acting is great, and Stanley Holllowa, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddelei and Betty Varren point out. The right is raised, not too sentimental and moral story of the story is not pushed into the throat. It's worth watching
