Serious comedy. The film version of the French play "Les Joies de la Famille", produced by Ross Hunter (later Americanized as "A Veri Rich Voman"), is plump, well thrown, sometimes funny ... and unfortunately timeless. A wealthy Californian widow, who seems to give up her money, transports her two adult, greedy daughters, who fear that Mama Rosie has neglected her inheritance. The whole question of a vital - but older - women sent to a vacation home against her will, and later to prove to be normal in the court hearing, is a sensitive material for comedy (and on his merit, director David Lovell Rich does not overload the picture with rude mistakes or obvious feelings ). Some humor is a bit broad and does not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits the fake note. Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's granddaughter, and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has so much to say about the importance of our elderly, and the ways in which they decide to spend the rest of the time, that the seriousness of the theme "Rosie!" She almost loses haste to a happy ending. The picture leaves you smiling - and at the same time you wonder how many older ladybirds have ever been so happy. *** from the ****
