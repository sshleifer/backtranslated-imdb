This is one of those little Christmas films for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that money is not enough, and hires a family who lives where he thought his family was. OK? This is a great small soap of high school, PG-13, but small recommendations about sex are comedies, so if your child can not deal with them, they can not live in the real world. Now, Affleck is a piece, and as usual, walking through this party, OMG, remember when we ... ... the ensemble seems to be at the end of some neuroinfective disease. But that's all right, because even this old Oracle hopes that if Ben is so well proportionate, so there's still hope for us ladies. Fortunately, the rest of the ensemble - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - fill up and hold this Christmas in Ozzie-i-Harriet, alternately funny, comfortable and warm. This movie is such that you can jump and get popcorn, and when you return, everyone wants to support it to show you what you missed. This is a happy movie, after all, and leaves you to feel good in life, love, family, christmas and chanel. There really is something for everyone.
