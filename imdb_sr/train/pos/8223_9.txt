When I first saw this film, in London in 1958, I was overturned. I've never seen such a movie before. He had a strange, hypnotic effect, unlike the movies I had seen before and left a lasting impact. I believe that Odile Versios and Marina are Vlady Sister, if not twins. Surely the interaction is incredible in its power to influence the viewer. If this is turned into a DVD in Region 2 format - in the original French, I would love to hear about it can be purchased.
