I have to agree with everyone else who published it. I watched him a long time ago, but I will tell you, whenever I hear certain music from this anime, I recall the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling I got when I watched it, and that He makes me cry (so happy, but sad feeling). However, I think that the love story in it was a bit of a hurry and did not correctly explain things, but it did not destroy any part of the viewing experience. I was so much in this anime after finishing I had to do a little research (and watch the finish several more times) and found all your answers and more. I love how they have configured historical legends to fit into this anime, it was incredible and it just made me explore more. (I've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime) I think it should have been a long series, but if that's all they were doing, then they got it nicely. I would recommend this to anyone who loves an emotional anime with a great story, well-built characters (some mysterious) and a little fantasy action. Also, although this was based on the H-game, there are none of these things in it and I really like this way. (I do not have problems with mature anime, in most cases I prefer)
