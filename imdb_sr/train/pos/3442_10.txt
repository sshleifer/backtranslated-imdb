This film leaves intellectual thinking and tries to analyze the story. And I can not understand why people would throw this movie. If you are a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, this movie may not be suitable for you. . The performance of actors and actors is obvious. Not fake, just natural. No special sound effects, so special adverse effects. The camera's performance is excellent, music is so good. I can not wait to get an acoustic background. Leaves your body stiff, like Constant Gardnerer.
