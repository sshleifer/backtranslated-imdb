A bit of typical film work from this era. Obviously, this is the first time imagined in this world for the scene, but still a very good movie from the beginning to the end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York can perform their stage performance for the silver screen and both work effectively. There is very little story and anyone who is not familiar with this type of character study can be slightly discarded. All in all, however, a Good Movie in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York are exaggerating.
