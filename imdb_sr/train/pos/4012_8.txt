After some difficulty, Johnny Juma arrives at the ranch of his ill uncle to take on daily operations, only to find that the old man was killed by his beautiful golden digger and the evil brother's wife. <br /> <br> Good production values, the sympathetic performance of Damon Dam and a lightweight action package make this fun, if not exceptionally deep, top-notch addition to the western spaghetti genre. Co-star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European girls ever who caressed the screen. Here it is absolutely perfect as a cold-blooded user (and abuser) of bad people. Damon and Neri have appeared together in at least one more picture, the Haunted Night of the Wedding, a pretty good horror movie that is of particular interest to those of you who want to see what's under Rosalbine's dress.
