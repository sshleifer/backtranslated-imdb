The love interest Jane Porter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh) came to Tarzan's hidden jungle slopes looking for a ivory gold mine that "The Elephant's Graveyard" was first seen in Tarzan, APE MAN ... only we will soon discover that both men have hidden intentions ... namely, Jane. Will Tarzan pledge himself for that? It is unlikely (in fact, Tarzan will not even stand up for any harassment of the "Elephant Cemetery") and knowing that Martin is trying to throw Tarzan out of the picture only later he is in trouble later and his party (including Jane, who leaves with them after which he believes is Tarzan dead) is caught by an indigenous tribe with the intention of feeding them with lions. Will Tarzan be ready and able to reach them on time? This film is an adventure filled with a multitude of scenes with Tarzan and other faces facing wild animals and the peak that captures the interest of viewers and does not give up. Animal cruelty and display of indigenous people today can disrupt some of them, but everyone should remember that this is basically fantastic adventure entertainment and should not be taken so seriously.
