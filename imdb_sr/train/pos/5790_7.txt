Wow! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is an enemy (she speaks Russian), then I surrender now. In her short skirt, high boots and an accentuated line of bust, she is a real baby, even if her zombie shadow somehow comes and goes. These 30 minutes are undoubtedly the sexiest. Pay attention to a realistic and revealing fighting match with Bronson as long as he blatantly throws himself on his chin, destroying all the fun. Okay, I probably should break my hormone response. This is very well produced half an hour from that underrated power behind the success of the series, Buck Houghton. Of course, manufacturers want to take the third season above the average. It's America after the Holocaust (we know because it is part of the invading force), and only US Bronson and the Soviet Montgomery have remained, along with twenty tons of real wrecks. They wander among the devastations in alternating moods, and we wonder how much time it takes for biology to overtake politics, which, of course, is, in the end, it is, (lucky Bronson). And that is all. There is no real story, except what Bronson has to say is pretty overwhelmed. Nevertheless, the scenario is still fun and pretty brave for its time, even suggesting that not all Russian women looked like truck drivers (a popular cold-weather stereotype). In passing - quite curious that Bronson (Buchinsky) who looked like a Slavic acted as an American and splendid Montgomery as a Slavic. In appearance, it should be the other way around. I suppose the producers did not want to put the American into the physically weaker role of women, regardless of their appearance. As much as it may be, there is little or no common TZ fear or atmosphere, yet the episode remains very, very visible for 30 minutes.
