For Muslim women in West Africa, marital life in the hands of the abuser's husbands can be very difficult. The community can not explicitly support such behavior, but equally, they may not yet be ready to see it as a crime, a position that of course allows for a continuation. Fortunately, the letter of the Cameroon law promises equality to everyone, and this documentary tracks the real lives of different practitioners in the Cameroon legal system as they try to ensure justice for a certain number of women and children. What is noticeable (except for the central story of the rise) is that, despite their informality, courts are actually pragmatically progressive, if the case is actually bought. The program also gives a fascinating insight into the entire Cameroon lifestyle, which (in addition to horrific crimes committed in prominent cases) looks stunningly emotional and joyful compared to those enjoyed by Europeans or North America residents. And while I acknowledge that this comment can betray naivety on my part, this view seems to have been caught in a wonderful pidgin-English language. All in all, this is a great little movie and much more fun to watch than you can imagine.
