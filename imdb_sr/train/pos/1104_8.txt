The film begins with Bill Coles (Melvin Douglas) who tells the story of his best friend - that client Jim Blandings (Cari Grant) and his family are firmly packed into a small flat in New York, with insufficient space in the closet and underfloor bathroom . When Jim's wife, Muriel (Mirna Loi) wants to renovate the apartment, the advertising boss Jim falls in love (or falls on!) House ad. When buying a house, bills and frustrations are constantly accumulating, because everything that can go wrong with the construction of Jim's "home of dreams" goes wrong. One of the three collaborations between Grant and Loia, this is a charming little comedy - not really burdensome, without a really big message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. Laughter is here from the very beginning, when the alarm is activated and Jim tries to turn it off, and Muriel turns it off every time. Time and delivery of comedy lines and situations can only be given by a few experienced professionals, and that's exactly what Grant and Loi give us: polished performances, simple chemistry and lots of fun. Mirna Loi is in a rather ungrateful role (it is obvious that Grant's character Jim gets the lion's part of lines and acting, and Grant, as always, separates both of them with extraordinary confidence), but Muriel gives color, life and bite that only Mirna Loi can give nature. Melvin Douglas also plays fun to perfection, never strikes a single wrong note. One of my favorite scenes must definitely be when Bill locked in the 'storage room', and Jim leaves. to "save him" ... just to get everyone captured inside! Every small problem that arises for the Blandings renovation project - including a petty jealousy and an advertising campaign for "Vham" - seems to combine everything that could * make a mistake with building a new home, but it makes it a convincing and comfortable clock. 8/10
