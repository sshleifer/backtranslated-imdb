The Noit Classic Ota Preminger is almost flip-side LAURA ... while this movie was glitz and featured by Clifton Webb, this film is much smaller. Dana Andrevs is less than a good cop who accidentally kills a man just to potentially tie him to the father of a girl he loves. Preminger holds that things move with a lively piston so that the failures in the logic are easily overlooked. Andrevs is quite good (much less wooden than he was in the past) and incredibly beautiful Gene Tiernei is stunningly beautiful! Crazy Craig Stevens plays an unhappy victim. WHERE ARE THE ROLLER AND THE INVENTORY SUPPORTER OF THE AMAZING VHIRLPOOL (which also plays Tiernei).
