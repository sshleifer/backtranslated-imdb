This was a really great movie. I loved Denis Kuaid and the entire baseball team. Jai Hernandez is also a very nice actor who is very pleased to watch. The chemistry that the team had after joining it was spectacular, it only shows what you can achieve when the minds unite as one with one goal. This team has returned from the edge, having more losing seasons to win almost everything. I love these films because they are really very inspiring. In addition, the character of Dennis Quaid gets a place in the main leagues. You can not do anything, but only for this guy. It seems that when someone needs something to do, they will do it. Things are easy to find in place and everything makes you click. Based on the true story, this movie will really tell you to think that "nothing is impossible".
