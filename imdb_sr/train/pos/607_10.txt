Perhaps I loved this film so much because I felt at the dumps and it's such a wonderful little fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, great acting (especially De Niro, which is great). This movie made me happier than I was some time. It's a very funny and clever movie. The joke about the history of the prince's kingdom of adultery and its consequences, the way it is delighted with the magic effects of the witch and dozens of smart little touches, kept me enthusiastically. That's a lot that makes him so good; it's a developed movie with special effects with more stories than in most of the fairy-tale movies, yet there's incredible attention to small things. I feel like I'm just going on and looking again.
