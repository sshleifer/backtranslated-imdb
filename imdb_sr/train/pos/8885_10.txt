Sometimes you have to look back to go ahead. The sixties just did it. We have to remember the past. The past is part of the future. Large mix of Garry J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserved to be nominated and win, the best mixer of the year 60. Best mini-series of all time. Thank You Ursuli <br />
