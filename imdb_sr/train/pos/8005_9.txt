I bought this game on the eBai after I heard it was a similar game Elite. The game is really similar and very addictive. After I played it several times, I immediately returned to eBai and bought copies for all my children so that they could join the party. if you're actually in the movie, that's great. If you have a problem with the freedom to explore because of the restrictive nature of the story in one-player game, simply set up a freelancer server on your PC (it's easy to do and the software is on) and play for pleasure. There is still a large number of freelancer servers on the Internet, so the multiplier is not a problem and not as dangerous as it does not mean that you often play other players unless you want to. Take a copy of this game, learn how to play a one-player campaign, then set up online presence and enjoy. The depth of this game is amazing, with vast systems for exploration and destruction to find, as well as all other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Fantastic game and especially as you can get for a couple of pounds on the eBa. Get one with a full written instruction if you can (a blue box, not an absent red box), that's better!
