I remember being a child when I first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's why I still remember some of his parts). I do not remember much of the acting, bare scenes or other things, but I remember that the man had a head that was shot in the air by a grenade, a man scattered over a tree, and a man who fell and shot in a truck with a truck :) (Todd Schaefer), Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McCalister damaged the killer's stomach to get the keys of the truck. It's a movie that gives you crawling and it's worth a look. But where can I find him? How can I download it?
