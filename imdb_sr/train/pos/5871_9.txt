I appreciate every frame of this beautiful movie. It's about ordinary people, people we all know, who suffer a bit in their lives and have some luggage to carry. Like all of us. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker bring life into their portraits and they are all great, but Harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real. He swore that he was really a truck driver who did not have to feel anything. Baker as his sister has some delicate moments - when DeNiro gives flowers in one scene, it seems like she has never given flowers to her before and probably not. Veri vorthvhile.
