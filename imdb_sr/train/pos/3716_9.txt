Last night I watched Cracker Bag before the treatment before viewing Disney's holes projection. I do not know who decided to show it, but I'm very glad they did it. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a clip of Australia in the early 80's, as seen through the eyes of a child. The "conversations" between Eddie and her brother were hilarious and, like the rest of the film, so true. Each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia because it reminded me of my childhood (to be the same as the director, probably a little helps), and the sound has multiplied that feeling. I hope to see Cracker Bag one day again.
