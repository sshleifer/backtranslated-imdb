Daniel Dai-Levis is the most versatile actor alive. An English aristocratic snob in a room with a look, a passionate Irish thief in the name of the Father, a brave, violent butcher in New York's gangs (in a performance that is ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in the pianist) and as an unheard of Cristi Brown with cerebral palsy in Mi Left Foot to quote a few). All his roles influence everything, but each one is separate and completely unique. He changes completely, with every character he takes. And I start to believe that he can act like anything. All. As Kristy Brown, it is amazing. He does not mock the character, and does not sympathize with the character. Hard to achieve. Cristi Brovn is reviving. A smart man. Unclean man. Man. This film, despite the minor flaws of the transition scene and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, this is predictable. But is it stupid sentimental? I laughed. I was crying. Not a moment of cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. My favorite scene is a scene in the restaurant, when Christie talks to painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. Here Daniel Dai-Levis reaches a peak. "I'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated." "Take out the rich!" And his performance never slows down, never stops, and is beautiful. Simply. There are plenty of screens here. I look at him again, and I never get tired of Kristi's perceptive eyes, jerks, and grunts. You must see. Fo sho, io!
