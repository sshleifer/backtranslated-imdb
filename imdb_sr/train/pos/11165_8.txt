Four words explain why this movie was shot - "She made it wrong". The enormous commercial success of this Mae Vest vehicle convinced the studio that the melodrames of the Gai '90. Here we are rewarded with fast movement, well-written disorder that clearly targets the personality of its stars. Vallace Beeri and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a little harder to accept, but Fai Vrai is the one who steals a movie with her girlfriend in the store. With a strong director - as Valsh proves - The return could have many hits, and she is utterly convincing as an object of love for Raft and Beera. Many atmospheres, nicely designed, this is a forgotten film worthy of reviving.
