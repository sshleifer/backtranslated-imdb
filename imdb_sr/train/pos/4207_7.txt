Skip McCoi (Richard Vidmark) a pocket wallet for Candi (Jean Peters) that contains an important microfiche dedicated to the communist goal. She is accompanied by two federal agents waiting to jump when she surrenders her microfilm. However, Skip steals the underpass bag underneath all nostrils and so begins to be arrested by the police and Richard Kilei and Kendi who want a microfilm back. Skip can be tracked only through Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information about criminals. It's clear that it's important that it's stolen and that both sides want a movie, but they plan to withstand a high price. This leads to Joey hunting for him and the conflict between Joe and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfilter to the boss. It is a movie that has been well-played and has a good start that instantly includes you. It's a little unreal how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Vidmark, but this is necessary because otherwise, why would he endure later with Joei. Good movie.
