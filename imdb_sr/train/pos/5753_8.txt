*** 1/2 Out of ***** Although I am not concerned about the fact that this version is in English, as some critics mentioned, it should be noted because it appears to be in many of the original hearts of Kuebeco. However, this was a movie as a child I fervently worshiped; Bearing in mind that it was made for children, I evaluate it on a relative basis. The story is that children on a winter break build an incredible snow fortress and push back to control weapons such as snowballs and other fabrications, such as idle hands and free time that are equal to winter breaks. If I had kids, this is definitely a movie that I would try to interest them, because the snow fortress was watching me while I was young, and I think the children today would agree, although with Picard and all of the computer animations, maybe I'm out of date and I just do not understand. In addition, the message of the film is beautifully allegorical and positive in that, for children (and adults).
