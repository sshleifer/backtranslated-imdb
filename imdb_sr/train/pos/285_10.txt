I just want to say, no matter how small the movie is, it needs to be shown in this world. We no longer read so much, but people want to watch movies. After this series came out on DVD, I wanted to read the entire series and I wanted more. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. Please do not change any of the characters, it destroys the effect. Because I loved actors who acted. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. I want to see a message and watch the message that these books and movies are now displayed. We do not get enough of it anymore. SUPER POSAO !!!
