This is what I call a great movie. lives through fantastic acting skills and a simple but human story. There are real characters that can be fun and dramatic. but the main topic is very cruel, as it is alive. The bus driver and his son are collecting people through the country (Yugoslavia) on the way to the capital of Belgrade. funny and cruel situations that happen on the road, connecting people and pigs traveling together. Watch it and remember it for life ... filled with celebrity humor and lifestyle. And another reason for his magic: it's hard to get !!
