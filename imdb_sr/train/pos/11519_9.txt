The only reason I did not give the 10 stars was DVD format - without menus, accessories, etc. However, if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dreams, do not let anyone stop or stop you. This is one of the most lifelike movies I've ever seen. And magically. The acting is great, the action serves purpose, and the introductory sequence is fantastic. This is one of those movies that once was a "cult" status. I recommend this film to all friends. Some people like it, some can not finish it. Whenever I think or feel that something is impossible, I mean the role of Alan Arkin in this film. I'd like to make more movies.
