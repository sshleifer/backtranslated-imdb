Rosenstrasse is a more intimate film than one of the epic proportions, which could have deterred a number of filmmakers looking for a similar complication of pianists. Fortunately, Von Trott, a good screenwriter, chooses a feminist view of an epoch that is too illustrated on his colorful exterior, but not sufficiently analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the standpoint of the ordinary Aryan, and not from the Jewish viewpoint. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these unnecessary burdens of people trapped in historical circumstances that appear as victims. The film's tempo is introspective, extremely slow, meditative. In addition, the characters are so vivid as the crosses between the generations and the passage of time are skillfully made. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative failures are well recognized. The second mistake lies in trivial cinema that is not able to capture the intensity of the inner drama lived by the characters. Still, this movie is worth a look. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German movies dealing with the ghosts of the nightmare, a trend that includes such great movies as Nowhere in Africa, and recently a controversial fall. I would recommend this film to those who know that they are reading from the pictures.
