10/10 for this movie. I am a British Indian doctor, currently in India. The word Beckham refused me, because I am Liverpool fan, and I personally think that Owen is really cool. Since Liverpool and Man Utd rivaled, I was DEAD sure that I would not watch the movie. But then I was in Delhi to meet some friends, and I had an early morning flight, so I thought, "What the hell is this movie", because it was a late night show . What I'm a jerk. I should have seen this movie the day it was published. I guess the use of Beckham was aimed at attracting the audience's attention (which was in my case fired !!!), but then I really can not think of a better title for the movie. And Nagra, Knightlei (beautiful), and Rhis-Miers did a great job. If you hate football, you do not like Manchester United (or England), then this is DEFINATELY movie for you. In fact, I am only 29 years old, a psychiatrist by occupation, but a kid in my heart. This film crashed Star Vars from my position No.1. Amazingly, there are not many comments about this film by Indians like me. I wonder why? 10/10 for this movie.
