I saw Insomniac nightmare not long ago, and I have to say, I really enjoyed it. If you are a fan of Dominica Monaghan, you will be pleased. A film in a hole takes place in his mind - or does it work? The acting of all the others is a little aroused and trembling, and some of the scenes could be shrunk, but it eventually works. DVD accessories are as big as a movie, if not bigger for those fans of the Home. There are tones of sincere moments from the set, outtakes and a big interview with the director. Anyone who has gone through the recording of an independent movie likes to watch Tess (the director), the House and everyone else in a very close personal suite trying to extract this little trippy creepy movie. It was pretty pleasant and I'm glad to have it in my collection.
