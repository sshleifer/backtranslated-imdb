Lapiuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any movie from the movie Haiao Miiazaki, brings the joy of storytelling to the audience. It's a movie that makes you feel like a child again; It's just magical. It's a crime that it took so much time to be published in the states, but now that you check it here! And stick to the original language; Dub has somewhat changed my impressions of the characters, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in the translation of a movie (or a book, anyway.) I give it ten / ten.
