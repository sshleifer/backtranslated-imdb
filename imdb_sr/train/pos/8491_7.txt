I saw this movie when it was new. Later I rented it to Japan after I was here for three years, fearing that I will refrain from looking at it in the sharp light of my expanded international experience. The film was pleasantly surprised by the exact representation of the cultural conflict between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I am from). It's not about all things, but the tone is perfect. I am still in Japan many years later, and I continue to enjoy this film for the impartial treatment of the two sides in the story. Interestingly, although Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original, the dialogue was reduced in the Japanese version to cover obvious problems with the delivery of another language. I noticed that one reviewer uses this in the Japanese class. . I think you can find out more about what you can expect from meeting with Japan watching this movie than reading any "serious" book on the issue (most of it was written in the 80s and funded by propagandizing Japanese companies). Br /> Do not be fooled by the drag by the average rating caused by one-star reviewers, who, among other things, considered it incredible that the Japanese would like to build cars in the United States. (Of course, the Japanese run many factories in order to be close to customers and to avoid commercial disagreements.) This is a very warm and fun movie that I would rate more that it is not for some cliches from the 80's, such as dancing around electronic disco music. Michael Keaton was never more entertaining.
