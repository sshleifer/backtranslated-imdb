I loved this show from her first broadcast, and I always looked forward to watching each episode every week. The action, the characters, the writing, the special effects were extraordinary! Then the science-fantastic channel screwed up again and canceled a very entertaining, well-written show. I say to return it, I know that all the actors will return. I suggest that I buy a DVD, I am. I hope that the leaders of science-fiction channels will hear these comments and realize that they must be more involved with their viewers. I watch only one show on that channel, (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure it will soon be canceled.
