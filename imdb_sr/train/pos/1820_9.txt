I remember this film since I was a little kid, then I loved him and I still do it. I managed to get it on a DVD for my 18th birthday and I was delighted because I thought it so hard to find it earlier and it was just leased when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The film is filled with fun songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the voices of character are perfect. This film has always been for me, but I do think that if I did not see a movie when I was a kid, I would not consider it as brilliant and fascinating as I do, although I still believe that I would still like it because I'm really in animated films.
