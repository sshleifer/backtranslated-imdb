This video is so funny, everything else makes Eddie Murphy quite disappointing (even police officer Beverly Hills and Professor The Nutti, who just shows how this is really good). To be honest, I do not think I've ever laughed at anything that is this, including Naked Gun and the seldom seen Bargearse. This show is incredible, although it must be said that it is certainly filled with words starting with F, which are four letters long (plus an extended version that begins with M), but we did not mind that. You see, the funniest thing I've ever seen and probably the funniest you've ever had.
