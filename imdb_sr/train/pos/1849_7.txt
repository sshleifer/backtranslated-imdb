"Antwone Fisher" talks about the young Black American Navy who cited a man and a product of child abuse and neglect (Luke), whose hostility towards others leads him to a relationship with a primary psychiatrist (Washington) that leads to introspection, self-evaluation and the return of roots. Pat, disinfected and sentimental, "Antwone Fisher" is a solid freak that talks about reconciliation of past regrets and closings. A good old Hollywood entertainment party is worth the fun with just a hint of corn. (B)
