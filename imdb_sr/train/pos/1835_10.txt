What's extraordinary is that I have no words to describe. I do not know how to get a rating of the movie is 7.3 should be 9.3 but no one else can make this film and acting Akshai is just remarkable in the second half of the movie makes the posters and the movie has a really good unexpected ending that makes the film perfect. You should watch this movie once, I think twice well it's up to. In any case, I love this film and it's not only sad and funny, but it also gives you a really good sense and what you should be doing so that I think this is one of the best movies in the history of bollivood. but I know that people have the right to choose that way. the only thing I do not like in this movie is music and music is good, but the songs are not good enough I think music would be better if AR Rahman is a music director, but we can not do anything about it.
