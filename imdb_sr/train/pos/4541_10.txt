I saw this movie on the cable, it was really funny, from the head of the police police to the stereotypes of the big bad guys, ja and leno and mr maiagi from the karate kid of the star in this good comedy about the prototype of the automobile. I am comparing this film with "RUSH HOUR" in which a local policeman has to team up with one police officer from Asia to solve the case. Chasing through the farmers' market in Detroit in the city center brings memories. Pleasant soundtrack, good script, I give it 10/10.
