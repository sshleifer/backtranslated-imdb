I saw two films during the weekend, One was "kaal" and another "Vakt". Both films are made in "Bollivood", but they are separated from one another. The main difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shav made his indelible track "Ankhenom", one of the best comedic comedic hindies. His performance of Charecteres is perfect. The story apparently taken from Guerrero Plaia is terrible, the treatment is excellent with some exceptions. In Bollivood, when the film is being compiled, the first thing Bollywood director decides to register as a music director, and this guy (Central Malik in this case) is obliged to purchase six songs to fulfill his contract. Even a good director like Vipul Shah needs to use them to calm down the Finisher, and the grandmothers who just can not get enough of those numbers. No music director can continually cast good songs as it is clearly seen in this movie. None of the songs has a melody and is clearly an intrusive narrative of the story except the background music and the western version of Bharat-Natiam. Dueling and playing the role of Father and Son are good in the performance of Bachachan and Akshai Kumar. His stunt scene is obvious. A good actor is surrounded by good actors and is ready to wait for a good story like this super movie to come. Then we have a cheap, classless, inexperienced Producer such as Sharukh Khan, who will descend as if he shamelessly enters and promotes rubbish like Kaal to enrich himself at the cost of improving art, and they surround themselves with marginal talent, and they are compensated by the marginal talent, and they are compensated for by talents, an investment before it comes to appear. These are Bollywood jumps that lurk on an unexpected audience to win the Bollywood Film Award, awarded by Bollivood Chamcha, and most of them are in the media.
