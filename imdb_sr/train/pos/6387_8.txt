I thought this film was very well made up. And the voices were big. I liked how they all overcame their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this film to everyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. The other scenes made me sad. And others cheered me. It's a movie that can be enjoyed at any time. From the moment Milo is a crazy "professor" or until he brings together a team for a fantastic voyage under the sea. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was good, but the film puts better pictures in your mind. It's like a book. But watch this movie!
