For those who are not familiar with Jimmy Stevart, this is one of his "smaller" films from later career. And, although this is not a great movie compared to many of his other paintings, it's not a bad thing and a passerby of time is decent - but not much more. Kim Novak is a witch in New York and for some inexplicable reason, she decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy to make him fall in love with her. Over time, Cold and Separated Mrs. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stevart - and apparently in the witch policy, this is definitely NO, NO! The film is weird in its witch sensibilities. They are neither sacrificing a baby nor an all-encompassing diversity. Most of their magic is pretty limited and meaningless (like Jack Lemmon using his power to turn off street lamps). And, very strange, all witches seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you can find people wearing berets and listening to fucking jazz. Taking into account what I think about jazz, it really must stink to be a witch in the world of this film! In any case, the film is pretty romantic and mildly comical, but not something I would hasten to watch. The acting is pretty good, but the script does not offer enough profitability to make this movie remarkable - in fact, I almost made a movie 6 - it was really close.
