I found this show really late at night and tried. It is a refreshing change from other types of things that appear late at night if you catch my enthusiasm. Its simplicity of value and sweetness of the heart helps me to remind me of the way friendships were. It's something I enjoy whenever I find it (which is rare, maybe I should check the list! Haha) ..... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so cute. Like every good jerk, you really get emotionally involved in the characters. Good old Louisa Mai Alcott continues to inspire good stories :) So obviously I have to fill in 10 lines of text to make my opinion valid, so I will tell you something more. Children play talented actors and actresses, and the settings are beautiful and filled with nature - another thing you do not see much on TV. I hope everyone will try. I recognize and I am fully aware that it is scapegoat, but it is a good heart. As I said earlier, it is refreshing.
