This is a pretty boring movie. Filmed with realistic performances, especially very good from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations and connotations in art houses, it fails because the director does not take a position, attitude or a critical commentary on a topic he prescribes. One of France's respected and regular working partners on Depardie movies - I believe they made 7 together - Pialat does not engage. It seems to be a debate about why women fall to a bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boy and a good husband around him. Isabelle Hupert, who plays the winner with a nonchalant difference, offers tangible answers like: "I do not know"; "I love his hands"; "I like the way love is done" with my husband who is trying to get her out of the house, but it softens and reassesses because ... I suppose she loves her. So, he accepts and hopes for what? One day he will wake up and feel. Such things do not respond to Pialat's resourceful docu-drama style with long speeches and even long scenes that do not add up. I know that the answers are not summed up, but please take it. Jules et Jim, this is not. The last hit, like the movie we just watched, is the heartache and headache just to the simplest.
