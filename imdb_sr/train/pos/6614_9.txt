I read that this is not good, that the story is not solid, that Volckman feels that he has failed in some way. I disagree. First, it's done well. Volckman works well not only to try out a new technique, but also to have a focus that is worth thinking: does immortality reduce the value of life? The big question ... I see that he is trying to build a feeling, and he does not compromise. This should be welcomed. I'm sure it was an interesting exercise to make the characters in such a form. I saw how artists reduced the form to a minimum in order to build the intensity of the moment. I identify this film with this. Further, it's much more interesting than Richard Linklater's roto-scoping, and Volckman's story has more meanings than later stories about Linklater about a lost life on drugs. Old news. Everyone knows it, but nobody does anything. The Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think. And there are many more stories with many holes in them that work much better. Very Good, Volckman. It's a really good job.
