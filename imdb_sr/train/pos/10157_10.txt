This is a funny look at the Gospel presented by Johnny Cash (who is, of course, decorated in black) that sings much and tells little story. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is pretty cozy. Also, keep in mind the blue picture of Jesus in this business ... just from fun, try to think of the five Jews who have blue hair ...? In any case, his funny presentation is the biggest and most important story of all.
