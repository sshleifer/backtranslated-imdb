"Now in the Indian sunny climate, where I spend my time as a soldier in the service of her Majesty Queen ..." so does the famous song written by Rudard Kipling. This is the literal basis on which the film "Gunga Din" is based. If you are lucky enough to watch this legendary Classic, you will enjoy movies as they use them to make them; for pure pleasure. Taken from the scenario of a well-established novelist and poet, this is a story of a modest Indian born. His greatest wish is to become a soldier. The boy with water is part of the contingent of the British Calvary, which is threatened by death by the infamous Kali blood cult, called "Tuggee". Three special soldiers stand out in this company that are known for their courage and companionship. First, handsome and impeccable, Cari Grant plays Sgt. Archibald Cutter. Next is Victor McLaglen as a brave Sgt. MacChesnei and finally Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Thomas Ballantine. All three and their companions are surrounded by the food of mountain lovers, led by their fanatic leader called "Guru" (Eduardo Ciannelli). In the middle of a war chaos, a brave boy who hopes to earn a place in the army by playing a stick he found. A solid story for an old black and white movie that needs a little fanfare for anyone who wants to enjoy the classics. ****
