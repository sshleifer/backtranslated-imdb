Fei is talking about Mars's attempt to colonize the Earth. (Things must be pretty bad back to Mars). Whatever it's landing, it is buried under the ice in Tracy Lake, but on the snow there are steps towards a nearby dinner. Dinner did not have customers from eleven o'clock that morning. Now there are several passengers on the bus that are sitting and waiting for permission to cross over a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were on the bus, although he did not notice who they were. The problem is that now there are SEVEN people waiting to continue the journey. One of them is an alien, but who? They are all suspects. There's a crazy old man (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to be using sub-roses. There is a bizarre businessman who must arrive in Boston (John Hoit). Young couple on a honeymoon. (Executive husband, Ron Kipling.) Except for couples, nobody noticed anyone else. Even the couples are suspicious of each other. Bride for the newly-married husband: "I could swear you had a mole on the chin." The story continues in a lively but somewhat sordid way - the phone rings for no reason, the lights come on and off, the jukebox turns on - and none of it is taken seriously. It is a fundamentally fun game and the highlight of revelation is worth the laugh. There is no noticeable "depth" for her. This is not a moral message about people who are turning to normal citizens. It's not a warning, just a fairy tale that redirects and entertains. Always enjoy when it is turned on. It is especially interesting to see John Hoit as a nervous and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was a Roman senator who led the murder of Julius Caesar in the Shakespeare version of MGM. And here it is - with three hands. Oops.
