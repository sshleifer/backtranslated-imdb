Many of the reviewers pointed out that Pinyar, in contrast to the running of mill films produced in Bollivood. While this is true, Bollywood films are generally targeted at a particular audience and should be appreciated for achieving their goals in this respect. However, Pinjar is a great movie for those who seek a change from a normal Equation based on the Bollivood movie. Set up during a split between India and Pakistan, Pinjar focuses on punishment that becomes a victim of social and cultural attitudes towards the treatment of women in their time. Paro, the protagonist, is forced to choose between life with a man who was kidnapped and a passing hope of life with his family in India governed by Punjab. More than Hindu and Muslim questions, Pinjar addresses and defines the role of a woman as a daughter, as a wife, and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike typical Bollywood films that are escapist in nature, Pinjar is a movie that makes the audience look at these issues during and after the movie.
