This was my first introduction to the Bollivood world and now I'm hooked! All right, this requires the adoption of a different way of thinking for watching American films, but when you allow yourself to enjoy the enjoyment of what it is, you will not be disappointed. The songs are great, melodic and very attractive. Actors are visually appealing, especially Karisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actors in the world of film. Locations, colors are enchanting. If you want something different and want to rise, cheer and stimulate, I recommend that you capture this movie.
