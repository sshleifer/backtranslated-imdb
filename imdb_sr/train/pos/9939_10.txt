This is a series of cartoons where the majority of actions take place in the human body where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not try to explain it in greater detail, you'll just have to see it yourself: I will not be disappointed. I remember seeing this as a child of the 80's (with Swedish voices). I talked to several people who were also children of the 80s and they also loved! I have to admit that part of education in episodes has not come to me on a conscious level, but the whole idea of ​​educating children while having fun is wonderful. I recently saw several episodes; there is humor and heart that is difficult to find in other children's programs today. 5/5
