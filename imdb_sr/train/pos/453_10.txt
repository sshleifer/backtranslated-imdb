I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult movie without hacking, sex and violence. You might think it's "the ultimate chick," but I bet there's one or two enlightened people who love it. Do not call your children. This film is very quiet. Seeing "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. The sound track and the beautiful landscape, together with the female gentle manners, remind us of the peace and beauty of the pre-Alpha image. I will paraphrase the line I heard on "Saturdai Night Live" and say that my two favorite films are "Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April".
