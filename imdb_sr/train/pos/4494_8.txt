As a Bolton-born, this film has an obvious appeal to me. The location of the image is fascinating and shows Bolton in transition - there is a series of scenes of obvious neglect, but this serves to show that the city has been restored - and the idea that the old must make the way for a new right is in the heart of this film. A little miscellaneous James Mason is enjoying the story of a great crowd about herring that gets into a full-fledged conflict, and then a pleasant solution. Although I am too young to remember him completely, all the details of Lancashire's life in the 1960s are here: redeeming on Friday, piano songs, Sunday constitutional, good-neighborly, awe-inspiring, massive Importance of self-esteem, and I was glad to see Naughton's funniest lines from the play that remained intact. There is no doubt that this movie should be available on DVD - it's well-created and most shows are well realized.
