This film was last week and although at that time of the day (at around 6 pm) the quality of the films was almost never good (at least here on Mexican TV), I could not turn off the TV. The story of Madeleine Moore really touches you. At first she does not appear as a very nice character, but watching the whole movie, you just want her to succeed. This film really leaves you in mind. And I think that's basically because of the big acting Brooke Johnson. I've never heard of her before, nor did I see her in a second film, but this was a great acting. Praise Brooke. I hope to see her soon in another movie.
