This is undoubtedly the most terrible game I've ever played. It's not about the average frame (everything that moves), which is usually not interested in much, but acceptable gfk, interesting weapons and magic, great surround sound effects ("Scrieeee, scrieeee ..") and above all incredible atmospheres. I love Scrie, which allows you, at certain places in the games, to see or hear the events that happened there in the past. The only game I had to make a break after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I am a big fan of horror, especially the stories of Clive Barker's films, and participating in such a horror story makes me crave for more games that accentuate the atmosphere and the story that involves more. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fps fan, and maybe the game was a bit short?)
