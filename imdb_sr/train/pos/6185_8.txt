I just watched the MUSIC ON THE VANITY in the recently announced Universal Pre-Code set, and I was wondering how much I enjoyed the car to the end. Most other commentators have covered the story, the mystery of murder in a musical, but I wanted to add some extra notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively mild, compared to even the majority of smaller players, and none of them seem to have the right voice for what they sing (Carlisle's dressed opera singer, Brisson is a little uncertain about some of his high notes and hunting notes). The great Victor McLagen and Jack Oakie play well together, with a great sense of timing that keeps the ball moving between music numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanity Girls, but we do not forget the wonderful jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the number "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick makes one of his early performances, sounding like Eve Arden; Patrick would continue to be the executive producer of the TV series Perry Mason. There is also Jessie Ralph as a lover in the wardrobe - you will also find her in David COPPERFIELD (like Aunt Peggoti) and BANK DIK. Music is very good - Brisson introduces standard "Cocktails for Two" in two different scenes; "Cute Marijuana" with barely dressed girls with peiote buttons in the background (the dripping blood on the white skin of a horina was beautifully cold); "Ebony Rhapsody", with Duke Ellington's Orchestra and ornaments of beautiful dancers, black and white, who mix it. And I believe this is one of the first musicals that have such a mic - and the costumes do not leave any imagination.
