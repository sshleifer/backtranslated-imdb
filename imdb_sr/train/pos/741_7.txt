I was a little young for this, but I had to see her. There is great music, which many people mentioned, but it seems that no one notices a very rare appearance of "Angela", now mostly ignored, but sometimes quite popular music equipment. Carrying their trademarks of white clothes, they melt through the 20th Centuri Fokes, and apparently everyone is trying to sink into the camera's field of view. The keyboardist Gregg Giuffria remains prominent bands, and apparently never got a lot of haircuts! Cherie Currie (former singer Runaways) starts a short, but noticeable, acting career here, and is quite remembered by Jodie Foster, and the rest. (Her toples of 3-D scenes in "Parasite", and her UFO sighting, in "Wavelength", kept us watching for some time). It is not a masterpiece, but keeps a piece of his period, that everyone is watching and wondering.
