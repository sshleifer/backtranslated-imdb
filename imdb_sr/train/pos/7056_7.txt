The continuation of the popular story of Cinderella reminded me somewhat of what they did with the movie Beauti & the Beast. These are essentially three short stories involved in 1. OK, the mice are wonderful (I love Gusa! I liked some newer characters, (Pom Pom was wonderful and I liked Prudence.) Still, the story was somewhat limited, but still very sweet. So I vote 7/10.
