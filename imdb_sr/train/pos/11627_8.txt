Lisa is the hotel manager or owner and she flies to Miami flight. She ends up sitting next to a killer named Jackson who tells her she needs to move the family room or her father dies. The reason he has to change the room is because Jackson wants to blow him up. It's a great film for uncertainty because Lisa is trying several ways to escape from these tricks that Jackson put up. The whole story is great and I thought they could spend more time on the plane. There could be more on the plane, but in addition, the whole movie was pretty good. Especially I liked the ending because it was a heart failure. I did not know what would happen and that surprised me. For me, this movie just flew.
