I think this is an excellent example of the difference between the two cultures. It would be a great movie that would appear in the lessons of sociology. I thought it was pretty funny and I have to say that I'm a gym for it "lets the band together and get the job done" land of the device. It seems that most people do not realize that this film is not just a comedy. It also has several dramatic elements and I think they fit nicely. All in all, I give him a solid 8.
