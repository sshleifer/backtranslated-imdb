Of course, 65 years have passed since Thalber's last production was filmed. But, members of the IMDB, this film is certainly one of the masterpieces of the thirties! It was the first film I saw at the New York Museum of Modern Art, around 1970 (I was a teenager). Together with such scenes of poverty, masterfully photographed, often exciting and always appealing, it was for me to record MGM film at its best. What the audience felt when they noticed the attack of locusts, the destruction of houses on the face, terrible poverty, and then the splendor of wealth. Last week, those who watched Academy awards had insights into the "Oscar winner", Luise Rainer. How wonderful to see an actress who undoubtedly delivered one of the brightest, most demanding performances in history by choosing to return to the celebration. Okay, therefore, she did not have to beat the year before (Great Ziegfeld), but she did not blame Luise. Talks were only ten years old when this was published and its dialogue was limited. But, like Olan, its use of visual and vocal record is unforgettable. Great scale and touch, what more can a movie lover love!
