What a wonderful romp? a highly competent film that has so much charm and a good factor that is missing from many romantic comedies. Einstein brilliantly played Valter Matthau, while Meg Ryan's Catherine is unforgettable ?? better than I saw it in those films opposite Tom Hanks? as a young mathematician struggling to be recognized. You do not have to be a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and to feel immediately sympathetic towards her, and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through Eddie (Tim Robbins) mind in realizing his true love. There is universal attraction in these emotions, even if I.K. Keeps everything light, fun and beautifully bound. It's certainly not difficult, but if you look at there are some sub-texts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, but he was a great spiritualist; His sayings like something like the following: "If that's not impossible, why then?" suggests that he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond his immediate comprehension. In this film, there are questions about what is actually a coincidence? such as whether Albert and his unbridled intervention at Catherine are far from a rigid upper lip, Jamess without love (Stephen Fri, who gives you a life in a carbonlike character, and you can not help feeling his lack of feeling). How many interventions do happen in our lives that we do not see and we encounter coincidence? And of course, we would like to think in real life, despite the fact that we often observe people we know, that Edwardi bring us Catherine and James have to learn how to defrost iced water in their veins. How nice to know that this could happen in an innocent (and disturbing, exclusively white) country of Eisenhower from the Eisenhower era.
