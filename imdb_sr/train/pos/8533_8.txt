This film is more than a Lupine, especially from Funimation. The other then bad, not bad. The first watch is very similar to a comic (on which the third Lupine is based). Lupine is trying to get a lot of treasure. Fujiko uses Lupine's weakness towards women to try to get something out of it. The last time he's not that bad, he's with other women, but of course Fujiko is still number one. Many other Lupine movies are more families with curses than Lupine. Every good fan of Lupine, I think it will be pleasantly surprised (I know I've heard so many bad things about this movie). Maybe it would be a little better without the small animations that move around during the loan (make it a bit snug), but generally, it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few who will again watch Lupine III movies.
