Although this movie has a list of the best actors, special effects that are great, and a story that is full of surprises, she did not pick up for the distribution of the studio and went directly to the DVD. Perhaps it contains too much information about "anti-police forces", or maybe it's too much of the action moves that were released during overcrowding, but regardless of the reason why the big screens missed the chance, fortunately, the new DVD playback concept allows us to enjoy it. The topic is old: a newcomer reveals an inner circle of corpses - in this case a FRAT (First Response Assault and Tactical) team, a group of well-trained police officers designed to clear the mythical city of Edison from its low crime point , drugs, prostitution, etc. Working under the secret temptation to seize confiscated goods and money shows too many opportunities, and now, 15 years after forming, FRAT is responsible for murders, drug trafficking, terrorizing innocent people, etc. The main dog is Lazer (Dilan McDermott, who makes a terrifying real gangster!) And his partner Rafe Deed (LL) Cool J, even more than usual, proving he can be a sensitive actor). Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) caught a "bad mistake" and reported on his theory of fraud and corruption to the head of his newspaper, Ashford (always trusted by fine Morgan Freeman). Polak gradually persuades Ashford, and then Vallace (Kevin Spacei, also a consistently good visual actor) and helps Pollack in this research report. The more Pollack is closer to the truth, more surprises and incidents occur, and the story takes place in a series of unexpected results. Timberlake has no charisma to play a major role, especially in the company of such experienced actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacei and McDermott maintain a well-oiled film machine to the very end. No, it's not a great movie, but it's the one that makes the edge of the seat run with the message. Builds Harp
