When I first watched a movie in the early 1970s, I was awe-inspiring to this film. It was visually stunning, and events in campuses in Europe and the United States prompted you to connect with what Antonioni was trying to visualize in the last 15 minutes of the film so visibly: you were thrilled in the head of the "tyranny" institution and great business interests. Continuous shooting of a beautiful house in the middle of a desert, a leading female figure enjoying the natural flow of cold water, painting aircraft in a psychedelic design (even the old British Airwaves did it a few years ago) are some of the images that have been promoted worldwide for decades by advertising staff. Even Pink Floid increased the number of fans after the film was released. You see this film 30 years later and it's starting to wonder why the same film lost its appeal. Today anti-establishment movies have more content - facts, documentation, fine performance and top-notch scenarios. Antonioni seems to be out of date; falsified genius. Even looking at Antonioni's "Blov Up" today gives you a similar feeling as if it was passing. It was a great movie that you saw on a wide Panavision screen as opposed to a dwarfed TV screen. Visual and Sound (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, etc.) The appeal of the film remains. The leading couple were not great actors, but they were sweet and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in a prison in the United States, extending the reality of non-conformist values ​​that he personified in the film. Today Antonioni seems to be "synchronized". But watch carefully and appreciate the muffled sounds of regular actors - Rod Tailor, G.D. Spradling, ladies at the pool, police officers on the airline. The real sounds are the opposite of the nonconformers. Antonioni was relevant 30 years ago, but his understanding of the media can not be questioned even today. He knew what he was doing.
