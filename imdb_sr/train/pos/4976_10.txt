Frank Capra A wonderful movie about life. Holding blood through our veins responsibility is valuable HEMO THE MAGICENTENT. In the mid-fifties, AT & T and Bell Science teamed up with the famous Hollywood director Frank Kapro to produce a series of CBS television science films to educate the public about the Universe around them. Far from gloomy black and white food, which is so often imposed on young scientists, Caprini's films would teach and entertain scenic scenes and appealing visions shown in Technicolor. Four films - OUR MR. SUN (1956), THE GREAT CASE OF COSMIC AIRS (1957), HEMO SIZE (1957), UNFURNISHED RIGHTS (1958) - soon became favorite in school, where they were endlessly displayed in 16mm format. The Star Series is Dr. Frank C. Bakter (1896-1982), a proficient English professor at the University of Southern California. This avancular pedagogue proved to be a perfect film instructor, who knowingly transmitted sometimes complex facts to his audience in a way that never made them boring or boring. Dr Bakter, who won the Peabody Prize for his achievements, continued to produce high-quality teaching films after the Capra Quartet was completed. HEMO The Magnificent, which was created, written and directed by Capra, refers to the story of the human heart and the blood circulation system, using animation and mild humor. Film star Richard Carleson appears as a fiction writer, who energetically helps Dr. Bacter to tell the story of Hemo. Film guests will recognize Sterling Holllowa as part of television production and the voices of Marvin Miller, Mel Blanc. , June Forai & Pinto Colvig as different cartoon characters, all are unpublished. The pious letter that begins the film is completely in line with the tenor and tone of production.
