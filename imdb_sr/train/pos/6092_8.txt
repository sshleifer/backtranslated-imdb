Cultural classics are almost impossible to predict. Who could have guessed that Vision Kuest, Fight Club and 2001: Space Oddisei, the films that critics and the audience attracted during their release, become extremely popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a film specialist. Unlike most of those who hated envy (Bad Score 4.4), I found Envi as one of the most entertaining films in the last decade. The dialogue is not smart, the scenes have little continuity, and the script seems to be written by a fourth grade. But for this reason, the film is so hilarious. You see, to appreciate the accidental genius of Envi, you must enjoy a movie from an ironic-separate point of view. Why I love Envi? Because the film is bad to the point of becoming good. This is a recipe for cult classic, and Envi definitely suits the law.
