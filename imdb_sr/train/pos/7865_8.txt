Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once during the film I found myself staring at the universe. Konana Sen has done a good job in the movie, although I think someone with more glamor or enthusiasm would be better, but she did a great job. All supporting actors were also very good and helped the film. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this STORY story which is brilliant and very realistic, does not strike the bush, but it is very clear in sending the message. I think that there should be more of this kind of film, it is painful for me to watch the same films with the end for sweets over and over, now it's hard to digest. Everyone should watch, it's a great movie. -Just my 2 cents :)
