Probably the best picture released by the Producer, this little horror piece draws attention from the first to the last. Director Frank Visbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one, and, more importantly, knows how to realize his full potential on the screen. Not only does the plot include characters that are fascinatingly drawn, but the setting is absolutely beyond this world! Almost all actions take place either at night or in the middle of a fitting, pervasive fog. This cold atmosphere was enhanced by the Visbar's inventive direction and the most convincing performances he had drawn from all his players. Beautiful Rosemary La Planche makes an ideal hero, beautiful, witty and vulnerable. Robert Barrat delivers his usual non-silly, portrait of a local giant, although it's hard to believe that he's a nice, handsome guy who plays his son no one else than later writer / director Blake Edwards.
