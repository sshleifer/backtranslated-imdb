ABC has done more for this show allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast of this show. Initially, the show was visible and even predictable with John Ritter and Katei Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Kate and three kids are a really solid professional actor. The hourly lesson after John's death in real life hit me. I lost my father at the age of 17 and I could sympathize with them and understand their pain and agony. ABC should be proud to maintain this play and even preserve it as John's final wish. This performance has matured and developed due to such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emmi.
