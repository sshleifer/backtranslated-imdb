This is a very dramatic and tense movie. There are many plots and turns. A story or director opens questions about the death penalty or the alleged crimes committed by black people. This film was very well directed by Arne Glimcher and the excellent sound of James Nevpton Hovard is excellent. Powerful performance by Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this, do not miss the "RIGHT CRIMES" or "HURRICANE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
