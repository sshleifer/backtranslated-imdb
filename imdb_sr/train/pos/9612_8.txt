Good thing about this movie: The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also teases you to think about those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without any knowledge. His little world and this little movie shows us. Bad thing: there are too many characters and it's hard to tell who the main character is, but still an excellent movie. This is a great movie and many compare it with Magnolia I did not see. -13 for short violence, some language and sexual situations.
