We Tutor Friend is a romantic comedy that has something similar to Mi Sassi Girl .. there are no kisses / sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more about Korean productions. Sex is not always needed in a good romantic movie. The film is from a luminous heart, with occasional cartoon CG scenes embedded in the movie. I like the part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Van. The most exciting moment is when Ji-Hoon hit Su-Van's first love because he left Su-Van for another girl and soon he will be a father. How he became a father was discovered in the next scene, which gives the audience a smile. Mao points: 8/10
