Perhaps not the best movie in 2006, but it was just a movie for excitement and reflection. Sentinel is a good movie about a political thriller that looks similar or even lends some elements from other political films such as In The Line movies. of Fire and Manchurian Candidate. The basic plot of this film is similar to other films like this: a plot to kill the president of the United States. Michael Douglas plays the secret agent Pete Garrison, who runs the operation only to find out later that he is framed. Kiefer Sutherland plays as a kind of rival called David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin who is a beginner agent headed by agent Breckinridge and Oscar winner Kim Basinger as the first lady Sarah Ballentine. One improvement for this film could be more action, as some sources considered as equally actionable a film such as a film about thrillers, but the good thing about this movie is instead of plotting to kill the US president, also concerned with mugs in traitors. secret service leading the president in the wrong direction.
