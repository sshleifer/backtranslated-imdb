It's "time-outs" through computer animation, allegedly working more than 300 artists. Made at the end of the 80's and published in 1990, this was the most up-to-date business for that day. I thought it was good and interesting in places. Most of the short scenes did not make sense, only the shapes developed into other shapes, but it was fun to watch. This is all about visual impressions, not about any kind of story. There were some weird sequences in which unusual men-men would dance around with birds. It's all a computer animation that was new then. Even the term "computer animation" was not well known. It is simply an opportunity to show this new technology in short-lived similar cartoons with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. There is no word, only images with electronic music. Stoners really liked it. Beautiful, intriguing 40 minutes "Sweets" and "Headache". According to today's effects of the CG, it may have lost influence, but I think that you would still be entertained by this.
