It is significant for its notoriously explicit scene when the magnificent Maruschka Detmers takes the penis of her young lover from her pants and into her mouth. Even without this moment, the film is brilliant, if a little disturbing, passionate and brilliantly sexy ride. Detmers puts in a great performance as a partly disturbed, insatiable pleasure, wandering about his blue goal. Dressed, partially dressed and naked steals most of the movie about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me, the last two have lost a bit, and the end is extremely confusing when her fianc√©e is released while fellow terrorists are released, it seems uncertain who wants a young lover more interested in his exams than anything else while crying, beautifully natural!
