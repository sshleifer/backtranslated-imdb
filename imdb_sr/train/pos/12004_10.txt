This film is a true and historical film. This is very useful for those who are exploring the LDS church, because it is 100% true. It's a great movie and I recommend it. It is very fact, exciting and motivating. Some people think it's not a fact, but it is. It is about the renewal of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and of the Prophet, Joseph Smith, who restored it. There are such events in his life as the illness he had when he was a little boy, having succumbed to Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, giving birth, and so on. But most importantly, it reveals the restoration of the church.
