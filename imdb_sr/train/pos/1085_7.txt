This film was a pretty fun comedy about Murphy's law that applies to the ownership and construction of a house. If such a film is made today without a doubt, the family would be dysfunctional. Having been set up in 'simpler' forties, we get what should be a typical family of that time. Grant, of course, perfectly combines comic and drama elements and works with more than the competent support that Loi and Douglas have put forward. Their manners make a good ninety minutes of fun, 7/10.
