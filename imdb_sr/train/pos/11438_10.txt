Ralph and Mumford, unsuitable in their own country, are misled into unconscious drunken Sinanomess Botchs. Twice on time is a story about them, the characters they meet and their struggle to correct things. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and a wonderful voice that plays some of the best in this business, this unusual movie hits a sign. The animation process, while similar to the cut style "South Park", is much smooth and far more three-dimensional. If I did not know that animation was such a style, I swear it was a traditional pencil and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THKS, please! You will not miss anything if you do not, but if you do, you will get a lot more than experience!
