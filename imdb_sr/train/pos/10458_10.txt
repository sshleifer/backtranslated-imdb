This film deals with one of the most horrible geriatric diseases today. Like the one that came across numerous families who are facing the potential of Alzheimer's disease or are in the process of being formed, I suggest that every health worker recommends this film to every family that is confronted with the trauma of this disease. The film is designed primarily to talk with the patient's family and reach the very heart of the fight. Casting is an excellent and dramatic portrait is remarkable with a very command line.
