When Philo Vance (Edmund Love) stands uncertainly at the edge of the balcony high above the city, apparently hypnotized and is just approaching his death, he immediately reminded me of an almost identical scene in another film made nine years later. A woman in the field of greenery, in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is struggling to get into space while hypnotized. Fortunately, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes survive these killings by unscrupulous criminals. Exciting cinematic uncertainty in both scenes. When will you learn that you can not blur the minds of the great imaginary detectives?
