I am a big fan of most films based on Stephen King's books - this is one of the most horrifying and most memorable. I just finished revatching for a tenth time and still it seems to be heartbreaking and scary. The scene in which Gage is located on a safe collision course with a monster truck is the one that stands out. And "No Fair" spoken by little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance. <br /> <br />
