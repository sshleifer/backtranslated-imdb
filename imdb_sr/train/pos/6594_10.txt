Professors-types from Tveed thought they understood it all. Today's peoples inhabiting Polynesia come from migrant Asian, fearlessly moving from the Far East, the islands to the island, to the east of Tahiti, and all the other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific for thousands of years. But the established thinking was simply not good with the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heierdahl. If this explanation is true, how do some people born and raised on these islands have traditions, works of art and physical characteristics that do not resemble those from Asia, but to South America? How can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look like what could be found on the island a few thousand miles away? Is it just a coincidence that the islanders point to the sea in the direction of South America and say that their ancestor, led by Tiki, their equivalent Adam? In the meantime, how does the Norwegians speak of the Scandinavian leaders who were persecuted from the colonized South American continent, and, along with some of the native peoples with whom they made friends, they went over the sea - VEST? Too much is Heierdahl's a coincidence. With an incredible amount of wet, crewed crew and local knowledge for the construction of traditional rafts, an expedition begins. It's as much a journey into human imagination as a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a trip is possible only with the basics of tools and maritime. An Oscar documentary can be dated in its tone and an anglo-ethnocentric approach, but it grows in the spirit of adventure that surpasses even the space program that was launched ten years later because people are ready to risk everyone to test the theory they think is right. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It's an incredible page turner and a perfect setting for a film-style movie.
