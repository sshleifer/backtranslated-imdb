The strange but emotionally disturbing cold that a middle-aged man (Villiam H. Macie) had finally decided to leave for a family business (rent murder) run by his silently exaggerated father (Donald Sutherland) while seeing a psychiatrist and flirting with another patients (Neve Campbell). Talk about great dilemma, but "Panic" is a top thriller that looks like "American Beauti" to meet "Professional". Macy and Sutherland are here. An outstanding debut for the first time writer / director Henri Bromell. I'm surprised that this film did not get the chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks.
