I watched this movie several times, and I found it very good. This film is also known as "Castle Of Terror", "Coffin of Terror" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele is her usual pretty / creep person. George Riviere, a man, is doing his job well. The whole film is dripping with the atmosphere, and there is a lot of tension. The camera angles are good and the performance, mostly, is not bad. This movie is suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have a DVD version that is far superior to the edited TV version. Get some popcorn, turn off the lights, calm down and enjoy. John R. Traci
