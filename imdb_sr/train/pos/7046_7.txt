At War, Inc., we find a logical continuation of the current outsourcing of all the war activities we are currently working in in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are familiar with the antiques of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brovn & Root and Blackvater abroad, you are halfway through to fully grasp the satire of Cusack's latest piece. Cusack plays a corporate hit man named Brand Hauser in Turkuistan and organizes a fair in the newly-established country as a blanket while waiting to gain access to his last target. While there, she was intrigued by a reporter against the uprising played by Marisa Tomei and persecuted by the super-pop star starred by Hilary Duff. We met the Hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has persecuted him since then and a corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon who actually runs the entire operation for him (and plays hilariously by Joan Cusack). While some moments play appropriately across the top, they are not always the moments you expect, and the little touch you often surprise. All directors turn into solid performance. Duff's accent is coming and going, but otherwise she does a very good job and goes a long way to disperse her Disney picture. Thomas is ridiculous, but underestimated, while Cusack has almost every scene they are in. To be honest, they get good material. The writers turn to a good script with enough turn and rotation and visual edges to shake you through to the foreseeable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that prevents me from judging the higher the story turns and turns the way to the expected conclusion. If you like your comedy broad and physical, there probably is not enough here to be interested in the whole movie. On the other hand, if you love a crafty comedy and a wide satire, this is for you.
