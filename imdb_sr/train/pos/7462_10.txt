Note: These comments are for people who watched the movie. Vanilla Ski is a brilliant, complex and exciting movie that is truly exploring exactly what tag-line says: LoveHateDreamsLifeVorkPlaiFriends. Perhaps a movie shop can come into focus for confused movie viewers if viewed from a different angle. Considering the following: Now, I have not painfully gone through the movie scene around the scene, so I will have to continue to examine my claims, (and I welcome your thoughts), but Try and check if the film falls into place: where exactly is the controversial 'coupling'? Now, I am not talking about a connection as explained in the LE "Technician", since this sequence can in fact be interpreted as a rationalization within the mind / dream / coma of David Aames, but the genuine connection between reality and sleep. It seems to me that the reality of a car accident, the way it is being recorded (without explosion, for example) is probably a "connecting point", and that each particular sequence containing existential / dream / coma / the non-reality feels - whether it is displayed on the screen before or after a collision - is actually part of Aames's personal path to self-awareness within one's own mind. In that sense, we remain two questions at the very outset. end (if you know more, let me know): is Aames really disfigured, and where did he wake up? If you do not come closer in the exact order of detail to the plot, or in which point his dreams are scattered, this film becomes a fascinating exploration of a man on his way to find himself, and that means in today's society of pop culture. <br /> <br />
