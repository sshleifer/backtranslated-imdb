This film, however small it may be, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that the budget is weak from the beginning, you can appreciate how good a story is, how well a script is written, and how a great film maker produced something so wonderful with so little money. > <br /> All the elements of the big movie are here. Graphic displays, although recorded digitally, were beautiful at places. The bizarre, dreamlike feeling of the film was particularly well caught on the scene with the dog that witnessed, this scene was incredible. It's a trippy work, but it's not done in a pretentious way, and for that reason I have a lot of respect for this movie. It is recommended for everyone looking for something unique and amazing, and they are different from many repetitive movies that are there.
