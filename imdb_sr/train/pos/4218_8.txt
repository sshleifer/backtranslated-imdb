I did not really see too many Columbo movies ... actually, I think I was only looking at one or two, except this one. I always loved Columbo, though, somehow, and I did not even see it. Peter Falk was and was always the perfect choice for the character, because of his looks, voice and charm. The perfect evidence for this is that even though the series began back in 1968, the latest (and probably not the last) movie was shot in 2003. That's 35 years. And Falk was 40 when he made the first one. The series consists of 68 films (unless my number is off) and all are made for TV. Everyone knows the character, although no one has ever seen a movie in the movie. That's a pretty accomplishment, if you ask me. The action is pretty good. The only problem I have with this is that the killer and murder are being discovered at the very beginning (although that may be the same for all Columbo movies), leaving no mystery, but how Columbo solves it, making it a bit boring (because it's at the end of the movie It's not a good thing to watch Pacing is good, there's hardly a scene where you're bored, the acting is very good, especially Falkova and Ruth Gordon, and they have a great deal of dialogue in the film, and the characters are well written and credible. All in all, the film is, yes, surprising obar for TV movie, and definitely worth a look for every lover of Columba and / or crime / mystery. 8/10
