The first time I saw the first feature film by Buster Keaton and I have to admit that I liked it a lot and that I only wanted that I met him a few years ago. Rohauer blurb initially warns that the three-day printing of one-time nitrate was rediscovered and saved in 1954 only in time before the combustion, and many frames that seemed hopelessly connected were separated. It's a stone looking place, but I've seen and survived much worse. It would be ok as a 3 short film, but as a non-tolerance of intolerance is inventive and funny from start to finish: In the Stone Age with Baddie Vallace Beeri riding an elephant and a goodie Buster riding a brontosaur pet; In Roman times, Buster rides a wheel with locks on wheels and is adapted for slewing, there are no signs for parking in Latin; In this technological era of speed and need of greed, his car is beautifully crashing into pieces on the first coat of arms. Both he and Beers are searching for a girl through centuries, an endless fight. The favorite piece: As a cave man, he crashes back over the edge of the cliff, but still smokes a kiss of the camera - an incredible second or two! Great things, affirming my love for non comedy film.
