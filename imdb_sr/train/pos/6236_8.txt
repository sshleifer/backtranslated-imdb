The trick of intellect is as easy as pen. But the advantage here is the classic rejection of boys and girls we are used to in "The Gai Divorcee" and "Top Hat" is now absent. Instead of the usual casual acquaintance, the dance duo are former lovers Bake Baker and Sherri Martin, who are still in love since their dance days. Of course, since the music of the 30s, there are problems misunderstood romance, stunning courting and light irritation sabotated audition with bicarbonate barrel costs Ginger something special. And then, in the great tradition of reducing finance, there is nothing better for Hollywood's best entertainers than for the show. The beautiful numbers from Irving Berlin were made during the whole show. Top hats and evening dresses are kept to the end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are out again to charm the world ... and charm the navy. Everybody and everyone is so pleasant again. Pure classic nonsense in its best edition. But with Astaire and Rogers, we know he has to work. Rating: 8.25 / 10
