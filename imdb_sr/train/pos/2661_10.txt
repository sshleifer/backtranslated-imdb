... This is not the first time that Stanley blurred the difference between genres to such a great effect. In Dr. Strangeloveu had a comedy about the terrible situation, and here is the basis for a terrifying scenario that actually brings some very funny moments. Slowly burning madness and trying to kill a family is of course not hilarious, but the dialogue is very well known ("five months of peace is exactly what I want ...") and there is a great drink that would be unbridled. if you have switched on only one type of ghost, but it's also cooling the spine when the factor is in the other. I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the recorded version. Nicholson gives the audience as an actor only a hint of the potential for madness, which only increases when we learn that the family head is struggling with alcoholism and that he is emotionally distant from his wife and son. However, the environment in which he is located then absorbs those personalities and frees them to his consciousness. In the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to absorb events that are happening there, the hotel keeps the weaknesses of an upset but healthy man and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him out of the spot without return. He can have a sleep disorder in his personality before he arrives, but Overlook himself is the trigger that triggers them. Kubrick's cool and separate approach to directing works great for a chilly horror movie, and an unpredictable natural force, which Jack Nicholson is all the time punching from you as you giggle and frighten your mind. When it explodes, you will not be sure how far it can go. Together they made an excellent team and a combination of their talents gave us a classic. If you want a great viewing experience, then this is an example that really shines ...
