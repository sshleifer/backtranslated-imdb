Fasbinder's most sophisticated production sacrifices little of his talent to identify and deconstruct the locus of suffering in long, mobile movements that in some ways act as social encapsulation; It is much more obvious here, as the story unfolds in the war-torn Germany at the end of the Second World War, and the central figure is a woman (Hanna Schigulla as Maria) who capitalizes vulnerabilities (economic and gender) to catapulting on a prominent textile corpus. It makes prestigious goods such as ice cream available to poor workers (as it used to be). Maria and her new husband, Herrmann, married in Allied air strikes get a short honeymoon before sending him to the Russian front. In his absence, her despair is excellent: she spent most days at the train station, waiting to return. When reported dead, he suddenly stops grieving and takes a job as a waitress / prostitute in a brothel for US GI. When it comes back, things become messy, and the circumstances (and its meaning). noble self-sacrifice) have stormed to separate them. The message is Fasbinder M.O. A Letter Much: "Love Is Colder Than Death", but not only that Mary is confronted with her common sense, and that her husband is largely incapable of loving her, but the land in a deep flux without visible light at the end of the tunnel. Fasbinder makes some sort of statement about post-war Germany that is being sold to the best bidder, but like with all his films, I'm trying to block those elements and focus on the unbearable passion on the screen: Fasbinder's here is caused by his characters; his actors are filtered through their real links with Fasbinder. Together, his films can be intolerable or indescribably hypnotic, often simultaneously; This falls somewhere between, although definitely closer to the latter. Although I did not like as much as Bitter Tears Petra von Kant or Katzelmacher, Maria Braun certainly has a larger scope and more, I felt his passion and authentic details in human emotions.
