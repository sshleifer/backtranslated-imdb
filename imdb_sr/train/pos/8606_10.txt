Looks like there's no center on this movie! Most occur in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often stupid and illogical. It's also a wonderful production with great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel. Jeanette is flawless, insults that they do not know, and various other freak dogs on dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and enjoyment. At one point, she sings a piece of Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding the lapdog, for some strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! It is a surreal comedy - extremely fun if you can enter the groove.
