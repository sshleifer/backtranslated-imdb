If you are progressing rapidly through horrible singing, below you will find a classic fairy tale. Christopher Valken is very witty and surprisingly good in his role. His protective style of acting works well for a crafty cat in boots. Other actors are good for their parts. I did not find any acting glupo or weird. The king nevertheless appeared as a real stupid, and I wonder if he should be. I can not remember the original story. Special effects are typical for the 1980s, but at least they are not overly fake as some computer-generated timetables we see today. All in all, I recommend this film for children and adults who are a child in the heart.
