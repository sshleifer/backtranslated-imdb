I rented this film from Netflik for two reasons - I was moody for what I thought would be a stupid sci-fi-asco from the 50's and because it was the first feature-length Superman movie. Needless to say that after about 15 minutes I was fully engaged and very pleasantly surprised. Experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the ground and the sponsor has shut down. Lois and Clark appear to get a spoon, but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation. A day later, strange events on the well make the story more suitable for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that radioactive Dwarf people have attacked their six miles of a deep home near the Earth's core. Superman and Mole Men is a simplified but well made piece of social realism. Released in 1951, in which the actor has served in World War II, it seems that these stories must have been that Americans are equally capable of becoming fascists like everyone else. In order to bring this spot home in a typically direct Superman manner, Reeves even accuses the lynch mob of hunting moles that they are "nazi" at one point. nonexistent. Six miles of drilling through the continental crust would not even break through the upper cloak, let alone the "hollow center of the earth" - which in any case does not exist. Forgive - bear in mind that this film is based on a comic book of the Golden Age. The film is a bit uneven pace. Although Molemeni is interesting, somewhat creepy and beautifully shown, there are several Corman-esquire scenes that spend too much time superfluously showing us their strange behavior. The scenario is intelligent and economical. According to today's standards, costing is bad to fair, but for their time, the special effects and costuming of this movie were pretty good. Cinema is also very good and the performance is much better than it can be expected. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Valter Reed.
