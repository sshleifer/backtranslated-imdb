A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) moved to a small town and have to deal with the wicked teacher (Glenn Shadik), their incestuous relationship, the beautiful girl (Madchen Amick) and one hellish great secret. Okay, so technically, this is a "bad movie". But who cares? It's so fun! They create impossible things (including corn), people joke around cats, have bad liners, have too much cheese to handle! So, yes. You will enjoy this. Much. It will not move, touch, scare, or delight you in any way, but it will entertain you and laugh!
