It's quite typical Tom and Jerry short - the situation is designed, the conflict arises and there is a riot. The characters behave appropriately, natural tensions between different characters lead to a general chaos. The best (and the funniest) part is when the peace agreement is in force and respected - all kinds of strange miracles appear before you. Warning word - it's most wonderful to allow Tom to help you complete your morning cleaning routine! Recommended.
