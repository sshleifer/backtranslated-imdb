I read the previous comments that this film went straight to cable. Well, I paid to see him in the theater, and I'm glad to do it because it was a visual film. Most of the settings seem to have been made in the early 60s (apart from the psychiatrist's office, which is dated in a different way), and if you leave the Neve Campbell sequence, the entire film has a washable environment in the early 60's. . The use of restaurants in the movie was fascinating. For the first director whose background, I believe, in writing, he has a lot of eye. In the first ten minutes I felt that the action was not acceptable, so I just gladly suspended the disbelief and started driving. As for acting and showing the relationship of father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child, the film was spot-on. Villiam H. Macchi, a pleasure to watch, seems to fill the emptiness left by the late Tony Perkins, if this and Magnolia are any indication. Tracei Ullman as a neglected woman was pretty moving, for me. It was a three-dimensional representation of the character that society often considers to be two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable impressions. The parent's view (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me, indirectly, of BUFFALO '66, Vincent Galla, although he was a little taut! I would definitely pay the money to watch another movie from this director. He has the self-discipline of directors of b-crime films from the '50s (something that P.T.Anderson will never have!), And yet has a visual style and a way with actors who draw attention.
