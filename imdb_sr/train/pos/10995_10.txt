I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out a few years ago and I really liked it. But I still wanted to see her this year to check if she's still good compared to the movies that are coming out, and I want to say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life !!!!!! !!! !!!! What you need to know is that you do not have to miss a minute of this movie, if you do not fully follow the action, you will be lost and you will not understand the end. End is what makes this movie so good, you can not expect it. Congratulations to the manufacturer!
