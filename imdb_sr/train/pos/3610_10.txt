Girlfight is a story about a problematic teenager named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is burdened with the suicide of her mothers and a sexist father living in a sexist community. A short temper and many things that would cause a fire, she will be kicked out of school for fighting. Her brother, Tini (Rai Santiago), trains with Hector (Jaime Tirelli) in boxing. Diane said her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), to deliver this week's payout for Tini's training. While Diana is walking through the gym, she realizes that this is what she wants. He wants to box. Diana asks the father for the money to train, but he refuses because she is a girl and needs to do more 'girly' things. All that Diana wants is to be treated like any other type. She did not look at her because she was a woman. She stole the money from her father to start training. Excellent film. Genius, a pure 'genius' effect. Recommend everyone who needs a good and clean film without a "monkey business".
