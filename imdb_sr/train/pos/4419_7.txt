I saw this film and heard that the writer-director, Juan Gerard, spoke at the International Film Festival in Santa Barbara. All I knew was that it was the story of an eight-year-old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution of 1958 and how it affects his home and family. Its starting scene will remind you of "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is filled with references to classic films: The Roulette Vheel (Casablanca), "Chicken Clucking" (Rebel Vithout a Cause), references to Bunuel, "The Touch of Evil"; you will find more. The homeless (Georg Stanford Brovn) is a reference to a Cuban folklore who often uses black people as a type of Greek chorus. What this film is is a culmination of the dream. Gerard's desire to respect his family and the medium of the film he loved all his life. It is a true story about Han Gerard and all the people in it, as well as the described events. Gerard is actually an architect and an engineer (and a passionate lover of the film), but his dream was to make this film. He and his wife decided to live this dream, and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and starve in it. Keitel keeps the screen strong as the mysterious and secretly grandfather of Che. Brovn and Keitel are the only Americans in the act. Iben Hjelley (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (I tu Mama Tambien) provide strong support in key roles. but stay with it. The last half is much better when the events of the revolution unite for the bitter-sweet and sincere. It's Juan Gerard's first attempt, but he's as honest as he and his passion and heart are really going through, in this sincere first effort. I would definitely see him again and I hope he will continue his film career. <br /> <br />
