When I think of the Return of Jedi, I think that ep. Yes, Evoke was there, so what? They are an interesting addition to the film (not to mention that they are similar to Vietcong who could also take off a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). Yards are definitely darker than other movies. Car Palpatine (shown by incredible theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is so evil and evil, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers in relation to him. Talking about Dart Vader, what an incredible end to such a cult character. Vader is truly a modern Greek tragedy and I think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after the Revenge of the Sith came out. His redemption eventually moved and truly brings you a happy but bitter-sweet feeling. The best part was, of course, special effects. It's amazing how a movie from the early eighties still can test the time with its graphics. The scenes at the Jabba Palace (Leia looks incredible in that metal bikini) and of course the epic battle in three ways is still staggering. In all the deep complications and emotional moments of the Jedi (primarily between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth of Leiji) and incredible special effects, it is convenient to end one of the most favorite concessions in the history of the film.
