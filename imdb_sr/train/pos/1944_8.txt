This is a great movie about characters in an adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions. It should have a larger distribution, because at the same time it is much better than similar films from the main studio. The swimming instructor is almost Olympic, reduced to teaching adult basic classes, and often to the target of horndogging by his student. It tries, more or less, to discard them, with different results. Signs of students are common in the United States; teachers, police officers, students and pensioners, all of whom have not learned to swim for some reason. The film covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they pass through the classes. Several underground stations provide fun food, including divorce teachers, some high school graduates, and a girl who is only in class to meet with men. This is a good movie for the date, or just one for watching when you are in for a romantic drama with a touch of reality.
