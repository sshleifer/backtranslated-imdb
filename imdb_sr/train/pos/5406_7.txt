The fourth Pokemon movie made me cry when Celebi died. If you did not dare say Pokemon is bullshit! I do not like when people say that ... I love Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, without further delay, please say that Pokemon is excellent and that people should enjoy it at all ages. Also, why are Pokemon haters given low ratings for all or most Pokemon movies? I do not understand .... They should not be doing this .... There is absolutely no reason why people should vote without proving Pokemon sucked apart from: 1) Pokemon is ONLY for young children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think that people do not like Pokemon because of that.
