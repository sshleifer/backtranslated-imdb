I was in a bad state when I first saw this movie. For some reason, he clicked on all my levels, tensions in the family, loneliness and the desire to share someone's life with you. She did not hurt that someone with whom she shared her life was such a pretty girl as Claire (Cindy Preston). I also bought a soundtrack for this movie (it's hard to get). I loved him and I hope that one day he will appear at DV
