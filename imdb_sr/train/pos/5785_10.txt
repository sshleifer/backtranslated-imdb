While reading the comments that were left for this show, I could not help but notice that a large percentage of reviewers did not even watch any episode of the show, either through their free will. The thing about Kerching! It's a children's show, FOR CHILDREN, so obviously if your elderly looks cheesy, forced, and probably stupid. I even found one person who says the sets are stupid, but I remember as an eight-year-old who wondered why Taj had his molds on his wall, and wondered if my parents would let me put something on my (not). Yes, it can be irritating, the acting could be better and some of the characters really make strange things with their hair, but as the children show, I appreciate it 10/10. Compared to the things that are broadcasting today, well, let's say I want to broadcast it again. Somebody?
