I thought "The River of Souls" was a very good movie, Babylon 5, with some exceptional performances by Martin Sheen, Traci Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this is an episode of the series (no humor), it would probably be one of my favorite stand alone stories about the series. JMS did not write to her for most of the series and she had to endure the Biron / Telepath plot. If you take out the stupid humor about the brothel and the "poorer" actors in those scenes, then this movie is a solid thing. Probably my third favorite of four films, but not bad.
