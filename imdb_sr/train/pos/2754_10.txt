I really love this movie, I saw it last week after three years. This movie is perfect, great acting, great story, excellent direction / camera / music. It's a gift to show it to someone you love. too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after this. Top 5 jobs. Really !! Today, 3 years and 3 days later, comment above. never published because it did not have more than 10 rows. In any case, yesterday I saw "le huitieme jour" again. This is no doubt in my top 3 film together with Cinema Paradiso, which is also a masterpiece. Soundtrack is also very good. I'm really interested in the new film "jaco von dormael". I hope it will finish my movie 3. If you see this movie, rent it. Or even better. bui it. Because you will want to see him again.
