After playing her nymphomaniac at VRITTEN ON THE VIND, Dorothy Malone finally got rid of the role of her sweet sister and wife and showed her ability to play mantras with the best of them. She and Gloria Graham played the same kind of tramp - and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role, Malone won the Best Actor in the Actress. , but it's a strong enough melodrama under Douglas Sirk-capable hands. In the explosive opening scene, it looks almost noiric in appearance and sets the tone of the rest of the fireworks in a story in which ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHI MALONE his headliners. Domestic bickering among the wealthy families with the oil background is the primary focus of the drama, with the emphasis on strong supporting players, Stack and Malone. Both used the opportunity with both hands, and Stack was also supposed to be rewarded for his excellent job of a poor, alcoholic brother who led to desperation with his wild motives. Nominal stars have less impressive work to do, but do it with their usual skill and conviction - Hudson and Bacall. They play their more compassionate roles with quiet authority and understanding. The use of color is particularly striking (as is usually in Sirk's film), yet it does not stop me from thinking about a film like Noir film technique in the vein LEAVE HEAVEN. Good value is to watch with some interesting performances from the whole actor.
