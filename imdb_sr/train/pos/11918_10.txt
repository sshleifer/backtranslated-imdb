"Angels in the Field" was originally a 1951 film from the Ted Turner Library; Disney reorganized it in 1994, this time, using the California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as a team (Disnei owned this and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team, also, well-used words, huh ?????). This film was about a couple of orphans who wanted a family. The man promised his family to the family, only if the Angels won the flag. That's why he called God on one night. The boy who was praying could see the help coming in the way (and ONLY that boy); For example, when the first angel came down, the player hit the ball so hard not only to break the bat, but also the ball !!!!! Most of the post-All Star season in 1994, Angels were at the top of AL West (of which my host Rangers is one and still is). However, they lost the game because the boy was on the ground instead of the game Vhite Sok / Angels (then there was no Central Division in Baseball, so Chicago was in the West), and no angel was there to help. So a new rule has been created: no angel can help in the first games. But wait! In the final game, the Angels have won !!!!! It was really a miracle! What I liked in this movie: This is a good movie. I mean, I prayed every night for the past few years looking for help in school and other things; Look at me now! My job was good !!!!! So, for one, this shows that if you believe, God can send his angels to help you in any kind of trouble that you can have in your life. And secondly, this is a family baseball movie, which is always exciting. This is the old Disney movie; I've seen it recently at Nev Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). The "Angels in Outfield" will forever change your life after you see it !!!! ! 10/10
