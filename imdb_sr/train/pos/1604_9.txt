I'm really surprised that this movie did not get a higher rating on IMDB. It's one of those movies that someone could easily get, but for the romantic comedy "The Moon" is in the class itself. His environment and ethnic charm are things that people take for granted. Casting itself makes it almost perfect film. Several films of the '80s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's also funny. **** from the *****
