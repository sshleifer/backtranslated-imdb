"The Day Completed" is an incredible picture. in a way, it's better than "close encounters of the third kind". (I prefer cheerful independent moves for big budget spectacles.) The special effects of SU are cheaper, but it's a big part of the fun. Jim Davis gives excellent performance in this movie. it is probably one of the best roles he has ever had in one capacity. Music score is very good. The story does not make sense. EVEN THAN THE ONE IS MORE INTRIGUES. as well as many of the best artworks, the "day is over" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "The Day Completed" may be a low-budget indie movie, but it's not too much to compare it with the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of them were themselves with a low budget.)
