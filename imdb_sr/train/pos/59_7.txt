While I was in the video store I was browsing one dollar and I came across this little gem. I do not know what this is about, but I only had an instinct about him and the wow was right. The story is based on two girls who just survived the school. One of the girls is Alicia, a teenager who is the only witness of a full attack, and another Deanna is another survivor who survived the bullet in the head with some miracle. Thrown together by fate, they slowly start a painful and beautiful display of healing and movement. Only I hate him when wonderful movies fall through the cracks. Because you're the kind of performance by Busi Phillips and Erkie Christensen not to mention the rest of the actors! My only remark is that the DVD lacked a special look. Oh, and some of the jumps in the movie were somehow inconsistent. But all in all, a great movie.
