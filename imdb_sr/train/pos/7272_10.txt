Before I start, let me tell you how these special sounds are in the place where you play Sonic Adventure I DKS: Directional Cut at the same time (especially at the level of the Red Mountain). So while you look at this stand-up special, I suggest ... no, READ THIS to do it. Carlos Mencia takes the lead in San Francisco, California. It is there for everyone with absolutely no apologies. I am very grateful to God that Carlos did not do his thing in using the same joke over and over again and again and again over again. He does a tremendous job, ridiculing everyone and at the same time truth about it; I know a few times that I said, after Carlos said the joke: "Damn, this guy is doing a good thing!" And then the Game Over came over my TV because I forgot to play Sonic Adventure I DKS: Director's Cut. My bad :) So, yes, there is nothing to complain about this stand-up special. If you have TiVo or something similar, do yourself a favor and record this historical clock.
