I saw this movie with my friend and we could not stop laughing! I do not think it was terrible about this movie! It was ridiculous all the lines Freddie said were hilarious! I do not think they made a new nightmare and went to Freddie Vs. Jason. Although some parts were rough (as the head exploded). and any film from 1 to 5 incised elk. This was the best but number one. I would not recommend this movie if you want a good horror. But if you have nothing else to rent this and you'll be laughing a lot. I want to see a massacre in Texas, I think it would be terrible.
