There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious, political and social means. Do not cut movies and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as inequalities of wages and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is only useful to take another approach and throw a little light on the subject. The item is the 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain in order to qualify for the World Cup. The passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men in order to enter the game. Women who were caught (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Sheisthe Irani, Ajda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detained for prosecution provided a fun and bright view of the customs of this country and, most likely, of all Muslim countries. Their interaction with Iranian soldiers who guarded and transported them, both the city and the villagers, and the father who asked for his daughter gave some hilarious moments while we were thinking about why they have such unwritten rules. Mainly it is a paternalistic society that believes that it has to save women from the harsh behavior of men. Instead of educating a male population, women refuse privileges and rights. Watching the changes in responsible soldiers and the reflection of Iranian society, it's no surprise that this film will have no role for Iran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner in the hands of those who can see it.
