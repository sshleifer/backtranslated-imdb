There is a very clever humor in this film, which is both parody and honoring actors. However, after a while, it just seems like an exercise in style (no matter how Balko continued the role of Dussolio, and played very well all involved) and I wondered why Blier made this film. Everything is revealed in the finale, when Blier, directed by Claude Brasseur, receives a phone call from his dad (Bernard Blier) - from the sky, and gets the opportunity to say how much he is missing. Effective emotional caper and obviously honest. But there is not enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to make the rest of the film interesting during the entire duration of the film. However, some really beautiful scenes and sequences, and anyone who loves these 'mosntres sacres' of French cinema should enjoy this film.
