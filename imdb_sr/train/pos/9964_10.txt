Just take it. The DVD is cheap and easy to access, the length is now standard and without it you've gone long enough. (When the home video started, there were RINGS three versions with missing parts ..) All you read is true. No defense and no life without him. The color is lush and beautiful for viewing, and the production values ​​are pretty good for the children's ep. But there are no questions .. the whole Santa Vs. Satan's angle is so large that the jaw falls, so the film was hit at the time and cult favors when the home video really started. How good is / bad / weird / is it? I only saw TRAILER as a child, and I remember IT for almost 30 years .. including Murrai through top voice .. I told my older sister, and she called me a liar and she could not believe that it IS POSSIBLE FOR ALL the film in which Santa vs. Satan ... Add to him things like Santa Claus looking for the blessing of the Virgin Mary before going to Christmas Eve, children who want to capture him and make him SLAVE ... Probably approaching many nightmares that children had in the 60's years. Like others here, I'm watching this thing every holiday now. (My version is the Misteri Science Theater 3000 edition). But any old way you choose it, the movie is a demented masterpiece and totally must (along with Brianac, by the way ..) She never makes me laugh. Better, I think, then SANTA KLAUS WAS MARTIANE. Parts can still be made to climb or just crawl. (How many of you parents know about cocktails on Christmas Eve? Bored, disturbing, funny, childish, strange ... what else do you want?
