The National Gallery of Art has shown a long lost original original version of this film on 10 July 2005. It restores vital scenes that are cropped by censors after publication. The character of the shoemaker, a moral good individual in the original censored edition of 1933, was portrayed as a follower of Nietzsche's philosopher and calls to use people to squeeze his way to the top. Also, the ending of the original was abolished, which I presume is in the current VHS version and the ending has been restored to its original form. A wonderful film of seduction and power. Hopefully, this movie will be re-released on DVD so everyone appreciates its excellent quality. I'm looking.
