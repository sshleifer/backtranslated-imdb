I had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this film shows unfortunately many of them. They are very cunning, ruthless and greedy, and very unjust. From robotic sex, rage for gifts, lies and betrayals, I have experienced it all in Russia. I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here's a photo-magazine of my three trips to Russia looking for a bride. Includes thousands of pictures of many hot Russian girls I met, a black comedy, the scams I was sent to, and a story about my looting and appearance on Russian national television. .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like Real TV. You'll love it. I spent a lot of time together. So look. The Russian woman whom Nicole Kidman plays is like Julia and Katia in my photo magazines. My three brides looking for a trip to Russia are very exciting and they would be sold, so why not make a movie from my bridesmaid looking for adventures in Russia? However, in this film there is one factual impossibility, and this is the way a guy orders his bride from the catalog and that she comes to the airport. It does not work at all, so I do not understand why the media wants it to emerge. There is no Russian web site to introduce a bride who works this way, and I challenge everyone to find the one who works. The fact is that you can order CONTACT INFO for a Russian lady (e-mail, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. From here, you agree with her, then visit her, and if you want to bring her to your country, you start the immigration process in your INS office and wait a few months after that. That's how it works in real life. You can not just order her to arrive at your airport. The US Immigration NEVER would allow this to happen. VuMaster <br /> - I got everything I wanted to go abroad!
