Ok, I first got this movie as a Christmas present so it was FREE! FIRST - This film should have been stereoscopic 3D. It's mostly, but whenever the main character in her car is, the movie falls to 2D! What!!?!?! It's not that hard to record in a car !!! OTHERS - The story is not very good. A lot of things are wrong. THREE - Why show all death at the beginning of the film! The movie sucked whenever someone was killed !!! Make sure you smile, but do not waste time shopping. Just download it or get something cheap.
