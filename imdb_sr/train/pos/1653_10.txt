I agree with everyone who says this series was the best in the 'spy' genre. My husband and I were enchanted when we first appeared in the US and watched each episode. I tried at that time to buy a series (I shot everything), but VGBH told me that it was not available. I even thought to write to Ian Holm to see if there was a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (in part to understand the complicated story.) If the original version is ever available on DVD, I will be among the first to make a copy. Ian Holm's portrait of a vulnerable but brave Bernard Samson was incredible. (He's always incredible.)
