In October 1945, the American German descendant Leopold Kesler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrived in post-war Frankfurt, and his bitter uncle Kesler (Ernst-Hugo Jaregard) gets a job for him in Zentrop as a sleeping car. As he travels train his profession, he sees a devastated occupied Germany and meets Barbara Sukova, a daughter of a former powerful transport business entrepreneur and owner of Zentrop, Mike Hartmann (JÃ¸rgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between the Allied forces and the Germans, and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called "Werewolves" that kills sympathizers of allies and conducts subversive actions against allied forces. She falls in love with Catherine, and she reveals earlier that she was "The Werewolf". When Mak succumbs to suicide, Leopold is also pressed by "Wolves" and should take a stance and decision. "Europa" is an impressive and horrifying Kafka story about great Danish director Lars von Trier. . Using the expressionist style recalled by Fritz Lang and changing the magnificent black and white cinematography with some colored details, this film reveals the difficult period of Germany and some of the problems that this great nation must have faced after the defeat in the war. Very impressive action by the occupying forces that destroyed resources that would allow for a faster reconstruction of the country destroyed and corruption with Jews that should identify Macas. Jean-Marc Barr has an amazing performance in the role of a man who wants to stay neutral, but manipulates him everywhere. Mack Von Sidov's hypnotic narration is another touch of the class in this award-winning movie. My voice is nine. Address (Brazil): "Europa"
