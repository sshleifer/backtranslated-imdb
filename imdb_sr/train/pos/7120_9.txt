Most war films made in the United States during the Second World War were fun to watch, but they suffered from serious gaps in realism because they were produced more for propaganda value for raising ghosts at home than anything else. I'm not typing these movies because many of them are still very visible. However, because they often miss realism, they are prevented from being really big films. The perfect example was John Garfield's "Air Force" movie - in which the B-17 almost alone took out half of the Japanese airliners! However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome departure - getting high ratings to show the true story in a reasonably accurate way. When I first saw this film, I thought it was not a true story, because it looked too unbelievable to be true. However, after further research, I discovered that this is actually a fairly true story about the incredible story of two men who have done so much to earn Medal of Honor. This is one case where real life seemed too unbelievable to be true!
