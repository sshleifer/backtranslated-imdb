Murder: The film proved to be good text in a well-written, well-directed and well-performed series. Free ends were linked so that they were not addressed at the end of the final season. The entire series, and in particular the film, provided a life-long look at life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with a very high murder rate. My attraction to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but when I experienced life here for myself, I realized how real it was. And the film certainly kept that spirit. I will certainly miss out on the original original episodes of the series, but I am very grateful to NBC and producers and actors who gave us another glimpse of the dark side of Charm Citi.
