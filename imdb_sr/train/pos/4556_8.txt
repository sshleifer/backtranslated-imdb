I watched this movie pleasantly. This is probably one of the best movies of all time. It has timeless value, you can get so much from it that it's incredible. There are moving parts, they are funny and shiny. All aspects are noticeable, the display of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% genuine, even small Irish subtlety are covered. The use of low and high images gives two great views on Cristi (watch out for it). The performance of Daniel-Levis are incredible. I've never seen an actor do it. It's really incredible. And so it's great to watch, it runs so well, that this may be the closest thing you can get to a real life experience. I love it. If you have not seen it, you should see it. I have no doubt about that, there is something for everyone.
