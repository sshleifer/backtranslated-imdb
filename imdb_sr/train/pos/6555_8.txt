I've read more than 100 Nancy Drew books, and if you're not smart enough to catch up, Nancy Drew is a movie about YOUNG Nancy Drew, not an 18-year-old girl who does not go to school. a book. It was when she was sixteen. So, naturally, she would not be as smart as she in the book, since she is only in the 10th grade. Besides, I thought the film was very cute. He was clean and convenient for everyone. Sometimes it was funny. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulated, character and sweet. I liked the clumsiness Nancy and Ned had about each other, because they were obviously not old enough to be in a serious relationship as in the books. It was a sweet, PG movie that I enjoyed because, unlike most of my years, I enjoyed movies without sex, drugs or curses.
