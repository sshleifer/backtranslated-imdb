Tiempo de Valientes fits into the genre of the action film buddi, but overcomes its roots thanks to excellent casting, the fearful correlation between its traces and extraordinary photography. Diego Peretti plays Doctor Silverstein, a psychiatrist charged with driving a shotgun with detective Diaz (Luis Lukue), who is in charge of investigating the killing of two smaller hoods that seem to have been involved in a weapon smuggling weapon. Diaz is suspended from duty, but he is the best man for this job and must have professional psychiatric help to get back to work. Silverstein and Diaz are soon in a conspiracy involving the Argentine intelligence community and some uranium, and the film divides them into a key point that allows Silverstein to develop some impressive own skills. Peretti and Lukue are great together and they remind me of Terence Hill and Buddy Spencer's screening team, although Peretti is not classically handsome like Hill. Interestingly, even nearly two hours in length, Tiempo de Valientes does not endure his welcome, and indeed the writer-director Damian Szifron sets a potential sequel in the charming code of the film. All in all, a wonderful and fun action comedy that does not encourage the lowest common denominator, nor insults your intelligence.
