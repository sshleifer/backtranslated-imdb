The longest time I enjoyed this film was better than the original Care Bears movie. Last summer I watched them both together and concluded that I was wrong. The first is a better movie Care Bears (as you guessed if you read my review). This is not a bad movie, it's just ... VERY STRONG. First, as several people mentioned, it completely rejects any knowledge of the first movie. I can not imagine a second sequel that is so obviously contrary to the original (especially with the generations of some characters and how they all met). When I was young and watching this, I was a bit confused and confused. I felt the same way by looking at him as an adult! On the grounds why the film is actually pretty good (if you separate it from the first movie). I can not imagine another movie for young children with DEMON as a villager! Now I have not even suggested for a moment that evil demons who want to steal the souls of camper and Care Bears are good, I'm just as cool that it was a QUICKLY ZERO in a movie for young children! It's like this bizarre movie "Santa Claus Against Satan" from Mexico about which you sometimes hear. In any case, the demonic name is Darkheart and he wants that girl to help him get Care Bears in exchange for him giving her special powers. Very dark for kiddy flick eh? And did I mention that Darkheart appears to the girl most often as VHINEI VOICED 10 YEARS? Freaki! In the meantime, some other kids take care of BABY CARE BEARS at Care-a-Lot! Oh, man! Demons and bears in the same movie It's unnecessary to say that eventually everything clears up (but not before we see how Darkheart catches the souls of Care Bears in this) Scari chandeliers thing in one [surprising] deep disturbing scene). But it remains to me whether this film has found a cult audience that he so richly deserves. I could watch it again.
