The Sopranos were probably the last best air show in the nineties. his sad fact that everything was over, it was the best show on HBO, if not on TV, it was not all written for you when you thought it was great. The cast was excellent. Tony (James Gandolfini) is a great actor and played a great character like the rest. Each character had the disadvantages that made them so real and enabled viewers to connect with them, and that's one of the reasons why it took so long. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to take into account many different things that can be interpreted as the final id, as if I think that the tone did not die, but the meadow went in and sat with them and that the darkness was only for uncertainty. Tony will have to go to trial and deal with what I hope is not dead. That's how I feel ... Sopranos and Toni Soprano lived ...
