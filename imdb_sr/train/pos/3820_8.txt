This is the story of Shin, who moved to Miliang from Seoul with her young son Jun to begin the reunion after the accidental death of her husband. Her husband was born here, and opens a piano school, but he also has the ambition to own land with the money he received from the death. If that's what this is about in the movie, it would probably be like a Hollywood movie, dropping it to a local guy and happy with her son in their new home. But this is not Hollivood. Her son was abducted and killed, allegedly because he knows that he has money from the settlement. The process of grief, attempts to move on, attempts to clear conscience from guilt, all are done beautifully, and the main actress is brilliant. The only warning, and it should be noted, is that this is a depressing film. You need to know she's going in. You want Shin to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood, it's Korea and in Korean film, especially in drama, they do not have any blows. Life is what's happening to you. Great acting, but sometimes heavy movie to watch, because of events. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do it.
