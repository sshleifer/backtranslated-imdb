Pressburger and Povell's biggest movie. David Niven plays a pilot of a RAF bomber who misses his own death, but gives him another chance of life when he notices that AVOL is sending an angel to investigate. Scenes when young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in action, arrive in the sky to process for eternal life is unbearably ill. Beware of Roger Livese, a deeply undervalued actor, and Kim Hunter as a love interest (later, of course, Zira in the Planet of the Apes). Incidentally, Steven Spielberg actress actress actress Kathleen Biron acted as the old wife of the privately-owned privately owned Saving Private Rian half a century later, an act that speaks of his film literacy.
