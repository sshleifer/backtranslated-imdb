First I watched "Valking Tall" when I was about 8 years old and I thought that Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson were doing a great job, they must have already, because, watching movies, I tried to learn more about Sheriff Buford Pusser as much as I can. All three parts of the movie gave me wings and Buford Pusser was a real hero, I just would like to be alive today and have more people like him. I would like to thank him for having rid of all the crimes and being so brave. I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain. My heart goes towards them. So, from the 30-year-old pussy lovers Pusser and three of the Valking Tall movies and actors who have portrayed him, do not be negative about these movies and actors, they were just trying to tell us how wonderful a man Buford Pusser was and what kind It's a big family. And to all young people who may not have heard much about Bufford, I suggest you watch movies that walk and find out more about him.
