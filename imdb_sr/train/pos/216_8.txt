The question: how to steal a scene from the experts of the thieves of expert scenes of Valther Mathau in the full, fierce and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode? answer: quiet, futile and with perfect time as George Burns works here. I do not know anything about Vaudeville, but this remains a favorite movie, it's twice hilarious, the scenario is funny, the direction and the rhythm very good. Richard Benjamin is very funny as a real man - trying to get to Burns through the window, etc. Even small parts are great. It has so many funny scenes, Mathau seizes the advertisement, Burns repeats its responses as a senile ... Enjoyment. Enterrrrrr!
