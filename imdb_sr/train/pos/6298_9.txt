Great fun. I went with 8 friends to watch this movie. We came to see each other differently, but after 10 minutes we wondered how we got into this time the jokes became funny and the others are ridiculous throughout the film. In the first part you are just wondering about this 'raspberry' and 'white' things (there are many more examples of this jargon) and because they repeatedly repeat the same jokes (with different crafts) become funnier and funnier. In pursuit of these Malin main characters, the first even more strange than the next one is presented. While half of the film did not end, we did not even know the name of this movie because there was no opening of the loan and we went to this sneaking, but we certainly had a good time. The house was loaded (about 250 people) and I think half of them did not like it, and the other half loved the movie. If you like strange movies with great dialogue, you will like it. In addition to Clooney, this film deserves much better than the 5.6 IMDB rating he had at the time I wrote this, but when I saw more ppl, I'm sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable, I guess, I would give 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br />
