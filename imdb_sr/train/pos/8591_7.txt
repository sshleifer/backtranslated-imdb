This was a pretty decent movie. This movie is good to sit and watch and have fun. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This film will never win Oscars or anything and definitely does not deserve it, but I thought it was pretty good. It's kind of like a show 24, but it's set in movie format. If you like it, we must stop the terrorist from killing the president, and then you will enjoy this movie. I personally think that the story is made too much, but Sentinel does not add a little twist to the mole in the Secret Service. All in all, this movie will not leave your fork on the floor or change your life, but who says that each movie must be such that it is good?
