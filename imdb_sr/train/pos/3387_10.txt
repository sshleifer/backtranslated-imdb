A truly amazing film, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is terrifying. A highly overwhelmed, unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer and all our natural resources. In this dark degenerate society, we have a great Charlotte Heston as a lovely detective in a movie style trying to understand the truth behind murder, versus the legend of the movie, nightwatch Edward G Robinson, which turns into a fine last performance. One of the pictures that will always stay with me from this movie are the masses of people who inhabit the stairs and the way Thorne (Heston) has to jump through them each time they use them. The use of music in the movie is also worth the attention, although it does not contain any results in the usual sense, the theme of the opening is good, and the later part of the music we have here in Simonson's apartment, and especially Beethoven's pieces in the clinic for Euthanasia is extraordinary. atmospheric.
