This film is basically about human relationships and interactions between them. The main character is an old lady who, in the twilight of her life, moves on her way to her past, analyzing how she lived her life. This trip is accelerated due to the economic crisis in the sons and their intentions to place it in a nursing home. It is a very sincere look at some of the questions that we all ask ourselves at some point in our life, and there are many secondary ideas to be discussed in this film, such as family heritage, true love, marriage or destiny. Although this kind of movie melodrama is nothing new, this may be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. There are good performances by actors and characters are very convincing, but due to time some characters may not have been fully developed. I really recommend this movie for quiet Saturday afternoon.
