I have the feeling that Varners Bros Depression will become more important over the next few years. Yes, we are in an economic depression (or you lived below the rock) and the weather looks dull. But we always have movies as a way to avoid our troubles. In the 1930s, the film was very popular even at the peak of economic darkness. "The Parade of Light on the Legs (1933)" was one such film that the audience gathered. While this musical directed by Lloyd Bekon can not include social issues of time such as "Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)", it is still a wonderful showcase of talent. We have to wait for the end of the movie for the triple sumptuous numbers of Busby Berkelia, but, lad, are they waiting for me? Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her tapping is so, but Busby's magical "Bi A Waterfall" whispers her, and what looks like a hundred other horror girls, into the dizzy water of miracles. Of course, Busbie numbers could never be performed on the stage (they resist the gravitation restrictions, for one thing), and they contrast greatly with the realization of sharp, wise non-music scenes. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney in one of his big musicals (really, what this man could not do?). He can even take the lead from the leading man, donate marine clothes and adore the sex of Shanghai Lila (who is really a little Ruby in Chinese wigs!). overlooked for the benefit of other women (until the final reel, i.e.). Apparently, Blondell was the only other woman Cagnei liked besides her wife. And you can see mutual respect in every scene.
