This Alec Guinness actor is a very good political satire of the corporate industry, as well as a light eccentric study as well. funny type on the floor, except perhaps sound effects for experiments. But it has its fun moments, and is very clever in its execution. A large explosion segment is probably the most convenient element. The trade union procedures are quite intimidating, very reminiscent of I JUST JACK; especially women's socialist with a slight romantic love in Guinness's character. Political machinations actually carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is very noticeable. I think this does not work as well as LADIKILLERS, or TYPES OF HEART AND CORONA; but even the bright comedy Ealing is better than nothing.
