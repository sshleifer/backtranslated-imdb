The film that was then criticized but loved by fans, this film became a classic. By mixing allegedly "surreal" footage recorded at John Lennon's home among other live-recorded locations Marc Bolan & T.Rec at its best, this film is not just an obligation for everyone who loves Marc Bolan, but gives a fascinating insight into the era. It was a time when Marc was hobnobbing with such as Ringo Starr from the Beatles [who directed it] and you can even find a short video from a Reg Dvight [Elton John for you] ivories in incredible [and never officially released] Tutti Frutti and rocking and ballad versions of Children of the Revolution. There are also great scenes with Chelitoma Secund [he said he 'created glam rock' with her glitter use, etc.], Mickey Finn, and even an actor from Catveazle! The best scene for me is in the garden when Marc leaves the dinner table, sitting cross-legged in front of a string of sections and throwing out acoustic versions of the classics such as Get It On and The Slider. > Very High Recommended !! PET star [out of five]. Rori
