No hidden intent. Pure scifi. All fun. I saw the original on TV and I was scared pretty bad. I was a child :) Original can be appreciated more in relation to the new one I've seen and forgotten. The original, starring big movie star Steve McKueen (BULLET), is far better and the only version that everyone should see. test of time. I was convinced that this thing was moving on its own. 10/10 -Zafoid
