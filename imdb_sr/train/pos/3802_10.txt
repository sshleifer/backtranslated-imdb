Dragon Hunters must be the most beautiful animated film I've ever seen. It was a fork. The film talks about a couple of robbers searching for cash, their strange furry blue fire dog, and a girl who dreams of becoming a knight, and they are sent in search to go to the end of the earth to kill a world gobler, an incredibly huge dragon . But honestly, it does not matter what it is about. Because he's gorgeous. Gravity in this world of fantasy is different, so blocks of architecture and sphere of land float around in the middle of cathedrals and castles and villages, and there are forests of floating lilies. The world is so creative, so unique, with some sort of dull story. The world looks like a set of beautiful pictures. Monsters are also visually stunning, like a fiery dragon made up of the wounds of evil red bats. Some actions are not too genuine, such as the main protagonists who want their Mesa and People farm and they never seem to be able to make it in the world; but beautiful graphics, some seriously scary scenes and a dialogue that causes emotions make this movie spectacular.
