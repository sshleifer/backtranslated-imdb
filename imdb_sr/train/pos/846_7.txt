Two years ago, I watched "Matador" in the cinema and I loved everything about this movie. Apparently, I was completely under the impression of the magnificent role of Pierce Brosan. Yesterday I caught this movie again on TV, so I looked a little deeper. Now, I can say with certainty that this film is not so special, but you have to love him for one man. Brosnan raises her grade in my opinion with the amazing performance of Julian Noble, a tired hit man who has no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mecca Citi, a man who has a bad luck: his son died in an accident, his job is not doing well and he is not sure he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis). br /> I always loved these films; film about crime with great humor. Most of the humor comes from Brosnan, he speaks jokes about dwarves with a big d .... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "I look like a Bangkok whore on Sunday morning, after the Navy's left town." Brosnan tells his charm while drinking his margarita as usual. I also like Greg's 'typical American face' Kinnear in the role of a loser who is very alive, because there are many people like Danny Vright. So I recommend that you absolutely surely watch the best role of Brosnan ever. He will laugh at you at the same time and admire him. Big Brosnan in an unequaled good movie.
