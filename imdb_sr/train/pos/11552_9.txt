Here's another movie that does not really need a lot of recommendations. It's a classic comedy, very funny and fun, which, of course, eventually inspired a successful television series that many would say was even better (I enjoy both). For some it is hard to warm up Jack Lemmon and Valter Matthau as Felic Unger and Oscar Madison when they were rejected in a TV show featuring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or maybe the other way around). But what we have in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed like their film colleagues that they managed to make these characterizations their own. This is the key element of Neil Simone's spirited material, and from where they really make a laugh. For those who somehow did not hear about ODD PAR, it is a story of a neurotic and restless fictitious freak (Lemmon) who was thrown out of a twelve-year marriage with her long-time wife and inhabits himself in a flat in Manhattan of her messy and a completely irresponsible friend (Matthau). Pitting these two unusual roommates together within the same four walls makes for some immensely funny difficulties.
