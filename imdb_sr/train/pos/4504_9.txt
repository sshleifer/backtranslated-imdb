I thought here that "Nanook from the North" is the last word in the archaic semi-doc of Eskimo films. How wrong! As a passionate sea kayaker, I remained until 330 in the morning to watch how I hope to get an insight into some hand-made 'leather boats'. The film did not let me down. Each student of a kayak / retreat should have a look here. (Note to colleagues Skers: it looks like they use Norton Sound kayaks with one blade). But the film went far beyond this, of course, narrow interest. Although it was like others noticed some small feedback videos, the movie has so many hearts that it's just a little bit of annoyance. It was (from the point of view of this amateur anthropologist) probably the perfect time to make this film. In the early thirties: 'talkies' are so new that they (including Louie Maiere!) Actually let the Inuit speak their own language. And so much is still, despite the infusion, authentic. They really hit that polar bear, this whale and those caribou. The ninetieth version of this movie would be so sweet with the 'stars', Technicolor, etc. Version of the seventies? Not even. A very good piece of this great film is "White Shadows in the Southern Seas" (1928). Geographically, the mirror is "Eskimos", which also deals with the unbearable and profound disorder of western culture / technology on people who do not doubt.
