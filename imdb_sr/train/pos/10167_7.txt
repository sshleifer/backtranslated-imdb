I was not a fan of watching this movie at all, but when GF called me and said that he had a free advanced screening pass, I was tagged just to watch eva longorie and laugh with gigantic fools. All in all, it's better than I expected, but not much. This is like a hybrid how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like a paradise. a typical romantic comedy with her moments. the film was quite short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, to build some character development and to have a decent happy ending. the whole idea of ​​the spirit that persecuted his ex-husband was an interesting conspiracy. Eva has done a good job of maintaining sarcasm and paula rudda, and the rest of the support (especially jason biggs) kept her laugh at a calm pace. Overall, I liked the movie just because it had a good amount of laughter to make me go or I would give this film a lower rating. hey his chick flick and I'm watching this movie from the guy is persepctive okay, that would be more than a fair fight if the women reviewed this movie and gave there thoughts about it.
