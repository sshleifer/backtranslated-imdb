Gung Ho tries to express many ideas at the same time and entertain us with comedy. The result is uneven, but generally fun. Keaton well balances all three aspects of her main character. Vantabedde is even better. One warning: George Wendt is very bad in his support. Otherwise, this is a pretty favorable weather capsule.
