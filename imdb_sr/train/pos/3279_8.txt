I'm glad this is now available on DVD. This film is an excellent example of triumph of content and style above empty glittering lights and constant loud sounds. In essence, if you have a short range of attention or miss the mind and imagination to get involved Literary narrative you will not like this movie. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately rarely: Matthev Jacobs has done a fantastic job to successfully pass the story of Catherine Storr 'Marianne Dreams' to the script. An unforgettable task, like everyone who has seen the movie, will surely know. The casting is excellent, allowing director Bernard Rose to use actors in a way that is rarely seen now; enjoy the craft of acting! I know, I know, actors do their job and act instead of fighting to reluctantly swim on the lens of the camera, and the kaleidoscope of hail on cars, explosions and the fighting of fire around them is really a rare treat, but it actually happens in this <br /> /> This brings me to the final reason that this is a film for a fictitious thinker and not a tabloid reader with a spoon. Besides solid scenario, directing and acting, he relies on the atmosphere, uncertainty and implied horror. If it is to be categorized as horror, then the presentation of the 'Paper House' is more in the spirit of Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. In conclusion then, if you love a lot of loud sounds, explosions, constant cuts, and bright blinking colors that you'd better be watching 'Transformers', but if you like a tense story that goes through skilful and challenging the use of narration, and not to offend your intelligence by force that feeds you with a cephalic nonsense, then it can only be your thing.
