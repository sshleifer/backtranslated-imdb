It seems that other reviewers think this is a horrible movie. It's just not true and it's a little unfair. The performance is of good quality and the direction is moving along with decent fluidity. I think there is nothing wrong with Tarantino-esquire in the way the story is interconnected. Maybe it's just a new tool for the director's attempts. I thought the film was much more interesting. It may take several script elements, but this is the only error I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives a great performance like Silvio, and Antonella Rios is amazing and worth the cost of the application itself.
