I saw this film on DVD yesterday and was flushed and bewildered. The independent acting of DDL just came to my mind, and I was surprised by the entire acting team and its top-of-the-line acting. All the characters were so authentic that I actually took DDL for Christy Burns and Brand Fricker for his mom. Go and see! You will cry your heart, but you will experience a wonderful catharsis! In addition, it teaches you one important lesson: Decisiveness is everything. You may be in an impoverished suburb of Dublin, but when you are stubborn enough, you will not have any problems. If you can control your left foot, you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer. The worst thing you can do when you are mentally disturbed is to let yourself be self-pity. You will not get anywhere and the only person who will pity you will be you.
