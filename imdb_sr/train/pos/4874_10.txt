The curators managed to do it again. Another masterpiece. Coral comedy full of its own sights, with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments, we were laughing and laughing at what kind of fun! Music is everywhere, as well as recording, animals, crazy bastards, sex and incredible gadgets and inventions, everything that is visually visual only for fun. Clean cinema in essence. Great experience for watching. One is especially grateful because good comedies are so rare and so wonderful. Well, this is one, and if you enjoyed the previous films of Kusturica, you will love this, although, like in all comedies, it's a chemical reaction, and you have to be in favor of it.
