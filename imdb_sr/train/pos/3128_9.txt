Corni! Like it! Corni - just like the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt renew the same chemistry on a screen that never went away! They re-live old memories, plus actors who have played them since the 1960's show some things behind the scenes that are very interesting. Television from the 1960s was an unbridled escapism for many of us then, and this DVD is no exception if you are familiar with the original TV show. Scene of fighting with written Boofs and Bams or whatever it is fantastic !! The film scene shows the footage of the villains who have passed away. In the end, Frank Gorshin appeared. She passed away not so long after this DVD was made, so it is his great merit to return to play the bad guy Adam and Burt, just as he did to Batman and Robin years ago. He did not lose his touch! Thanks and Julie Nevmar to live again as a criminal. In conclusion, I think this DVD is for great memories, and I want to thank Adam and Burtu for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thanks guys!!!
