Johnnie To's CHOICE has some cool music on introductory entries and a nice introductory design, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and those Asian mobsters who solemnly swear an oath or say some sacred things; In fact, the entire movie is well recorded. I found about It from bishop Serafim Sigrist and I was very eager to see the movie To. The one I started with, THE CHOICE is exciting and interesting, and today only moderately violent to today's standards is moderately and substantially violent; the story of an Asian godfather, uses a puzzle game of elements, violent facts from the life of a mobster, a race for slander, true details, and Coppola is expected to believe that some of the morally glamorous mafias are right and nice and cute. The performances are quite entertaining and colorful. CHOICE is well made in a pleasant, somewhat carefree Hong Kong style style; The ending is bitter, true, flat, and will scare the children.
