I got this a couple of weeks ago and I love it! It is modern, lightweight but filled with true complexes of life. Questions and Answers, as well as other Eitan Foka films. This is my favorite, along with Jossi & Jagger. This image is much more universal, but only bubbles in which we can live. You do not have to be a Jew or a gay person to enjoy this - I am not, but the film goes straight into my top ten films. At first, it looks like pure entertainment, but it makes you think further. Relations with which we have to live are superficial, meaningful, deep, fatal. You do not know what's coming, and you definitely do not know where this story goes when you look at it for the first time. It's worth seeing several times. Fok films include a great bonus material - here's an excellent music video and "creation" (including an explanation of the title, interviewing Lior Ashknenazi in the film and the Arabs with suspicions of Israeli lifestyles).
