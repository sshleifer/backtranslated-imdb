This is the incredible return of the film director, Tsui Hark. It's one of several movies that deserve to get to know Shaolin's football Steven Chov. From the moment the film began, astronomical backgrounds, which were decorated with top-class style, were on each edge. If you are a science fiction or Chinese martial arts "geek", you will appreciate the excessive amount of many 3D effects and realistic computer weapons. There comes a fine performance (as always) of Ekin Cheung playing "Ski King". He teamed up with Louis Koo (Red), who was very impressed by his flexible "wing" that refuted the coming attacks. The fighting movements of these actors were experienced in every way. Not only is the action awesome, it already has a somewhat complicated story. Many critics of this film complain about the lack of a story / theme or just "push in random pieces" and even describe them as "Legend Poo." However, the viewer can not rely on watching Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga cartoons to understand this film. Others who have "Vu Xia" movies will have better access to movies. In due respect. there may be one weakness that can be predicted. The shot that was delivered to the enemy at the last stage of the fight could have been significantly and devastatingly made. In spite of all this, this must be seen.
