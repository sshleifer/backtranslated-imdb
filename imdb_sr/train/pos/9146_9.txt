This charged musical has more than just the breath of his star, the music genius who is the Prince. The movie is 90 minutes, but it's easy to see why it's so cult classic. Similar to other movies that run around a young musician who is struggling and trying to be great, this has the drama in him to add a dimension to the music numbers. Although this movie is not as good as 8 miles as a recent example, it's still fun and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side of the story, the story moves around Kid (Prince) of a young artist and a regular place in the club. The owner of the club is frustrated by Kid's arrogance, and little Kid knows that he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival. One side of Kid's parents has problems, and his dad is abusively abusing. During the film Kid teaches several lessons in life, and teaches her to value her friends even more. These are all the things that we have seen in drama that has arisen in years, of course, but this is combined as a musical, very stylized music. Actors are good. The prince is actually pretty good on the drama side when he is not in the position. It looks human and relatable. Clarence Villiams is as good as a father who is offensive. Appollonia Kotero debuts as a princess sexy love interest. The main strength of the movie is, however, excellent music. Music numbers are well placed and charged. The prince is no doubt a music maestro, although very eccentric. When inspired, he is great, but on the other side he will often make songs that are exclusive to him, and sometimes his experimentation can miss the fire, but that's the same for many music geniuses. The soundtrack for this movie is great, only that the Sexhooter is a weak point. The performance of "Purple Rain" that stopped the show is incredible. It's one of my favorite songs of all time. *** <br /> <br />
