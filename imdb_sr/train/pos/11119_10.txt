There are so many reasons why I judge the soprano so high, one of his greatest triumphs is the construction of actors and characters. Each character is developing more and more in each series. Also, each series has a series of different 'small time characters' as well as the main ones. A good example of a character (who was only in three episodes) for whom you can feel is David's compulsive gamer who greatly played Robert Patrick. Every small detail builds the perfect TV series. The show is about mafia boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) who is struggling to balance his crime with his role as father of two children. The show is not afraid to be brave and powerful with its dialogue and images, and that's what makes it so faithful. While Tony runs things with capoeira Paulie (Toni Sirico) and Silviu (Steve Van Zant), his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) seeks promotion. Each episode also shows Tony's other family, which in a way includes his children and the wife of the carmel souvenir (Edie Falco). On top of these problems, his uncle Junior soprano (Dominic Chianese) is trying to get what he can from Tony's work despite being in house-arrest. All acting is a powerful and complex character, but the two that stand out most; James Gandolfini who is Tony Soprano. Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, also represents a younger (20-30) generation in crime. If David Chase did not create this masterpiece, modern TV shows of such a caliber might not have existed, such as The Vire and Decree. So, Sopranos is definitely Kum, Goodfellas and Pulp fiction television
