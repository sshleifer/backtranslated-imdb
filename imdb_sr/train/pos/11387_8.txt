An American in Paris is a wonderful musical about an American painter who lives in Paris for inspiration. He meets a rich woman who admires his pictures on the street and believes that he can make his work even more popular for the public, e.g. at the Museum. The Golden Globe nominated Gene Kellie, because the artist Jerry Mulligan is perfect for singing and especially for dancing. She also met the main girlfriend Lise Bouvier (Leslie Caron) who is engaged to her best friend. She can not help her feelings for this girl, even after she finds out who she is hired for. Filled with a beautiful romance and beautiful song and dance, this is a very good music movie. It can be a little retired with his dance dreams, i.e. American ballet in Paris, but there is a good happy ending. She won the Oscar for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Designer, Best Music, Best Music Scores, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay and Best Picture, and nominated for Best Director for Vincent Minnelli and Best Movie Editing nominated for BAFTA for Best a film from any source, and won the Golden Globe for Best Film - Music / Comedy, and was nominated for Best Director for Vincent Millenni (Lisa's Father). Gene Kelly was number 66 on 100 movie stars, he was number 15 for 100 years, 100 stars - men, "I Got Rhithm" was number 32 for 100 years, 100 songs, the film was number 9 for 100 years music, was number 39 for 100 years, 100 passions, was 68 for 100 years, 100 films, and was number 58 on 100 greatest music. Very good!
