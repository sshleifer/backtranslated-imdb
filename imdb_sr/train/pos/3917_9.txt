I first saw this film when it was released in the United States in 1984. Since then, I have seen him many, many times. What hits me in the movie is the incorporation of the art of rehearsal into the lives of characters and vice versa. Through the film, two twists and sometimes he never hesitates to watch the lives of the characters or the scene from the rehearsal. This continues to the peak of the film. All these years later, my friends and I still love to discuss whether the "Carmen" is really stabbed in the end. From the reactions of other characters to stylized murder, it is open to debate. The passion of dance, the quality of the acting, the love of art and the brilliance of the performances together create a superior film that once again merges and distorts the boundary between life and art.
