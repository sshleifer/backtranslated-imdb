The movie often can not literally laugh the entire audience, and five minutes later, fill the eyes with tears. Many films are trying to do it, but few can deliver the emotional impact this film has made. Adam Sandler practically pulls you with your heated and often violent outbursts, but he also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past does not pull him away. I will not destroy anything, but there is one scene that should especially water your eyes and lips shake. Even most feline men would have to be insensitive bastards to not feel anything while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but Sandler bridges him. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances, but nothing in the series of two leading roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which actually saved this film from the depression of the borderline. There were a few laughs, but do not think that you will stay there for a long time, because again it becomes serious without much warning. about every emotion that the human body contains, but I will shorten this. I feel that there is no need to say anything more. Make yourself a service and take the time to see this movie. Even if you have to wait for it to appear on a DVD, it's 100% worth of time. A deeply shaken movie that surely puts tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless of course ... you are soulless soul.
