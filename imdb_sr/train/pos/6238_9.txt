An uncompromising view of the suburbs of Vienna in the 21st century, mixing stories of six groups of characters from the former documentary U.Seidl is a provocative, minimalist and intense piece of observer film. After the worldwide expansion of Big Brother Realize Shows, Hundstage takes modern voyeurism to an upsetting, deep level. Difficult to play, but an unimportant piece of European artistic film can seem cruel and silly, but it can manage to transfer the nihilistly alienated feeling of modern society in a dignified way.
