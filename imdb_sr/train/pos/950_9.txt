The setting and the actors make this television movie for me the best performance of Dickens' classic story. George C. Scott is as loyal as the rest of the actors. His Scrooge comes out with sorrow to the end of the film. Then his character changes to the one who really repents. A 19th-century cast that was selected for this scene creates an atmosphere that suits Dickens and contributes to the acceptability of this film. It's a movie I watch every Christmas together with a real Green and it's a wonderful life.
