How can you make a mistake with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that the two are already dead. It reminds me of a joke about Dennis Leary that great musicians die in kitchen fires while useless live forever. I paraphrase here, but you get an idea. DEADLINE AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL recounts the story of a group of disenfranchised children struggling against the administration of their oppressive high school. It is extremely stupid, but there is optimism that it is refreshing (even if it approaches the building). Who knew that this would actually be a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of a era when people still believed that music is important and that it can change the difference in the wider society. There are a lot of kids who know that the authority does not have the right answers. Instead, rock and roll is the only thing I can trust. But most importantly, this is pure exploitation. Nothing to do is take it seriously. Just go in and have a good time. If it was not the life of high school in the seventies, then it should have been.
