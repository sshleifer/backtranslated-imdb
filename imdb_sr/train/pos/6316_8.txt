This is not a "loose", but a precise, faithful remake of Monicelli's 1958 classic "I Soliti Ignoti" with Tot, Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale, etc. , even in details (such as a scene in which a photographer steals a camera from a local market). I watched the beautiful old version many times and knew all the gangs and the end, but I still enjoyed the "Velcome to Collinvood", which has its freshness and atmosphere. It's interesting to see how the life and paths of small thieves in Italy from the 1950s were adapted to the US in 2002. Things have not changed much. 8/10.
