My favorite movie "Imperialism" and one of the best action adventures of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with shy and wise cracks to satisfy everyone except for "PC" movie visitors. Unbridled scenarios abound - three sergeants and their 20 sepia fight hundreds of criminals; MacChesnei & Cutter gives Bobbi Coote a sharp stroke ("save for the elephant"); Cutter to MacChesnei - "I am an expedition"; Din breaks Cutter from jail, with jaw ("what do you think I'm trying to get out of? Pudding?") And the incredible temple scene with Cutter's singing, then releasing it, I smell like brass ... "All right, you're all arrested! > I could continue, but it's enough to say that I'm trying to catch this movie whenever it's on it. It's hard to imagine a better 2 hours for the armchairs of adventurers and the general.
