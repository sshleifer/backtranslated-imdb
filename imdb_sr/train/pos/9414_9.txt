Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness has produced an amazing amount of work - especially in the 1940s - from drama to strange comedy. I especially love his comedy because they are so well made and look so natural and real on the screen - it's far from being different from the usual Hollywood dishes. That being said, it was the movie that caused my interest in these films. The action was so strange and sweet that it was unlikely that the film would have been made anywhere - except for Ealing Studios - who had a special affection for "small" films like this. Guinness is a non-working little scientist working for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, although he does not work for a company as a researcher but for working in the home! So, he is inclined to sneak into laboratories (or during the day, if no one doubts or at night) and to try to imagine. He was constantly caught (as he did after the laboratory was pulled) and gave the boot until one day he failed! Then, despite the significance of the discovery, he moves into a completely unexpected chain of events - and then begins the party. The film is a wonderful satire that is entertaining in industry, trade unions, governments and people in general.
