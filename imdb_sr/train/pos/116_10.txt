Man, man ... I foolishly delayed (not the right term, there is a long list!) To watch this movie, and finally I had the chance to do it. And the "news" are: Wonderful spectacle of labyrinths! For any "follower" of Von Trier: and Rigets, Crime Element, Dogville, Dancer and The Dark, Pet Obstacle, etc. probably the difference due to its size in visual terms. Everything is beautifully clueless and claustrophobic! You really have the feeling that you are in this "imaginary" night sea varp. Taking the master of surreal films such as Bunuel, Bergman, until noir films from the 40's with acid droplets of avian guards, Von Trier leads the art-film scene as a "benevolent totalitarian" filmmaker today. His authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate questions, and not irrational, affects the mind of the viewer in order to heal some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world. As utopian as it seems, I believe that people like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a wider sense. Daily films and filmmakers carrying this kind of power are no longer needed as a means of thinking, perhaps it could be the beginning of a new era: "The Age of Emotional Control over Our Fears." That's what he constantly offers us through his work over and over again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
