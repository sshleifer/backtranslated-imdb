IN THE LOVING MEMORY OF DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) When I first watched this movie I was 4 years old and I was fascinated by this story of witches in World War II. The scene, which impressed me most, was the struggle between Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was exceptionally seen this army without a physical walk to fight the stunned singing of their march. This film is fantastic, from the road to Portobello Road (which made me the most fantastic London city) to traveling to Naboomboo. Angela Lansburi and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. She's always great, she seems to be a good aunt of the family, and David with her always amazed face is her big protagonist. We will miss him a lot.
