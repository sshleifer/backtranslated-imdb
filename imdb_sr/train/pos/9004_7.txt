I doubted the second love story in which people with disabilities find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh performed and exemplary, almost astounding, and rescuing them from being just another tear gas. Carter's description of the ALS victim is strong, perhaps even exaggerated sometimes (sometimes its dialogue breaks into unintelligible murmur). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarded. Branagh can be a perfect compliment for her performance. <br /> <br />
