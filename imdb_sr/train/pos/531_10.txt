This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I saw this film the first time a week ago, since then every day I see the opening and every time I feel thrilled as I felt the first time I heard David Niwen speak the immortal words of Pilgrimage Sir Walter Raleigh: <br /> <br /> Give me my shell of silence, My staff of faith to walk, My greed of joy, immortal diet, My bottle of salvation, My dress of glory, the true hope of hope; And so I will take my pilgrimage (?) Do you know why it would be true to say that the lives of Michael Povell and the Emeric Pressburger are completely justified by having made such a wonderful opening? Because they have already been admitted to the Paradise of the poet much before they filmed this film. I imagine that both of them face trial during the day of judgment and carelessly talk to the angry God: Excuse me, sir. So, do you want to know what we did during our lives? Well, you see: we wrote direction and production: I know where I am going, Colonel Blimp, red shoes? Do you think that's enough, sir? It is quite obvious that these two great artists have already fulfilled their duty with God, Nature, Muse or All that you could call when they recorded the Question of Life and Death. The fact that the lives of other people would be justified for their deeds could not be obvious to everyone, no matter how I feel that my life would make sense that I never did anything else to see this movie. Naturally, natives will be tempted to say: they do not do such films anymore. They will partly be in error; Such films were not made in the past. I've already quoted Keats, but I repeat his words: beauty is a joy forever.
