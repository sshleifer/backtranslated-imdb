I really do not like Shrek movies. (Since both of them are "PG" and have the words in them, I would never say so, so I did not love them.) But when it comes to "Ghost: the Cymarron Stud," which I barely watched for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated films, except Picard. *** Connections forward *** In "The Spirit: the Chimarron Draw", the horse's lottery is born and eventually becomes its leader. One night in the distance she sees a strange light and moves towards her. This action eventually leads to his capture and a few more things. Through the film we hear the story. It is through the Spirit's mind, although horses never speak. That's what makes the movie so goo. They (filmmakers) have reconstructed real horses to make the sounds made by horses; none of these sounds is made by humans. The Spirit encounters Rain, a beautiful mare, and Little Creek, a self-made American, who owns Rain. Little Creek later releases Spirit and Rain, they go home. I was never a big fan of Brian Adams, but I intend to buy a soundtrack for this movie in the near future. Take this film and you will not regret it. My result: 10/10
