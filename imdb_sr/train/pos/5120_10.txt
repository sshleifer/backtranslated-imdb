Quick and easy, I love this movie. As some others mentioned, I am also not from the south, I do not really care about Countri music and I never wore a cowboy hat. (I've never been driving in a car with a dead body in my trunk, but I love "Goodfellas.") This is just a great movie. Recorded at 2.35 ratio and beautifully transferred to DVD. (VHS was 1.33 full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mix for viewing pleasure. What can you say about this movie? It's just a story of love / hate in Texas, with great performances. Travolta is fantastic. In addition to "Pulp Fiction", that's the best thing he did. Already 25 years old is in my top 5! Check this out !!! That's 10 !!!!
