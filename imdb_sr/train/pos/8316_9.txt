I watched this movie every chance I got, as early as the seventies when it came out on the cable. That was my introduction to Harlem, which has since fascinated me (and Bill Clinton). I was still very young and the film made a big impression on me. It was great to see a movie about young girls growing up, trying to decide who they want to be, and making some bad decisions, as well as good ones. I was amazed by the beauty of Lonette McKee, the brilliant dresses she eventually got to wear, and quick dialogue. As someone who was raised by a single mother, I really could identify with these girls and their lives. Funny, these characters seem to me a lot more real than Beion's Knovles!
