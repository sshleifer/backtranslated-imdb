The idea of ​​filming the Beatles sounds convicted of an idea, as no production can capture the idea of ​​a real Beatles. Then it's best not to try to recreate the past, but to make an illustration that best works with other available Beatles material. This is precisely what our "Birth of the Beatles" offers us, a simple story that we know without any extravagance. *** SPOILERS here at *** He warned that not everything is as accurate as some Beatles graduates might have expected. The Beatles are shown as songs that were barely made up until then. Beatles perform "Ask Me Vhi", "P.S. I Love You", and even "Don't Bother Me". Beatles graduates should see that if the Beatles played only songs that actually worked in Hamburg, younger viewers might no longer recognize the Beatles who learned to know them. Only the "Johnny B. Goode" and "Love Me Tender" Stu Sutcliffe are kept from this original Hamburg repertoire. The guys who play Beatles in this production hardly look like original, but the rest of the movie still looks good because the movie for the rest is pretty accurate. The guy who plays Lennon does it well, and the rest of the band is not bad. Brian Epstein is great and the moment he pulled out Pete Best from the band is probably the most memorable scene in the whole movie. You can also see the original Cavern Club in the movie as a bonus.
