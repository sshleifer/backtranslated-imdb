This is really one of the best movies about love I've ever seen. Then there is no other than "Before sunset," which is technically not yet another movie, because these are the same people and the same romantic. It is "love" in the real world. . All right, that's only if most people are intelligent and eloquent as the film's leaders. Reading other reviews, I'm glad to know that many are crazy about movies based on dialogue. And that's what makes "Before Sunrise" so good. The dialogue is perfect. It's so real, attractive and fun. It's hardly surprising that Jesse and Celina fall in love, because at the same time you fall in love with them. My favorite scene is she in a coffee shop, where they pretend to phone their best friends, and the other pretends to be said by the best friend. It's perfect. He returns you in the moment when you first fell in love. I have to say that if you have a choice, watch "Before sunrise" before watching "Before sunset." "If you are like me, you first watched" Sunset, "it's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sorrow for two young lovers through the whole show. Once again, the biggest romantic movie in my books is wonderful acting, great script and beautiful location. Young love, that's the best.
