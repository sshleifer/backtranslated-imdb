Kirk and the crew descend to a lonely planet where the sun will explode. They intend to evacuate residents, but to find a place abandoned, except Mr. Atos who manages a kind of high-tech library. Despite attempts to get a clear answer from him about where everyone is, Atos is indifferent to their questions and insists they must quickly 'make a choice while there is still time'. They have no idea what he's talking about, but they wander around looking like mirrors like mirrors on viewers and seeing images of the past of the planet. Then, while the disc is in the viewer, Kirk passes through the door and magically returns to the past in what appears on Earth as the Louis XIV (1660s). When McCoi and Spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to hell of the ice age. Too late, they realize that the library is a time-travel and library store. While Kirk's visit is rather short and not so exciting, Spock and McCoi are much more fun, because Spock falls on her feet for Mariette Hartlei - who is sent to this terrible spot as a punishment. Scots with Spock are extremely interesting and very atypical for a normal logical guy. Spock's deviation from the norm, wild inventive script and very diverse locations make this extraordinary episode - one worthwhile look. FII - Ian Volfe, a great art actor, played a g. Atos. I am a big fan of older films and I saw him as a supporting and important player in the countless films of the 1930s and 1940s and he looked almost the same as he did in this episode of 1969. 23 years old - dies for over 95 years !!
