We Take: Funny recording of Lion KING, presenting itself as a sequel. Amazing fun. Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another funny recording directly on the video, which is worth the theater treatment. I do not see why Disnei posted this directly on the video and released heavy films like "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland" theatrical. These movies are better visible in video stores (in the field of "new releases") instead of watching their theater posters outside the theater. This is just a podium of the first movie (although the Events in "Simba's pride" have not yet been held, on Timon (pronounced by Nathan Lane) and the viewpoint of Pumbai (expressed by Ernie Sabella). We see them ridiculing events in The original cast of the first film, such as Matthews Broderick, Voopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their main roles in the first movie, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give some hilarious comedy relief as Timon's mother and sultry uncle . /> So this does not sound fun. Maybe not now , but watch out for yourself. The fact that it is not so serious in its plot makes it more comfortable. It's kind of like the MST3000 with Timon and Pumba. Estimated video of the movie: *** 1/2 of 5.
