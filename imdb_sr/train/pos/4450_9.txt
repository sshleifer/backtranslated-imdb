The old man living in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. He walks in the forest to be a witness to the murder, but has he seen murder or loses his reason? Are you just old? The film is so big because the viewer has to decide on what's happening. There is very little dialogue in this film, but they do not need to say, the entire film speaks for itself. You knew what was going on, and I liked it. The second part that I liked was the record of the late autumn and winter forests. They were nice, but the only thing I did not like was a look at the old man in his underwear. He could tie the coat a little stronger, but in addition, it was a pretty deep movie.
