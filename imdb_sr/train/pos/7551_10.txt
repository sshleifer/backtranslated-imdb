The best animated film ever made. This film explores not only the huge world of modern animation with absolutely stunning effects, but also the branches of the human mind, soul and philosophy. In the story there is a family of cats, in which the big sister dies, the younger brother sees and saves her body, but when she wakes she stays without a soul. So, the two siblings are on their way to find him. I've linked this journey with many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the life cycle, and every time I watch it, I discover more and more hidden topics and metaphors. If you are not in the physiological aspect, you will still worship it. The animation is great, and creative scenes will tie you to the screen. For example, freezing the ocean in time, God eats soup from the earth, a strange and mild SNM transcription of Hansel and Marica. To conclude, Cat Soup is an absolute delicacy for everyone. PS - Not for children, including free violence.
