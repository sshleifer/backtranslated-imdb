The story and music (George Gershwin!) Are wonderful, as are Levant, Guetari, Foch and, of course, Kelli. One thing is missing, and this thing is a good lead lady. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron is bothering me. In any case, despite her, the action moves nicely with the famous (and deserved) ballet. Colors, shiny red, blue, green and yellow. Mus does not forget either beige. ; I just adore the contrast between Beauk Arts Ball (completely black and white costumes) and always so brilliant Ballet. She certainly sees, and enjoys it, because even though it's not the best, it's MUSIC. But do not forget to forget another musician, Gene Kellie, with a 20-year-old girl who was catapulted to the star right after that.
