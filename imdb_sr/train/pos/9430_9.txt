I am a member of the canoeing club and I can tell you the truth that the liberation is synonymous with peace and tranquility of experience. As we put our boats in the water, banners respond in the background of the conscious mind. This film is timeless, because it has a philosophical influence on the human place in nature and the impact of technology on man's relationship with nature. We see him in the bow. We see him in his home tent. There is also a scorn of a city man and a sense of superiority in the village forestry "cracker". The fact that the Banker of Atlanta (Ned Beatti) has "bad teeth" means putting him at the same level with the foresters who also have bad teeth. Finally, the struggle of life and death confuses the assumptions of a "civilized man" about the "Law". This canoe road ends too early for the viewer, but unfortunately it is not enough for the characters.
