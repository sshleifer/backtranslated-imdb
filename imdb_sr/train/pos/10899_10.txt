So I laughed during this film as my face hurt. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of one nice boy Jack Blacko in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical A performance. The whole acting is funny, the story is pretty good and the comic moments are great. I went to this film without expecting much, so I may have been so surprised that I got out of a movie that was completely satisfied and physically exhausted. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys comedy, can be identified with loneliness during holidays and / or face relatives. The best part of this film (in my opinion) was the subtle pieces of humor that completely encountered me and laughed long after the rest of the audience stopped. Namely, the scene with Christmas tree lighting. Go and see yourself and laugh!
