As they travel by train across Europe, Americans Jesse (Ethan Havke) and French Celine (Julie Delpi) meet and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States, and Celine to Paris. "Before sunrise" is one of my favorite romances, really one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's a budget with a low budget with a very simple and real story, but the chemistry between Ethan Havke and Julie Delpie is perfect, and the dialogues are stunning. The direction is incredible, conveys the feelings of Celine and Jesse on the viewer. I just finished my review number 1.000 in the IMDb, and for this significant number I chose "Before Sunrise," because it's a very special movie for me. I can not understand why this film was not nominated for an Oscar, with such magnificent scenarios, direction and performances. I was probably watching this film for the third or fourth time yesterday, and I still love him. My voice is ten. Address (Brazil): "Antes to Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
