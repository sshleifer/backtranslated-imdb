Holly is a film devoted to problems, but it is neither manipulative nor too sentimental. His heart is that this film is based on character, which would not be so successful without the images shown Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with a gradually awakened conscience and the Holi (Thui Nguien), a strong will, but in the end too much coincidence of the young Vietnamese girl . From live locations and photos to effective editing, everything is open and well done. A contemporary classic score can at first dispense something, but it is a superb composition and emphasizes admiration that is obvious in everything. This film, which raises many questions, but gives a few clear answers, ultimately succeeds in raising awareness and compassion for Holly and many who share her condition. Honor to those who managed to make it.
