I really enjoyed this film about the relationships that sometimes happened between US soldiers and Japanese women in post-war Japan - as well as the obstacles created by prejudices. Brando goes from contempt for the Japanese (which is natural with regard to the Second World War) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and wants to marry her. His performance is fine (I am not a big fan of his acting style), and the film is remarkable. Red Buttons won an Oscar for his moving performance of another GI who falls in love with Japan (although Japanese women who play opposite him also did a remarkable job). but the movie is good to watch with a tissue box. This movie is able to say something and be fun at the same time. Most of the underestimated jewel.
