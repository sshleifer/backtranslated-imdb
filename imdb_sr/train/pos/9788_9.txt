I was at the same scriptwriter conference and I watched the movie. I thought that the writer - Sue Smith - very clearly summed up what this was about. However, the film did not really need an explanation. I thought the topics were plainly clear and inspirational. A movie that deals with the ability to dare, to face the fear - especially the fear that is transmitted from parental figures - and to overcome it, and thus to accept life opportunities, is a film that needs to be guarded and enjoyed. I enjoyed it much more than the much confused "Somersault". I also think Mandi62 was a bit unkind to Hugo Veaving. As a type of his harvest, I should look so good! I agree that many Australian films have recently been glittering, but 'Peaches' are shipping goods. I'm glad I saw him.
