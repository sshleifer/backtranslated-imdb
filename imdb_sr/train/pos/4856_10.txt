I first saw this film for the first time a few years ago and I continued to watch it a few times a year when I have a chance. It's on my list of favorite movies along with some classics. If someone tells you it's stupid or outdated, ignore them ... this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughter and music. Dance is not so important in this movie as in other Astaire films, so comedy and acting are shining. Watch this movie if you can, it may be light, but it's still fun. So I know that many people hate black-and-white movies, they think old movies can not be funny, this movie should make them change their minds. No one I know can watch this movie without having a little fun. The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire is singing without dance. Perhaps he is an excellent performer and capable singer, but is simply not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. Comedy sometimes has little clich√©s, but the vaudevilleskue performances of G-burns and G Allen are perfect for a piece and can please anyone who searches for some light laugh. Give this movie a chance even if you do not like old movies, this movie can get funny in any movie.
