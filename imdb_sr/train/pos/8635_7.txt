"California" is a good Hollywood odyssey of uncertainty and terror that talks about two couples driving in California to share the price of gas: a pair of losers (Levis & Pitt) and two vannabee artists, photographers and writers (Duchovni & Forbes). Pitt "naughts" his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller. Good watch for those in a psycho killer.
