The original uncensored print of this incredible film was discovered in 2004 at the Congress Library, and in 2005 it was screened in several specialized theaters around the world. worst dialogue and innuends intact; later they were either removed or completely filmed in the studio before the first release, in order to pass the censorship of the State of New York. I also read the DVD "expected in 2006" and that you can only hope! If we are really happy, it will include comparisons between the two versions. Keep in mind that the released censored version was originally available on the Laserdisc, which I saw. Stanvick rules!
