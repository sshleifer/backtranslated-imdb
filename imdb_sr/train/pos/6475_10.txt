These are just 2 episodes in a 5-part drama, but I can say that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. It's on TV, a silver screen or even in real life. As a writer, it's good that it's almost demoralizing! As a spectator, it's so fun that I'm upset that episodes are over two weeks instead of Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negatives are positive. I am a modern guy who has previously surrendered to television drama. Compared to movies, TV shows always seemed to be out of date, pretty good and good, generally boring! "Five days" really brought a television drama to the 21st century, so that at least it changes for me. Go look.
