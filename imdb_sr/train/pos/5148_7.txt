I do not know what's with these movies. But movies about history or religion have always been criticized by their accuracy. Of course, this is not 100% accurate. It's hard to make 100% accurate movies today when even "experts" do not agree with each other. That's why I like to judge the film by what it's trying to say, but to choose all the inaccuracies. So I'm starting to say that I like this series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years passed too fast. The series should be a story of three parts, and his childhood is the first part. But if they did not have more money to record more stories, who am I to criticize? book vai. Especially the other part that is just the sum of the events that happened. I'd rather have seen Hitler humane (more scenes in which he doubts himself, etc.). Noah Taylor did more in the movie Mak that seems to work better. Still, I'm glad that this is done and I own it on a DVD. Just to remember better what happened and see Carlilla doing her best. 7.5 / 10
