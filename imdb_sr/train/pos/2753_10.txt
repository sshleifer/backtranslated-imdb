My favorite movie of all time! I've seen a lot of movies, but this one has won everything! Great acting, wonderful story. You, as a "normal" caring person, will start to love George. Although he is an actor, he is also a very nice person. And the most important thing is that you will learn to respect and look differently from people with Down's syndrome.
