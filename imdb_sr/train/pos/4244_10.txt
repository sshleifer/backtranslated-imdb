This film has fallen through the cracks of film history. Much better than some other New York movies of the same period, such as: "French connection" or "Taking Pelhama 1-2-3". There is a real reality in this movie that also succeeds in effectively using humor to deepen the line of complication. It starts from the beginning to the end and has not diminished over the years, as is the case with the above examples. Let's fly as a result of this project. Gordon Parks directs and, as well as after "Shaft", at first glance looks like a weird choice. Nevertheless, this is the other side of this earlier effort and has approached him as much in the machismo of your face. United Artists really have a jewel on their hands and it's a shame they're not doing anything with that.
