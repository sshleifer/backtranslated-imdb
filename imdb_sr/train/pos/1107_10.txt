In a classic sense, four humor (which are not specific to the concept of fun or even fun), Altman's "H.E.A.L.T.H." treats all the humor, in very funny, fun ways. There is Flegma, as she was personified by a very slow, well-guarded and protective personality, Lauren Bacall, Esther Brill, whose mission in life seems to be about appearance, protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being. There is Paul Dooley's Holler Dr. Gil Gainey, who, as a fish from water (perhaps more like a seal), frenetically, lightens and encourages the audience to turn into his guided madness. Melancholy Isabelle Garnell, Glenda Jackson, smells Shakespeare's problematic and self-righteous Hamlet - even if one or two monologues say it. And let's not forget Henry Gibson's Bile Character, Bobbi Hammer ("The Chest That Keeps the Baby Rule the World"). There are also characters Harry Volff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett), relatively healthy characters who seek to find some kind of balance among all followers and extreme humors convened by H.E.A.L.T.H. - a kind of world trade organization specializing in H.E.A.L.T.H., meaning everything except health. This is Altman in its classic best.
