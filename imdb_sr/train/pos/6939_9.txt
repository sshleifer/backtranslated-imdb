I was very impressed with this film. I'd have to rate him as one of the better classical Western ones. I say this for the whole thing: acting, mature dialogue, non-pointless story and excellent cinema. Director Anthony Mann, who has recorded several times a well-recorded movie noir in the same period, made some news like this. It has the same film-noir look. During this period, Mann and Jimmy Stevart collaborated on several westerns. . If you like this movie, I recommend Mann-Stevart's "Bend Of The River" movie. In short, the story is about a man, "Lin McAdam" (Stevart) who owns this prestigious Vinchester 73 gun, a weapon he won in the competition. Then he was stolen and transferred from a villain to a villain. All these criminals are interesting characters. Helping Stevart is to tell this interesting story: Shelley Vinters, Dan Durie, Stephen McNalli, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Vill Greer and J. C. Flippen. Everyone is fun to watch. It was a bit tense, however, to see Rock Hudson playing the Indians ("Ioung Bull"), but you can not have it all.
