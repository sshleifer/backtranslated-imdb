Delirious, near pitch-less mood piece and if more LSD is inspired by the Devil then we have to remember when it's made! After a stunning SM opening (which is not even what it looks like) we move to a soft focus and dream or imagination or memory. Many literary and cinematographic references, and this is in fact Franco's film, which Lang himself praised. Beautiful and enchanting, the film takes place at a slight pace, but it has a wealth within every fold. A rare movie that is heard. Old Jess could do them when he tried. Sophisticated central performances, including unstoppable Jack Tailor and Howard Vernon. I did not even mention the Lisbon sites - ah!
