Made by the French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet, and narrated by Robert De Niro and firefighter James Hanlon, this is a convincing and heartfelt story about how the brightest New York shone on the darkest day. I saw that for the first time when I was a young naive 12-year-old, and she still touched me at that time. Knowing how serious September 11 was, this spread the entire effect of September 11th. We found out who the heroes are, how they make everyday life and how they put their lives in a situation in which most people just run and save themselves. These brave people put their lives on the line and watching it only increases my admiration for them. Watch if you can, this is the best documentary I personally ever saw.
