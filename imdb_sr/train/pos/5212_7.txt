STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning Very significant bad actor, which turns into his (now pale) appearance Instead of a strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere always took a rather curious position on the American Hollywood scene, always a sure role in the leading roles of men who still have a prominent presence today. But today he seems to have gotten more into such direct roles on DVD / limited editions and as such he may seem to fit more into his forte now. He must rely on some strict things here. as cynical random worker Earl Babbage, one such worker has been assigned several hundred sex offenders in one area in the United States, who, together with his new protege Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes), must be taken to his last case, going to the abduction of a young woman while she was trying to forgive her for a case that had collapsed many years ago. This is a certain dive into the darker side of humankind, the treading material is definitely not for the gadgets or those who are looking for light viewing. And as such is a fairly strong, convincing film, stubborn and not limited by direct DVD. The only thing that really pulls it is an excessively tremendous, fast sequence of cameras used in more dramatic moments that seem a bit odious after some time. But it's still one of the most perfect materials I've ever seen in Gerea, tirelessly getting darker and more over the edge as it continues. ***
