Warm film. The usual great acting of John Thaw, which recently passed. A man who was always so modest. He was one of the 10 best actors of Englands, of course, of my time. It can be remembered by his famous role as Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan hit the TV series Sveenei in the 1970s and as a lawyer in Kavanah KC. She must take care of all the family and a great DVD for my collection. Recording will bring back some memories to people who remember the war in Britain and certainly to those who were evacuated from London to escape the German bombing. The interaction between the two main characters. Tom and the boy William really reacted well and were true to Michelle Magorian's book.
