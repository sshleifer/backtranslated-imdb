This is almost a perfect movie. Mamet would repeat the ideas, but he never said so crudely. It's actually a failure of trust, a human condition. The film perceives the idea that we are all criminals, nobody is innocent. Is anyone today alive, who has not seen this game in our society, every day? The film is very structured as a Hitchcock thriller. Besides, there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, destroyed and everyone is involved in the conflict. Is it more accurate? Do not miss the sound surface. It is beautiful.
