Although little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the thirties of the last century, a pretty teenager with a lively personality and a beautiful voice of opera singing. This 1937 was her first big movie, and proved to be a bonus tape for the surrounding Universal Studios. - A faithful mother reveals that she could soon marry again - with a firm intention to undermine her girlfriend with golden diggers and return it to her mother. Although the story is small, the script is witty, and the professional actor plays it with a proper humorous touch. Durbin has a nice voice and an appealing personality, and such entertaining actors as Charles Vinninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Vatson and Mischa Auer. Ultra-light entertainment for movie lovers from the 1930s. Garry F. Tailor, or GFT, Amazon Reviever
