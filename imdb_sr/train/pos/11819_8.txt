I just picked this up on a DVD and looked at it again. I like light colors against dark pictures. Not a big Beatty fan, but this is a great popcorn movie. Pacino is astounding, as always, and this film marked the period when Madonna was absolutely the most sexy. I wish she had been stuck with "Dasha" for a while. The first really big role of Charles Corsman, except "What's with Bob?" The effects of the makeup were then sharp and still remain for the greater part. Beautiful landscapes and mood bring you directly into the comic environment. Cars, wardrobe, buildings, even street lighting and great tone, not to mention perfect lighting, although scenes with many red colors can be a bit unpleasant, as it tends to be a bit tricky. I just want Beatty got the chance to make a sequel. All in all, fun for several hours.
