I recently watched this movie for Jake's recent success with Mount Brokeback. I thought I would watch the movies I missed. I did not expect to enter the film, so I was amazed that I missed this movie at all. It's a nice story about father and son, and that's a story of loss. I even finished tearing at the end of this wonderful story. This movie attracts all ages. The only reason 9/10 gives me is that it slows down a bit in the middle, but in the end it returns very hard. The acting was great, the story was magnificent, and the cinema was amazing with regard to the setting of the film. GO SEE THIS FILM! Rent it, buy it, watch it, VOLITE SE! I know that I am!
