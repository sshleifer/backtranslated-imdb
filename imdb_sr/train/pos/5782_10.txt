The Internet database lists this as a TV show. And yes, it was a series on MTV that was shown in the Oddities program, after The Head and before Aeon Fluck, if I remember correctly. But the version I was looking at this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes that met together in a movie without bored credits between or waiting for the week in the next fifteen minutes. You have a story about Makk, Julie Vinters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Makk is a super-hero or bummer, Julie is a social worker or queen of a leopard, a Sarah girl who needs to listen to less The Smiths and Mr. A gone guy who can not hold his head. And there are other weird creatures ... I use "or" with Mack and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and what are the dreams. Maybe they are all real or dreams. Perhaps one of the characters does not exist. There may be only one and dreams about others. You'll have to wait and find out. I had comics before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. The works were spectacular and the story was genuine - unlike everything you find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind and have powerful scenes of adults without being obscene or insulting. And the show essentially used the same same works of art (it is only now being launched) and the same story ... which guarantees that the beauty essentially found in the comic will be faithfully reproduced. This was the best show that appeared on "Oddities", hands down. If you love comics darker in nature or you need a good trip of the mind, this is a show you can check. It's "Donnie Darko" before there ever was such a thing. The most amazing thing is that this has never become another movie or television series, but I'm not saying it's disappointing. Holding it simple, they sealed this film in gold and held it free from stains that caused repeated errors.
