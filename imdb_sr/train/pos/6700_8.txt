Sitcom ran around a girl who must learn to be responsible for her own actions. As she had the power of magic, she often used to try to help her closest or self, which often resulted in literal playing, which is often catastrophic and always funny. The program began with Sabrine's secondary school adventures in the fictional town of Westbridge, located near Boston, Massachusetts (as opposed to Greendale in comics). In later seasons, Sabrina graduated from high school and enrolled in college, and then continued her efforts to live alone and retain her job in local newspapers. Smashing away from her comic roots, the show ended with Sabrina's wedding, although she finally left the wedding and fled Harvey. Many episodes include Sabrina to meet, through natural or supernatural means, popular real music artists of that time, including Coolio, Violent Femmes, Backstreet Bois, Phantom Planet, Davi Jones of The Monkees, Britney Spears , Avril Lavigne, Daniel Bedingfield, Hanson, Eden's Crush, Savage Garden, 'N Sinc and Ashanti. The course of nature, band Melissa then boy Joan Hart (now husband) Mark Wilkerson, appeared in the 2002 episode.
