I'm not a big fan of a kitsch camp and "it's a bad thing" type of watching. However, I really like this film because of its fun factor and - believe it or not - it's innovation. the direction most used by slapstick and stialised movements. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a lesson from the textbook on how to use the movement) and framed by some unexpected stars. do not enjoy it, but if you have the opportunity to watch it, then spare time because chances are you will finish a movie with a confused smile on your face, and a new look at the sense of humor of some big stars. Highli reccomended.
