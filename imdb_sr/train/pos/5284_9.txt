Father and son communicate very little. In fact, they speak different languages. When his son takes his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimage to Mecca, conversations are finally held. They are heavy and necessary growth in both parts. This movie takes us to the hearts of these two travelers, and it's really a great journey for the audience as well as for the two principals. The pictures are impressive, especially when it comes to final stages in Mecca. Once again, I underline how different the world can be, but at the same time, how similar it is. The same goes for a father and son in this movie. See this movie. Tell your friends to see him. You'll be glad you did it.
