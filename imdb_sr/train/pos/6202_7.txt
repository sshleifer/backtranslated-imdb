When I started to watch "Fai Grim," I had no idea that it was a continuation of "Henry Fool". This second was not a movie that I imagined as a sequel. But one has arrived, and it's pretty good. I guess you saw the original, so I'm not going to explain that. This starts with Fai (Parker Posei), who lives with her son with a dead hero (Thomas Jai Rian). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in prison. One day, the son was thrown out for bringing a pornographic toy into school. But this is not an ordinary toy. There is a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie. And this secret deepens deeper into the geopolitics of the "Syrian". Perhaps this does not reach the original quality, but it is certainly good to see what is happening in the world. And the end leaves the possibility for another extension. The main role is also Jeff Goldblum.
