This is the first movie I saw last year! It's awesome funny, incredibly original, incredibly great looking (they went for this great cool Technicolor screen that's great for watching) and actually has depth in character and what it says about society. It's a really smart satire that nails everything from homeland security to a race of questions while at the same time leaving you laughing and figuring out how much the world is living in fear. Carrie Anne Moss turns into a comedy show I never imagined would come from her! It's cute, fun and sexy! Billy Connolly is as good as Fido, who can only rush and roar! And Dylan Baker as a dad is invaluable. The fact is that the entire head is perfect. Henry Czerni as a bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor with a hot sexy zombie girl (now gets an idea?) Funny, though provoking and all amazing! Go and watch this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen.
