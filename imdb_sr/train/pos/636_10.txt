Why are the reviews so blah for a movie that's so awesome! Everyone needs to know what a great movie is. He is attractive and fun from a moment, genuine and well behaved. I'd like the film to act like a good journalist he deserves! For everyone who loved Princess Bride, Labirinth and other really fun and original fantasy adventures, this is one of the biggest. Robert De Niro is hysterical. Relatively newcomer Charlie Cock is an incredible leading man. Claire Today is as fantastic as ever. Michelle Pfiefer makes a big deal with her recent return to the screen. There are many wonderful moments of smaller characters ... even to the expression of the face.
