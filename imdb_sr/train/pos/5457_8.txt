This film is one of the more risky black and white films of this time, at the beginning of the 1930s, before Hoits' law was introduced. It's a story about how a beautiful young woman moved to New York and broke through to the top of a business using her body as a tool to get there. who really does his job well. Lily moves to New York and manages to climb into the office with sleep with all men. Stanvick performs extraordinary performance as a strong woman who uses men as a one-time arrangement, hardly any kind of emotion toward them is playing them as if they are pioneers. Lily Povers is a woman who does not like only power and money. I thought this film was somewhat different from other movies I saw because barely there was a background music listening. I believe that this is only because people are first introduced to live sound and dialogue between film people. Several times when music is heard at the beginning, while it shows how it breaks down with the chain. Shooting and different scenes were fantastic! The director of this film has made all the right angles and all the real tricks, making this film full of realism. This film was all fine movie. The ending of the movie was not so good. as it should, but it did not completely destroy it. Babi Face had his slow-moving scenes moving through the film, and maybe a few foreseeable parts like who he would sleep with next. But this is a nice movie that can be watched more than once, and it is suggested to some people and friends.
