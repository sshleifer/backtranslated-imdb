I married Japan 14 years ago. We're still together. However, during the 1950s it would never have been that easy. to this point. Ripped to death. Mixed relationships gave her a new foundation for covering. This is an old hat today, but then ...? Married to Asia, then it meant that you owe something to someone or that you were some kind of freak. This touches on both options along with the third. Maybe it's love? Brando has done his usual good job. Garner did a better job than usual. He's good, but this shows how good he is. Ume-chan had a fat debut here and although I think she earned her statue, she did not really stretch. It was a role that nobody would have recognized, who was not abroad, and the novice was a robber. The real thief of the scene was Red Buttons. Red was the best thing in this movie. Bank on it. And the Japanese lifestyle is also shown in a beautiful light. Classical.
