I love this movie! 10 of 10 hands! It's damn good! I'm not really a movie lover, but I have to tell you that this one opened my eyes. Stunning color and quick energy. I was lucky to get this on the Zoins projection! The film festival in Boston, and the story has taken me from the beginning. She had many topics and characters for adults, and when she finished, I wanted more. I hope he will make a sequel. That would be fun. My only problem is in the performance of Melissa Connor as Ania. UGH! She SUCKS! I saw a block of wood pulling out better performance. I do not know what the director was thinking when he threw it. But if you ignore it, you can not help but give this movie a great deal !!!
