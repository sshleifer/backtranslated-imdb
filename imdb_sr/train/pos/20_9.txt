"Stanley and Iris" show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it's a struggle to become literate and realize your potential. For Iris, it is to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the movie is the dance that Robert De Niro and Jane Fonda work together, starting and stopping, before each of them has the skills and courage to fully trust each other and continue on. In that sense, it gives us a very good look at how life is often, and it is credible. Unlike some other reviewers, I found signs that were displayed as consistent for the whole picture. Also, auxiliary guitar that adds the depth of character added by the main characters to the meaning of the accompanying performances is carefully selected. All in all, a great movie. The best thing I'm taking is Nada.
