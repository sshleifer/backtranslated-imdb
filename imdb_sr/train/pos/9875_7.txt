The introduction of Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a sweet film, but in my opinion it could have been better. Judy Garland is as brilliant as ever, but some of the scenes in the movie seem imminent, and the romance between her and Van Heflin takes place too fast. I mean, one minute is ready to fight, but in the next minute he falls in love with her. I believe that this production, the installation of the film and the scenario (although the photo was great, the beautiful scenery and the costumes were nice) could be a bit better. It feels like production has been exaggerated. Supported actors were also good, especially small Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter of Rosie's daughter. At age 11 she looks very sweet and it's a shame that she did not develop into a teenage comic actress. Much better in this movie than in previous films like Varner Brothers in the late 1930s (except for the Broadvai Musketeers 1938, she's really good at it) when they tried to turn into a hybrid Shirlei Temple / Sibil Jason. All in all, this movie could be better, but in the end, Judy gave it everything.
