"Kaabee" depicts the difficulties of women before and during the Second World War, raising children only after her husband was imprisoned for "crime of thought". The film was directed by Iamada Iouji, and it is expected that the atmosphere of this film is truly wonderful. Although the historical correctness of some of the scenes, especially the beach scene, is suspect. The acting in this movie is absolutely incredible. I'm confused how they managed to collect this actor for all 2008 movies. Ioshinaga Saiuri, probably the most amazing and still active actress in Japan, will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in the role was also good. However, Asano Tadanoob, who performed the most impressive performance, perfectly portrayed the witty character of his character and the difficult situation he was in. wonderful direction and acting, I was completely preoccupied with the story. Also, it was not far from left stupidity like "Iuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni", and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of the government's oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan. Excellent film, recommended to all viewers.
