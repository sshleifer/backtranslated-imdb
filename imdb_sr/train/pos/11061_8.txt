And I went through a very painful personal loss (Twice), and this film shows the good reality of this experience, life outside of balance, nothing makes sense, well relatives, etc. > It was nice to see Allie again. She is one of my favorite film actors. I laughed and cried as the story unfolded. Great story and cast. Good work!
