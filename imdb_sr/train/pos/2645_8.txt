No film has attracted my attention like this one. You see, I wanted to watch this movie again for twenty-five years. The only time I saw it was a teenager who might have been the year when it was published in 1977. so deep that there is still a huge desire to look back. The intrigue that this film provides to the human element of searching and searching for a father / son will surely touch every human soul he watches. Why this film is not pulled out of the warehouse and is shown as often as other films of less depth, I do not know. that my memory is true. Score reflects the content of the movie. Would you like to watch this movie on a DVD like this 1977 production on the used VHS tape to take away the overall quality.
