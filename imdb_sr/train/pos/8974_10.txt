Jiri Trnka cited his latest animated short film as an accusation of totalitarianism, which caused him problems in his native Czechoslovakia. The elements are few, symbolics are simple, and its trademarks are almost absent, allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fairy tale. A man in his room dedicates himself to ceramics and takes care of his only plant. But suddenly a huge hand came into the room and ordered him to make a statue. A man refuses and is pursued by an evil hand in his glove. Nowadays, when the impression of reality factors seems to have been deleted from most animations that are trying to replace the real world, it is refreshing to watch a movie, which makes its technique part of the enjoyment.
