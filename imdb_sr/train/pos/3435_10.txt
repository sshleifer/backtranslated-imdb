This film is a beautifully simplified work. Enjoy the beginning to the end and at the same time it's sad but at the same time it raises. Miranda Otto performs (oh, she deserves much more recognition!) And George del Hoia are beautiful, yet almost painful to watch, while two tortured souls come to understand each other. Supporting workers in the dead letter office are wonderful parts in them, such as Alisa's long-time boy, whom I could not help but feel sorry for me. There is a special scene I can watch (and I am!), It's so a shame that such films do not get recognition, and that's why they bring them to the public's eye so that more people can enjoy it. I cried, laughed and sighed. I would recommend this film to everyone.
