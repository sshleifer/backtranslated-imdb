I always liked the movie John Frankenheimer. Good scenario by Elmore Leonard and the main reason that it was not just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His tense direction and attention to small details make a difference, he even hired the porn star Ron Jeremy as an advisor! You can make the case that this is the last good movie made by Roi Scheider. I always said Robert Trebor gave an incredible performance. Clarence Villiams III got his publicity with his terrible performance and he was great, but I really thought Trebor pointed out. Frankenheimer may not be so proud of this movie as others, but an effective thriller is full of blackmail, murders, sex, drugs and real porn actors appear in sleek parts. What can you say about the film that Ann Margaret shot and raped? I'm pleased to say the least. Vanity has a real sleek role, and very young Kelly Preston appears early. A classic explosive thriller that should not be forgotten.
