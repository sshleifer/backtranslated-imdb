"Silverlake Life" is a documentary film and it was clear and clear. Actually, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic illumination, take a look at something else. And this is by no means a seeker. But I think it in a positive way. It shows two men who love themselves and how they are affected by AIDS's impact on the quality of their everyday lives. It's almost hard to say whether it was a quality movie or not, because he was so uncircumcised that I had to look for other ways to answer. It's a wonderful movie, actually one of the most beautiful, sincere documents I've ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity because their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. Hence, the production of hollow wood on AIDS is hip and soulless. These people made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to do something. The scene in which Tom sings "You are my sun" to Mark and tells him goodbye is the right thing.
