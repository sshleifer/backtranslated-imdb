I know Anime. I was in it long before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was even. And just so you know I do not praise myself, let me say this: from all the anime I've seen, Castle in the Ski is by far one of the best. It's obvious that people say that Spirited Avai is the best, but I really disagree. Most people know this film just because it is a prize for Acedmi; this is not an exaggeration - I showed Princess Mononoke and a castle in heaven to people who only saw Spirited Avai, and agree that the last two are superior to three. Personally, I never thought anything could be compared to Princess Mononoke until I finally saw the Castle in the sky. I still think that the predecessor is better than the two, but Castle in the Ski is easy on the same level; In many ways, Castle has the main elements that Mononoke lacks. In both cases, if you only saw Spirited Avai, and you think it's the best Miyazaki movie, be ready to shake your ground.
