A man in a white suit is one of those great comedies that Ealing did so well in the 40s and 50s. The plot is followed by a man who makes up a fabric that is neither dirty nor crushed. Of course, this is a great breakthrough in the textile world. However, things are not that simple, because the fabric will endanger the lifestyle of many people, including fabric manufacturers, fabric factory workers, and even an old lady who washes every week. A man in a white suit is a film about scientific achievements and a way in which they do not always help; as the old woman says at one point in the film, "Why can not scientists just leave things alone?" Like many Ealing comedies, this one star is Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to illuminate the screen with his presence (and literally in this film), but also manages to display his characters in a terrific and convincing manner. In this film he is appropriately dreadful, and he records the right atmosphere for his character; intelligent and ambitious, but a little naive scientist. Together with Ginis, The Man in the Vhite Suit also features Joan Greenwood, a deeply expressed actress who played with Guinness in the simple divine "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who would continue to play the role of Alfredo in Batman films. The acting in the movie is not always great, but it's always decent, and it fits with the movie. The man in the white suit is an intelligent, provocative and witty comedy with morale. Comedy is not always obvious and does not always work, but the film is not meant to be a film that causes laughter in the stomach, so it's forgiven. I recommend this film, in essence, to anyone who is a movie lover.
