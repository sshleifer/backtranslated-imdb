Busy Phillips put in a hellish performance, both comical and dramatic. Erika Christensen was good, but Busi stole the shov. It was a nice touch after the film The Smokers, in which Bush played, which was not so good. If Busi does not get any nomination for this movie, it would be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, see Home Room.
