Ses Cesar Montana To Revive Cebuano Film! Panaghoi with Suba is very good - he has a drama, action, romance and a scene that will make you laugh. While the story is not so original (love triangle - or not love of four angles, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as Lord), its presentation is somewhat cool, especially it uses the original language - bisaia for Filipino, nipongo for Japanese and English for American. This film will be one of the best Pinoi films this year. Take this!
