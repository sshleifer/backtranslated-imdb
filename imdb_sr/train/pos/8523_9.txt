I was a book lover since the third grade, so I watched the movie, read the sequel, and then watched a television show. It was a good performance by itself, and now as an adult I still enjoy the show. My only real problem was that I did not follow the book. The first time I saw him, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But it comes from a girl who owns the first addition to the book. But after a while, I decided to try again and ignore the book (similar to what you have to do with Harry Potter movies). I found a wonderful series! It was a clean cutting and something everyone could enjoy, just as many comedies as they all were. It's really nice! Clean and beautiful!
