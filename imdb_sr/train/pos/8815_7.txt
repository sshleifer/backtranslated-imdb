This collection of eleven short stories in a single movie is a great idea, and it represents some great segments, but also some disappointing surprises. On the basis of the September 11, 2001, tragic event in the United States, eleven directors were invited to give their approach to American tragedy. The result of most of them is not only the individual sympathy of the American people, but mostly intolerance in the world with different cultures and people. Ken Loach (UK) is the best segment on September 11, 1973 in Chile, when Salvador Alliende's democratic government destroyed dictator Augusto Pinochet with the support of the United States. Other excellent segments are those of Ioussef Chahin (Egypt) showing the intolerance in the world and the number of casualties that US governments have committed in different countries along contemporary history; and that of Mira Nair (India), which shows the true story of injustice and prejudice towards a Pakistani family, whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the United States, when he was indeed a hero. are pretty: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows that innocent Afghan refugee children are preparing a ruthless shelter against bombs, while their teacher tries to explain what happened on the other side of the world; Romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows the life of a couple in Nev Iork near the VTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) shows the effects of their war in a small location and a lonely widow's protest; Sean Pen is very poetic, showing that life continues; and the story of Shohei Imamure is probably the most impressive, which shows that there is no holy war but sorrow and shame. This African nation. The Amos Gitala segment (Israel) is very boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism. terrible, without any inspiration and certainly the worst.
