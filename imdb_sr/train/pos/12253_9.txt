This has long been one of my favorite adaptations of the novel in Austin. Although definitely not in the same category as the spectacular "Pride and Prejudice", "Emma" is a lively and relatively faithful TV version of Austen's novel - especially given its short length. The biggest change between novels and movies is good, because unnecessary snobbing which Austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with some much more similar Emma's character in the rest of the book. I thought that the selected characters that feature the roles are well selected. Kate Beckinsale walks with a fine line between femininity and social snob, with grace that is completely lost in the version of Gvineth Paltrow '96. Cute blonde Samantha Morton responds to her attitude and character, because the one who follows her role in previous characteristics replaces Harriet's knowledge in the book. The role of Mr. Knightley is, in my opinion, very good; and the seriousness and mild compassion that a hero has painted in a novel are present in this very neglected, luxurious film.
