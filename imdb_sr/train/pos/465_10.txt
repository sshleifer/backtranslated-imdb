Marlen Gorris became one of the world's greatest directors. This delicate, visually beautiful film is based on the story of Vladimir Nabokov and captures this irony well. John Turturro gives what I consider his best performance (I usually do not like him); and Emili Vatson is also brilliant. Well, worth seeing.
