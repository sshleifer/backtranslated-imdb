The line is, of course, from the Lord's Prayer - "Your Will will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven". Sweden, especially in its far north, is not my idea of ​​heavenly winter temperatures of 30 degrees C for me, but good people who live there doubtless think they are in God's land. The story is here known. Famous international musician Daniel suffers medical breakdown in the middle of his career, returning to a small village in northern Sweden where he was born. Convinced by the local pastor to help the church choir, he turns some incredible talents into a class rank, and they enter the competition held in Innsbruck, Austria. There are echoes (snows) of band "Brassed Off" Girls Girls and dancing "Full Monty". But, of course, he causes many emotional reversals because some of the oppressed villagers realize their value and fight their oppressors. He faces hostile husbands and all the suspicious pastor, but nothing but death will stop him. In spite of the slightly futile story, we also come across as many of the characters who meet as people rather than caricatures despite the fact that many of them are recognizable "types". I wondered if the woman-jaundice was unpunished for so long? Sweden is one country in the world in which such violence is quite discouraged (and he was a little younger than Daniel's youth), and the Puritan pastor with secret passion for women's magazines was a little stereotyped, but miraculously realized by Nicklas Falk . Michael Nikvist is simply wonderful as Daniel, a fragile but mobile musician, and there are some nice music, I was thrilled all over the two hours, and the ending is what you think about it, but it does not spoil you to say that Daniel accomplished what he wanted to do.
