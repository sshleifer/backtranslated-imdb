It can be said that this is a very good "sequel", better than the first action movie 101 Dalmatinac. He has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and a good slapstick! Cruella DeVil, who had some great therapy, is now a dog lovers and is very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, the owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once tried to kill, do not believe it. Others, such as Kevin Shepherd (the owner of the second shelter for dogs), believe that it has changed. In the meantime, Dipstick, with his partner, gave birth to three sweet Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... In the main role of Eric Idle as Vaddlesvorth (honeycomb makao), Glenn Close as Cruella and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, the name should be said) , this is a good family movie with excitement and a lot more! One of the downsides of this movie is that it has a lot of painful slapsticks, but not as extensively as the last movie. This is also more fun than the last movie. Enjoy the "102 Dalmatians" Enjoy! :-)
