Of all the reviews I read, most people were extremely difficult for Alexander. Neither Marie nor Veronica never seemed to desperately want to hold Alekandra, because he was only a little intelligent, though not intellectual, like most of us, however hard it was for anyone to admit. Alekandre has mastered his life, completely taken care of, gets and gives what he wants. girls allow it, the veronica loves sex, Marie is his patron. Is there anything wrong with this? Is someone in love? really? I do not think like that. Although the French New Vegas movie is prone to pretend, and so on, it's amazingly simple because of the lack of a need for complication to create an emotion. Simplicity is perfectly lovable and everyone in Alekandre's position, in the urban area can look for. Looking for a patron, anybody interested?
