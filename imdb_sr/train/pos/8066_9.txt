One of the best films of John Ford "Informer" has no great landscape of the American West. Instead, Ford's intense drama was famous for performances on the face of the inconsequential terrain of British actor Victor McLaglen. The former fighter of the award, who once faced Joe Louise in the ring, brings the spectacular performance of the disgraced IRA soldier Gipo Nolan on the worst night of his life. Dublin, a hungry and humiliated man who was thrown out of the IRA because he was unable to kill the informer coldly, and he himself became an informer. For 20 pounds he issues a friend "Tansu", and the rest of the night drinks and gives blood money in a quick alternate crying of guilt, denial, self-pity, and a desperate desire to avoid the consequences of his action. It is an extraordinary complexity that is given to the character of the seemingly simple Gipo, which is the most impressive achievement of the film. In most films, a large piece of Gipo would be thrown heavy, he would have the best two or three lines and would quickly be solved so that the hero and villain could have their bribe. In 'The Informer' Gipo is both a hero and a criminal, while clearing in his inner turmoil, every part that is explicitly shared with the audience. shot in 1929, RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. Director and his associates, especially cameraman Joseph H. August, they turned this into their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece of a man in a war with himself. In addition to McLagel's Oscar 'The Informer', he also won the first John Ford with victories for best screenplay and best result.
