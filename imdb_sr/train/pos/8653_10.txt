I just watched "California" on Shovtime for the fourth time since I first saw it in July 2001. You thought that, with a recent wave of serials, "California" would have been one of the earlier films. Worth it, but it's not. Perhaps this film was published somewhere between 1996-1999, maybe it was even more successful. In my opinion, "California" is much different from most of the serials that were killed in the late nineties. It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today's serial killer films such as "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many serial killer movies have shown the killer, but that person is always behind the mask, or we never see enough of them to find out about them. "California" is a movie that actually tries to break through this barrier and actually grasp the criminal. Trying to answer questions like "why are they doing what they do? Is it because of something that happened in their past? Does it make them feel superior or powerful? Or do they do it because they love the excitement of killing?" "These are some of the things California is trying to answer, but it leaves us room to try and invent things ourselves." Brad Pitt leaves a lasting impression as Earl Graice. When we first meet at the beginning of the film, we see that he is obviously one of the disturbed When he first sees it, it's too late in the evening, he's drunk early, then we see him taking a stone, throwing it off the bridge, and then landing on a windshield of a passing car, Pitt is furious in this movie. psychose or really bad people. It's ridiculous that he will bring him later you do a real madman as in "12 Monkeys" and will be on the other end of the spectrum in "Seven" by David Fincher.
