Playing as a kind of runner at The Great Escape sometime 13 years later, this brilliant little British movie is played without excitement and dares to be overdone. The first part of the film is the setting and subsequent escape of our protagonists, while the other part focuses on their survival while on the run while trying to reach Sweden. The film relies on pure characters with simple, effective, and yes, convincing dialogue that can bring it to the end, and achieves its goals nicely. No small amount of uncertainty does not keep the movie typing, and as an adventure story perfectly works for the timeframe that adheres, so a big thumb of the movie that could be the first of that type? 7/10
