I've seen it on TV so long ago that I can not remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the most horrible, the most adorable films I've ever seen. At the same time, there is a subtle, but intense fear caused by a woman in black on the edge of the frame, not quite clearly visible, so you feel (like a lawyer's hero), sure whether it's just his imagination or not. It's also one of the few movies that really frightened me to continue to watch. "Production values" are hanging, good films are about the director's ability to create an atmosphere using movies, actors, locations / sets, music, attention to detail, and ... imagination. A real gem.
