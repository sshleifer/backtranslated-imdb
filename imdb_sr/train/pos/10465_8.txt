Even so early in her career, Capra was quite successful with her work with the camera and his time. This is a thin story - and pretty predictable for moments - but he gets very good performances from his actor and has pretty tangled camera movements that intimately involve the viewer. The first part looks like a story about Cinderella, although anyone with a brain can see that the bottom will fall - a rich "prince" will lose his fortune. And at a fast pace, it's easy to catch clich√©s. Then the film becomes more original, because the couple must find a way to earn a living. The end is very predictable, but satisfactory. I also want to praise the writing of the title: very funny and fun.
