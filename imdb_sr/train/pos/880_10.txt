Probably the best movie of the year for me. This little French film focuses on the secretary of Emmanuelle Devos, who runs days doing other male jobs, dishonest, and as a source of their contempt and lunch talk, which is too clear to her, because she is partially deaf and reads lips. The change started when she hires newly-formed couples Paula (Vincent Cassel) as her assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the film. Interdependence, for very different reasons, connects them. Karl is attracted by Paul and the fact that he is appealing to what looks like the first time. Paul does nothing to free her feelings because she needs her help. He owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him, which will include Carls's lips-reading skills. I think that the main thing that pushes the film path above average uncertainty / drama is incredible chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the entire film, no matter what other characters on the screen, you can feel this incredible connection between Karle and Pole. I can not remember when I witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuel Devos gives a great performance (she won French Cesar for the best actress). You never feel like watching a part of the act, this is really Carla. Chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. He is a somewhat unattractive character and attractive and attractive. I loved this film because of these two people, and both times when I finished watching, I wanted to go back to the cinema and re-embark on them.
