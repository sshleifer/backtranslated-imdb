this short film is basically about Superman and Batman who work together and create an uncomfortable alliance. Obviously, these two characters have very different opinions on how to deal with crime and what constitutes a punishment. I'm not going to go on a story here. but I'll get into the acting, which is great. Everyone is thrown out well. The two actors who play Superman and Batman are well adapted to their characters. made by Batman: Dead End and Graison also made this short film of three, I probably liked this one at least, but I still thought it was done well.
