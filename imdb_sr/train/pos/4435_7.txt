This is a handy, small criminal drama, which greatly interferes with 65 minutes of work. He has all the right ingredients - a mysterious corpse, a tired middle-aged policeman, Corrigan (Valter Kinsella) and his novice assistant Tobin (John Miles), a mysterious killer at liberty, and even the love of Tobin in the form of Botanist Marie (Patricia Vright) solving of crimes. There is also a great finale that takes place in the yard of stone cutters. Take care of the brilliant flashback near the start of this film in which lieutenant Corrigan mentions a dead woman like 'Tatooed Tilly BEFORE the coroner discovered she had a tattoo (confusing?). And later, when Tobin ran the killer over the yard, he suddenly appeared in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he did not catch him!
