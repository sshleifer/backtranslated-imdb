This is a weird little movie, and I must agree that there are some strange things in it. Follow the adventures of a young man who decides he wants to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist, and in part about dreaming his dreams, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the shoving bouts. I thought the film was charming, and that there was a moment or two real magic that makes the whole thing worth the effort. funny and touching attitude. Probably not for everyone, but if you love travel videos, I think you will like this.
