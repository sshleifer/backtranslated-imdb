With such actors as Ralph Richardson, Raimond Massei, Cedrick Hardwick and Margaret Scott, you can make a mistake. Very unusual scenes, especially modern. The realization of modern mechanization is very efficient. Here you have explosions of paradise pistols from building a vehicle that help clear the area, so that new structures can be made. Although much younger in this movie, it's not hard to figure out who will be future Ms. Pumphrei from BBC Series, All Creatures Great and Small! Really effective "re-appearance" by Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The recording of the famous Swiss composer Arthur Honegger is also unusual. For the time (1936) it looks like they used really, great sets or effects that make it so. In the end, it's a really good story.
