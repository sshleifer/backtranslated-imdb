This is the repetition of many recent films, this one only has fewer stars, fewer complications and a vague sense. Abhai and Rita (played by Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol) meet at a friend's wedding, where their own marriage (regardless of them) begins the process of decoration. In a short time, two foreigners marry and go to a honeymoon camp where they meet with other couples who go through movements similar to theirs. While spending time together, secrets, broken hearts and / or correction and love of bloom are revealed. If you have seen Honeimoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishk, then you have seen this film. They are rotated the same, there is no element of surprise in all two and a half hours of film. Everything is predictable. I enjoyed only because I saw Darling before (also playing Deol & Khan) and enjoying their chemistry so I said 'why not' when my sister suggested that we rent 'Just married'. See: Because Kirron Kher is an actress and it's her usual soul in her. Skip: Because you've had enough of these nonsense! C +
