I remember I originally saw this movie at Radio Citi Music Hall when it came out. At that time I did not quite understand humor, but this film can laugh at me aloud. With all respect to George Burns (RIP), Valter Matthau really earned an Oscar for this movie. His performance is incredible - given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Villie Clark. His mannerisms are first class. ("You know what songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And when you talked to the guy who speaks Spanish at the reception: "No! No! No enchilada !!") Absolutely hilarious! Happily for Richard Benjamin, who played the right man for Matthau. I would just like it to be on DVD, because my VHS recording becomes a little old. There was no interest in remake with Voody Allen, because in no way can he match the original.
