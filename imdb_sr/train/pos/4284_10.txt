This film is one of the most entertaining, saddest and most precise depictions of the mentality that, apparently, rejoins the Balkans, 45 years after the time shown. All the common characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sorrow and love in combination that it is impossible to decide whether a weeping or a laugh would be a more appropriate answer. The accuracy of the display and the timelessness of the guys, however, make the big movie look if we want to understand a bit of what has bent on the former Yugoslavia to its madness. In fact, no diplomats dealing with the region should try anything until they see this movie, and its twin, * Marathonians, run a slow circle. * Did I mention that this is one of the happiest movies I've ever seen?
