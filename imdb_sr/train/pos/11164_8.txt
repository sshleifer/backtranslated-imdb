In Brooklyn a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their volunteer fire brigades leads to Brodie's famous bets that he can jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be known to many people through the cry of Bunny Bunnia, Boveri Bugs from 1949. This generally pleasing film would probably be more widely available if it were not a notorious and disturbing scene involving some Chinese tenants - a time capsule of pre-emptive racial attitudes, which gives the film a great interest in history, in my opinion.
