Many of the criticisms and comments I have read about this film say that this was pretty much aroused by the movie and performance of Clare Bov. Although the story was pretty typical of Clarina's later silence, she still seems a bit exciting and incredibly entertaining. Clara plays a happy Hawaiian girl who will not stand anything to win the man she loves ... it does not matter what this man is married! Clarin's lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but I believe it gives the sweetness and general fun of the film. Although definitely not a brilliant story (pretty typical, in fact), this movie is a nice showcase of Clarina's ability to smile at the audience.
