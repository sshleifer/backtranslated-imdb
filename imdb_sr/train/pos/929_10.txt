Father Pride was the best new show that appeared on TV from Familia Gui. This is another masterpiece of talented people in Dreamvorks animation. Like the Simpsons, the show is around the nuclear family (in this case white lions). It also contains many unforgettable support signs, including Roger, Oscars, Vincent, Italian-American flamingos, eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, fake patriotic brothers and Chutnei elephants. Other stars are Sigfreid and Roi. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose way, making the most fun activities fun. The combination of sweet animal characters with very open dialogue and controversial issues (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the brilliance of the program. The crash for the failure of this show lies in NBC. They decided to broadcast episodes without a certain order (perhaps under the influence of which guest stars can promote) rather than a more logical production order. Several times, the show was excluded for an extra half hour of such shit as the biggest loser (as if 60 minutes was not enough)! It's a really bad sign for the future of television as an art if the original and bold performance like this fails, while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. Fortunately, the complete series has been released on DVD and the show now has the opportunity to get bigger followers. 10/10
