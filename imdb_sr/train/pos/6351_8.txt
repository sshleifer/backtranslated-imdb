When Grinch came out, I was excited, although I thought it would be a happy movie and it was. Although he had a little nightmare before Christmas, he touched it. You know, it's kind of dark and spooky. I loved this film because it helped fill people with Christmas spirit. So Grinch mostly saved Christmas. And what happened in Wohwiew then said that Grinch's little heart of that day had three sizes. MERRI GRINCHMAS!
