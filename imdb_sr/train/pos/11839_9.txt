This movie was very funny. Soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. More impressive is that Brian Adams is doing all the songs in French. Score is also exciting and dramatic. The film is made from a mixture of traditional animation, combined with computer-generated images. The result is truly amazing. I watch this movie at least once a week with my children and we never get tired. The story is tempting and well-told. I do not understand anyone who would rank this film less than 7. Definitely a guard in my household.
