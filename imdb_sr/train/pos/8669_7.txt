If, unlike some other commentators, you do not lead a class war and you can not watch the lives of other people who are rather successful, extroverted, bohemian (sighing) and not terribly English at fun and getting into all the troubles as a result it's not a bad movie, closer Euro cinema rather than imitation of the usual smooth American shit ... I believe that the minimal sound design and the cheap camera are aware of the decision, not the bad movie, to defend this, the film is no worse than that, and it puts the actors at the center of attention, of which some really good (Kate Hardie - Thoughts that's her name, because it is sarcastic drunk on the spot) One exception is David Baddiel, who should never be allowed to appear in serious things !! It's bright and we're not going to this kind of crap about anatomy of a relationship in this country, but if you do not have real friends to go to a party than you could do worse than sitting and watching This.
