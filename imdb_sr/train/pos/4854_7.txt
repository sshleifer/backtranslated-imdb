Get together with this in the dark and stormy night and prepare to alternate, rush and scare you alternately. A creaky old plot of a phantom train that is said to pass through a lonely English nature at night can be amazing, but it's fun. There are some beautiful old clich√©s like "THE ACCIDENT", which the local people can remember, but they will not talk about them. But primarily film is a means for comedian Arthur Askeia to present his special humor style of humidities between terrible parts. Askei's humorous humor these days is not very trendy, but if you allow it to wash, it can be fun. This is probably the best of Askey's films.
