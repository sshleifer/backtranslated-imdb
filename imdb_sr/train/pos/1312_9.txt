Chasing this in the column, this was a great movie. The acting performances were great and the script was as excellent. Helen Hunt was magnificent as a Riverside Gina Pulaski cop. Gina was a complex character. She was the newest police officer in the Riverside Police Department. She ended up in an affair with an associate whom she knew to have a wife and children, as she took on the dangerous task of going to a secret mission to seize a serial killer. Jeff Fahei (Rai Liotta looks similar) did the job as a confused, often stuttered policeman who had an affair with Gin. He was stoic as an officer, but he was completely opposite when it was about his feelings and his extramarital affair. Steven Weber, especially from the "Wing" sitcom, is not a nice job as a quiet, meek, poor sociopath. On the surface, he was an innocent loser, but a cold-blooded murderer was lying beneath the surface. Weber really took the personality of a young boy with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys. The whole movie was spectacular. Every scene, each verbal exchange gives us more information about the characters. The production team has done a phenomenal job with condensing days, if not weeks worth of events in a 90-minute movie. This film was a good example to do a lot with a bit.
