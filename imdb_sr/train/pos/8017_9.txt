After they were missed to produce it, they all split up and went their separate ways. I love the characters and the cameos. The songs in the movie are "Together Again," "Look at me, here I am", "Say hello," "I'll always love you", "Rat Jazz" and "He will make me happy." Frank Oz excellently directs this The movie and all actors do a great job by playing the Muppets real, seeing it 91 minutes.
