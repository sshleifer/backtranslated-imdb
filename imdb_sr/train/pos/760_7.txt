I did not see this film since the late 80's and I decided to pick up his VHS version. The action is very slow and the actors are almost robotized in this breakdance flick. Music, hip hop / freestile artists and breakdancing scene are what makes this movie special. Breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in Breakin, but I must say that "Breakin '1 & 2" brings energy and excitement to the screen much better. It's a movie I'll keep in my library, but it's not a movie that I can watch again, just once in a blue month.
