Pushing marijuana is truly a landmark in television as a form of art. Everything seems to be honoring Amelie and Tim Burton, but then, in a world where fresh ideas are extremely rare, this show will guarantee that you do not care if it's fresh or not. It's just Brilliant. I was captivated from the very beginning, intelligent writing, background directing and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece of The Shield and The Vire (ok not really good comparison but the beauty of Pushing Daisies is that there is no comparison on the television. Really addictive and absolute satisfaction. Perhaps as one of the Piemakers pie which is being mentioned in such a tempting way.
