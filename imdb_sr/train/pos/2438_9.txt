This was a gem. An incredible acting starring with Liam Cunningham, Orlean Brady and all the auxiliary actors. The film launches not only the theme related to the history of Ireland and Ireland, but also to many communities around the world and many of the marital units within these communities. The intensity and sincerity of the film shows that religious beliefs and traditions have caused a wedge in love and passionate family. The title "Love divided" could not better capture it. Although it was a true story and an event in Ireland since the 1950s, the life of an entire village eroded and began "pogroms" to remind me of Russian history. Intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately they are deeply hidden within human nature. As in the movie, the figure of Liam Cunningham says "hate was always under the surface". It was interesting to watch the moral choices people made in this story. Also, the character of the Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was quite significant. The story, however, gives hope that the love of two people can win everything, and love makes us better, stronger. The character of Liam Cunningham is going through the whole transformation during the story becomes the man he always wanted to be. Again, the acting is superb. The story is fast. The Irish village is as beautiful as ever. Recommended.
