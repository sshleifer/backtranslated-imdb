Just the movie I love. Some very good British actors, as well as one and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates a well-educated group of human lives, playing on their weaknesses to gather experience to write a book of the mystery of murder. She plays the female psychopath quite well while using her full sexual attraction to convincingly show what can be considered one of the ultimate Black Vidos. Tramel is used in dark places in society and freely participates in sadomasochistic flings in 'never visit after the dark side of the city. From the very beginning, there is nothing less than R rating from the dialogue itself. The stone can also be described as a kind of female Hannibal Lecter, a senseless femme deadly without a meal plan.
