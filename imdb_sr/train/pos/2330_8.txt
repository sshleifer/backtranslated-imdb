This show is good. I love acting, funny things and beauty. Actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc, all were excellent in the show. The show began great with its funny, illogical basic idea of ​​returning dead people to the first series and honestly, as people said, the first few episodes of the second series were a little lowered, but later returned as good as it was. And now I really hate the fact that it will be canceled. Why ABC does not allow it to end until the end when all the episodes are already finished? I really want to know how the story will be. I think that they should be given the chance because there are still so many spectators who love it.
