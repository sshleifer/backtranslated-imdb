This was a good movie. It was not your typical war movie, but something a bit different. This film showed us recruits on training before the war, not in the war. This film is one of the more realistic views of war and army from most other films. Colin Farrel did an excellent job in portraying army recruits and Clifton Collins Jr. and Matthews Davis contributed relatively well. Seeing that Colin Farrel moved from class to class in a few short years, you would never have thought that this would happen. I will also add that the creators of the tigerland made a great job in filming the film in 2000 and that it seemed to be a good touch in the 1970s. It is good to see that the talent is wisely used and I hope that I will see this same talent again in the near future.
