The British horror film was in a terminal decline until the early 1970s, but three came out of the darkness that were among the best that our island produced. Vickerman, the Blood on Satan's Claw, and the House that Threw Blood made the future pink, although many people knew that by that moment there would be no. THTDB has a cast type that can easily form a wish list, if it has not actually been compiled, in the gloomy hinterland of 2008 you may expect to wake up. The vaccine is the most overlooked of the four stories and, of course, my favorite, Cushing's life and art are interconnected so firmly that you can not tell where the results are ending and the pain begins. It can only be assumed that this role has affected such a gentle, sensitive man. Death and a girl. RIP Peter.
