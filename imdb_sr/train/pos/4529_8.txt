As is well known among long-time young people who are incredibly interested in the silent speech of Herr Graaf, during the summer aristocrats like to travel to exclusive and prominent places to avoid the heat, as well as hordes of rude people who take their ease. Such bizarre journeys all over the world take place in the "Three Centuries", the charming and elegant part of the quiet work of the director of the old hands, namely Herr Buster Keaton and Herd Eddie Kline. It is obvious that this German number most liked the first segment was centered on the Stone Age because of the affinity that this aristocrat felt in that ancient time. preferring this to another segment that happens during the glory of Rome (It should have included the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, that is, Varvara, or the same thing, the Germans). Of course, the third segment is unfolding in modern times, but this aristocratic aorist believes that he should qualify as a modern one 100 years ago. The leitmotif that drives Mr. Keaton and his companions to travel and endure strange and hilarious events at three different times is a quest for love, a very complicated topic for understanding aristocrats who prefer a search for money and their own interests. Every time the "Three Century" is displayed in the Schloss Theater, it's always a pleasure to watch a funny, witty silent movie (even for a serious German countess), opus full of gags and gadgets, games, games and acrobatics, visual and astounding technical tricks, absolute silent delicacy that is perfect for bringing various and rough summer rigors. Now, if you allow me, I must temporarily leave because this German Count must flirt with an old Theotonian heir, which does not seem to be years old.
