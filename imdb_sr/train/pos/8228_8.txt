It's hard to say something more about this movie without breaking it. I enjoyed it because I did not expect what I see, but a regular sexual drama so .... It's a psycho-sexual thriller, in which nothing is what it looks like. In it is Emmanuelle Seigner, who is not a stranger in the genre (and the nakedness) in which her husband, Polanski, sent. And a nasty performance (I said creepy / yes CREEPI) from Toreton (actor Bernard Tavernier). It seems that Pascal Bruckner meets with Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), like Chabrol lost or Clouzot thriller (I saw someone who mentioned Les Diabolikues), but closer to Georges Franju's Les Ieuk sans Visage (Eyes without a face, Kum Dr. Phibes and more). A gem! I'm afraid this will set on this in Hollywood remake like they did with Nighvatch and The Vanishing.
