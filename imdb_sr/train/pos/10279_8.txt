Rich Psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and feels bad about her profession that she hopelessly helps patients. A young client of gambling addicts asks him to help pay off his debts if he really wants to help him get better. He intertwines with Joe Mantegn here. To discover more than complications, a funny movie would ruin, and 'House of Games' could be the best movie I've ever seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem that is full of dialogue, great liners, and enough turns to guess to the end. Crouse is as perfect as a psychiatrist who wants to change, and Mantegna at the top of her as a devilish crafty man. And with the exception of coincidence in the last quarter of the film, the film is in complete control of its audience; and we love kon. *** from ****
