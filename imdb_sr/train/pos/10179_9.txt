De Grot is a very good movie. A great contribution comes from the novel by Tim Krabbe, who adjusted this story to the screen. Some really exciting actings, not just Van Huet, but especially Marcel Hensem, who mostly worked on TV before Akel van de Graaf was taken. It turns out that the film turns into a thriller and gives a great mood. Then we begin to learn about Egon Wagter and Akel van de Graaf, and the story reveals little by little in a very attractive flash-back structure, which adds a more romantic aspect and dramatic character to the film. In the end, all this culminates in an emotional end, which will capture the audience with their throats. Make sure you know as little as possible about the action when you see this movie. You must see, especially if you liked 'Spoorloos' (the original adaptation of the Vanishing screen).
