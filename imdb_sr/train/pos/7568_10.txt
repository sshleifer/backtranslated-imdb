I saw this last day at the festival, and I was glad I was staying for a few extra days. Poetic, mobile and most incredible, funny, in its strange way. So it is rarely seen that directors work in this style, who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper-realistic world, without looking precious or disturbing the balance. It seems to be improvised, but still completely controlled. I'm reluctant to compare, because these filmmakers have really digested their effects (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... common suspects) and found their unique style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (Linne Ramsai, David Gordon Greene) , you're right. This is a wonderful movie and I hope that more people will see it. If this movie is playing at a festival in your city, go! go! go!
