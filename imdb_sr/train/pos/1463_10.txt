Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a beautiful, tangible link between popular culture, nudity and globalization through the creation and throwing of pearls. I saw this film at the Boston International Film Festival, and I was expecting too much an introduction to globalization, but what I got was an attractive visual display of shocking shots from China and the United States. The film that opens your eyes is witty, deep, serious, non-patronizing, and leaves you want more as a loan role. It's worth comparing with Murderball - it's just done well. Young female workers in China have different views, and the owner is stunningly open on discipline. The revelers during the carnival are the highlight, but only because this excellent film provides a deep-rooted context inside the factory in China without narration. Bravo director to come in and finish the movie! I would never think of the connection between beads, China and New Orleans; Now I'm thinking about the human connection between almost every object, but also the role of globalization, inequality and fun. More importantly, I can make these links without feeling guilty after watching this movie, unlike other films about globalization that I have seen.
