I do not understand. Without criticizing, I do not evaluate the quality of the acting, which I think is credible, a good thing. My confusion lies in the content. No one else is sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women justified their disbelief in the people who fought and bleed to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and the country. Should not there be a prologue that would inform us whether the men arrived home and, if so, what effect did they have disbelief? And as those women reached their lovers in the sense of loneliness, did they think that their husbands enjoyed when they were shot every day while facing death or decay? They did not even mean their husbands! Just for yourself. Excuse me, except when they wanted their husbands to die.
