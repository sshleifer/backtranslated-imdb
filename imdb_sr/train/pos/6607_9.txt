I almost gave him 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing sections as well as sections that are wrong and affect the stream / continuity of the movie. The story is brilliant and well composed; you will certainly want to look at this quietly so you can fully understand it. The characters are complicated, as well as the story, they expect to get enough information to stop scratching their heads, that is, a film that is finally explained. The animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir results in a brilliant film that is similar to everything I saw in animation. It is a black and white film and its dark darkness in several scenes, so it's worth watching it on a good T.V., or plasma. The character's voices guard this film in his English version, but it would be more convincing that there are some French accents that emphasize that what is happening in Paris, I enjoyed more in French with English subtitles. One whole of its worth is worth buying on a DVD or BlueRai if it has it! And personally, if you enjoyed this movie, you might like it; The awakening of life and spirit in the shell 2 Innocence, this is only a personal proposal.
