This movie is great! This movie is wonderful! Finally, a film that shows Muslims as PEOPLE, there is no stereotype here. This film is powered by stories, acting and above all topics, cultural affirmation and discovery. They can look like clich√©s, but they're not, at least not in this movie. The view of the Great Mosque of Mecca is absolutely incredible and the audience gets a look at the side of the Muslim world that is rarely ever seen in the West. Here people are caring, supportive, devout, tolerant and dedicated to each other. What a welcome and exaggerated departure from the common negative views of the Arabs. Outstanding film.
