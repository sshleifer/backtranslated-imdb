This is one of the best movies of Jamie without the opera friends Sammo Hung and Iuen Biao, has one of the best openings in any action movie and continues in this way with Jackie who shows some high quality. the middle becomes a bit slow but appears for the frenetic for the last 25 minutes in the film, and finally it's clear that the crazy fool Jackie Chan is just holding us on film addicts
