This was made for the television version of the legendary attitude against hopeless looks that it is more objective, more realistic than earlier recorded versions of the event, although a film made after that may have gone too far in the humanization of the figures of Sam Houston, Bovie, Travis and Crockett. The focus is here on Jim Bovie, who played with a crisp, cynical shift from James Arnes, who is obviously still alive at the age of 85. Then 65, returned to acting after years of screen. Raul Julia, born in Puerto Rico, humanizes General Santa Ana, as no one has done any of J. Carol Naish '54. However, the Mexican dictator was portrayed as a ludicrous, bold, pop-gaudier uniform that had never been seen before. He receives excellent advice from the European officers he hired, but, being convinced of his own infallibility, he does not pay attention to it. Alec Baldwin is an actor whose age is appropriate to the character that plays: Col Villiam Travis. His portrait is serious. It's almost awe-inspiring for the older men who share the command with him. The only heavy note was Brian Keith as Crockett. In the hood of a mole and wears Ol 'Betsy, he stumbles as if he was out of another movie. Without a belief in a portrait, the character is reduced to several stages of the convention. The scenario reveals some historical facts that are ignored or suppressed in earlier film versions. We learned that Jim Bovie, in the Santa Ana person, fought with his brother-in-law. The Mexican soldiers were bad, partly because they were armed with rifles left by the Napoleonic Wars for a generation earlier. "Santa Ana likes a deal." Bovie explains. The entire defense project of the former Spanish mission as a fort was militarily bad - a fact that was deeply researched in the 2004 film "Alamo".
