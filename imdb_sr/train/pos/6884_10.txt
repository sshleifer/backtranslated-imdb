This movie miracle is one of those movies that have a lasting, long-term effect on you. I read a review or two of the angry people I suppose are either Republicans or children's beaters, and their extremist statements speak of the power of movies to deal with people with their darkest secrets. No such work of art has ever combined laughter and tears inside me, and that's the miracle of the film. The realism of the film and its performance by Brett Carr should not be missed. The very nature of its almost interactive effect will cause people to leave the theater or release or question their identity. Bravo at the next level of the movie.
