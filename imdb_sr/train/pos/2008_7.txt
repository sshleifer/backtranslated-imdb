The original Vampires (1998) are one of my favorites. I was curious to see how the continuation will work, since they did not use any original character. I was pretty surprised how this is happening. As a rule, sequences are never as good as the original, with few exceptions. Although this was not a great movie, the writer kept the main themes well and the vampire surrender from the first in a clock. Jon Bon Jovi was initially a drawback, but turned out to be half-decent Slaier. I doubt anyone else could do the climax of James Vood in the first one, although ... if you do not bring Buffy! > I have two questions left, but ... what happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a killer? It looks like we have to give it up to imagination.
