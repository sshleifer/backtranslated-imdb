'Cri Freedom' is a film about how many people will go to find the truth. The first half is an interesting display of an unusual friendship between activist Steve Bick and editor Don Voods (fanatically played by Dezel). Washington and Kevin Klein). While the other half deals with Voods in search of answers about Bick's death. Although most people prefer the first half of the movie that focuses on the incredible friendship between Biko and Voods. In the second half of the year, I found that Don forests struggle to hear Biko's story around the world much more interesting.
