I would not call "We are back! The story of dinosaurs" just as a children's version of "Jurassic Park". It was more interesting to me than that. Like the first one, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one age into our own. But it really opens my eyes when I see who voted: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jai Leno, Valter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Ieardlei Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase this: a certain actor, Cheers wife, host of Tonight Shov, the most trusted name in the news, famous chef, Ioung Frankenstein chief of police, Lisa Simpson, one of three Amigos and CNN guy. But I guess I should not focus only on the actors. I thought this film had something for children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). True, it's escapism, but perceptive. I would actually say that John Goodman, who is doing Rex's voice here, is some sort of predecessor to his work at Monsters Inc. Worth watching.
