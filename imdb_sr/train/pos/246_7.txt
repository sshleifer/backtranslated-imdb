How can I miss the opportunity to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not do it, I rented this mess of film. I never heard of Ned Kelly and I was surprised by what I learned about the legend of this young man. I was surprised how much this film was central. Maybe it was very, very late and at the end of a four-hour movie marathon or maybe because it's really a bit slow, this story is hard to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it's slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. Although trying to recommend this as a must, this is a great story about Australian history (considering how young a country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film has some sequences of good actions . 6/10 look for historical value .... (yes yes ... and that's the only reason to see it ...;))
