"Everyone in the world is a stage and her people are actors in it" - or something like that. Who, to the devil, said that the theater was stopped in the orchestra cave - or even at the door of the theater? Why are not the audience involved in the theater experience, including the story itself? This film was a great experiment that said: "Hey! your active participation." "Sometimes we bring you a story, sometimes you have to go to the story." Unfortunately, nobody he did not listen, but that does not mean that he should not have said.
