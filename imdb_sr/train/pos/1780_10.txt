My mother and I were returning home from the road to the northeast (mostly in Massachusetts) when we decided to take a little turn to the Boston Film Festival. Now, I do not know much about the film, so I thought it could be a little educational. The first film we've seen is this, ROMEO DIVISION. Now, I do not know about you, but I thought this was great! I'm from Texas and where we come from, we do not see too many movies, so it was a pleasant surprise. My mother claimed that it was too violent, but said that I did not know much about what she was saying, but this was a great picture. I was shocked by the fighting sequences that were great. Also, I am a big fan when the good guys win, so I was thrilled when Romeo ladies killed all the bad guys. It was a true brightness. I'm not sure when it will appear on the video, but if you have the opportunity to check it. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. The word wise, however, is quite violent and has many curses, so you may not want to let your kids watch. It's more for adults.
