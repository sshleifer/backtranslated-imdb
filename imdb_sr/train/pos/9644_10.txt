I'll give you that straight ... this movie is incredible. foreign gay films have so far surpassed American gay films in acting and story production. While many American indie gay films are grainy, bad sounds, amateur acting, dashing stories, and the surprising lack of any nudity or eroticism, top-of-page gay movies appear like this from France. cinema is beautiful, thoughtful, meaningful. the story is adult and complex (but it's not difficult for someone to follow), the acting is intense and professional. Both guides are fantastic, as are all the acting. boys are more than just handsome and have a lot of complete nudity. Follow the whole year for these guys, from their meeting to the end. all the small nuances of relationship, the details of the fall, and out of love, there are beautifully performed there. left me to want more. Take a look at!
