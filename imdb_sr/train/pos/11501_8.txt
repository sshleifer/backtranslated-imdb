I remember these performances a little, but I remembered it was great! My eldest brother, he reminded me of the show recently and saw the advertisement for D.V. The net, again, screwed to pull this out of the air so that they could put something else in that place? It should have been at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? Sometimes I think the network managers think they are "gods" of the world of entertainment. But they mistakenly presume and occasionally miss good placements. Let's say they have a lot more flops than 'hits'. It was one of the bad decisions to get out of the squad. Anyway, I get this for my collection.
