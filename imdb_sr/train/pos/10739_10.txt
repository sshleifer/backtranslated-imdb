Amazing documentaries. I saw it on the original airdate and on the DVD several times in the last few years. I was shocked that he was not even nominated for the best documentary for 2002, the year he was published. No other documentary is near. Recently it was on television for the fifth anniversary, but I eventually missed the added segment "where they are now," except that I caught Tony now working for the Hazmat unit. I saw the criticism on the documentary of the few on this list. I do not see how it could have been different. They had less than 6 months to collect it and get it in the ether. The DVD contains more materials and wallpapers. I'm surprised that, according to IMDb.com, the brother had no projects in the past four years. What did they do?
