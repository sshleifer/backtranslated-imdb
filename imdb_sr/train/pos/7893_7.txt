I guess I'm part of the silent minority that enjoyed this movie. Is this one of the best series "Nightmare"? Maybe not, but I've had a lot of fun with that. Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, wise potential. Since parts 4 and 5 were behind the series, I felt that this so-called final show ("The New Nightmare" was the real finale) brought the series out of its fall. There are some great sequences from the nightmare, including the one in which Breckin Meier plays a stoner that breaks, falls asleep and stuck in a video game controlled by Freddy. This is a very original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see it from dreams, jumping around like Super Mario. And Freddy says a funny "liner", "Excellent graphics." And since the film was filmed 10 years ago, he returned memories when Freddy began controlling the game with Poverglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Poverglove. Cast is great. Lisa Zane is perfectly in the lead. I have not seen Iaphet Kotto ever since "The Running Man", and I think I last saw this movie 5 years ago. He is another great actor who has a strong presence on the screen. And who can forget the dragons? The best of them is Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare"), who plays a spokeswoman for the anti-drugs advertisement. The 3D sequence in the end is truly brilliant! For those who want to read this movie - rent it or buy it on DVD! I hope all editions come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video edition has a 3D element removed. I personally did not see much in the movie. He even worked out Freddie's story. The film is a great combination of humor and fear, and brutal effects are great. Did this give a better franchise? Of course it can. But Rachel Talalai did a good job. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. And finally, I loved installing through introductory loans. Lovers of the series will be delighted, and will watch him as a tribute to the beloved Freddy. My score: 7 (out of 10)
