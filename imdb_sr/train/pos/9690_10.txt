My thought frame changed immediately when I was soon fascinated by the movie. It's rare that you've found a family movie that is thorough and can be crafted "hello".

She told a story about a young girl (Marie) and her best friend, Paulie Parrot, who was incredibly able to talk to her and often held talks. Mary's admirable father-in-law felt that this was incredible, and she thought that Paulie was damaging the mental health of her four-year-old daughter and quickly disassembled them. We follow Pauli's adventures (and misfortunes) as he tries to reconnect with his beloved owner, meeting many unforgettable characters on the road. Oh yes, Paulie really could (smart) talk and had a quick accent in Nev Jersey. Cool. The action was dense and fun, keeping me attractive. Paulie is the best family movie I've ever found and enjoyed. Ever. Seriously. Take a copy and sit and enjoy a real family movie, with your whole family. No sleeping. I promise.
