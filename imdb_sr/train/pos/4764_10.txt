There are some comments about this film which say that he is bad and stupid and that he is an excellent actor like Pierre Fresnai should not have accepted to act in it. I think, quite the contrary, even when the film is weird and has some weaknesses, the appearance of Pierre Fresne is so frightening that the movie turns into something great. Its performance is probably the best in history. The film itself has a very controversial scene about consecrating wines in cabaret. For someone who does not believe he is a priest? Even one defrocked? can turn it into Christ's blood, the scene may be bizarre. But for someone who is raised in a Catholic framework, he is very emotional, even quite unpleasant. The scene of the death of a young priest is terrible shocking. But that's very good. Pierre Fresnai turns a crazy act of murder into something that is understandable within the timid madness of his character, the martyr took Moranda away in this terrible way back to her office.
