This film, although over 70 years old, is still a very mobile, powerful movie. Bette Davis, as a slut, the evil Cockney waitress Mildred is absolutely convincing. Watching her performance is still spellbinding. It makes the observer absolutely despised and pitied at the same time. Leslie Howard's performance as a weak, obsessed Phillip Carey is not that strong, but I do not see how any actor could keep up with Mrs. Davis's performance. She chews a scene in every scene she's in, a completely slashing show. This is a movie that sealed her fame and she deserved to win Oscar, but lost. It's shocking for the day when it comes to the issues of infertile pregnancy, multiple sex partners, and Mildred's bad language, so something is outdated, but still an excellent movie. Just to see the scene where Mildred told Phillip what she really thinks about him ("You cad, dirty pigs ...") is still some of the greatest performances I've ever seen on the movie.
