I admit that I had no idea what to expect before watching this stylized work. It could have been a cure for a zombie virus or a cold for everything I knew. It started with great visuals, small clips that would attract your attention and provoke the wilderness of your imagination. As I continued, I quickly learned through the voices that had taken place. The beautiful little neo noir story I felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time. Small clues to the audience through visual effects at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment while compiling a plot. Together with a fine twist in the end, his package is great. The result, though not bad, gave the movie almost a sense of music video. He simply felt a little obsolete, not adding anything that would contribute to the development of the story. Some of the performances were too dramatic, but they fit perfectly with the feeling of the whole part. I am very satisfied with this. I got a lot of information for a short period of time, but due to great editing and voice work, I did not feel rushed or pushed. Great job!
