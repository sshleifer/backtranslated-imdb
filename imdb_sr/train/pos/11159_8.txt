This is a wonderful movie ... The first impressions of cynicism and rudeness are soon scattered with fun showing how men and women differ (Vive la difference!) You can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses. Human beings are really garbage, but we have big hearts and we try the best we can, despite the temptation. It's not our fault when we can not resist the temptation at times, that's exactly what we are. There is constant elegance from the beginning to the end; sharp pictures and sharp composition, very pleasant viewing when adding provocative content, well-tuned music and laughing out loud. Take care of a very young "lonely voice" ... glossy; wisdom from innocence, balancing comedy from a human condition.
