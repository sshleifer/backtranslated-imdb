After watching a rather messy spy thriller VV1, Madam Lily (1969), starring Julie Andrevs on TV today, I suddenly thought I saw a far better spy thriller VV1. The only thing I could remember is that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. It took only a short search for IMDB to find Fraulein Doctor. When I recognized the title, memories came back. This is, for the time being, a fairly well-made story that revolves around true events such as the death of Kitchener and the German offensive from 1918. She also has a female spy who is much more convinced than Julie Andrevs! As with other reviewers, the first and strongest memory was on well-produced battle scenes of men and horses in gas masks. If you are interested in war films, especially for VV1, it's a movie worth seeing if you have a chance.
