I got this film from Netflik after a long wait, so I really expected him when he arrived. The worst fears were that it would be plodding, as well ... well, you know what all the screams of the cheerleaders were chattering? GACKTnHIDE = havt iaoi love? Stuff like that? Dreading it. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The film was surprisingly visible, even if recording and music made it feel as if someone would cast some honorable launchers of every two scenes, and acting on Gackt was pretty good. Hide, who, um, Hide, acted as a quasi-romantic figure who was a member of the band / gang, and anyone who saw him on the stage could hardly be surprised. He's one of my two main beefs with the film itself. But the rest of the actors (including actors in the introductory scene) were very good at doing what they did - which was mostly shot and shouted. But my other problem was very small, related to burning. It seemed to me to be too restrained - a horror for me - like any scene in which someone was shot, or crashed, really sincerely dead, or lying there for a long time. But Sho just ... takes photos, repeatedly, over the keel, bubbles LOT while talking, and makes Hide to cry. All in all, if you are a fan of an actor or just a j-movie fan, it's certainly worth watching.
