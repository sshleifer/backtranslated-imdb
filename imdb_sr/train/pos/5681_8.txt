I had no problems with the film, which I thought was pretty good. It's the real video of the LAPD crime that upset me. I wonder if the Lion's Gate really thought the viewers would watch people who were brutally beaten to death and blood everywhere. I'm sorry, Lion's Gate, this was an INCONNECTIVE LADY IDEA. Returning to the film: The actors were excellent, especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes. John Holmes was a spleen, abused women in his life (Lisa Kudrov as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and he is hopelessly deep in drugs. His relationship with Eddie Our (Erik Bogosyan) creates a spiral that resulted in notorious murders in the land of miracles. How Holmes is involved in the murders? Perhaps we will never know the whole truth of the story (Nash is still alive and free man), but the film works pretty well.
