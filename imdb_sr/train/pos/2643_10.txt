I really can not say much more about the complication of a movie that has not been said before. I have not seen a movie for about 25 years and my memory has never left me. I searched him everywhere. In the past I searched him, but I showed up empty. Last night I was thinking about the film and I tried to remember who was in it, but I was only 10 or 12 years old when I last saw it and I was not sure if I had the real name of the movie so I decided another search and finally I found this scene. I was right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, can you now let me go to tavniteel@iahoo.com I really would like to thank you. And anyone who has not seen this movie has a chance to make good money.
