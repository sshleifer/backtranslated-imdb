Even without saying a word, Billy Conneli is as beautiful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as a "mom"? Better yet. Zombie girls? "... My father had to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's as if the plane is lucky (meat?) The Night of the Living Dead, sponsored by Zomcom. It's just a cool way! And yes, the social commentary is too much to be able to start commenting at all. Sufice to say, all this really works!
