It seems that there are only two types of reviews of this movie on the Internet. Those who hate and swear to him the name Ralph Bakshis and they love him and call him a genius work. I'm inclined to be in the middle. I am forced to agree with the majority of the criticism of this film (for example, crude cutting of stories, bad rotoscopic charecters, acting, etc.). But this I deduct, I still love this film. Rotoscoping (when done properly) adds a spectral realistic dimension to charecters, and the final scene of the battle at the end of the movie is fantastic. Surrealistic scenes when the Ninja capture Frodo are stylish and well-executed and musical parties ... magic. Unfortunately, bad spots outperform the film, but if you can ignore them, that's a great movie. (No doubt I will be lynched by the angry crowd of people who hate this movie after they wrote this review, ah well, such is life)
