I have no idea how Texas (director, Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever pulled this out, but this will recall again what all this hassle about Mrs. Paltrow was in the first place! I've long since left the woman and I still feel she's pretty boring in her performance "Shakespeare In Love" which won the Oscars, but she gets all her here - she's as close to her as Emma Voodhouse. Maybe she won the Oscars for Shakespeare, but she needs to be remembered. Naturally, she is surrounded by a brilliant acting team, including Tony Collet, Greta Skaka, Juliet Stevenson and others ... Jeremy Nortam is very attractive as a love interest, even if the script slightly discounts in his release love for Paltrow (in this process, allowing all tensions to come out of their relationship); A few years later, Evan's hair was a bit easier to take than it was in '96. and, personally, I think that stiff Alan Cumming is present in anything today. But, it is undeniable that Sophie Thompson (sister Emma Thompson, daughter of Philly Lew) as Miss Bates; this version requires a scene in which Emma reconciled with Miss Bates, because she is a character whose fate is attracted. The movie is worth watching (again even) just for her performance. All in all, this is greatly aged with charm and more than enough subtlety to sort the British class system. It's worth hiring (because it's unlikely that Paltrow will ever be as good - but we'll always have Emma).
