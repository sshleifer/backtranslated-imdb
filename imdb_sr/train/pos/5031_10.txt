This movie is nicely designed! No defects. Not in the design of sets, lighting, sounds, shops. The script is a call to a complex game in which participants are on a simple mission. Pakton is the best in this role. His manners, infections that are used in the tone of his voice are without misbehavior. Each clip is carefully finished! Surprises appear one after the other when the film reaches its first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it is a jewel that is very well polished. Not for a simple mind.
