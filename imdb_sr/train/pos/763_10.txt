This movie changed everything for me ... I heard about breakdancing and hiphop, but I never saw it professionally (hey, I was an 11-year-old kid from Holland!) When I saw this movie, it all changed. I actively joined the hiphop movement in our city, started breakdancing and wrote the lyrics. To date, I consider this film a personal favorite. Of course, shooting and "cinematographic" importance may not be so significant. But who cares if the recording is badly recorded or if you see a microphone hanging above someone? That's what makes you personally, what counts ...
