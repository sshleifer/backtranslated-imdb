In short and short, the people who wrote the stories for this show are genius, actors are just perfect for the roles they play (CJ's character is extraordinary) and have so much chemistry on the screen that makes what it is, a very successful comedy. When I first saw new episodes that are probably coming back just over 6/7 months, I wondered what happened to Paul. I was desperate when I learned that he died when I reviewed Google. He was so funny and played his character to perfection, an overly protective father, who likes to keep his daughters away from the boy. The comedy, it seems to me, has gone from strength to strength, even without Paul in it. In addition, I think that most people would enjoy this view.
