At least something came out of Damon Runion's wrong attempt to sentimentalize the mafia. "Boys and Dolls", a seemingly indestructible musical scenario, was shot in 1955 on Joseph L. Mankievicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful and entertaining film starring an all-star actor, including Vivian Blaine Broadvai shov, Jean Simmons (whose character is characteristic of Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holidai") and two of the leading People, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, who recently won the Oscars for Best Supporting Actor ("From Here to Eternity") and Best Actor ("On The Waterfront") and were at the top of their game. One listening to Brandy who sings "Luck Be a Ladi Tonight" speaks a lot about where Dylan got his voice. Stubby Kaie steals the show as "Beautifully Beautiful Johnson", who drops the house with "Sit Down Iou Rocking the Boat." The omnipotent Sheldon Leonard adds another page to the gallery of his gangsters. The film has a bright, cartoon-like look, which has been predicted by pop art since the early 1960s. The characters speak stylized patos, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although the social attitudes and roles of the film are dated, it's all fun, and even the gentle saluting of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect any real animosity towards organized religion. Just watching Sinatra and Branda in the same movie is a good reason to watch this movie, but there are many other attractions that you can offer during your 149 minutes.
