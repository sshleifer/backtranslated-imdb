"Pandora's Clock" is an exciting tension / thriller that is a cross between a movie about viruses and a film about disasters. This film, which is broadcast in two parts on NBC in its debut screened in 1996, refers to a flight of a plane that is infected with the virus when one of the passengers accidentally carries this disease. The US government is discussing whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while a pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to figure something out to avoid a catastrophe. I'm not really a fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I liked Pandora's watch. One of the excitement. Jane Leeves (TV "Frasier"), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as president) also play the star. *** (out of four)
