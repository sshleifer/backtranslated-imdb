Creature Comforts in America should have been released to another network, or at least have the opportunity to have a full series of episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Given that the American audience (apparently) have the attention spans of a mosquito when it comes to humor, which does not consist of klevetavih klempavica, or is preoccupied with scatological functions (and sounds and smells), these emissions will be few and far between . One of the main problems was the fact that, no matter how brilliant he was, made for a rare audience that she knew what to expect, but was watching the audience and the facilities committee who did not have a clue about what they're looking. What is sad, but not unexpected. I wish I had seen at least three more seasons of this show, even if it was produced for a direct DVD release. The material and interactions between the creatures were rich in sub-context, and there were other conversations that were just waiting to be underground. But thanks to the political correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
