Returning to the cabin next to the lake is perhaps one of the few pieces that can satisfy the original. He had black humor, good suspicion, nice girls and, of course, a psychic killer. What do we miss? I Think Nothing. Except that we are left with a small amount of Gore and nudity because it was made for television. In addition to being one of the best sequences, it is one of the best trillers to watch as a family. Recommended for everyone.
