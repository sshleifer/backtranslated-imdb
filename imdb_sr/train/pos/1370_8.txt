I remember seeing this a few years ago when I first came out, and I was exposed to the performances of Parker Posey. And the movie was also pretty good. For anyone who has spent a bit of time in the nightclub / after-hours scene, this movie will have a special charm for you. Not too serious, mostly funny, and Parker Posei definitely shines his talented way through this indie gem. I especially liked the Diaz character (he reminded me of every DJ that fights me). And many other films could take the sign from this film about how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and mild about it. Babaganoosh!
