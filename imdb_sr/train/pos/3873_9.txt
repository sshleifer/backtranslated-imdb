This film is light, fun and beautifully captured. The lightning is absolutely beautiful, and the colors are convincingly resembling Vermeer's paintings. This is a sentimental comedy in the best way, far above American and French standards, and better than English. Each character is touching, and the interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is great, Silvie Moreau is better than Catherine's, Stephane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in his strange role, and Genevieve Laroche is the perfect best friend!
