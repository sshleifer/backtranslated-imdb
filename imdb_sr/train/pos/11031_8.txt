Sli is the best movie for the game and action. It is the ultimate pleasure in a movie with interesting characters, solid performances and the direction of Rennie Harlins is elegantly secured. Stallone is rarely so interesting in his action films and certainly plays a role in action scenes. This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most exciting and funny nineties, the definitive genre classic. As a Stallone fan, this is one that looks back on nice memories. A lot of wonderful actions and Sli in the main form. Lovers of action appreciate this film because it has all the features that make a good aciton film. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgov. ****
