On the night of his boyfriend, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the beautiful dancer Becki (Julia Stiles) at the bar, drinks a lot together and wakes up on the bed the next morning. His future mother-in-law calls him and informs that his fianc√©e, Karen (Selma Blair) might come to his apartment, and he desperately asks Becky to leave his place in a hurry. Before that, he discovers that he has cancer, and later, in preparing a wedding dinner, he understands that Becky is a cousin Karen. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy, with harsh situations. The first attraction of this film is certainly the central trio of actors and actors. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, great actresses and extremely beautiful, and Jason Lee, who is astoundingly funny, have good performances. I laughed a lot in the story, but there are some scenes that are really hilarious. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds his own colors; his imagination in many situations; in a drugstore, trying to buy and get explanations about crab medicine; most of his neighbors' scenes, the minister; when Karen called a department store; or when the police find the suspect suspected of attacking Pole. I could count many other scenes, but better to read or buy this movie from readers and have lots of fun. My voice is seven. Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy for them")
