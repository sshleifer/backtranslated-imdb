Perfect acting for a drama of several people. Simon is dead, but somehow rises out. What he saw there was shown in the form of empty dots that he orchestrated with the magnificent partitur German avant-garde composer Verner Henze. Simon is being persecuted by his death, comforted by the support of the people of death he saw on the other side. His girlfriend tries to keep him alive but fails, decides to follow him after his final death. Very sensitive and moving, deeply psychologically, but a bit slow and somewhat boring.
