In this glorious story of a weekend that is shared among literary giants. Maria and Persia Sheeli, Lord Byron and others created an enthusiasm group. They show their pursuit of sexual enlightenment. Personal freedoms from political to moral. Liberal use of drugs for stimulation and as dependence. Their creative views on life and writing. Describing, without a boring viewer, that every writer wants to find his husband. Together with distractions and feelings. With a breath-taking landscape that does not diminish, it greatly enlarges the story. Well-created characters from dark to kind, then angry on calm. With some of the most beautiful and most perfect costumes to be held.
