If anyone is wondering why no one is filming movies as a time, conversation, character and simple theme of friendship struggling to turn into something new, better and different, these people should take this film and see top-level writing, directing, and acting it melts into a wonderful evening of observation that things were once in Italy and England. The other days, the second time they turned into a great comedy of entertainment, recorded in 1992 with Alfredo Molino, Joan Plovright, Polly Walker, Josie Lavrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the lead roles. Under the right movement of the Mike Nevell's brush, these actors realize vividly unforgettable performances that are photographed with the help of a sublime subtle painting eye. Recalling the theater farsa of the dormitory at the turn of the century, this film could be called a farce of friendship, which becomes a valuable experience in the growth of a romantic nature within each character as well as the viewer. An artistic telegram about the importance of caring for people around us.
