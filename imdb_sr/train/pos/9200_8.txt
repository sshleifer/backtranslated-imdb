I've read countless posts about this game that are so similar to Mak Paine when I first played it when I thought it was a bit strange arcade game with the desire to drag Mak Paine style (not just bullet). When I played it for several hours I realized how fun it is! and how much it is different from Mak Paine, that the time of the bullet is a bit similar, but I think it's different from the style of the game. This game is a non-stop action - a combination of shooting and fighting, as a big fan of Mak Paine, I have to say that the DTR story is not close to the size of MacPain, the graphics are a little average and some levels look the same, but if you want something more than This bullet-time should definitely have this game.
