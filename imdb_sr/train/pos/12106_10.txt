"Danza Macabra" / "Castle of Blood" Antonio Margheriti is a creepy, atmospheric cooler that manages on all fronts. It looks absolutely beautiful in black and white and has a marvelously creepy Gothic vibration. with the visiting American choir Edgar Allan Poe. Poe bet that Foster could not spend one night in the abandoned Castle of Poe's friend, Thomas Blackwood. atmospheric and scared of me. The crypt sequence is really spooky and the tension is almost unbearable.Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful as the evil hall Elisabeth Blackvood. in the early 60's.
