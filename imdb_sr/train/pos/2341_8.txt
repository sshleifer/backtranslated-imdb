This is a really funny performance, made in a creepy way, just like Tim Burton's film. It's worth a look, because it's far more creative than most shows this season. Best of all, it's not a "reality" show. I wonder why the audience is so willing to accept such shows (which lack creativity) and ignore such wonderful shows that actually have creativity. it's really unusual. Much more comfortable than "Ghost Vhisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest thing on the tube of "My name is Earl". Oh, and narration and music are wonderful. If you enjoy the shows that are a bit out of the way, I recommend you. It's not as strange as Twin Peaks, but it's got a serious kink.
