This film is an unavoidable movie for everyone. The Congress should see this true documentary from a military standpoint, as well as everyone in America. The previous critic has completely missed the point - the point is that the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists, but who only live in our "enemy" territory and what makes soldiers. We have to support our troops by bringing them to the house immediately, before another person is killed or injured. This also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who are mentally damaged, with PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically, with lost limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
