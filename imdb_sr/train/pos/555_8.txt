My comment would be added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I could not find a place for it. I was really surprised to see that this film was released in the US in February 1955. I saw him in the "first movement" in Washington, DC, March 1958. I wonder if it was reissued, or was it a problem? In my opinion, this movie is a very easy game, but it has some classic characters. John McIntire does the job as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan basically has the same role he played in the Red River years ago. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives as good a performance as he ever did. I've seen this movie half a dozen times or more, and I never get tired of seeing the parts again. Photography and set design are excellent and offer an extraordinary amount of entertainment in an hour and thirty-six minutes.
