I just finished watching the 1st disc in a collection of 4 discs (26 episodes) created together with the UCLA archive for film and television (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (except for the first episode), the picture quality is pretty good. The DVD box is shown on the title page here in IMDb. "Mr. Peepers" is as charming as when I first saw him (then he was 5 years old) and Valli Coke is really in this role. If you are in favor of a silent comedy that sneaks at you, unlike blowing on your head, you will see this opportunity to experience all the wonderful characters that you will remember from childhood. Although some of the legs are slightly loose, most of them are genius and well-executed ... and even have funny fun. This is one TV series that lives in memories of my early childhood.
