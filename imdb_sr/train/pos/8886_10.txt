I was not living in the sixties, so I can not guarantee that this film was a full-fledged view of the period, but this is certainly a moving and fulfilled experience. There are great performances, of which the most famous are Josh Hamilton (from Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who play the brothers divided by war. Bill Smitrovich, an actor who has long been ignored by many, gives the heart a fulfilled performance as their strict father, who is forced to question his convictions and values ​​while one of his sons makes him proud to go to Vietnam, but returns empty inward , while the other is the opposite. All in all, this is a powerful and cordial movie that I hope everyone will have the opportunity to experience it.
