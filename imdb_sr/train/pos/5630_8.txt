Marjorie (a great and amazing performance by Farrah Favcett) narrowly escapes the attack on her in her car by the evil rapper of the serial rapist Joe (superbly played with the scary conviction and intensity of James Russ). However, Joe steals her wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives. He pays a visit to one fateful day. After Marjorie subjected degradation and psychological abuse, Marjorie manages to turn the tables on Joe and lock him in the fireplace. What will Marjorie do with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and scriptwriter Villiam Mastrosimone invent a sharp, coarse and often disturbing story of morality that honestly affects the brutality and painful humiliation of rape, while at the same time showing that every person brought to the extreme is capable of shocking violence and inhumanity. Joe perceives women strictly as objects, while Marjorie sees Joe as an "animal". However, this film with its wonderful credits refuses Joe to make it just a disgusting one-dimensional puzzle; Instead, it is terrifying indeed and ultimately a sad human monster with a woman and a child (Joe's climate recognition is particularly genuinely touching). Faucett and Russo are outstanding in leadership; they receive good support from Diana Scarvid as passive Terry, Alfred Voodard as sensible Patricia, and Sandi Martine as a cunning officer Officer Sudov. And the moving cinema of Curtis Clark and J.A.C. Redford's daring, skin-crawling result greatly increases the significant claustrophobic tension. A real powerman.
