Okay, I'll admit it. This is a movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He makes a wonderful parody of someone who makes a parody of James Cagney, with a charm that's economical. .

(Well, yes - some of them have been copied since then - but when this movie was made, it was genuine, and much has not been copied elsewhere.) Watch Joe Piscopo to warn people not to work ______ with one of the great taglines of spoofs. Watch how Roman Moronie does things with English curses that would make you laugh gratitude teacher. Look at the incredible scenes, like Johnny Kelli's pet shop owner using a gun on his puppies and forcing his kittens. Watch the biggest "warning against sex" educational film ever made. Look at the most incredible fake ecclesiastical incitement, while a guy who has never taken lessons for work collects Thompson's machine gun from parts. Look at the lines you will use in an informal conversation for the next decade. Look at Maureen Stapleton to make the perfect antithesis for a diligent mother, with amazing gossips that you will never see. others will appear in 30 seconds or less, and chances are, you will have to pause until you finish on the floor several times. Duckies and Bunnies? And them. Beware of subtle things - some of the visions of vision can go unnoticed with the first few reviews. There are several minor disadvantages - but this is probably the best of the podium. Some are approaching, but none of them is very good.
