This story has never been among my favorites in Christie's works, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adaptation. The mouse's motive was effective if it was a bit overburdened, the bones of the story are there, although a greater emphasis was placed on the sub-site of 'crime in the past'. The students were all the way I imagined them, although it was a shame that they were no longer cosmopolitan - perhaps the revised setting of the thirties did not allow it! I thought some of the recordings were very bold. perhaps because I did not read the book for a long time, but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the killer was from their appearance in some of the recordings that appeared at an early stage. early Poirots. Sometimes it works, but I found quite a lot in this episode (although I laughed at 'Lemon sole'). All in all, a solid entry into the series, though not one of the best.
