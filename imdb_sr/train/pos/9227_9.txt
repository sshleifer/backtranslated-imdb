Postfeminist view of cruelty and sadism. Warning! This underestimated jewel of the film talks about Flavia, the girl of the fifteenth century of noble birth he found in the monastery after he defined his father and the entire medieval Christian community watching the fall of the Islamic Warrior As a human, not a demonic figure. In the inability to accept the patriarchal rule of the monastery (explicitly stated in the scene where the bishop arrives with soldiers and monks), Flavius ​​begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds himself, and through the struggle against the entire system of subjugation, repression and violence , inevitably brings the tragic end not only for itself, but for everyone around it. Made as a piece of nunsploatation, it's far from the truth. This is a film picture of the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal domination, the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit. I described him in the title of this work as a post-feminist and in the end Flavia's triumph must always be corrupted, compromised and perverted by people. Even Flavia's terrible end was committed by men for men (women turn around and monks only look horrified.) As for the violence that is talked about, this is an overview of the effects of violence and the Horror of the World that is crazy for religious excess, in order to escape from violence, limit the impact of the film, make the film more difficult and allow it to assimilate in the patriarchal discourse that exposes the medieval society. Beautifully captured, great acting (especially from by Florinda Bolquin and Maria Casares), contains an excellent piano score and even more After all these years, Flavia is a classic of European cinema.
