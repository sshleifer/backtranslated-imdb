My father, dr. Gordon Varner (Major Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg to the Japanese, and also got Navi Cross. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that my father was a technical advisor to this film and I hope he had an impact on the film to remind him how it really was then, as I read in the various comments written by viewers this film which It looked like real life. My father is a fanatic of facts and figures, and he always wanted to see things as they are, so I would like to believe that he had something to do with it. He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (ironically, she is Japan), and a few years ago she was awarded one of the highest acknowledgments by the emperor of Japan for his contributions and activities returning Kendo and Iaido to Japan, after McArthur banned them after the Second World War. My father used to be a marine, but I know that when you are a marine, you are always a marine. And that's precisely what he is and I really love him and I respect him. I would like to be able to watch this movie if someone has a copy. And I would love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year!
