This is a very rare film and probably the least known from the Shirley Temple because it is not in any of its collections. The reason for this is probably because there is no happy ending, unlike all her other films. musical, though she makes a song called 'The world owes me my life'. The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I have in color and on VHS, I would say they did a good job because the color looks realistic, unlike I would say colorful films Laurel and Hardy They are terrible. The film is good for its age and the story is not dated at all, I'm surprised that nobody tried. It seems that the movie is a bit nervous because some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem to have been pulled out, in some scenes it looks like they it takes fifteen minutes to say what they could say in five. do not delay this, because this movie has some really good moments in it, especially when Jerri} Ga Cooper steals a necklace and hides it in Shirley's honey. Tension and slow progress to his actions, {while at the same time his daughter sings to the audience in the other room} is very well directed. The facial expressions when they are taken care of are also very good. In all this, a good movie from the early 30's, accept it for your years.
