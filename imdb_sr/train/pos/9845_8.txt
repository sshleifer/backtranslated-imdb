I'm not gonna lie, this is a great movie. I saw it about 4 months ago in a local theater. I saw him a second time and I was a little boring in slow scenes. Sid (laziness) is not so flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the movie. The animation is remarkable, and the story has a touchy ending. Worth taking children 10 and less, but teenagers would probably think it's a bit boring. Also, the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting. As I said, it's a pretty good movie, but I would rate "Toi Story 2" or "Shrek" higher. 8/10
