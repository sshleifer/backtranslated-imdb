Like many of you, I am a great fan of real things - noir films from the 1940s - but Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us eager for the past. The term 'neo-noir' is thus often used improperly in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and influence. John Dahl's film, on the other hand, really deserves to be described as such. Casting is perfect, and everywhere you would feel at home with Tai Garnett or Jackues Tourneur. The action is so tight that you are hooked in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would appreciate it. Many contemporary movies leave me wondering why they are not being made like they used to be, and I'm not that old. Movies like Red Rock Vest give us hope for the future, giving the honor of the past.
