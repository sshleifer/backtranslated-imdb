Invisible is done in a style that looks more like old Hollywood mysteries than a horror show. The film is somewhat slow, but many bizarre images keep the film alive and visible. The basic idea of ​​young girls in a cellar room is old, but good acting and production make the movie worth watching. The movie emphasizes its emotional influence and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects. I rated it 8 out of 10.
