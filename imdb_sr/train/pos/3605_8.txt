The girl is using a well-known formula as someone pointed out, however, I've seen many movies that do not work so well or are not so credible. I believe that in the end it is easier for a woman to sympathize with this character and in this way feel more touched by the film. and, I think the viewer still can get a lot of things by looking at this. Although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general, this is a movie that gave me a spark. So that the plot is known / common. Actors are good. but the thoughts they can cause are what it does above average in my opinion. he made a great impression on me and I know that I'm not the only one.
