By reaching a truck in New York, a smart young woman with BABI FACE starts methodically to break through to the highest floors of power in a big bank. Barbara Stanvick is fascinating as an amorous heroine of this influential drama. Without a punch of hatred or regret, she coldly manipulates by removing or destroying people who have not been fortunate to find her way. A beautiful actress, Stanvick has a full chance to show off his great talents. Being quite late in the story, George Brent is a welcome addition, as one of them could deal with Stanley; his sophisticated style of acting makes a beautiful counterpoint to her icy behavior. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker show a series of her unfortunate victims. John Wayne appears on only a few seconds as the unsuccessful prospect of Stanley's feelings. This would be the only time these two performers would appear together on the screen. Film guests should recognize Nat Pendleton as a special buyer, and Charles Sellon and Edvard Van Sloan as bank managers - all are free of charge. > Sounds heard on the soundtrack during the whole movie, perfectly interrupted action, is "Babi Face" (1926) Benni Davis & Harry Acst i ?? St. Louis Blues' (1914) V.C. Handi. BABI FACE is an excellent example of pre-Code naughtiness. In its sincere and reluctant attitude to sex, it is precisely the film that is intended to eliminate the 1934 Code of Conduct.
