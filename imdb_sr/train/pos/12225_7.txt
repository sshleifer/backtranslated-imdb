I saw this film and although I knew from the beginning who the killer was, I still loved to watch it. I would recommend it to other people. A lot has come to the Lifetime Film Network. I'm thinking, since it's close to Halloween, it may be playing more. So please be careful if you are interested in watching it. I believe Alicia Silverstone played her role very well. I really like the actress and person. It looks so nice on the ground. Kevin Dillon, he was so successful for me. I'm not trying to ruin him or anything else, but I believe his brother Matt would be better able to take that bad serial killer. Kevin seems to me too sweet. But I think it's good.
