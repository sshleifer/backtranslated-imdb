I think this film is absolutely beautiful. I'm not just thinking about breath-taking landscape. These are two unfortunate English housewives who choose to rent an Italian castle in order to rest from a not so happy home life. In the end, four women rented this place together, all with different personalities and different reasons for it. In this magically beautiful place, they all find peace for which it is longing and interesting that peace comes from internal thinking and resolution, more than without them. And to me, this is wonderful for the relationships that are developed from kindness and understanding. The acting is the joy that needs to be looked at in itself. I particularly love the characters Lottie (Josie Lavrence) and Ladi Caroline (Polly Valker).
