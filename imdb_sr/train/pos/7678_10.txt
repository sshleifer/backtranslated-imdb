I just watched Holly along with another film about the trade and sexual exploitation of children, called Trade on Film at the International Film Festival. I must say that Holly broke the store out of the water. Holly is a powerful and incredible movie at many different levels. From a purely artistic and film perspective, this is incredible. Mixing sounds, camera angles, direction, and acting are on-site. In addition, the way it deals with it is tasty and unused. It presents the question of sexual exploitation of children in a way that is both educational and accurate. Film makers devoted extraordinary attention to details, truly grasping the nuances of the epidemic of sexual exploitation and child trafficking. Too often, when it comes to an object of this kind, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into this typical Hollywood trend. I was pleased to see Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen a more moving audience. Only by listening to conversations after the screening, people are wondering what they can personally do to combat the sexual exploitation of children. I recommend it to everyone, both because of its cinema value, and because of its theme.
