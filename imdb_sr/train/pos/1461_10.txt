The film reveals the apparent exploitation of a Chinese worker - mostly a female sex - recording footage from a Chinese business owner who shares his wicked and misleading viewpoint, his American counterpart also as unharmed and deceived, repressed vocal workers and, of course, drunken Americans wearing endless necklaces in Nev Orleans. The emergence of hope comes when some Americans are actually outraged by the fact that people who make their beaded necklaces received a salary of $ 0.10 per hour to do so. You also have the feeling that workers may have the opportunity to avoid working in the bead factory, but they will likely do it when there is a lot of penalties that are popular with the factory owner and / or are just too exhausting to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor. I was wondering where the necklaces came from, not realizing how hard and hard it would be to make them. I really appreciated this film because it beautifully describes the impact that American satisfaction has on something we consider relatively harmless in our society to people on the other side of the world. A honorable memorial to Val-Mart. It's just incredible. And clear, just the tip of the iceberg!
