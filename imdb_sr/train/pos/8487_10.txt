I remember seeing "Gung Ho" as a child with my mother and wondering why she would always cry in the last few minutes. Of course, I found the entire film hilarious, especially the manicures of the characters. Only when I was much older and watching again, I realized how much this show is deeper. Michael Keaton and Gedde Vatanabe shine in their roles as reluctant intermediaries. Keaton ceases to amaze me with his style of delivery in real life, and Vatanabe adds humor and pathos to mik. I also thought that Patti Iasutake (Umeki) was simply fantastic in her role as a comic relief. I think this film is one of the most disgusting films of the eighties. We all can learn a lesson from joining American and Japanese workers in this movie ... sometimes you really * can have the "best of both worlds". And now I understand why my mother felt the way she did in those final moments. I'd rather be one of those cars.
