*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, since I'm a big H: LOTS fan, maybe the movie I liked more than what normal people would do. However, this film is still excellent. He had a lot of surprises, and the series was even more closed. While I was sad that Bailiss had turned into a killer, the overall feeling I felt was pleasing.
