A few years ago, I added a comment to the IMDB about The Real McCois. Then I said and repeated that it was a charming, fun and fun show, she was well behaved with great characteristics. Recently I saw DVDs on the DVD of four old episodes PLUS Reunion in 2000 with Richard Crane, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As the other writer mentioned here, it is curious that Lidia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Vinkelman (Little Luke) did not mention, but they may be able to follow SAG or AFTRA. The reunion of the shov was well done and gave us a lot of unknown insights into the show. One of the information we did not know was whether Kathy Nolan complained that she had left the show in an unpleasant dispute over the contract, which left Luke a "widow" last year, which was not very good. Nolan continued to work on the Broadside comedy bomber on World War II female nurses in the Pacific. Got it? BROADside? No, it's not funny. Unlike the sleazy, loyal and violent TRASH on TV that now undermines our values, "The Real McCois" has enjoyed decent values ​​and fine human beings. And I thank everyone who took part, including the creator of Irving Pinkus, who brought it to my family. We never miss it.
