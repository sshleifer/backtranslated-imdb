The drama club in my school will present this show in the spring of 2002 and I can only hope that we are good! I recently watched this movie as a kind of "research" for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I would just like to say, Vanessa Villiams is the coldest! Vov! Casting for this film was right (with one exception). Jason Alexander, my God, is there anything he can not do? He was the most lovable Albert Peterson ever - I especially loved all his funny facial expressions and dancing in "Happy Face!" He's so great! Vanessa Villiams, as I said earlier, is the coldest. She was beautiful Rosie, and her transition from the secretary to the seduct was completely convincing. Tine Dali was hilarious because Albert's hated mother and George Vendt were as beautiful as the angry McAfee (but I liked the performance of Paul Linde in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau attacked me like Ursula Merkel; It really messed up! And Marc Kudisch was a terrible Conrad Birdie ... "Let go!" It was just one throw that I did not understand, and, as you'll see from the previous comments, many other people do not understand it. Chinna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was that? I think she's really pretty and very talented, but ... she seems too old for the role. Eh, maybe I'm mistaken. Okay, sure, I recommend this movie. It will leave you smiling! <br /> <br />
