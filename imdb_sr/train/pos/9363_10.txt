This film was amazing, it's the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than watching other movie actors you watch in other director / writer movies. Sandler did a good job by working a character outside his comfort zone, and always a good Cheadle did a great job. This film is great for a mature intelligent audience. The acting was fantastic and can only outsource the writing and directing of the film. This film focuses on genuine Americans, the past generation, without stereotypes or racism, only people who have merged and realized the true meaning of life. This film is about losing and confronting. Instead of choosing psychiatry, it defines it, and not as someone who magically treats you, but through the need to say your feeling to an impartial someone you can trust will not judge, but will guide you through your thoughts. This movie is incredible!
