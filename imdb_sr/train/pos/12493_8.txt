After all the shit that Hollivood (and India) released, we finally got a movie that brings some scary moments. There are some clich√© moments, but I'm not sure that it's possible to make a completely original movie today. There are not many new things here ... it's just done well. Take care and pay attention, because "subtle" fears come quickly and often. This is not a movie you can watch while you eat pizza. In this film there is a very well-written red haringa and, unfortunately, one very bad role. Cheri Christian simply does not make an effective Julie (wife / mother). First of all, it is totally inconclusive. I know, I know ... she just went through a traumatic experience. But the viewer is never met as "normal" and the relationship between her and her husband is rather uncomfortable (in an unintended way). I think the director intended to have some sympathy for her, but I never did. Finally, the thumb is over, which is both disturbing and satisfying. It could easily have been cheaper with the sound effect at the start of the final credits, but the director wisely resisted. A terrific movie ... something rare today.
