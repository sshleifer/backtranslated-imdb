Yes, it's the horror of the B-class. But at least producers, directors and actors do not pretend to be a defect from the sky. The plot is loose, a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is sprayed with a genetic acid that turns him into a snowman. Snowman a.k.a. Jack Frost then goes mad to find a sheriff who finally arrested him. With a limited budget, the crew had to work with limited special effects, most of the money seemed to be spent on a snowman costume. Special heavy recordings are managed by cartoons or shots that move (images where the camera moves to conceal details). This is not a movie for children and you should not mix it with a Disney movie of the same title. If you do not allow your children to watch only pg-13 movies, parents should not allow their children to watch this movie. This film has two claims about fame. 1. The beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) played her first major film role. The scene in which Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth is worth watching several times. 2. This movie has the worst snowshown ever. The joke is so bad that the directors admit a joke to a speaker on a credit card.
