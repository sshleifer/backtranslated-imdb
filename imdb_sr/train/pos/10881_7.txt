"Cut" is a complete subversion of the genre of the slasher and generally achieves what he wants. Most standard clich√©s are here; old dreadful house, forest, anonymously indestructible serial killer, spooners upstairs, and of course the couple interrupted the killer while they were having sex (it's hardly a spoiler). Set - it's simplicity: film school students began to complete an unfinished "masterpiece" of a slasher, unfinished for the killing of several actors. This also neatly - fine, messy - has Kilie Minogue in the first roller. They are joined by one of the surviving original films, played by Molly Ringwald, who absolutely steals the film as she gets all the best lines. The rest of the actors responded well to their roles, especially to the beautiful Jessica Napier, who was acting as the confusion and crowd brooked around her. There is very little time to try to discover who the killer is because the film is moving so fast. It also has a corresponding low budget appearance, including some awkward editing that is probably intended. Good soundtrack, too. If there is a problem with this movie, it is decided whether it is sending or giving respect to the genre slasher. Probably both.
