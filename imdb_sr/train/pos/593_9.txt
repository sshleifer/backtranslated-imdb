This game lasted only one season, but it was intriguing to the audience because it required visual ability and a steady hand. One wrong move would disqualify a contestant to win the prize, although it was clear that the competitor knew the correct answer. It was always exciting as the competitor began to draw, wondering whether he would finish the drawing or be buzzed; allowing another competitor to easily win the competition. It was a carefree performance, but it was clear that the competitors were often confused about the inevitable error. Rarely seen, the game did not survive just one season. Only the dependent game addict will remember these performances, as it turned out to be pretty unpopular, although the games showed a great return to the TV screen after a scandal of games from the 1950s. But it was a unique concept for the show and one that has not yet been seen.
