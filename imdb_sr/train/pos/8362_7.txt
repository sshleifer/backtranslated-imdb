A revitalized version of the story transformed into a film in 1938 in England (The Frog Returns) in connection with a search by a police masters of crime known as Frog due to frogs such as rising (bulging eyes, etc.) Wears. One of the good Vallace's films from the 1960s is a solid little party. Apparently under the influence (or did this effect) restarting Dr Mabuse's films, the frog seems to be more a super-thief than a master of thieves. Although not the best of Vallace's films, it's worth a look. This would be an interesting double film with a great previous movie. Between 6 and 7 of 10.
