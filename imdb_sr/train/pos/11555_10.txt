Simple comment ... What can I say ... this is a wonderful movie that I can constantly watch. This is definitely one of the ten best comedies. With a great acting team, Jack Lemmon and Valter Matthau wrote the perfect Neil Simon's script based on his performance. If you have a digital cable, the menu appears at the bottom of the screen to get what's turned on. This movie usually gives ***% of stars, but in reality deserves **** stars. If you really are watching this movie, it can be said that it will be so funny and fresh for hundreds of years.
