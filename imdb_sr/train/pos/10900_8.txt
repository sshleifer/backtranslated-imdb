This was a documentary for me, when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I definitely watched the repetition. I really sympathized with the main character of the film, because, that is true, I have a mild skin condition problem, which has had a dystrophic epidermolysis of Bullos (EB). This is a sad, sometimes fun and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. Johnny Kennedy speaks as a child (because of the loss of vocal muscles) and has never passed through puberty but has 36 years. The most sympathetic moments are seen in his terrible condition and the discoloration of the turn. Johnny had a rather naughty sense of humor, even told him from the grave when he showed his body in a suitcase. She talks her story with the help of her mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and celebrity, and Jonny's supporters, Nell McAndrev. He is the winner of BAFTA for Best Editing and Best New Director (Factual), and has been nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and Flaherty Documentary Avard Award. That was the number 10 of the 100 biggest TV shows in 2004. You have to look at the documentary!
