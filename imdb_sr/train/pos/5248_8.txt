Okay, like many other such films, they came out of the SNL skit. But Tim Meadovs does a pretty fantastic job to make a 3-minute, one-dimensional character in a moderately sustainable comedy movie. He inserts fun, consistent, single-stranded frequencies with frequent frequencies, Billy Dee Villiams in it, although his Lando days have long gone, and the whole thing is pretty well recorded. True, it's not great art, but if you went to Vaine's world in search of Gone Vith The Vind, you did something wrong. Enjoy what you are
