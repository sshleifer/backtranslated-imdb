*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This "Divers" movie is really interesting. All I knew was that it would include Nazi history, underwater scenes, and everyone would speak Danish. But I decided to check it for one reason, the fact that the story unfolds around the submerged German submarine of the Second World War. I have a fetish for German submarines, especially wrecks that can dive. So I was a little skeptical about the Danish part, but I explained that the submarine could measure that part. Knowing that Nordic films are not always so good and not sure about the size of the budget, I was, at the very least, very skeptical. When I looked, I was ... surprised. I had some thoughts that the actors are inadequate, given that some are very young, especially two main actors. It was not a problem, they were both very good. Like other actors, who consist mainly of people in their 50s and wider. This creates interesting interactions between young and old, which are often not seen on the screen. In any case, it is not unique, but somewhat rarely. And that's all good. As far as the Danish language is concerned, it is almost impossible to understand. But that was not a problem, he had subtitles. The second question was the submarine itself, I suspected there would be internal footage, as well as underwater submarine footage. Deciding that their budget was thin, I thought it might be adequate at best, but that's the worst. I'm surprised again, the outer scenes of the wreck are beautiful, and the inner scenes are very realistic. I had a fetish for German submarines, I knew what the submarine looked like, especially inside, and it was not lowered. The team did serious research. All is well. I assume that more people than I will watch this movie just to see some underground scenes, so I feel that I have to issue a "warning". The submarine in the movie is not the actual model that existed during the war. It's a special purpose submarine. But to tell you what to expect, it's a transition between type VII, type IKS and Japanese I-52 submarines. God is a good design and makes a wreck. The environment is on the Danish island or peninsula, I can not remember. The summer and two brothers travel to their grandfathers to celebrate the arrival of the summer as every year. Their grandfather is a kind of sailor. Cinema is quite good, many beautiful summer scenes on island docks, some newly discovered teenage love, nice diving time and a general feeling of "perfect". Once again, everything is fine. The floating island brings some visitors to the suspicious species, a set of people engages one of the ships, an old minesman and his crew. One of the visitors, a man of the fifties, has a tattooed German eagle and a swastika on his back. The older inhabitants of the island remember when the German submarine sank to the end of the Second World War, and since then, rumors of Nazi gold have been heard in depths. Grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken ship shortly after the German bodies began floating in 1945. No submarine has ever been found. Key elements are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunt, secrecy, competition, teen love, conspiracy and ... surprise. *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not expect some supernormal elements to appear in this movie and that they did not catch me. Although he is not a big fan of supernatural events, he still fit into the story well and does not pose any problem. It's not like "From Twilight to Dawn" where everyone is turning into a vampire to the end. This is a bit more subtle. OVERALL: A really good movie, I gave it to 8. Some because of the fact that it's not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. Later I learned that there was a fair budget and that some of the actors were experienced Danish veterans. But even if it was a Hollywood production, I'd give her 7 or 8. It's definitely worth your time. Yes, she talks about a child in some way, but then a mature story again. There is a lot of uncertainty and a great aura of adventure, which I thought was very attractive. And, again, cinema is really good. Medusa 2001 <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br />
