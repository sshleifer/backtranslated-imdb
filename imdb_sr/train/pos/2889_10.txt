*** Maybe you would not consider this a spoiler, but I'd rather be cautious than careless *** I've never seen this movie when I was a kid. I fell in love with her the first time I saw her with her three-year-old daughter. I can watch it over and over again. For a small piece of work that Ilene Voods worked for life, she was a lovely voice for Cinderella; very attractive; Very convincing. Music fits perfectly into the movie. The acting was great; They liked the mice !! You really "hate" Lada Tremain and sister-stepmother; they were just terrible. Cartoonists have well described spoiled behavior. This is a wonderful movie, especially if you are in love stories. My daughter watched the movie about 25 times and is still excited at the end.
