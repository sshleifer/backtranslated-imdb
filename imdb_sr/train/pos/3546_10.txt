One of the best musicals ever made, this is an example where producers and directors were not afraid to choose actors for their talent, but for what people could expect. The lighting and set are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (this has a special name that I can not remember). The dialogue is also unique in that contractions are not used. The film is well-timed, it behaved nicely and was interesting from start to finish. The true joy is MUSIC. Such a series of first-class songs, from beginning to end, that are perfectly performed and orchestrated. Also, music is very original and very memorable, and I think it's superior to many musicals from the thirties to the sixties. There must be more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which can only have two or three. It's not bad for a director without experience in this kind of movie. The other quality is that it is fresh every time you see it.
