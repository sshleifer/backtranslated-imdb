What's so taboo about love?! People seem to have big problems with the transgender. The title of this movie did not catch me. It was a grainy snapshot about 4 minutes in the movie, which made me stop surfing the channels. I could not believe this movie was amazing. It touches so many levels of human emotion that it has never managed to move me in one way. It's by far one of the best independent films I've ever seen. I did not consider these characters even gender, but human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially independent films. Praise all the fearless filmmakers!
