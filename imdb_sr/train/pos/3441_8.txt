This film is incredibly realistic and I consider it to be a great justice for a crime that many people do not understand because of lack of experience. Many people who think that I can figure out what goes through the mind of the victim are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Davson has done a fantastic job in his role as Maia. I agree that this is an incredibly brave movie. This looks at rape from a different, more realistic point of view than any other film I've ever seen on this topic. The end has lasted for a long time, but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, because the chances of an attacker being sent to prison for their crime are around 1%. It's good to see a movie that comes closer to reality than most would dare.
