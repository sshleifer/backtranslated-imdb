Los Debutantes is a story of two orphan brothers who moved to Santiago from the south after their mother died. Silvio, the older brother, who is self-confident and street-wielding, gets a job that works for the bad stripper club owner after he took the naïve Victor on his 17th birthday. included in the owner's sexy and manipulative mistress, Gracia. As the film unfolds, characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and open ways each manipulates the following. The film is well made, with good cinema and fast pace. It's also pretty sexy, with lots of nudity and some pretty explicit scenes of sex. It uses the now popular technique of layering different scenes from different points of view, from a chronological sequence. Many people hate such films because they do not understand what is happening - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good movies use this device. The story itself is not really anything new, there are elements of Bodi Heat, Pulp Fiction, and many other good movies noir. As the different layers reveal, our perceptions of characters and their motivation are evolving. While the action can be a little cliché, it is also smart and fun. I would call it a nice movie, worth watching, but nothing unforgettable. I have not seen many movies from Chile, and it's always interesting to see a movie noir from other countries. In addition, rent it if it is available, but do not lose your sleep if it is not.
