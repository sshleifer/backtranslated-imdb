Massive multiple wins down the spine! I'm surprised that people do not like it! I saw him at 10 am and I was still scared! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers / horror films! For a loud voice I am 22 !!! I mean, OK, acting, not very well, probably even b-movie-ish. But the real look of terror, sound effects, a stream! From the very beginning, he constantly strikes you with tireless, unbearable, terrible scenes! So many cliches, but no one can surprise / scare! You know he's coming, coming, coming, BOO! and you're still jumping off the chair. Catch the pillow and blanket, call your closest friend and do not watch it at night! Caps for the Japanese!
