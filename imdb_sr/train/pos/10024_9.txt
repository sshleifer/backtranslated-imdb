So many things fall into Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino (In the mind of the killer), it is very difficult to talk about it without any warning. Let's just say this movie is like an exercise in the cinema, but really, really great. It is made with super 8, black and white shots, 35 millimeters, colors, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin seems to have made a movie documentary, or vice versa, which is the strangest aspect of the doubt that leaves you wondering, did he really exist anymore? The film follows the later life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked in a religious mission and killed some people. The act for which he was caught and sentenced to death. The film begins because some French documentaries have been interested in this character, so they interviewed him before his death. Today, some more people have joined in and deepen their character research. The one we are witnessing - film. For the main part of history, we are leading a half-slow phase to look at Aroov's mind, mainly to decode why he did what he did. However, the important thing is that filmmakers never give a one-sided view; they have left the trial for all of us, and even when we can understand his actions, we obviously never justify them. So, the first half is based on the recollection of information; Later, things turn into Aro's childhood, giving the film such incredible new power (even heavy, it has never become weak or boring). so the only thing left to say is that if you accidentally get this movie in the vicinity, believe me, the journey to see it is more than decent.
