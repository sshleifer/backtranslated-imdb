This film was shot by one of the absurd humorists in Canada, Ives P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a second that he made a ROMANTIC comedy, but knowing that it was heavy cinefil, he was seen at every local festival and in the local cinema, I had a positive feeling about this movie. Damn, I was right. Immediately, the script (written by Pelletier himself) is a little twisted and difficult to follow, but in Pellet's fashion it's a unique 90-minute jack-in-the-hook. Easy-inspired and transformed allusion to Dangerous Connections (Laclos) "Les Aimants" consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the refrigerator. Through the movie you will have the opportunity to find out who is who and who writes to someone on that goddamn refrigerator ... that appears in an interesting love. Great story, great photos, great quotes of other films. Should we look for more for the first movie?
