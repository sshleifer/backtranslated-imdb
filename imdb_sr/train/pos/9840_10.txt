Re-born Limerick: If a man could come back from the dead and live in the head of a little girl Revenge would get <For the murder he met <br /> < > The guy who is now in his wife's bed. For me, Born Again is very underrated, classical. an episode that forms part of what defined X-Files for me before I started watching it. I saw several segments before playing for the first time and I was too young to watch it, such as The Jersei Devil, but especially I remember seeing this episode as an 11-year-old and that I was absolutely drunk from a scene where the guy sucks in the bus, then the hypnotic scene with a girl. I'm telling you I could not sleep for weeks! For this reason, in this episode, there is now a special aura about the frustration factor that I have enjoyed since. It is enough to look at some of the obvious shortcomings in the shop, such as why the girl had to wait until she was nine years old, before her previous life spirit really started to get refreshed. Or what she was doing by sitting on the bus in the middle of the night. I would think her parents would be worried. And maybe they just do not see that part of the story. And he was with telekinesis? In addition to adding Carrie's really cool factor to the already daunting story, there really was not any good explanation for that. But even with my little flaws, in my opinion, this is a classic episode and there is little or no reason I do not like it. 10 of 10
