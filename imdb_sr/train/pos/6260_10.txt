This caused the soul! I am Iranian, and I live in the 21st century, I did not know that such great tribes live in such conditions at the time of my grandfather! You see it today, or even in 1925, on one side of the world, a lady or a baby can have everything that served him or her purely and on demand, but here 80 years ago, people dared to go somewhere with more grass. It's really interesting that these Persians carry those difficulties to find a pasture for their sheep, but many sheep lose their way. I commend the Americans who followed this tribe, were tough as Bakhtiari.
