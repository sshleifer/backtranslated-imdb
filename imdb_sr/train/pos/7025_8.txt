I found it to be a charming adaptation, very lively and full of fun. With the exception of several big mistakes, the actors are wonderful. I have to repeat some of the earlier comments - Chinna Phillips is terribly wrong as a teenager. At the age of 27, she is too old (and, yes, she does NOT show), and there is no song "chops" for Broadway-style music. Vanessa Villiams is a decent singer and, for a non-dancer, she is adequate. However, she is not Latin, and her character definitely is. And it is very STRICT, which becomes fatigued. Girls of the Conrad Birdie fan club from Sveet Apple are truly glittering - with special honors Brigitti Dau and Chiari Zanni. I also enjoyed the performance of Tina Dali, although I'm not really a fan of her work. Finally, the dance Shriners are messy, especially three in the bar. The film is suitable for the whole family, and I recommend it.
