When I first went to watch The Shining, I expected a decent movie from what I heard about it and I loved many other works by Stanley Kubrick, but when I started to watch it was much better than I thought it would be. Sometimes I seriously felt ridiculous discomfort and I could not watch the screen is still something very disturbing in everything in the movie. Now some people do not like Kubrick's version of The Shining because they do not fully follow Stephen King's book, but in my opinion Kubrick's version, mini-series and book are great. Jack Nicholson gives excellent performance. look for a good original movie that will keep you in mind even after movies and watch The Shining.
