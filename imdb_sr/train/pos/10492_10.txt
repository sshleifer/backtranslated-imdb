I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on the video. Since then, he has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complicated but does not take away entertainment. It is full of comedic moments and has very valuable quality. The characters are what makes the movie so good. Each of them has its strange features that contribute to the humor, the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Philli Lew in their minds. All-in-one performance was performed by everyone, especially Brenda Blithen. She and Craig Ferguson were great together in pulling some of the funnier moments. If you are looking for a good comedy, I would recommend this movie!
