This production of PM Entertainment was filled with enough bullets to make John Voo say "Enough already!" Of course, it's not nearly as good as Voo can deliver, but it gets a job in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret cop in the near future. When his wife was handed over to kill the governor by a team that uses a cyborg-like appearance, Eric is cleansing his name. Wilson is able to withdraw Van Damme's duties while playing the heroic leadership and his evil cyborg. Why the Academy did not receive the notice is beyond me. Since PM production is, there are tons of automobile drives, car explosions (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shootings. I especially liked the van that turns in the air before even approaching the touch of an explosive truck. My second favorite subject was a girl from the neighborhood who came to perfect her karate in Don's simulator. It's just a chance to show some cheap LAVNOVER MAN effects around 1995.
