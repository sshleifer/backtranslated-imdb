I loved the silent noir of the first part, the acting of Pacino and Cusco, especially their scene together. The dissatisfaction of the environment and the juxtaposition of the old sex and the idealistic youth were an effect. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the movie; it was a serious and attractive character. The film started for me when the assistant mayor began to sniff around the mobster to reach the bottom of something that his boss apparently did not want to mix. junkiard. Here the story has become incredible. Something I do not understand: why did the policeman and Vito have a shootout if she gave information that could corrupt the corrupted judge?
