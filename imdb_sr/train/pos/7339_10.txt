Since I heard about Ralph Bakshi version of Lord of the Rings, I wondered: What the hell is rotoscope animation? !!! Well ... I finally found out ... I saw this film three years ago, and I have no idea who Ralph Bakshi ... And I liked ... a lot ... A very good story ... it even has a little the development of a character that is great for a cartoon ... You see him if you get bored with modern animation .... Do not misunderstand me ... I'm not saying that's just a nice cartoon ... And it's a pretty good movie ...
