This movie is a real jewel. The arch of the first plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are cute and clearly drawn, their motives are completely convincing. The dialogue is fresh, and so real. Situations are unique to characters and are not clickable or exhausted at all. To the climax, that is. Then it's like the movie got out a little out of the rail and it became a little funny and incredible. But I do not want to discourage people from watching this movie. The first three quarters are truly outstanding. I gave him 8. There are some notable performances here. Watch this movie.
