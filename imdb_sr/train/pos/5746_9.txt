Words are seriously insufficient to convey the emotional power of this film; it's one of the hardest things you'll ever see, and the end is one of the most compassionate, tender and emotionally filled you can hope for. Every actor in every role is great, especially wise and underrated Jamie Lee Curtis, severely wounded and sickly Rai Liotta, and heart stopping the turn of Tom Hulce who should have him for every prize in the book. (He is the best choice for the best actor in 1988 in Danny Peary's "Alternative Oscars.") The last half an hour is bordered by a melodrama, but the film earns each of its tears - and if you are not made of stone, there will be many of them.
