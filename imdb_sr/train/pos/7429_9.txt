She's such an extraordinary singer, who cares about anything else !!!! This final scene is one of the best moments in all shov biznes - bar none !! I'm glad she kept the camera on her for ten minutes - she deserves the iconic status - that's the power of the voice. The first time I saw this movie when I was five years old and had a huge impact on me. I see him today, and yes, I see some of the faults (as Esther wanted to leave Grammy's right while her prize was announced). false - I mean, where is the free nudity - maybe we've seen different movies ??? Streisand's singing ability is monumental, and if it has a great ego - good! She deserved it.
