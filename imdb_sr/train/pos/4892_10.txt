It was a wonderfully smart and funny movie that I would never get tired of many, many times. Casting was magnificent in matching young people with older characters. Here are some of us who really appreciate the good actors and the format of an intelligent story. As for Judy Dench, she is beautiful and a gift to every kind of production she plays in. I always want to see Judy Dench in all her performances. She is a wonderful actress and a pleasure to see how every transformation of her character is reviving. I can only be grateful when I see such an extraordinary picture for most of the films that have recently been missing good characters, good scripts and good acting. The film audience needs heroes, not deviant mannequins, lacking imagination and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites such as Leslie Caron, Olimpia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I wish this film to win the prizes it deserves. Thank you once again for an incredible night of fun. I congratulate the writer, the director, the producer, and everyone who did such a good job.
