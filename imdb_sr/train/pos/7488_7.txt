Someone (or something ...) leaves traces of stinging on the neck and exhausts the victims of their blood until death. Police detective Karl Brettschneider (Melvin Douglas, before he came out of the horror genre of B-film for higher heights) is confused when and what ... behind these notorious crimes. The village is overcome by hysteria, and Karl depends on his reliable medical genius, dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atvill, in another powerful role of a crazy scientist) to provide feedback on what could be the cause of the innocent death. He also fears for the safety of his beloved Ruth (the beautiful Fai Vrai, who for the third time plays with Atvill after "Doctor X" and "Mystery of the Vak Museum"), who is Niemann's assistant. Dvight Frie steals a movie as a crazy village idiot who collects bats and wears demented behavior wherever they go. It's easy to figure out why it's becoming suspicious like local paranoia in the fever. Maude Eburne gives the humor of the movie as a very naive (and, quite easily, influenced by) patient von Niemann who believes that he has diseases he reads in books near the laboratory in which he works. She is impressive and often von Niemann just humorous her constant and fictitious illnesses she feels. Lionel Belmore returns as another scared, superstitious Burgermeister. Skirting, static, but still fun thanks to the actors. The film is obviously low budget, but this does not count too much on film because it is pretty well made up of director Franck R Strider and his team. I'm sure the movie was better. This is a type of B-horror item you would find packaged with 50 other random customers and poverty programmers. Zlikovac film ... and his motives for feeding a synthetically created biological creature ... certainly give a different attitude to Frankenstein's formula. Many could be disappointed with the final results because the film moved away from the real supernatural story of the real vampire killer who caused the killings.
