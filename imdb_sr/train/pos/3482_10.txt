This is my first comment on IMDb site, and the reason I'm writing is that we are talking about ONE BEST FILM! 'Do not burn!' will laugh at you and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you are not yet a fan!) with the Georgian choral singing tradition, and you may accept the difficulties of your own existence and feel good after watching What I like about this movie is that the actors in non-leading roles create vivid and unforgettable characters and equally interesting and important as the central character. The movie is played by Vahtang Kikabidze (which is excellent), but you will remember each individual's face around him in the movie. You will find yourself quoting their lines, which have become the names of the hosts for so many people who speak Russian. Film for life. Simple but deep, you will want to look at it over and over again.
