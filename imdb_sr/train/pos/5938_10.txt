Another great taste of what should be a superhero movie after Batman: Dead End, which only helps to stimulate our palate and let us want more! This should look like a real superhero movie and feel it! Even this is a kind of fanfile. Attention to detail, character and action is indisputably real. Although this is a limited production of resources, it embarrasses big budgeted, starry, hyper-productions of "other" films related to superheroes. Here the main and accompanying characters work and look like they are real people. Finally, Superman who actually looks "great" and looks like the real thing! Batman as it should be, without a gorgeous rubber gimmicky body to hide thin physics for over-paid actors who do not deliver. I just want a reasonable Varner Bros to execute OK to produce the full length of the adaptation of this gem. I do not care if I go to a movie or a DVD, I would never get tired of watching. Only the plot is worth my hard-earned for this. I hope that the "big heads" on Marvel & DC productions will look and see what a super movie should look like. There's no more football "Batman & Robin," or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these little time managers and find out there should not be a reason to "invent" a hero for a movie, just to be the "bomb" of the theater. G. Color ... We need more directors like you!
