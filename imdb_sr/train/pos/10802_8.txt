I'm on the opposite end of the previous comment. First of all, I do not think this should have been a direct extension of "Pizda". I mean, it's not called "Pizdun 2" ... it's "Pizdun, too," which makes me believe that, although many characters are the same, it actually revolves around a completely different person. /> Think about it: practically has nothing to do with the previous movie, except the name of the characters; a completely different story; different cast; and the fact that it's partial music. I say this film needs a little credit. There is a lot of laughter in it ... Mark Blankfield at its peak.
