Bogmeister and others were quite knocking this up. Shore Leave is actually the first attempt of TOS in a lightweight sci-Fi (which will then be mastered by the classic Trouble with Tribbles). This has also given the company's crews and its television viewers a break from the outbreak of the universe, for example, Corbomite Manouever. Seeking a place to rest for some time, Enterprise takes place on the seemingly idyllic M-Class planet and sends the research team to look closer. Soon, all kinds of absurdity will begin - some seemingly dangerous - but all this seems to be that the hum of emotional extremities are played in a strange connection of a fantastic mystery (McCoi went through a mirror), a psychological thriller (Kirk is persecuted) of tireless silence from his past ), and romantic comedies (no comments). TOS was the least serial of all the series in the Trek franchise, so it's easy to forget how the episode in the first season focused on a difficult, potentially catastrophic drama. Unlike later serial writers, the TOS production team was not afraid to literally go where there was no TV series. And Shore Leave, despite occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the actors (especially Shatner - ironic with respect to his legendary sense of humor) seem to have no idea how to deal with this new battle on ST themes. The last scene is perhaps one of the worst scenes that can be recalled from the whole TOS - compositionally and in terms of action. "Nuff said." My recommendation - watch it while watching the whole first season, because it should have been seen - she orders.
