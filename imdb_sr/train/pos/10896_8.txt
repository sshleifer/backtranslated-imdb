At first I did not think that Ben Affleck could really pull a funny Christmas movie, the boy was wrong, my daughter invited me to watch this with her and I was not disappointed. James Gandolfini was ridiculous, I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O'Hara was good, the story is what she really sold me, I think, I'm too close to my family, at the table for people you can barely see but once or twice yearly, and you probably do not agree with everyone, you really need so much alcohol as your system is capable of handling Christmas, so I thought there was a good place there, a family of $ 250000 was a little far-fetched, but it turned out that she was working pretty good for me, because it was a rebellion to the end , it shows the class struggle of different families. there are many funny moments, including unpleasant things on a computer for a teenager. All in all, I loved this film and I will watch it again the next Christmas or before my daughter wants.
