When the United States entered the First World War, the government forced Hollywood to launch propaganda films. A LITTLE American is probably the best of all because it plays Mary Pickford. Pickford plays a young woman tangling between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raimond Hatton (French), but her decision was postponed because of the war, both reported. When Pickford sailed, the Germans sank (I mean Lusitania) because they carry ammunition, Pickford has a great scene while standing on a lifeboat and shouts to the German commander. Later, of course, she also encounters Holt and Hatton when she is held as a prisoner of war in the trap. Director of Cecil B. DeMille provides one really great scene in this movie as Pickford and Holt wander through a bombed village. They pass through the destroyed church from which only one wall remains. There is a huge crucifix against the wall. While standing and looking, the wall collapses, but the Jesus figure remains suspended in the air. This is a very surreal moment in a movie that is otherwise very clear and non-artistic. Pickford is, as always, a pleasure to watch. She was always a very natural actress who avoided a handwriting histrionist who used many other actors. She's also very beautiful. Holt is very good in the role of a leading man here. Hatton's fine. Among the list of actors in the "extra" parts are Vallace Beeri, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alekander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerri, Valter Long, James Neill and Edithe Chapman. It's not a great movie, but it's interesting to see American propaganda at work.
