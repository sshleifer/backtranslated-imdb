Nobody's gonna break this job better! Avesome movie! Experienced by Ira Levina and shown with the best performance of Christopher Reeve's career and one of the best Caine's, this is just great. I wish I could catch the prepared version somewhere ... maybe one day. I hope this very underrated, overlooked movie has not become too difficult to find because it's 'must' for every Hitchcock, Agatha-Phil or the great lover of a big movie. One of the rare films that I could not solve or predict immediately and worth the second or even third viewing, "Deathtrap" gets 9/10 and earns every jot. We need and deserve more of these films!
