Very few so-called "remake" can be as much as originals. This crosses that border with flying colors. Just remake, I do not think so! I watched him theatrical at the age of nine and was totally enthusiastic and delighted with the film. The film certainly calls for comparison with its 1963 colleague. The earlier film is also a fun and entertaining movie, but it is recognized that it feels more like a documentary of nature than a movie. This update is more epic and film. Still, I recommend both movies. This film is certainly indispensable for animal lovers. We have a wise old Golden Retriever, Senka; sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassi; and a young, fun American Bulldog, Chance. Animals brilliantly expressed Don Ameche, Salli Field and Michael J. Fok. In the movie almost nothing is offensive. There is little skatological humor, but nothing extreme. Without fierce violence, save a few tense scenes including waterfall, angry porcelain and dark iron shaft. the film won no prize, not one. Nevertheless, I must say that this is as good as some of the nominated for the best picture.
