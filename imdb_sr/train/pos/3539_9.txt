Good: Engaging movie fires, great presentations, vehicles are actually fun to drive, pretty attractive multiplayer, lively movie, and the list continues. Poor: The main missions are short. /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third person (not necessarily a spy). Great fighting continues the story and make you want to complete EVERY single mission and unlock all the right bonuses offered by the game. The hypo played this game, lived it up, and I personally think that you should buy, and connect with a few friends and play this. Lots of fun. The sound in this game is the rip-roaring achievement of several previous bond games, and the shooting weapon, it really feels like you're shooting a weapon. It's related to the aspect of being a deadly and merciless spy. All in all, this game makes you excited and happy after you pass, and some multiplier that can compete with the standards of crafty James Bond "Nightfire" game for gamecube.
