This movie that I loved since I was young! Perfect. Although, for an average film observer, there may be little if some subtlety can not be interpreted in the film (for example, the name of our hero is Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander he fired in the fifth rocket, just as Achill in mythology fired It's just a small fact that's fun! Anyway, an excellent movie, a good story, it would be a good idea to see how it's being processed with today's special effects! Strange, Gary Graham had an average success, acting in the TV show Alien Nation This film is funny and needs to be appreciated more !
