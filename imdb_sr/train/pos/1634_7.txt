For the first time I made a film on his first run at HBO (probably) in 1981 and I was 15 and I thought the film was hilarious. I remember I did not see Alfred E. Neuman's views are shown in the theatrical trailers. When the MAD magazine saturated the movie and suddenly halted halfway with the apology from the "usual gang" for dropping in such a piece of shit in satire, I just assumed they were having fun in myself, which I am sure are, to find them seriously (and Rona Liebman) so shamefully to remove their names from any loans, I was quite surprised. There must be a lot of bad movies with which to connect. Looking at the movie on the video now (at the age of 32) with the restored MAD references, I still throw it out. And as a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his crown performance (SAA IT AGAAAAIN)
