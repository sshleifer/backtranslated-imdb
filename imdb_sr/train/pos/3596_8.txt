I finally sat down and saw this movie all the way, and I must say, I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses - not just the fact that she can * behave, but rather chooses the roles that are most appropriate to her, which are more important and more important than what would first appear. I have read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some terrible feminist thing as they used to be, but I certainly disagree. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in her contrary to what virtually everybody thinks about her (except for her caring brother Tiny and her coach and manager, Hector, who proves that she is more of a father than her real parent), which is "feminism" is all about. It is good to see such films that portray the true side of feminism - that they are not a bunch of straypers - but that they have dreams and can do everything. Diana is true to herself while she still becomes a victim of love, and she and Adrian have more realistic, more complicated relationships, and not just something that works magically. The girl is a true taste of reality and returns some faith to my perception of people. Thank you, Michel. 8/10 - A very important movie that can be connected not only with young women, but with everyone who wants to go far in their lives.
