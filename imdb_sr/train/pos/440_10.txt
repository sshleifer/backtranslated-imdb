My favorite movie of all time. Work on the Oscars caliber of all participants, both in front and behind the camera. The script is perfect and elaborates the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfactory way, unlike the novel. The care that other leading figures have drawn is a tribute to Peter Barnes, a film writer, and intense visual beauty should have won the Oscar for director Mike Nevell and cameraman Rek Maidment. It's by far the best work of Josie Lavrence and has transformed my mind on Joan Plovright. Looking at this movie at least 50 times, I can not find any error in it. Music, the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennett is a miracle.
