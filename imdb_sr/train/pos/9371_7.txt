One thing I always liked about Robert Ludlum's thriller is when you think he understood it, it's going in a completely different direction. In this film there are so many turns and turns that my neck stays out of sight. The one thing I like and the director of John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that it can depend on its direction and, in this case, writes (with his brother Rick) a good story. Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flinn Boile and JT Valsh to the cast and have a story that will keep your interest even if they play the characters that they all perfected. Dahl seems to get the best out of the people, and that will keep you interested and guessing to the very end.
