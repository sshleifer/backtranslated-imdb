This is a wonderful movie with a fun, smart story and the dynamics of cultural differences and the topic of what is important in life, making this film very unknown. Do not let the cynics of the world stop you from seeing this. Keaton has wonderful moments and I wonder if the comedy never appreciates, because actors like Keaton make it from humor to serious bits extremely easy. A great movie everywhere around!
