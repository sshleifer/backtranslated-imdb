I felt the need to write a review for Space Cobra because it got a good score of 7.3 stars, but only a few reviews at the time I wrote this were particularly positive. A strange situation and I hope that my positive review will show people to this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space cobra is a funky story of a smuggler and rogue who intertwines with three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and a break with force that wants to exploit the power of the planet. This is an old film and animation, but what he misses in contemporary sophistication, seems to be with a lot of charm. Space Cobra is very adapted to the Western audience and is very easy to watch. There are a few, if at all, references to a specific Japanese culture and excellent for Anime novices to watch and enjoy. The Cobra itself is witty and cute. I can not tell how much it is because of the English dough or the intention of the creator, but this is one of the few Japanese comedic characters that are really funny. The style is very sixty years old Barbarellish with fantastic soundtrack Iella. The style is colorful and imaginative and there is a constant action to move the story to move. The strangest aspect of this film is how it begins as a comedy and ends up on a very funny dramatic note. I can not remember another movie or film that was able to do so impeccably and convincingly. You barely realize that this is happening, but it works so subtly and looks perfectly natural. You also feel that the characters went on their way and that the lives changed through their entire experience. Make sure you can.
