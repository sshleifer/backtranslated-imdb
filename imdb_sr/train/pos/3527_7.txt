Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fai Helm) at the bar and invites him to see the performance with him. It agrees on condition that they do not share information about each other - even names. Sometimes these are the best dates. However, when he returns to his apartment, he is awaiting Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team. Scott's wife was killed. His alibi is a mysterious woman, but no-one can not remember seeing her, and as a result, Scott was sentenced to death for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guilt and is moving in search of a woman who can save him from the death penalty. This is a good movie and the viewer is 100% behind the Kansas attempt to come to the truth. We follow it through some unforgettable scenes, for example, Her quest for Mac, the bartender (Andrev Tombes) at night and a claustrophobic place where Cliff drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) Took him to socialize, drink and dance while fighting with friends. This is so obvious an expression of a sexual desire that it is a prominent part of the film, as all of them intensely and rhythmically sweat during the duration of the scene. Ella Raines is good in the female lead and Thomas Gomez makes a cute policeman. Alan Curtis began as a confused, innocent man, but when arrested, his performance turned left until he became completely unpleasant for Kansas for no reason. God knows why he stuck behind him. The film does not prevent you from speculating on who the killer is as we know it halfway through the film, but that does not matter. In fact, it contributes to the tension and dramatic development of the story while we will discover Kansas what is going on and then go out! It's a good movie with some great scenes, but although Elisha Cook Jr has an unforgettable role, he never likes anything in what I see him in .... someone gives me a tie ...
