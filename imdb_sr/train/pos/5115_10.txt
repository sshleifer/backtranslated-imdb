I did not see this movie in the theater. I admit bias against Vinnie Barbarino. Who the hell did John Travolta make movies? I recall that Oscar was broadcasting those years, when Travolta seemed completely destroyed when he did not win. How dare, when in "running" there are "real" actors? I'm sorry, John, you should have won. After capturing this movie on the cable many years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissi, Uncle Bob, Ves, everything is beautifully done. I also admit that I never go when I surf the web. I have to stop and watch. Over the years, I've learned to do most of the dialogue, dance with thumbs in the belt, and I've learned to appreciate Travolta even more. The only disappointing thing for me was the overwhelming, sound-based, some of the music from Urban Covboia. The "Search for Love" defines the film, but Urban Covboi was full of classics who did not land on a soundtrack. It should have been a double CD ........
