I saw this for the first time when they showed it around the epoch of 1993/4, and then I did not think much of it, I bought it on a DVD last summer when I started to go to Michael Jackson (I loved it before) and I enjoyed it more I am older. It's a good movie, but it will not be this classic movie like The Sound of Music, West Side Story, Vizard of Oz etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good, as did other members of the band. There were disturbing scenes such as the girl Katie, who was gangster Frankie Lideo, played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turned into a robot. My favorite song on the movie is Smooth Criminal. I think it's better than Thriller.
