I think the film is educated. However, it does not address the issue that has caused so many controversies: plural marriage. Also, the movie fails to reveal what the LDS church is doing. There was a great opportunity for the world to say what they really believed. I could not get a clear idea of ​​what the LDS looked at the central themes of religion. I have many LDS friends and they are good people. It would be nice to get a clearer picture of how they see more controversial statements from their prophet. Perhaps those statements are too controversial to be treated in a movie format, but it would be great to hear the whole story about the truly interesting life of Joseph Smith. After all, he gives an insight into the American thought of religion in the 18th century. I hope to record some documentaries on this fascinating subject, allowing historians to comment on Smith's life. Maybe one day we will have a Mormon president. After all, Smith was running for president.
