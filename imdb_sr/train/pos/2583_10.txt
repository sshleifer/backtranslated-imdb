The biggest games of Kasparov or Fischer can be a mess for a total newcomer. This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in conspiracy. This is a trail! This is a PRIVATE parcel, built as a PRIVATE company. This is a self-destructive and self-organized plot. In conclusion, the scenario described the perfect professional action: private, self-organized, self-destructive, without trace at the end. Everyone can be behind conspiracy: a smart "director" with some money. Everything can be done only by a delegation. "Director" must be a trigger only. If a normal viewer can not see the essence of plot in explicit sequences of the film, the real plot has less chance of being detected. All performances by actors are well performed, with a special emphasis on Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
