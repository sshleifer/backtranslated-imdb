Hitchcock was of the opinion that the audience is not really interested in what puts the protagonists at risk - just that they are in danger and have to escape. This film proves that Hitchcock was not 100% accurate. Police believe Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime, apparently not. Trevor Howard decides that their best way to run is. And so, the body of the film is our charismatic couple that is moving away from the train, bus and bus - jumping over the wall at the top of the waterfall - crossing over the roofs of the shipyard. All good exciting things - but I could not get out of my mind that all this was unnecessary. They should have stayed. In other words, MacGuffin was not strong enough.
