Why are people boasting about this movie, not about horrific films like Kuma. Titanic is the biggest movie of the 21st century. With great acting, directing, effects, music and everything at all. This film is always rejected by everyone, because one day somebody said that they no longer liked it, so the majority of the world agreed. There is nothing wrong with this film. All I can say is that this film was not only the Oscar's most powerful film for the whole time, most of the money ever made and unfortunately one of the most unfavorable films I've ever seen. In addition, it is truly the best film of all time. The only films approaching the trilogy of Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings or any of the masters of Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good films and directors, but nothing matches the masterwork of James Cameron TITANIC.
