I thought that the whole film was going well with fresh pictures and interesting cinema all the way. The actors were at the top of their character's face in almost perfect time and they looked great. The music was lush and well thought out. He even had a decent turn. What about every vote? The story was not completely fresh (it felt like the rest of the Running Man with the whole idea of ​​a television show), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about the public choice of their Messiah must have sounded true enough. It made sense to follow one man who was placed in front of a modern pile and put it on a pedestal for his occasion. It's possible that Christians or other religious people pick up this because the movie has the word "God" in it, but it shows what filmmakers were trying to do is learn the possibility of people who may have never seen this world , especially in the modern world where Christianity is increasingly accepted and forgotten. of some. I gave him the 7/10 star here on IMDb. I thought that every part of the movie was fun and original, in most cases. Make sure you're not too offended to see a funny movie from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the coming modern Messiah on television in your vicinity.
