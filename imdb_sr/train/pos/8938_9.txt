A wonderful movie version of the best-selling book and broke Broadway's Sadie and Bessie Delani's life show, two African-American sisters who both lived over 100 years and told their story of witnessing the century of American history. Rubi Dee and Diahann Carroll give very good performances like Bessie and Sadie. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Hearth, a white New York Times journalist whose book about sisters started the book, etc. as in a book. This is the only real disadvantage, combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not shown clearly, such as the interracial background of mother's sisters and why their father was so strict. But in addition, a very well-made, exquisitely performed, powerful movie.
