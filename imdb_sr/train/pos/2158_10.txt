I do not like "inflation in class," but I had to give this 10. I can not think of something that I did not like. I saw him last night and woke up today thinking about it. I'm sure the Hollywood remake that somebody told me about, with J Lo and Richard Gear, would be great, but this original Japanese version of 1996 was so emotional and thoughtful for me that it's hard to push any way to improve, or that his setting changes into a different culture. The story I found worth watching is, and with those paintings that fight for hands or pistols or something like that! Imagine that! All the characters looked well developed, ... even non-primary characters had a good character character and pleasing acting, and the casting seemed very appropriate. It's always hard to find a good movie musical in our days and years, and maybe it does not qualify (there are many learning to dance, but no singing), but I really think that Gene Kelly and others advocated a place for dance in our lives so highly thought of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell the story of a middle-aged man, successful with his family in Japan, looking for something ... he does not know exactly what. People in Japan who contributed to this film, thank you for doing this and doing it.
