If you went to this movie to see some great reward for the academic prize ... well, well ... but if you wanted to see the funny wonderful adaptation of the old classic, you'll be pleased. Jim Carey was as unbelievable as usual. The story was excellent, several parts added as the history of Grinch made it even better. Ron Howard never missed a single victory ... But although several comments and adolescents of ADULT were added, this is assumed to be children or a family show. Try not to lose sight of this .. if you really do not enjoy the movie ... and as for the comment on Ron Howard, try to direct the main movie show and see how you do it .. It's not as easy as it looks ...
