Some films manage to survive only on originality - "Wonderland" is certainly one of these films. The scenario manages to throw everyone in the fever, but it does not seem inconceivable. The speed of this triloger is not to choose to hide a weak script, but to accurately display the reality that is added to the drugs. As director, James Coke is a very strange way of acting for his actors. Most characters are constantly on the verge and often because they are pretty ugly personalities. Val Kilmer described John Holmes as a hustler, capable of manipulating and controlling. No offense for Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems only to control drastically weaknesses. Still, this is a stunning performance. Comparing this to Kilmer's "Hollywood" roles, such as "The Saint", seems to prove that he is far more at home in indirect movements. Actors are the main force that holds it all together. There are various small shows that stand out - especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrov have a limited time on their screen next to their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. In addition to Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott, they give unusual, stunning energy to their roles. Originally I postponed the viewing of "Wonderland" because I assumed it was a movie about porn actors, in the strictest. meaning. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but this literally has nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this film is a mystery of murder, and as such - great. RATING: 7.5 out of 10
