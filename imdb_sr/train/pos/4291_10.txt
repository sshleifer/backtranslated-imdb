From the initial footage of the leading actor we get an early look at how women in them lead many men's lives, and the humor that comes through everything that happens in everyday 'normal' life. . Eric Lartigau, the director takes on himself that many European men feel they are in complete control of their lives, but without the help / support of women around them it can not seem that things are working. Using the image of a person throughout the film is great, and his smart positioning of an elderly family member (mother) is on the spot. Although the film is more than enough of laughter, it still deals with single parents / adoption and the strength of the family in society. Really rewarding for watching, and again what a French seam can do. For now, one of the best 50 films I've seen this year, and worth five start-ups. I'm looking forward to adding this to a DVD collection when it's published and I recommend it to all ages.
