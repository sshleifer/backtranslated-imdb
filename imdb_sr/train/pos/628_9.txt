This movie is fun. Actors are still making a movie. Without giving any complication, I would describe him as a new cult favorite Princess Brida who should endure the test of time. You can see the whole other side of Robert DeNir in this movie! (It costs only the price for it!) All the elements are here from adventure to romance, and well-placed comedy. (My parents have done it!) Good special effects can be daunting for small ones. Good movie. Great for some escapism. Deserves A. (I hope it's good at the box office)
