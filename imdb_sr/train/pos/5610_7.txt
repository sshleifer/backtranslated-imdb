Roman Polanski masterfully directs this type of variation on the same theme as the Repulsion. I can not imagine that there is a fair film that can not recognize a good director at Le Locataire, but both parts of the diptyk may not be entirely satisfactory to most people, including myself. Polanski is very good at feeling the internal torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), beginning with some lack of self-confidence to gradually turn into a psychological discomfort that eventually flourishes in irreversible physical illness. Joint pain for characters and audience is really different from the horror and tension of horror films, because there is no tangible supernatural element here. While horror films allow some kind of catharsis (cheap or complex), Polanski seduces us sadistically and if, in his last opus, dark humor is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves, not on the edge of our places. Anxiety, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the expectations of the audience (alternatively deceiving and filling), not literally with people's nerves. In my book "Rosemary Baby" there is far greater achievement because they are pure paranoia and simple rationality in a constant fight: the story is about a couple moving in an unusual apartment, while we are forced to identify with the only character. Moreover, if the elements of fantasy are in the hero's head, the situation is the most admirable, because we, the viewers, are forced to judge him, we reject him while we are masterfully lured ("farbamo mame") into him.
