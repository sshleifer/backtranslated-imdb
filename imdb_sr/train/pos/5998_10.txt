The girl is an incredible movie ... so uncertain and just so real! I was lucky enough to catch the 'The Cure' projection on her NIC premiere and it gave me a complete hunt! I also heard that he was awarded the prize at that festival, and he definitely deserved it. The first thing that hit me was cinema. Eric Giovon did an amazing job. The style of making a love scene in half the film was amazing. The love scene was necessary in this film, and Jafri crossed the spot, but he kept the scene tasteful. Giovon and Jafri make a great creative team and should definitely work together on future projects. The narration of Judy Maier was so unreal, but at the same time a distortion of the heart, for which I felt what the main character felt. I'm a very strong critic, but I have to say that Cure is one of my favorite films. If you have not seen it yet, look!
