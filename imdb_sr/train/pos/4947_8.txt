One can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take time to help someone who needs help. As Vill Rogers said, "I never met a man I did not like." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, what's wrong? That smile can melt diamonds. She is so fantastic that I can watch anything she is in. The same goes for Freeman. He's just magic on the screen. The two of them gave us a movie that was funny from start to finish. From Mexican supermarket to Lorraine and Bobby to Packy. She was gentle, charming and simply funny. You need to check this out.
