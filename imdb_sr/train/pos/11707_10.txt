I remember seeing this movie long ago, although at that time it did not have any special effects, the acting was really good. And it still has the same message for today, although technology has changed, maybe we should make remake of this movie, it would be interesting to see remake. I also enjoyed the music from the movie, Larry Norman was a really good songwriter at that time, although now most of the Christian music is now worshiping and praising music. I was always curious to know what happened to Patti after the end of the series? Did she continue to make more films, did she finally marry and raise her family? I'd like to have an update.
