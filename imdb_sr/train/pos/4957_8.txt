10 PRODUCTS OR LESSER was made in two weeks at the weakest budget of writer / director Brad Silberling, just a small film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the whole story is improvised ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling was fortunate to steal veteran actor Morgan Freeman, among his big projects, with Spanish actor Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different opportunities that manage to improve the life of the other. Morgan Freeman plays herself - but part of the comedy is to be portrayed as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting the location for a little "film filer" to get back into the flow of things. His "role" is to be the role of a market manager, and he throws himself to the market in Carson, where he encounters, amongst other things, with one Scarlet, a girl in the argumentation line of 10 or less. Not only is Scarlet tired of her statistic job, she is also generally angry with her husband, Bobbi Cannavale, who is currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy colleagues (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. Two pairs after several common problems and go on a "trip", which results in each character growing from the story of the presence and life of the other. It's a simple story, simply put it, but because of the gentle connection between Freeman and the Pasha, it works well. This is one of those small films about human relationships in which the message is vulnerable to change and exchange. It's good to look at, and this is a DVD that has features that are touching, informative and comical - a pleasure to watch. Builds Harp
