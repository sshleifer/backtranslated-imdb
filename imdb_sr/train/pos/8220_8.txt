The fourth in the series Dirty Harry, this film depicts one of the most depressing, arrogant, inexorable, profane, disgusting females I've ever seen on the movie: "Rai Perkins", played by Audrie Neenan. She is a modern embarrassing version of "Detour" from 1945, "Ann Savage." Her rude attitude about her mouth and gut had rejected me so much that I never watched this movie until I got a curse filter that closed it ... and at least some of it! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. Everywhere "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows ..... in a matter of minutes! It happens so often that it's almost funny, but it seems that a fast-moving movie seems to be entertaining with a satisfying ending, because all the evil thieves are eliminated one by one. This is a very sophisticated movie that appeals to our basic instincts ..... and connects, sad to say. Many of us like to see these dirt in the end, and who better than Dirty Harry?
