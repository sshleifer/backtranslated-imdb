Kurt Russell IS Elvis, simple and simple. His dedication to this role has resulted in what I think is the best film ever. If you're an Elvis fan, take a look at him if you can. Film made for television was filmed two years after Elvis's death. One tip, there are two versions - one for 180 minutes and one for 117 minutes. The only one to watch is longer. Shorter has more than one hour of recording. It just does not work because the scenes in it often depend on the scenes that are cut. This masterpiece takes you from the childhood of Elvis through his appearance as the greatest stars of the party. Shelley Vinters and Bing Russell (Kurt's real dad) are as good as Elvis's parents. Pat Hingle delivers a highly competent colonel Tom Parker. Lived King!
