It's a crazy scientist who creates a semi-shark - a semi-human type on an unknown island, then invites all his old business and academic friends to come and see his creation (a laugh), but actually wants his killer to kill him! Many bad GCI, stupid tangle elements and babies that sweat in tight t-shirts are followed. These monster films follow a similar formula, but this sparkles things with little humor (I guarantee people who did this with tightly tongued languages), not to mention sexy babes. But we mention those sexy pieces - a few hot pieces, in tight shirts, abundantly sweating. One is in the underwear at the beginning, the other at the end. Thank you, thank you, the creators of bad films! The plot is full of stupid things, the guy rides in a jeep, bangs it right into the tree, and then offers everything to leave the island with a helicopter. Yes, um, well, how to think about it for a while; we will call you. Sharkman is hilarious - or a horrible CGI or equally comedian in a rubber suit. A crazy scientist gives pretty good performance; he is evil, that is his motivation, he does not apologize. All in all, if you want a stupid, fun B-movie, this one should do the job.
