This film was one of my favorite details and I have to say that, unlike some other films I loved at that time, the thief from Baghdad kept his quality until I grew up. This is not just a movie that kids can enjoy, but can also watch and enjoy adults. The only disadvantage is that one can not see the past of 'bad' effects (compared to today's effects) as it is possible when someone was a child. I recall that none of these effects, of course, lasted ten years since I saw this film when I was about eleven. Who then looks at the effects? We are only looking for good stories and entertainment, and that's exactly what this film provides. In my opinion this film is one of the first great 20th century adventurous films. When I think of it, I feel that Indian Jones films are pretty similar to this film. There is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mixture that will catch you from the beginning to the end and although the movie is old, and the music and style of the films are obviously not modern, it is not dusty and old. All this is mainly due to the great story, good directing and good acting. In this department, Saba (like Abu) and Conrad Veidt (like Jaffar) stand out, who largely provide the comic and cool element of the film. A great movie and although 'oldie', definitely 'goldie'. I hope someone has the brain and the courage to release this DVD once. 8 of 10
