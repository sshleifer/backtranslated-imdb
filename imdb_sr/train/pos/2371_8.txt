I suggested that I rent this film to a friend and he made a commitment because he had already seen a movie and said he was OK. I thought the title was a bit logical, because the version in our store was called "Fear: Halloween Night". I expected this movie to be something that would match animals. But she was open with a good scene and the killer immediately killed two victims and celebrated twenty years later, when his son, who witnessed him, killed two people (including his mother), and even saw the suicide of his father, go to a hidden cabin in the forest with his friends and his girlfriend, where he tries to confront his fears until the wooden statue revives with the spirit of his fathers. It's pretty good to continue and I've never seen it first.
