This is one of those unique horror films that require a much mature understanding of the word "horror" in order to appreciate it. The main thing people may not realize is that this story is told through the view of a little boy and, as with most younger children, it is easy to be scared. Mostly because he just does not understand things, such as why his father barely exists for him. Watching a movie, you see a husband discussing a balance between working time and family time with his wife and you can easily understand that, but the little boy does not. It can also be imagined that the boy is afraid of the forest, as it was originally established in the film, that the family is from the city. Likewise, at the beginning, as the family traveled to the house, they hit the deer, then they stayed, then they argued with the local population about it, and the boy certainly did not consider this introduction to the forest to be pleasant at all. In the end, "Vendigo" is what his young, innocent mind invents to explain all this. There is an American Indian legend, but when looking at a scene the boy is hearing about, he is explained as open and simplified. Not because it's what Vendigo actually is, but because he understands it so. When you look at a movie from this point of view, you can really start to appreciate it. Obviously, it was cheap and inexpensive, but the jumps, the use of light and the general ghost were more than compensated. And the final question that the film asks is: is everything in your head, or is it really there? 8/10 Estimated R: profanity, violence and sex scenes
