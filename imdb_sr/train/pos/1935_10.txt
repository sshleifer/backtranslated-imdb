Writing something of a true and true challenge. It's even better to know how to record and compile it without being trivial. Ishai Setton's film is one of those in which you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. I've been touched by "The Great Bad Swim" and from now on I will promote it as much as I can. It's a shame that I can not show anything to friends (you know, like DVD ???), because the conversation is good ... but it's better to give something to see. Everyone can not go to festivals to discover such pearls, and this film really is worth it to be there! Many thanks to the staff of this master, and I am waiting for it to be distributed.
