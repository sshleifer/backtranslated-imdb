I was lucky enough to see it on the jokes during the film festival, and I was so dumbfounded that I saw that the next day I returned to the second of the three screenings. A funny, wild and sharp tooth attack on every aspect of the mainstream of entertainment, passively swallowed without tasting the target audience of the lowest common denominator, led by a self-advising journalist who slowly takes the members for his guerrilla war of predictability is that film is all about, and it was done in such an unpredictable and refreshing way of staying after the loans are restored, and hopes are renewed and excited as the original movies can still be made. Anyone who is frustrated with unfulfilled expectations that something will illuminate their imagination, it would be good to hunt (and I mean to hunt) this barely visible object. For lovers of the Fighting Club and any Charlie Kaufman film, and the necessary watching for anyone who avoids multiplex as a furious dog.
