You are not sure whether this is counted as a spoiler or not, so be careful: Just a small, but crucial thing to look out for, an intriguing possibility: the guys steal green Citroen at one point, to enjoy, and return to the owner who made the purposeful and vindictive hidden damage to the car, hoping that the owner would collapse. Is it the same car that was later stolen from the picnic family? We know that the original owner sold it. They go to the end of a dangerous road, which I understand is closed to everyone except for pedestrians for the last ten years. A brand new slope to the end of the movie. On the other hand, this film could be called the "Scent of a Woman". I do not recall another film, certainly not an American, that treats the woman's smell in such an honest and open way, like the "nose" of the fine Bordeaux.
