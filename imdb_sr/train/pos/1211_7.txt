I grew up on this movie and I can remember when my brother and I played in the yard and pretended to be in Care-a-lot. Now, after so many years, I can watch a movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy. If you are a parent and you did not watch this movie with your children, then you should just hold them in your arms and watch them bewitched by bears and taking care! Songs, especially "Forever Ioung" are very sweet and unforgettable. Parents, I recommend this movie to all children so they can learn how fun it is for others! When everything comes down to the garbage that is on TV, you can raise your children to have the right way of thinking about life with movies like these.
