I was completely preoccupied with this film from the first to the last minute. It's greatly captured, with many interesting and original camera angles and techniques used. The shop surrounds a deaf woman who is equally accepted by friends and colleagues. She hires an assistant at work, with her genuine intention to find love. He is a former prisoner and used him to avenge those who hurt her. In return, he must help him with a robbery that requires her lips to read. The film goes into a dark film noir, with several really great scenes, and even better finals. The real beauty in this movie comes from the way the director takes advantage of the disability of the leading character. The use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and dramatic shifts from silence to noise keep pumping blood, that's for sure. Include a little black comedy and the tones of erotic sexual repression that you made from a great movie. It's a movie Hollivood really wants to do, but she just can not.
