"Kum", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Good guys" None of the above can not be compared to the complex splendor of "Soprana". Each character has layers of absolute truth layers, completely and completely three-dimensional. We worry about Tony Soprano wholeheartedly, despite the fact that in the simplest model, he is good against evil, he is evil. Soprano is the most mind-boggling, hottest and fascinating protagonist ever created so far. If you are willing to be openly challenged as viewers, and to be forever changed in your feelings for the party, watch "The Sopranos". I'm forcing someone to sit down and watch the first episode of Season 1, and I do not want to continue with the series. Every season is brilliant in its own way. DVDs are necessary for any collection **** of 4
