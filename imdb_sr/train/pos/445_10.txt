The first time I saw Enchanted April five years ago. I liked it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy of the next Christmas. It's about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, leaving their lives behind. They are very sad women at the beginning of the film, and you can not help them use them while they are planning to do it with two more women who are calling to share the costs. This is perhaps the best movie I've ever seen. It's clean and simple, without a car spin, without animosity and without death. It was made carefully and in very good taste. You can not help but laugh through all this - except when you cry happy tears!
