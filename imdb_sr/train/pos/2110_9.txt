So much is written about the plot of the film, the wonderful acting performance, the script, the melancholy, the bitter atmosphere, the top direction - what can I add? Just watch out for one of the most subtle, beautiful scenes ever made. This is the Christmas tree and the image of Frank Morgan (the owner of the shop - Mr. Matusek) recovering from a broken marriage and attempted suicide. Since each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each of them defiantly rejects it. Everyone has plans for their own Badnjak. At this stage there is a deep sorrow for this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily leads to tears. Fortunately, we have a happy outcome on this particular scene. The new worker, the indebted boy, is the last one to leave the store in a beautiful snowy street scene. Despicable Mr. Matusek approaches this boy and asks him how he would like to spend the evening with him, he will treat him with all the wonderful Christmas food this boy probably did not see! lonely as Mr. Matusek and together they can have a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene, it moves me. If you manage to get a wonderful DVD view of the great trailer with Frank Morgan, who presents himself as Mr. Matusek and the appearance of the film director - talented Ernst Lubitsch. This film is a joy from the beginning to the end.
