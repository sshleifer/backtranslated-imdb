This film is still relevant today, even under the threat of bioterrorism and the threat of viral viruses from the western Nile and SARS. As a thriller, the tension is quite intense. Richard Vidmark and Paul Douglas are more than useful in their roles. The domestic scene between Vidmark and his wife gives a nice interlude to the main action. The actor in this film that left most of his mark is Jack Palance. His sharply defined characteristics and seemingly carefree exterior are always on their way to discover a cruel and cruel man beneath the surface. The hunting scene through the packaging factory is impressive today. Recommended, 7/10.
