I love Malle's documentaries. They are so simple and simple, but still so fascinating. I have no idea why this documentary works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. There are 5000 people living there and nothing is happening. Nevertheless, Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. His love for mankind, even racist or homophobic people, is so astounding that you just can not help but fall in love with them. He recorded most of the films in 1979. He returned six years later to see what had changed. It would have been a good film without material 6 years later, but this little addition makes it great. It may sound like Malle does only what's done in the Up series, but it's actually not. The Up series is about people. Mall's emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person, but on what happened to this community. And the change is high. In 1985, Reagan's era and farmers were suffering. Once proud community, now no one sees much future, and parents hope that their children will educate them and do something other than agriculture. This documentary is quite relevant today. Our financial crisis started today because of what was happening then. Just take a look at these last words in the film, uttered by the senior lawyer from the city (1985): "Well, I hope this country because things that are right now can be characterized in my mind just as obsession with greed, and the nation does not live long with that obsession, and especially democracy that ... There is good - there is good - many good in this country and many good people and they will not - will not subscribe to this philosophy of greed which it's happening now. It's terrible. "Unfortunately, it took more than 20 years and hell headache before that.
