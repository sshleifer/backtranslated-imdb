Bromvell High is a comedy for a cartoon. It worked at the same time as other school life programs, such as "Teachers". My 35 years in the teaching profession led me to believe that the Bromwell High Satyr is much closer to reality than the "Teachers". Scramble to survive financially, discerning pupils who can see through the sweeping of their pathetic teachers, the mercifulness of the whole situation, everyone reminds me of the schools that I knew and their students. When I saw an episode in which the student tried to burn the school several times, I immediately recalled .......... to .......... Highly. Classic line: INSPECTOR: I came to fire one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults of my age to think that the Bromwell Highway is far busy. What a pity that is not!
