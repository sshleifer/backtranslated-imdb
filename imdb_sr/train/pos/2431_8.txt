The famous was "famous" because of his tension and release in the style of a cartoon film in which the half-main character is in terrible danger, only to save him in the last second of the hero. This Casper is the only one I remember where death actually takes a hand. But even in death, there is still a happy ending. The constant in cartoon Famous Studios is that "virtue always triumphs". Popeie always comes to his spin at the time, Babi Huey always comes out with cuffs, Little Audrey always "teaches his lesson". And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. You need to give them credit. how much I like Loonei Tunes and "Tom and Jerry", I do not think anyone has put a better cartoon product at the time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (great Vinston Sharples), editing, voices. They were a consistent and excellent example of the best that art could offer.
