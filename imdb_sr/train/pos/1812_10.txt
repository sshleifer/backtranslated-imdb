This is one of the biggest movies ever, perhaps even the biggest movie ever. I forgot about the film for about 12 years. Until I saw the addition to the TV for ADGTH and it brought me nice memories of me while I was little. And when I watched him a few nights ago, I became addicted to the movie. I usually do not like animated family movies, but this is special because it is a perfect family movie. incredibly better than all the garbage that appears today for children's movies. I think that film G is estimated also that about 2 dogs involved in gambling have a lot of smoking, drinking, killing, death and hell shown in the movie. Which I believe makes a movie from good to excellent. I think movies do not bring reality to children today, and in this film they did it. RIP Judith Barsi and Dom DeLuise
