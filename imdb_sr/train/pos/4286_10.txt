I saw this film (the title of the English is "Who is singing there?") At the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival. Then he won ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It's great. Sublime, funny, sad and extremely fun. The scenario is an artwork. It's been 19 years and I've seen only a few comedies (or any other genre) that can match its originality.
