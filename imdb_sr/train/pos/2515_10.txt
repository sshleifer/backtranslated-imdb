Moon Child, featuring Japanese rockers Hide and Gackt, was a better movie than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and immediately became one of my favorite films. Set up in Mallepa, the story follows a group of street orphans, Sho, Shog's brother Shinji, and Toshi who are looting and killing making money for life. On one robbery, Sho meets Hideov Kei, a burning vampire burning in the sun. Through rough events, Kei's real nature is shown, but nobody rejects him. Time passes and implies that the immortal, constantly changing Kei erected Sho, and the two of them have an extremely close bond. Sho and Kei then meet with the Son in an unmanageable gun battle, and become quick friends. Both Kei and Hide fall in love with Sina's sister, Ii-Che. The time again skips forward and shows the grown up Sho, this time without Kei. He also explains that Sho and Sin became enemies. Through the tragedy, after the tragedy, this film bursts into the reality of life and all its difficulties, focusing on friendship and love. It's a really touching movie that's sad at the same time, but nice. As for acting, I think Gack had a great job. Hide did an incredible job for the first timer. The recordings were beautiful, but the film had rare and short terrible footage. All in all, I have to say this film is amazing, it moves and I recommend it.
