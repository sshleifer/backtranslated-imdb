The first time I saw this movie in the '80s, but now this thriller is still up-to-date. Some recent movies focus on similar topics, but they do not coincide with this French milestone. The president - obviously JF Kennedy - gets a bullet in an open car during a public appearance. The result of a huge investigation is that Lee Harvei Osvald is guilty of this film, but one jury member insists on further investigation. He reveals some surprising evidence ... Unlike JFK Oliver Stone - a film with the same plot - this is not played by emotions, but is concentrated in the exciting description of the plot and how it fits, drawing a new picture assassination. Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared with JFK, this film is more intelligent, more intelligent and exciting. Parts of the action can be found in much more recent films, I had some sort of deja vu that sometimes sits in the cinema. "I ... comme Icare" is "must see". Unique and brilliant, and Ennio Morricone's music is wonderful. This film deserves a very good ranking, if it was a Hollywood production, it would certainly be known. <br /> <br />
