It was an extremely small budget (some scenes seem to be recorded with a home video recorder). However, it has a good pay line, and it's easy to track. 8 years after shooting her sexually violent father, Amanda was released from the psychiatric department, with the help of her doctor with whom she has an affair secretly. The doctor gives her a house and buys her car. But in the first 20 minutes of the film Amanda killed him and buried him in his backyard. Then he sees that Richard's neighbor looks at him and he stops nothing until he gets it. It works innocent, but after another neighbor Buzz finds out that Amanda killed that doctor and tried to kill Richards' wife Laurie (this was after Amanda and he put it in a hot tub). Then she ceases to act so innocently and kills Buzz, and later attempts to kill Richard who she allegedly likes and cares about. And you'll have to rent a movie to find out whether Amanda is dying or not. Overall a good movie, a lot reminds me of my life, you know the whole fall on your neighbor and nothing stops you until you get it.
