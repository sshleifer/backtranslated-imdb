In his first release as a Hollywood director, Henry Bromel screams with a fascinating yarn that is all from prodigious marital problems with melancholy authenticity, and, as with the equally absorptive backing of the work, father-son hit-man, and bonding. The film is directed asthmatically and consists of a superbly composed actor as well as a fast, family-conscious scenario (also Brommell) that brings life into a otherwise tired genre. As a bonus, 'Panic' delivers subtle, sharp humor - unexpectedly, indescribably charming, and very welcome surprise - through its messy, insecure, low key star, whose conscious state is tempting, especially forever, the great Villiam Maci again catches our hearts like Alec, unhappy, torn, husband and father of middle ages who finds consolation in the most controversial: a young, attractive, equally ruined 23-year-old Sarah (Neve Campbell), who is in a waiting room at the psychologist's office, waiting for Dr. Josh Parks Talk about his growing desire to leave the family business that his father built (Donald Sutherland). Alex, whose desire to lead a new life is obstructed by the fear that he will disappoint his dictating father, creates an unreasonable idea for Sarah, which in the end leads him to grasp the essence and indisputable responsibility of being a wife to his wife and, more importantly, , a good father to his six-year-old son, Sammy (enthusiastic actor David Dorfman). The brilliant 'Panic' of Henry Brommell is a rare rarity in Hollywood that is rarely seen (except in 2002 'The Road to Decay') since its conception in 2000, it's two controversial genres (organized crime, family drama) into a fascinating, warm watch that is equally strong in both directions? it's the one who will retain his exceptional, rare caliber and luminous honesty in the years to come.
