I've seen almost all the films of Cinthie Rothrock, and for me this is the most fun. It reminds me of the early films of Jackie Chen. However, Ms. Rothrock may not be the best actress, but she is very good at watching as a martial artist and as a very sweet young lady. This film, though probably not the best of all of her films, was the most entertaining.
