I thought that the original of this film was strange and charming, and that I was sitting on the edge of the seat trying to figure it out. Since I already saw the original, when I saw this Sci Fi Channel - I do not know if this remake was intentionally made for Sci Fi - I knew what it was in the first few minutes. Since I like Richard Burgess as an art actor, I wanted to see how he would do it. Writers / producers, etc., have slightly modernized the film trying to explain the difficulties of "aliens". "(They could no longer reproduce their kind and needed help) using the same pseudo science that was stuffed in our ears of the 90s. Maybe the film added a little nuance, or not. This film. "This production takes on a more evil edge than the original one - the original ended with a confrontation between a young woman and an alien, and there was something sensible, although there was no solution to alien problem." I kind of remember that in this remake of a woman became quite hostile to Burgi / Alien - I think it might be better to finish. But for The ruffle is just an ending, and the toy is a brilliant yarn, which is a basic science fiction from 1958. Many great science fiction stories have been written in the 1950s, and some of them have even been filmed. This is a great thing to watch as a rainy day or something. I highly appreciate the processing of the old 50-year-old Sci Fi, this one went well. In fact, I enjoyed this in enough. if someone wants to see this story, it's well said, I suggest the original version of 1958 with Tom Tyrone and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
