I saw a movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was nicely made, from cinema to acting. It is a story of father and son and how they are costly to each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written by a dialogue that never lies, the film shows the acting talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among other things in this extraordinary acting edition. The film begins with an old father (Peter Falk) who is trying to figure out why his wife (Olimpia Dukakis) left him. The father, unannounced, represents at the threshold of his son and daughter-in-law. The father and son leave the next day to look at the property and finish the classical journey. Fish, play a pool, watch a baseball game, get drunk, get into a fight, and dance with strange women. But more importantly, everyone faces unspecified tensions that can affect each family. It's a movie that touches the heart and makes us appreciate those who are closest to them.
