Most of the movies about monsters from the atomic age that I saw on television as a child - some of them, including the BLOB, scared me for days. Movies such as INVADERS FROM MARS have made us "little fish" too clear that children should not be trusted when it comes to things like the Homevorld attack; BLOB just repeated that fact. I remember, delighted, late nights spent on the floor, observing that Snatchers and the Mars Invaders and Blobs penetrated the innocent society. It was summertime in the early 1980s, when the local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) each weekend led the classics of the atomic age. These were films of 16 mm, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the "color" of the BLOB prints faded to the pale pink color - but, man, it was fun. I dragged my mother, and she enjoyed as much as I did. I was right there in the Science Museum, really fell in love with THE BLOB. The director's intention was, of course, that because of the money - but because of the sincerity of all who took part, from the director of the film to the "talents" (player), I fell in love with this film. Corni? You can bet. Cheesi? They do not get any cheesier. But, man, what a movie!
