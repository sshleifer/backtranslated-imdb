This film perfectly describes the suffering of the ALS victim (Lou Gehrig's Disease). The subject is compassionate and humorous. Helena Bonham Carter is so convincing as a person with ALS that it was hard for me to believe she was just acting. Kenneth Branagh, a top-notch actor, meets expectations as a weird, poorly performing artist and is forced to socialize with Helen's character as part of his "community service", an alternative to prison time. Looking at the development of the relationship between these two things is a treat from the beginning to the end. The fact that this fairy tale does not diminish fantastic performances. One comes to the care of the two of them.
