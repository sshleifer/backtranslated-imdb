Together with King of the Rocket Men, this was still repeated on BBC TV in the early and mid-eighties. If I loaded the time capsule of this period, both of these series would definitely enter. Someone watching it for the first time will think it's stupid, but this is one of the best examples of "Serials". Don Del Oro will laugh at you (When I was a little for him, Mr. Dustbin was a head) and it was funny when I shot at him and said, "Your bullets can not hurt me," then he stumbles back, seemingly less of luck. I also like the way he gave up Sebastian in the first episode. I watched this again because I had good memories of it from years ago, there are some good cascades and good music, you have the ingredients you expect, including water, slopes, flares ... Besides the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner) fencing was not as good as I remembered it, and it has an inevitable "flashback" episode! He gets 8 out of 10 because he still suffers from slow pace, falls and other tricks. If you are interested in these series, I recommend the book by Villiama Vitneia, "In the Door, Into the Fight, Out the Door, In Chase", although there is only a small contribution to this series.
