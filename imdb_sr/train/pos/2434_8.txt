I often wondered how CASPER was intended for children ... with all the issues surrounding his identity (in this film we are led to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, because his home is a graveyard), as well as the disturbing message brought by this Movie. Perhaps Casper meant more as a moral game, or Famous Studios felt like breaking new scenes in the cartoons of 'reality'. GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a well-animated project - no doubt. However, concern is the development of plans involving a fox (which becomes Casper's friend, but encounters a tragic ending). Give credit to a famous studio - they respectfully deal with death ... The picture of Casper's grief is quite graphic and disturbing for children (although the plot offers a happy ending, but I will not end), and violence is pretty steeply, even for the standards of 1940. <br /> <br This could be a good cartoon for parents who will help explain the death of children - but I would not put it in a video recorder for a nasty cartoon.
