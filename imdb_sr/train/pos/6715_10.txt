I loved to watch "Sabrina, Teenage Vitch" on Friday at ABC's TGIF. I think this was one of the best performances on TGIF. My friends and I were gathering every Friday just to watch this show and never missed an episode. He was lovely and so ridiculous. And I liked Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey. It was HOT. I think Melissa Joan Hart played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes are "Sabrina through the Mirror" and "Hilda and Zelda: The Teenage Year". These episodes were great. All in all, I really miss this show. I hope one day ABC will return it with new episodes. I'm giving this show a 10/10 star.
