This will probably not be chosen for the best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and cavities. However, we are talking about a movie in which a hit man and a white bread retailer become friends, so several chores should not be too much a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, went by the wooden James Bond (the role he was ruined). If she can maintain this kind of quality, I hope she will continue to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also great as Brosnan's real man. I read a few negative comments about Hope Davis, but I thought she was pretty good as a housewife with a dark side buried deep inside. There are many good smiles while Brosnan breaks through and a few scenes where I almost died of laughter. My father (consultant) almost lost when Julian described himself as a "facilitator". Similar to Grosse Pointe Blank, another hitman comedy, humor can be very dark. If you are in that, be prepared to enjoy.
