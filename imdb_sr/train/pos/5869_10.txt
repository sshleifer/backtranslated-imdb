After just looking at the deer hunter, which is a masterpiece, Jackney's film had big shoes for filling. He has the same topics as the deer hunter, the devastating effects on a person after the war in Vietnam. as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here, as well as Kathy Baker. but this film belongs to Ed Harris, which gives a powerful, emotional and effective performance. The film is based on a scene game, and there are one or two scenes. where it was obvious to me that I only think that for one or two scenes I feel that I am watching the theater play. It was not that big a thing, and it does not actually diminish the movie. this film is not epic like The Deer Hunter. They are similar era and have similar themes, but there are two very different films. I thought Deer Hunter was excellent, and I also think this movie was great. In what makes it so great for me, Jackney is 10/10
