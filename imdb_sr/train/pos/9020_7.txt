The theory of the flight is an interesting study of the image of the artist (Branagh) who wants to free himself from the boredom and mundane, and the incurably ill patient (Bonham-Carter) in the final stages of ASL, confined to a wheelchair, who wants to make Love towards man before what dies. Helena Bonham-Carter exhorts with humor, defiance and independence as an ASL patient who practically depends on the people around her to take care of her. Kenneth Branagh, convicted through the community service to take part in caring for her, completes Helen's charm with a melancholy melancholy, creating a sentimental, compelling love story in which two people try to help one another find the path to happiness, before expiration time.
