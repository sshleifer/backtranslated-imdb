A real movie about a dark noir and a very graphic film, a nice story of a redemptive man, who may have just been interrupted too late. Visually there are some truly beautiful scenes that are artistically incredible in terms of what can be done with a minimum budget. Completely evaluated by Gareth Makvell Roberts and the team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, although, I hope, more British actors were great. Lisa Rai looked lovely and she did not see her and hoped she would see her again in the future. The subject of all interesting sex, drugs and violence. Bring. I'd definitely say that I'm renting this and checking if you're in the mood for a half-witty noir.
