This movie was great. I did not expect to complete all the hypo, but it did not. Like all Bourne movies, action is fast, real and intense. If you like the other two films in the trilogy, you will also appreciate this. The film's action is clear and there are no complications that are too unrealistic. All right, the figure of Julia Stiles, who appeared in the Italian safe house, was kind of tense, especially after what happened in Supremacy, but it makes sense that she is the only character in the "Treadstone" that Bourne knows he does not want a dead and he was the only person to lead him in the right direction. The action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening around them. The thing I've always loved in Bourne's films is that Bourne can kick, but when they match up with people who are as good as he is, fighting is fighting and he takes a lot of damage in them. They never treat the audience as idiots. All actors were solid in their performances. I believe that Damon could play Bourne in the dream and get excellent support from Joan Allen, who again took over the role of Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this film and trilogy. I miss Frank Potente.
