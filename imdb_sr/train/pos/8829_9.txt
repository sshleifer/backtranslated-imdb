More directors like Nacho Vigalondo need a greater exit for their talents. 7:35 De la Manana is an absolute genius. What Nacho is capable of transmitting in 8 minutes takes several hours Hollywood director to achieve a movie. I watched it laugh, but it felt a little dirty, not sexual. Sit and wonder how you would feel after watching this 8 min. nugget. I was having fun, but at the same time I was upset. Few people can do this in just 8 minutes. It starts simple enough. Young women come to breakfast in their usual place. She sits down and somebody starts singing. From there, the film takes you through so many different emotions that are suddenly difficult to describe. It's in black and white, but it helps in the feeling that the film gives you. This movie makes you want to know more about characters, how they interacted earlier, and how the ending affected their lives after that. I guess it's like an old saying: "Leave them over", Nacho Vigalondo is able to do it. Look at this when you can. Show it to your friends and ask yourself how 8 minutes can be so much fun without removing clothes.
