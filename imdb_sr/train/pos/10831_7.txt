A great actor works this movie; all the characters are very well developed and it's clear that the actors enjoyed filming this film. Not exactly that comedy I expected, much easier look at the attempt to return youthful glory than the ruthless humor. . For lovers of music there are many subtle references that are intelligently funny in themselves. I hate drawing direct comparisons with other films, but so much this movie reminds me of Alan Parker's films that you can not help: Imagine that the commitments really did great - and then tried to bring it back again 25 years later .
