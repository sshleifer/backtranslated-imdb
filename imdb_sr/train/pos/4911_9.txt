This film has become one of my favorite pseudo-noir experiences over the past ten years. Each of the three series of stories given to us by Kazan have their own unique and separate pleasures. Home chatting between Bel Geddes and Vidmark, moving between rooms, small gestures such as the phone book Barbara puts on a chair under her son so that she can get to the table, those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife, all are well made and natural. Most of all, I love their porch, the other living room where it's clear they spend a lot of their summer time. The second thread is a professional relationship between many in the film, but especially between Vidmark and Douglas characters. He may not be completely genuine and has a little glitter, but everything comes all the way, real, respectable and effective. The third thread, a hunchback about Blakey and his little gang, brings us closer to the dark and frightening Noir world. Flash Blackie is cold as a block of ice. This self-proclaimed businessman, this man who created himself, obviously has a complexity that we only touch briefly. For me this film is still a completely satisfying experience.
