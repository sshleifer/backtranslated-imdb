The case is that you are in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating movie. It's easy to understand why Chavez is so popular among his people. He does things. It's affordable. And it's easy to see why the West so much hates it. He has control over the resources of his country and returns profit to people. Mostly poor. It's easy to see how TV stations can display the wrong images to put them there. Just like the war in Iraq, or war on terror. Or those who lack VMD. Or about the axis of evil. People should wake up. And you get different views. Stop the new consultants who rule the world. Go watch this open-minded movie. And make your mind. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russo: America: The Freedom of Fascism. It's not a problem for the Americans. It's the government.
