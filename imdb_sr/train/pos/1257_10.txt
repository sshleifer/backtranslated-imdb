I have read a lot of criticisms of this film and I have to say: "What about you people?!?!" This was a great movie! I thought this film was excellent from the beginning to the end, and the story was extremely good. I am convinced that people who did not like this movie did not pay much attention to the film. There are several very important scenes that, if you do not pay attention, be confused and the following scenes may not make sense. I invite anyone who does not like this movie to look at him again and watch him, so you can really pay attention. My story was perfectly reasonable and, as I said, it was very well said. Every scene in the movie has a point and everything fits at the end of the movie. All actors have done a fantastic job! Sean Conneri was very good in his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was great as Tanny Brovn, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was a nice touch, and it looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I did not expect anything from him, but he performed a great performance. Ed Harris was a real gem in the movie. He plays a really sick individual and really tells you to see how his character is disturbed. Look at his eyes in his scenes, just great !!! Also, there is a young Scarlett Johansson (like Kate) in one of his first roles ... not a bad place to start. A great voice in this movie! I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who loves any actor or loves a thriller. This is a great movie and I need to see it. Do not listen to all these people's opinions, go to the movies and come up with your own conclusions. I hope you watch the movie, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading, - Chris
