I do not remember seeing this before tonight, probably that name sounded so commonplace that it passed me. But it was well-made b West, with an interesting story about which he copied the acting from good to grunted. He remains a Mayor for some time. As usual, good business people have different emotions - they want to get rid of bad things, but as a job they bring. Laws on relaxed drinks and gambling are still being applied and encouraged by industry, but they are pretending to condemn the bad effects that can have on ordinary people. What is fascinating in this film is Mitchum's cynical intensive display of the city's cleanlings from bad ones, and the citizens acknowledged that his violent methods were the only ones. The favorite piece: a sudden ruin of 2 villains in the Red Dog salon. Ignition of the main salon bordered it with nasty, but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison. for Do-Gooders, who would probably prefer negotiating with evil rather than end it.
