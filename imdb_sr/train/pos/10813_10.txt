I turned this over to see the incredible Ethel Vaters, whose autobiography I'm reading now. I will admit that my jaw fell when pork chops and watermelon recommendations began to roll, but people can not watch this film as a stereotypical or racist part. It's a rather short film of black people for black people at a time when the entertainment industry was fairly segregated, and stereotypes about the people involved were jokes of their time, old trends exaggerated for humor. We see that modern black films do the same thing, but with new trends (stereotypes), "ho" and "hood" and the like. I think if you look back in about eighty years, you think that today's movies will look equally racist. What viewers should understand about this film is the talent of Vaters and Sammy Davis Jr., who pulls out his modern Shirley Temple, and looks stunning as well as an adult. Everyone who was involved in this movie obviously had a great deal of fun. Why do not you enjoy what you are, instead of what you think it was supposed to be?
