I loved the way the EARTH was made. His photo is incredible, editing must be an interesting challenge, and Patrick Stevart's voice is PERFECT. In addition, music and sound editing make the Earth look through the deep experience you do not want to miss. You are really on the way to a place where you will probably never end up alone. Although, initially, I was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience while we watched the animals in their daily struggle for survival, sometimes I could not laugh. Nature simply seems impressive to figure it out. But instead of the need for laughter, I left the cinema with the deep question: "How can 200 years of industrial revolution destroy the natural systems that exist here for thousands and thousands of years?" <br /> <br /> With this issue in mind, you will realize that I felt a bit bitter and powerless after I saw the COUNTRY. I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to cancel the changes that we passed through past centuries and to stop global warming at once (all that is not an NGO activist at all!) ... <br / So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the movie to see what I can do to save our - a fantastic planet (and a polar bear) from its depressing destiny. (vvv.loveearth.com) </ br> I was a little disappointed that I did not find direct answers to my questions. However, it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the battle that the crew had. I hope it will reduce my energy consumption. I do not know how to otherwise shorten the distance of polar bears to swim to reach the earth before drowning or attacking animals that can not be beaten in their exhausted state ... Inspirational film is, but I did not leave the cinema feeling happiness.
