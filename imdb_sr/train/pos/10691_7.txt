Last night I caught this on the meal. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia 3 different times (adopting our two children). I can not put my finger on exactly why this film liked me, except watching the "bad" turn of "good" and "good" turning "half-poor." I liked the look of Ben Chaplin through the whole movie. Like "I can not believe it's happening to me" is it good or bad it's the same look (and it works). Great ending. 7/10. Rent it or catch it on a meal just like me.
