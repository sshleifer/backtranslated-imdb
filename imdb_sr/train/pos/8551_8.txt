These% s and As *, a lot of boobies. Some great characters, fun filled pranks and well put together teen actions in this spin off of Amercan Pie franchise. This is a really old school. I feel a bit like Porkis for the 2000s. Some great funny characters, combined with some very witty situations, make this a real surprise for me. We will not be too excited, you have to take it for a cute teen comedy that is, but for what it is, it stands out. The characters are cute and entertaining, the girls are warmer than hell.

Do not expect the classic American Pie, but expect something that will make you laugh and draw attention for an hour.
