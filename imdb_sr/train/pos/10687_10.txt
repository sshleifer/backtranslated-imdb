I must admit I was completely shocked by this film. First of all, I went to see him in a hirou expecting something central, but given that, the shocking thing was that it was in a populist American film in general. This is a British comedy at its most beautiful - dark, weird and fun in the way American films are simply never. I must, however, stop to recommend this with all my heart to everyone; I went to see him with a few people, some English, some European and some Americans, and while some of us liked them (mostly from the first two groups), some hated him and thought it was worthless. If you think you are in such things then go. If not, do not. 10/10.
