I never saw him on TV, but I rented a DVD via Netflika as soon as I discovered it was available. I had great expectations and I was not disappointed. It's funny, and the animation is great. That level of quality that I would expect only from feature films, I am surprised by some bad comments. Perhaps the DVD edition has improved the animation? One DVD bonus is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I'm an adult and I really appreciate it for adults. These are not just children who love sweet animated characters. It is not even near "rude" as some claimed, but I see where some parents would not want their little children to see that. I am very disappointed that it was canceled. I'd like to produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
