This is an extremely powerful movie based on a true story that can be disturbing to watch. I say this, because how much brutal damage can be to people, in this case, an innocent Australian couple is charged with killing their baby. but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's just say that both were excellent, but the role was a bit tougher for Streep because she had to learn Australian emphasis. (She taught me so well that I had difficulty understanding it in parts.) Without taking anything, all I can say is that this film will emotionally carry you.
