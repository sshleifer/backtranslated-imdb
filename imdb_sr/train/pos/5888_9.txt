I was able to watch this movie as a whole and I was deeply touched by it. I was not sure whether it was actually a comedy or a drama - it had elements of both. Marie Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper looked beautiful - our picture of 60-year-old women must have changed from Aunt Bee! They are lively, beautiful, sexy! The only drawback in this film was that it was not even mentioned about other characters in the "MTM" or "Rhoda" shows of the 1970s. I thought that, since it was set up in New York (where Rhoda was set up), at least some mention of her sister Brenda or to appear Julie Cavern, assuming she is still in a big apple. I hope ABC will make this series and return guest performances to all of the old casts of these shows. By the way, what's wrong with the CBS that is working on this reunion, or what series? Was not that the network that transmitted "MTM" and "Rhoda"?
