Friends of Secondary Schools Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel announce the war to their colleagues and plan a frightening attack on their high school. As the deadly countdown begins to their last act of revenge, the two of them start a video diary to explain their feelings and describe their mission. Why am I giving this? To compare two films, of course. I must say, although I liked the "Elephant", this is a much better movie. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for the beginning, this was recorded differently, much like the Cloverfield, Blair Vitch Project, and the "Dnevnik mrtvih". This makes the movie even better because it is much more painful realistic. But what won me was that the film was willing to show "the other side of the story". You meet these two shooters, unlike the "Elephants". I actually worried about one of the shooters and I could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This movie actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white. To be honest, that's why I almost cried in this movie. Characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions. You can understand them. It's not that they want to kill people for attention. All in all, this film is emotionally attractive and very boring and much better than the "Elephants".
