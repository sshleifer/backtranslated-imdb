I did not read all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that a 30-minute version could be shortened. I am curious because later parts of the film simply did not make much sense even when I reviewed them again. And 30 minutes seems to me very short for the movie. "The Bad Little Rich", which Tourneur's next film lasts for 65 minutes, and the "Pride of the Clan", which was his previous feature film, was 84 minutes long. It makes it easier for me to see that I am not crazy, that it must lack part of the film and that's why the resolution did not make much sense. It's hard to review or comment on a movie that you can only see half ... but I would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating look that gives us insights from this film studio on the east coast. It's the earliest film I personally saw, based on the film industry itself. The main character is a film star played by Robert Varvick, who later acted as a Hollywood actor and appeared in almost all of Preston Sturge's films. He plays the western actor who may be unclear by the example of Villyama S. Harta, which Varvick resembles. After the really fascinating sequences in the studio, we see them shooting a location where the girl from the country (Doris Kenion) finds out, and she convinces her to come to Nev-Jersey on a screen test that goes badly. After that, the film seems to be missing the larger parts in the form we now have. Again, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of the film for documentary value, but in a form that does not hold it as a movie and is not a particularly good example of Maurice Tourneur's work.
