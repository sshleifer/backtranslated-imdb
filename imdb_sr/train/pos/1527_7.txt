Delighted when it came out, this movie now looks nice and sounds great. The feast of the intelligent acting cast, from Gielgood, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrevs and especially to Anton Valbrook, and the central performance of the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger does not jump around and shows up - his long-delayed passions encourage you to listen and think, and Graham Greene's script summarizes Shaw without sacrificing complexity. up for it. Too many contemporary films on 'historical' topics can not resist being disturbed. What would Mel Gibson do from Maid? Many had fired on the shelf, and then they rocked on the grill while the flames were holding. Preminger does not do any of this. It is burned up mainly through a guilt-induced reaction. There are several poor performance but insufficient to cause serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and I did not expect to watch it, but it caught me. In the era of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, John's story has an unexpected resonance.
