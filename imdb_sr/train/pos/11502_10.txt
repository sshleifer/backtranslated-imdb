As a forty-year-old urban explorer / photographer and long-time fan of the original Kolchak Night Stalker since my early childhood, one aspect that did not really mention the amount of urban research Karl's character accepted during the series. He has always managed to find himself in one large abandonment, sewerage or tunnel after another. Armed only by his reliable lamp (okay, so he had some torches in the primary tunnel of a monkey episode) and his camera, he never wore any other equipment to protect or facilitate research. Many here, I recently purchased a set of DVD boxes of two pilot films and later TV shows, and I slowly reviewed all the shows. And although I remember seeing them in the early 70's when they were first emitted, it's been over 30 years ... so many of them look new. Campi, dated and cheesy, but charming and very fun. They just do not do this sort of thing these days. Now all his returnees are with predictable characters and complications. Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter sat to watch episodes with me and she developed gratitude for them (she enjoys them in the genre). It gives me the hope and faith that the series will continue with the new generations of fans in the coming years.
