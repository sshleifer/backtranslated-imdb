Do not let my constructive critique prevent you from buying and watching this classic Roma Schneider. This film was shot in a lower budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to make it due. They came too fast. That probably could not have been helpful, but the castle that they rented for the film was Austrian. When they tell her that she is the queen, she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her, where are the British citizens on the side of the castle cheering for their new queen? Why does not the ISBN show her on the balcony to greet her topics? Low budget! Where does the audience then realize these imperfections? I wonder how the critics felt when he met Prince Albert on the home scene, but the ISBN was not excited about it. During a meeting in the dining room, you hear music from the famous old American civil war songs such as "My Old Kentucky Home" and "Old Black Joe". What? city ​​war songs from the 1830s? Is Romi Schneider presented as Scarlet? Does she also play Magna Shnieder? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashlei? What was that in the mind of Marishka? Well, this is a supplement to the camp. This is the only reason you need to collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction Germany and England are linked
