I did not approve "Still Crazi" with any real expectations. Another rock'n'roll picture, I thought ... good nostalgia for grandma boomerim. This film is part of it, but much more. Brian Gibson, director, previously led the biography of Tine Turner, and was quite successful in his style. I guess it's appropriate that this is his last film. Actors are well selected. Bill Nighi is perfect in his role as a frontman of the band. Actress-actor Bruce Robinson appears as a band guitarist. He does an excellent job, although he did not appear on the film since the late 70's. If you are looking for a touching and funny movie (with some great songs), you found it. 7.4 from 10
