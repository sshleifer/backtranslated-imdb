The frustrated deputy district attorney George Makvell (an excellent performance by George E. Carey, who also produced this picture) can no longer bear his brilliance, an ice-cold woman Edith (perfectly female Anne Bellami). Worse still, poor George is burdened with newborn sun and a lazy lesbian teenage daughter (brushing brunette Sheri Jackson). George has an adulterous assault with a lovely, seductive and free witty girlfriend Hippie Kendi Wilson (beautifully plays with sexy dulling of tasty blue knockout Patricia Vimmer). Complications arise when George finds himself blackmailed by bitter Julia Freeman (a nice poisoning move by Kathy Villiams) who wants George to throw out his psychotic biker boy Laurence Mackei (terrifying Robert Tessier, who plays full-length hair) from prison. The director Tom Laughlin (yes, the same guy who showed Billy Jack!) And the scriptwriter James McLarty pushed a great story with a winning and very entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity, cocky soft sex, and raw violence. Moreover, they accurately bind the whole wild, unobtrusive sensibility of the culture of the younger 60s and link the action in a tight 75-minute time, ensuring that this film does not exceed its welcome. It definitely stands out when Candi invites her cute friends through Makvells' house to an improvised cellar bash complete with smoking in a pot, poor rock music and, of course, hot bare dancers. Funk-result of Robert O. Ragland hit the hub. Stanton Fox's sharp, black and white cinema adds an extra thick edge to the delirious, and he sniffs dog-on. Best of all, this film moves like a beautiful showcase for the extremely charming and fresh dots of Patricia Vimmer, which positively illuminates the screen with its sweet, sparkling personality and amazing beauty. Totally messy.
