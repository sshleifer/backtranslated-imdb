The brilliant thing about Onenail & I is that she records that she has not left the college for a long time and that life could go in both directions, along with all the rest of her ornaments. Freebird is something for those who probably never thought about higher education and just went to work at the age of 15/16. I know that some of the broad leafs put a knife into this movie when it came out in cinemas, but I saw it in a packed house in Hailsham and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. I grew up in Dean's woods and this led me back to my mushrooms and drugs (they had some great companions - I hate to think about what's happening now - it probably runs the local assembly). I watched him several times on DVD and I already watch the movie as an old friend who will forever remain as part of my collection (how can I love this movie and Dambusters - somehow it does not seem right). towards the second half of the film and I think that social scene with the local population is brilliantly made. I like the mixture of the three main characters and there really is some nice writing here along with some very quoted lines and I dare say that good integrity is integral. I tried to get an audio background, but it was not published (shame, because it's a robber). Somebody told me that it was originally a theater show, it's not entirely certain how it worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked a few Shakespearean touches / references that appear to appear throughout the movie (also noticed by Dilan Thomas ref) and like all the little jewels, there will always be little things to discover, such as the final scene that gives the sign to Easirider as they begin next time. All in all, a truly unpretentious film work (you love it!)
