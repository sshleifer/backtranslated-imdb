Looking for Kuo Vadis in my local video, I found this version of 1985 that looked interesting. Wow! It was amazing! Ken Russell is a very popular movie, stylized, very artistic and of course "different". Nero is presented not so much as an evil incarnation, but as an unsettled, uncompleted emperor who would rather have a circus career. He was probably wondering why he was put in a position to lead the empire - it was not so much fun and it was fun that he longed for it. Klaus Maria Bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played all that was worth. Yes, Nero reviled the Christians; one of many who did it. At one point, one of his supporters murmurs: "No one will ever realize that we were simply protected." He is right.
