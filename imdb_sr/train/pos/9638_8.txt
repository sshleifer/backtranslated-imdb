This film was more a passage into the masculinity of a gay man and how he must deal with everyone. His mother is depressed, his younger sister is pain, the older sister is somewhat accepted. The relationship looks good with his boyfriend / tapping and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy is fucking around him and says it did not mean anything. Our young gay man gets away and ends up in the trash and eventually leaves, throwing out his new lover and starting over. He remains with him and begins to watch, does not participate in happiness. Maybe things will be better for him in the future. The ending was kind of a sight, but the whole movie was quite real and that's why I will allow this real slipper to be a high rating.
