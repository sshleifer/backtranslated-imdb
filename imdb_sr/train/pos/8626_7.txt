"Der Todesking" is not exactly the type of movie that pleases you? Another cult monument of George Buttgereit in a series, which is actually much better than the notorious "Nekromantika", is of seven short episodes? one for every day of the week? He is referring to the suicides of unrelated people. Between these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit introduces truly terrible images of a manly corpse that is falling apart. Episodes are not all equally powerful, but as healthy, "Der Todesking" ranks quite high on the list of the most depressing art-house films. Especially episodes on Wednesday, involving a man who explains their sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park, and that Sunday, focusing on the younger man who is being abused on the dead, is extremely intense and devastating to watch. The added value of this film, or any other shocking thing like it, is debatable and I'm not even sure whether Buttgereit had any kind of communication message here. There is a vague reference to a violent chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide, but mostly we remain uninformed about the motivation of these people to end their life so dramatically. Totally unlike the expected, "Der Todesking" is not exploitative or repulsive graphic! On the contrary, in fact, I could never hope that Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful about the display of pure human misery. The fourth episode is a perfect example of this because it stylly displays the different views of the famous German bridge, while the names, age, and occupations of people who jumped appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitably poor, and editing often has no professionalism, but that's not what really counts in this type of film. The subject is strong and makes us think of less joy? but also necessary ?? aspects of life. EXCELLENT use of tragic music!
