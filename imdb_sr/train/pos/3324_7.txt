Someone has mastered the difficult task of combining sports with a romantic. In reality, sport and romance go together like oil and water. So, to successfully put two on the screen ... well, it's roughly the equivalent of atom separation. I never thought it could be done. I will first say that I do not like romantic comedy at all ... but I love sports and most sports movies. This movie was a pretty good combination. Since I'm a baseball fan, I really could appreciate the comedy experience with Ben Vrightman (Jimmy Falon) who was an angry Boston Redsok fan. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the damnation of Baba, who has been harassing Reds for 86 years, and know how crazy they are for many Baseball fans. Farrell's brothers did a great job for a good comedy. This was a very good movie that could appeal to many.
