In the hands of a more skilled director, this film would be considered a masterpiece. Despite the fact that Michael "Death Vish" was just a passing route, the movie is interesting, original and more than frightening. including Chris Saranden as a heroine hero who really listens to her while insisting that spooky things are coming down. Burgess Meredith is wonderful as a crazy neighbor. Eva Gardner persecutes young Beverly D'Angelo as her silent and disturbed lesbian mistress. John Carradine does the job on the chair. And watch out for a short comedy of the unknown time, Chris Valken! This film is creepy and creative. Rotates are enviable, if predictable. The highlight, about which I will not speak details, is disturbing and quite impressive. Again, a better director could do more with her, but it is still quite satisfying - at least to those with the sensibility of the horrors of the seventies. Like this. There's almost no blood. The direction is pretty spartan. The effects are few, although in the end there is some wonderful makeup - most of which are not really makeup ... but maybe I already said too much. I have little rated this. higher than quality can be justified, but I enjoyed as much as any "8" movie I saw.
