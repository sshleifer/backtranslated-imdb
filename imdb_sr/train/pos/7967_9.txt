This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever recorded. It is a real pleasure to everyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and this will make you uncertain. Basically, what is related to the house is three pets that are sent to live on the farm while their owners go on holiday. They do not know what is happening and desperately want to go home, escape from the farm and try to find the way home through the wilderness. This is one of the last films Don Ameche has played. He gave the voice of Senka, an old, wise and friendly golden retriever. In the film, Salli Field played the voice of Sassi, the Himalayan cats. But seriously, what's in the movie is Chance! Expressed by Michael J. Foca (my favorite actor of all time), Chance is essentially everything you'd expect from a dog, a cute, playful, energetic and stupid, and every time I watch this movie, it's because of Chance; as if the comedy never ends! This movie is also very sad. Sometimes reminds people of their time when they were alone or when they lost their pets. One scene that always puts me in uncertainty is the scene in which the trio is trying to escape from the pound; I'm especially shocked in the part where Chen takes his necklace caught in the fence and almost fails. The film had other uncertain moments, but none of them seemed more upset with it. All in all, it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoyed this movie, you will probably enjoy the sequel. I'm giving this movie a solid 9 out of 10!
