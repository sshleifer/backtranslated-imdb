I do not believe in all the negative reviews that this film receives. Yes, the cheap is made. Yes, the blood is ridiculous. And, yes, treatment is a sub-pair. However, this is an example of early slip textbooks, and if it's your thing (mine!) Then you will enjoy this. It has enough good aspects for this movie to compensate for the shortcomings. First of all, the result of the unknown Christopher Iounga is very violent and perfectly emphasizes violence. The ending is a welcome break from the predictable optimistic endings of most films. And the last, but not least, the setting is what made the movie for me. The producers of this film could have done a much better job of "dressing up" sets to make it more convincing as a dormitory. However, if you can overlook this problem, the setting is great. The four courses are themselves in a huge, abandoned, condemned building that just awaits to be demolished ... this refuses the possibility. When watching, let your imagination do something about the work and you can enjoy this movie as much as I do.
