Gundam Ving is a fun show. I appreciate that he brought me to Gundam and anime at all. However, after watching their predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I consider Ving Gundam Lite. push back into difficulties and grow to maturity. This does not happen in the Wing. Heero is the first dog at the start, and in the end is the main dog. Personality does not change, growth has never been achieved. The best character is Zechs, who is for all intents and purposes the hero in most of the series. But suddenly, the series issues him and turns him into a criminal without any reason. Mecha: Ving has excellent design suits. Gundamsi are cool, and Epion is my favorite. I even think that several designs of OZ suits are at the level of some of the classic Zeon suits. But the design of sweet suits does not keep a series of boring characters. Conclusion: In the end, Ving has a cool fighting scene, although sprinkled with recycled animation, but shallow plots and character development. Pleasant, but does not move like the previous Gundam excursions.
