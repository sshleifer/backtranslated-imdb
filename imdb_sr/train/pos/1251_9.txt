This documentary explores the story covered by Pilger's latest book, "Freedom Nekt Time," which was released in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the native Diegas Garcia, one of Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. The islanders are technically British citizens, because Diego Garcia is a British colony, similar to Mauritius, a nearby island where the natives were expelled. However, the British government ignored their requests to return to their homeland, as the island is now a military base for the United States Army, which used it as the basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. As usual, Pilger's reporting is shocking, especially as documented treatment and the present impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews are excellent, and his turn away from parliamentary representatives in which he uses his own information to defeat him, ranks as one of his best. Pilger also uses a dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently published documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to evacuate the natives. The weaving of this recording with the interviews and music of the islanders really increases the influence of the film. It's not easy to watch, but "Theft of Nations" is John Pilger at its best. Recommended.
