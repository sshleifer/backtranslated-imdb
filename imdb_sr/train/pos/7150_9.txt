What a great movie! This reminds so much of the wonderful Disney classic films of the 60's and 70's. I was so pleasantly surprised, after the last 20 years of absolute detritus, the crew of Disney's live productions appeared. This film is an absolute joy. The kids were just that; professional, quality actors. I am most impressed by the quality of this film. Sigournei Veaver was a totally portraying * inserted hyperbole * that led a prison camp for rude guys. Siobhan Fallon was awesome as the mother of the star. I will not pull this story because it makes little sense to do it again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was excellent and the acting quality of you is great! This paper reminds you how to be a child without being too cute or too crude. The deleted scenes displayed on the DVD version are really best deleted. They were too strict for this movie and they would take so much. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not fully displayed outside a certain limit. That was the best way to do this. This was an absolutely awesome movie to watch. He gets 9/10 of ... Fiend :.
