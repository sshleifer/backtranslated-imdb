I was really surprised by this movie. By entering into a spy review, not knowing anything about the movie except the trailer I saw, I thought it would be Dude Vhere's Mi Car what a shitty fest. I expected bad jokes and a farthest and pathetic main character who would eventually be laid out, because movies do so. Instead, I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who never had sex. Yes, the film is full of sexual jokes and vulgarity and occasional hey-look. -npple! but much has been done in the spirit of Bad Santa than Sorority Bois. All characters are people you probably know in real life, redeeming friends who just try to connect a brother and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be totally shit, and I was very surprised. Yes, it's quite at the top (come on, it's a 40-year old virgin movie!), But it's very cleverly made. In the end, are you really for this guy to get laid, which talks a lot about the movie, because honestly, did you really care that Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
