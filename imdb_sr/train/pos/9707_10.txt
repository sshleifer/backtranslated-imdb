About a year ago, I finally gave up on American television. I was thinking about quitting television until my friend who lived in England showed some programs that included the Office, Ektras, Blackadder and The League of Gentlemen. Then I decided to go to British television. Among all of the above shows, the League of Gentlemen is easily the darkest and distorted of all, providing guilty laughter and material that is not found in any other comedy I have ever seen. The involved characters are the most desirable married couple, a butcher who puts ingredients in meat that is not built (probably for the best), a disturbed couple looking through a local store that is dedicated only to the local population and the worst veterinarian. This program is one of the best I've ever seen.
