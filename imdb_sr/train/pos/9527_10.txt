This is the best film ever shot. He earned more than what he earned in the Oscars. Nominated for things such as the result, the art direction, the supporting role (Nevman), this film could easily be nominated for the best picture, director (Mendes), actor (Hanks), supporting the actor (Nevman and Leo) and won it! ! Hanks gives one of his best performances, and a kid who played Michel Jr. he was so good that I'm surprised that I do not see him today in several movies. The critics themselves did not give enough credit to this film. But apart from incredible performances, another real star of this film is incredible music. This is by far the best result of the year. He was nominated, but he did not win. This is a great movie that everyone should see. My class-A +
