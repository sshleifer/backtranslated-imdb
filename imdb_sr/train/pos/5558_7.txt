This story is well-known in Tom's and Jerry's long-time cartoon films, especially in the forties of the last century, the only difference is that two cats, instead of one, pretended to be thrown out if they did not catch a mouse (Jerry). Tom has an unnamed friend ("Butch?") Who lives in the house with him, so this really disturbs "Mami Tvo Shoes" who can not believe they have a mouse despite the DVA cats in the house. In any case, the one who seizes Jerry can stay while the other gets the trunk, so the competition is in progress! make entertaining. Not only were the cats competing against each other, but Jerry in the equation, so there were enough good specs to definitely recommend if you are a fan of Tom & Jerry.
