Spanish films are, if not golden, definitely Silver Age. Piedri is another example of a film that seriously understands people and their conflicts. Although feelings are strong or almost at the level of life or death, they are still not melodramatic. This can happen. There are different stories to connect here. One refers to a retarded girl who does not dare to cross the street to the next block. One refers to a middle-aged woman who finds a lover of her life in a foot fetish. The other is about a girl with drug problems that leaves her lover. Another is about madame brodhel who (almost) finds true love. It's definitely worth seeing. In Spain, filmmakers take women seriously.
