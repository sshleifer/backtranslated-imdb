A realistic view of young love for college, but also the attraction of an older audience like me. There are ups and downs, turns and turns, and made me tear out a tear or two. We rarely watch films with black urban characters that might appeal to an older, not black audience and show a more realistic view of young black people. Meet and fall in love. In the background there are different acquaintances of friends and situations that affect them better or worse. Typical complications may be said, but this was indeed unexpected. I found myself running through the relationship of couples, watching their past in their story. The occurrences of deep thoughts and revelations came from acting performances. It is a great movie that I would support for those young ones in the heart and in love or ever in love. Excellent movie. I'm looking for a copy that I will add to my movie collection.
