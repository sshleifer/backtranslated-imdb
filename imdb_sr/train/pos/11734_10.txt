This must be one of my favorite moves, unlike the bad Elvira's Haunted Hills ... in any case, I like the way the goth / com 'Vizard of Oz' is talking ... <br /> < Elvira is a gothica Dorothy that is stranded in an unknown city after the death of the Good Witches (the elvis of Aunt Morgan) ... she inherits the "Ruby" ring that is extremely powerful and sought after by Bad Unlock (her uncle). ... She is engaging with four characters who inadvertently help the growing film throughout the movie with a dog in her hand. I agree with her uncle (evil witch from the West), where Elvira realizes that she has strength in her and that she ultimately wins. In the end, he was sent by city people after defeating their hearts and finally reaching his destination Las Vegas (Dorothy Home in Kansas). There are many references to the wizard of Oz movie ... she and her uncle both quote the lines that are relevant to their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus .... There is no place like home, no place at home!" Poor Uncle Vinny: "I'll bring you my beauty, and your little dog!" There is a sign that Elvira is passing when she first mentions the state of Kansas on her trip. /> But in addition, the fact that one of the sequences she has "broken, um ... I think she was inspired by FlashDance" is pure genius ... and if you do not turn around, laughing at her titty tvirling at the end of her "very 80s" in Las Vegas shows that you do not have a bone camp in your body ... This movie is a Cultural Camp
