I love movies that do not provide a typical "happy end", and that's my main reason for my movie. Alice Marano (Danny) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) were arrested in Thailand for drug trafficking after anonymously telephoning the Thai authorities. The movie is a solid job for spectators to guess whether (or which) girls are involved in this, and Bill Pullman is as perfect as their cunning lawyer. Jacqueline Kim turns into a great performance as his more polite, generous wife, Ion, who is also a lawyer. I wish that girls were more abused in prison, as another commentator said, because I heard that Thai prisons could be quite brutal. However, where this movie catches me, that's its end. Alice submits a 96-year sentence, so Darlene can be pardoned, and we (the viewers) realize that they are both innocent. Any film that defies my expectation of ending with it brings additional points, and this well-acting drama certainly deserves.
