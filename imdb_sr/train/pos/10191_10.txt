What is contained on this disc is the first show of the first group. This disc is not for the weak heart ... the music is incredibly intense, and VERY cool. What you will learn when watching this movie is precisely why Who has been so enormous for so long. The truth is that their recordings were great, but their shows were at the top of the crowd. In 1969, when this concert was recorded, screaming the teenie bopers they threw in the Beatles disappeared, and the bands (and the audience) went down to long and often incredible portraits of virtuosity - something a bit of an audience with intellectual curiosity continues in the era Canned music by Britney and Christina. What you learn especially here are incredible things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert, it's really amazing.
