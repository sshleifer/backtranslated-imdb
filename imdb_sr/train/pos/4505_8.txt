Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural bubble between an indigenous population and a white man. Although documented in a documentary style seemingly with non-professionals, Eskimo is a skilled producer who contains a convincing story that the audience wants to see to the final shot. \ T behavior about women and life than whaling who darkens his landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his partner, it's natural for other men to share their wives with their friend. It is also common for their wives to take the place of their missing spouse. All this seems natural in the context of the devastation of the Arctic. The trust of the Eskimos becomes prey to unscrupulous white Whaling (with severe European accents) that do not consider these natives equal. Scams, drunken orgies, rapes and deaths arise after the Eskimans go to work on an icy cold sea. In the end, Eskimo (Mala) realized that he was deceived and he was refreshed. The audience would rehearse in theaters from the 1930s. Come to the Royal Canadian Police Station and the moral dilemma of returning Mala to the trial. Mounties play as policemen who know this is not a dry case. Will Mounties get his man? Is it fair to follow the Small Code of Conduct beyond his traditional society? Is there an exit that does not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the law of the Whites prevails? Is there no hope for innocence? This is not a great movie, but one in which you will enjoy the depth of the problem that addresses in a completely different environment. I assume that sequencing of animal sequences was done before today's denial that no one was injured in the making of the film - so beware of raw natural sequences. Recommended.
