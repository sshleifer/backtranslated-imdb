I did not expect this film to appeal to me as much as I am. I got it simply because I saw it on the Top 25 list of the most controversial films of all time. It did not look particularly big. I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that this is one of the most complex films of recent memory. It stores every piece of information it collects in a huge archive. He experimented with experience in sex, political activism and human relations. In the meantime, the film crew is showing up as a real movie and we're watching their reactions to the story and each other. Golotinja, explicit sex and controversial politics kept this film in the US, while a complaint was lodged at the customs. The film is a narrative, but it is a documentary that shows us the world of films that are behind the scenes during narration, and the fourth wall breaks. This film is the most direct way of filming a movie I've ever seen. The film mostly works as a time capsule of psychedelic events from the 1960s, a struggle for freedom and sexual liberation. I like to think about it much more than that. I did not think that I would like to spend my time on the blue version of this movie, but actually I am. This film is buried treasure. Give it a try.
