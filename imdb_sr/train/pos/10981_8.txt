Hey, now, your truth, TheatreKs, found this while digging videos on the flea market, in an almost new state, and by reading the back of the box I saw that it was a bit "cult hit" and of course he came home to me. What a weird movie. Aunt and cousin of former first lady Jackueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this collapsed 28-room house on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) And share a house with raccoons, cats, flies (eiov!) And who knows what else. Suffolk Co. is all around them at one time for dirty life, and the old Jackie came to correct things himself. In any case, this is a strange couple, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie always carries something over his head and dances, singing, and gives a small side of the camera that rarely makes much sense. Great Edie (mother, 79) obviously likes to run around naked, and as we get hints of what this might look like happiness, this is delicious (?) Made to the extent that we are graciously spared by it. These women talk and talk, they mostly talk about the past, and they do not make much sense, except for them. Living in absolute dirt, cats do their job everywhere ("Look, that cat goes to the bathroom behind my portrait!"), And one bedroom is their center of business. If I close my eyes and hear the voice of Eddie, that reminds me very much of my late aunt, who was from that area of ​​the country and had that emphasis on Goyland. One scene put a little Edie on a reflective flea, beautiful, you can see all the cats that are scratched all the time, so the site must have been infected. The box refers to these two women as "eccentric", and in this case I would have to say that this is just euphemism for "wacky of their zucchini," but this film is not without moments in which you really feel something for them. This is just as fragile, sad and disgusting, but I could not stop watching when I started. This is not my "normal" type of movement, but I found it fascinating. However, it will not be for everyone, guaranteed.
