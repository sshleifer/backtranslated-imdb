Seriously, can you imagine such a spread of talent in a single film without a huge budget: Daniel Dai-Levis, Rai McAnalli, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shav? There is no doubt that Fricker and Dai-Levis earned their awards: but it would be entirely justified to see that O'Conor (like Ioung Christie) and McAnalli were rewarded: the clich√© is true here: they do not play the role they inhabit. Dan-Levis's performance is a tour - such a transformation that arouses awe, but it was really a sign of the Academy's intelligence that, besides this performance, they also admired Brend Fricker's beautifully restrained, heartless and heartfelt work as Christ's mother. Otherwise, if you did not see this magnificent actress in "Svann," this is another movie worth checking out for her contribution (and exalted Miranda Richardson).
