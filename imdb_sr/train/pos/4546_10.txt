This film will enter history as one of the greats, next to Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Please, convince Leno to make a sequel! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo, which has not yet seen Abbot and Costello. The evil that comes from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Teka" Cobba will give you a cold. Dingman's character as a stupid stupid man returns to the days of Shakespeare's comedy. And the peak. My God, the peak. I will not ruin you, but it makes the explosion of the Death Star fade in comparison. If you can find this gem that is hard to find, do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately. I'm still hoping for a special DVD release these days.
