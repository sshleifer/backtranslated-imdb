I read a comment that labeled this film as "garbage" and "waste". I think this person got her political underwear a little pulled too </ i> <i> too. I've just hired new DVD's for both yellow and blue. These films - though heavily large - have at least a historical interest in the so-called "radical student" of the political-social movement of the late 60's. I did not see a picture or a picture of their notorious reputation, I expected some genuine pornography (there are no). (including still verboten frontal male nudity (automatic NC-17 - Orvellian-Ks) in the US, but I did not expect movies <br /> <br /> < > The democratic socialist message in your face. <BR> <BR> Although it is prone to simplicity, I thought it occasionally allowed its points well while I laughed out loud <br /> < and the director's comment clearly showed that he had a lot of parody in the film, he got "pornographic" sec scene.The first such scene is very real.The lead couple is awkward, incompetent, funny and s impatient in its first copying scene. The other - which caused the most complaints - falsified kunilingus and felacio. And the last is the end of an angry battle, <br /> <br /> /> this is likely. Additions include a brief introduction to the film, an interview with an original US distributor and his lawyer, passages from testimony testimonials in the US and a commentary on the "diary" Directors in some scenes. This is a film that "blue noses" would not allow and led to the key "free prey interest" without the standards for social redemption. </ br> Fortunately, it still stands. Those who are interested in history, this will have to see you see.
