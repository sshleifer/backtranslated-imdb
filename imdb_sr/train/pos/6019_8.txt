The ZP is deeply connected with that youthful dream that represents the hippie movement. The college debate at the beginning of the film talks about the cultural situation that creates this movement. An explosion Daria imagines represents the collapse of all social structures, and hence the development of all that immense transformation that society suffers, and ultimately the death of Mark, predicts the end that A sees for the movement itself. The film will be easier to understand if we return at that time in our lives. During the 60's and 70's, young people were the driving force for deep research into the changes. One of the most significant changes was that sexuality got out of the closet, and I think that the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy, but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom do in a hypothetical situation in which it would be from whom to hide. I watched a scene where couples throw sand on each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which A showed the inability to hide this basic human instinct. Repression was a way to 'control' social outcasts at that time, and that's the method, the police are applying to stop students. This society suffers from hypocrisy, and it becomes clear when students gain access to weapons, skipping all false controls. The dialogue between a police officer and college professor, who is detained for no reason, shows that a part of the society is interested in this youthful feeling and that he is completely disinterested. Imposing flying as a more precise symbol of freedom, theft of aircraft represents Marco's inner desire for it, but his (return or return (segun)) shows difficulties to free themselves from these connections and as I said, "A" describes the death of dreams due to these difficulty in conquering games. In my opinion, a film for memory.
