The actors are different and now they had a different approach, we have a street smart team "Netvorth" vs. the alleged professional team "Magna", but the guy if you think the street smart team had problems, would be right. While Magna team occasionally fights, the street team simply disintegrated Sunday from Sunday. First of all, some things to repeat as far as "Segunda 3" are, firstly continues the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and play in this series: if you are a good project manager, but you lose, the team will turn around and you will be fired, despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often those who work half-ass. It's simple, it's absurd to play at a fair that claims to hire the best candidate is actually "shedding" the best while dysfunctional candidates interact with each other until one stays and that person is the best. lol Everyone this season, we've seen a total of curses, backstabbing, and even gay offensive stereotypes that run while teams are trying to run campaigns. The list of victims so far Cast Tara Dovdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner, these three are the only ones I think were unfairly dismissed by Trump, while the others really came because they only provoked conflict, anger and suffering . It's amazing how one candidate Audrey Evans said that the one who did a good job was fired and that some of her worthless colleagues are still in the game. Yes, it's a game, it's "The Apprentice". where manipulation, backstabbing, and always popular "all gang up on project manager" rules. It was a fun ride, however, candidates are given a wide array of tasks from photo shoots to the construction of a mini golf course, the construction of new flats. Still, although it is still an "Apprentice", it's all that you can basically laugh all the time, while insanity and chaos insues until a happy person is a winner.
