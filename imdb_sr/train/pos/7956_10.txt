This is simply a classic movie in which human voices from animals are really what their thoughts are. I do not know if my video copy has no scene, but it never shows how dogs went out of the pit. It also shows the instinct of animal survival and tracking abilities. Put people in the same position and the helicopters would be out. Once, the original movie was improved by the remake when the voice for the first one was removed. Only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because the use of humans would have to spice the story by turning it into murder, proving that, after all, animals are more interesting than humans
