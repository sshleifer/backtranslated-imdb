Definitely in the top five of John Garfield's top five films must be the Pride of the Marines. This is a true story about private Marine Al-Shmid who cost his own eyes, while the wounded were hit by the Japanese army in Guadalcanal. The story is nicely segmented into three parts, Al Schmid's home life, where he is a simple worker who only seriously faces a woman and who loves nothing better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor was bombed and he was in a war while millions of others were. The second part is at Guadalcanal and we see part of the action where it is in an isolated machine gun nest, holding Japanese troops. His action prevented the naval positions from going over, but the grenades in his sight. And, of course, the third part is his painful adaptation to civilian life and to make sure that people not only care about the most of the girl you've seen with Eleanor Parker. This film was broadcast on TCM at John Garfield's 95th birthday and was a documentary about Garfield, hosted by his daughter. One of the interviewed people said Garfield was convinced of the role of the working class in holding and holding a union card. In that sense, he was lucky to have landed with Varner Brothers in Hollivood. Although he continued to get the types of gangster roles in the tradition of the studio, Garfield was great in these parts because of his background, because he came from the life of Al-Shmid, with the exception of Garfield Jewish origin. In that sense, he was perfect to play the role of a hero of a working class like Al Shmid who accepted the responsibility to defend his country. There is no super heroic here, only a guy who would rather be in Philadelphia, but he did a job that had to be done. It's a big part for Garfield. It's a movie that should not be missed. I wonder what happened to real Al Schmid.
