I liked it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. Chemistry between actors (including little Arthur) is incredible and exciting. It could have been used a little more screen for tasty Frederick Lavrence (played by James Purefoi). And Gilbert Markham was astounding "on it" from the very beginning of the film. The one who thrilled me with surprising shock and awe and wonder was Rupert Graves like Arthur Huntingdon. I love him in Forsite Sagi, and everything else I saw inside him. But he surprised himself here as Arthur. In my wildest dreams, I could not imagine playing crazy psychopaths like Arthur Huntingdon. But it is. And I love it. And I love him.
