I did not laugh so hard on this film for a very long time. The trash that Hollywood puts me lately brings me to the wall! This was definitely fresh and witty. If you look at demographic rating data, only a few women voted! I do not want to ruin a movie for you, but I'm sure every guy who saw this ran to their computers to evaluate it and give it a bad result, why? Because the film puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because of its real value of humor, not because it is harmful to men ... it could easily be a movie rated as "7"!
