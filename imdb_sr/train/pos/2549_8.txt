The great urban Ronald Coleman is shown here as in several of his other films. He is literally in every scene and this comic movie remains fresh for him, not in spite of him. He is handsome, witty and very smart because he remains a step ahead of his wandering, beautiful wife - perfectly likes Anna Lee. The film is based on the French play and brings all the best qualities of the farce. Most supported actors are well-known, at least by their faces, if not their name ... and they are absolutely perfect for this very funny movie. Fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable, while he is a step ahead of other characters. His multiple talents can be even more appreciated in the classic "Lost Horizon" that every movie lover has to see.
