I've seen a couple of eating disorders, but this was definitely my favorite movie. The problem with others was that people with eating disorders only automatically improved or accepted the fact that they needed help and that's it. this film that I thought was more realistic, because in this main character, Leki does not become automatically better. It is getting better and then it has a drawback. I think this movie shows more than others that I've seen better not only happens, it's a hard job and it takes time, it's a long way to recover. I think this film shows everything very well. There should be more of these films.
