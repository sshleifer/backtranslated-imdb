Jim Belushi is as good as "Average Joe" who gets his 15 minutes in the "Twilight Zone". Michael Kane is a mysterious band that not only listens to Belushi's "story," but also has a "cure" for all the problems of Belushi's middle class: A magical drink that will cause the bubble of change in Belushi's life. Flashbacks shows a 15-year-old horrible shame over the defeat of his baseball championship in high school. Belushi continues with his "sad life", seemingly happy, but always wondering "what if ..." It seems that for several days, Belushi experiences a "different" life, one of the huge success, admiration and hatred of other equal measures. This is not quite "It's a wonderful life", but some elements are similar and very lovely. "End" is predictable, but still satisfactory. Look at the very young Cortney Coka in a small role as a "fatal attraction" - like the other woman. Very nice movie!
