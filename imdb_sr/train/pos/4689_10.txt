I agree with all the comments so far. I remember this documentary as one of the most incredible and most innovative I've ever seen. As already mentioned, I recall that I began to look, thinking that it was just another study of nature - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was so wrong. Not only is the story of the colony incredible, but I remember that music was so much of its appeal. If I remember correctly, these were the Indians pipes (similar to the music at the end of One Year over Cook's Nest). I was also looking for a copy. It should be asked to look for anyone, but especially for schools. It should be reissued.
