This is a wonderful film about the Battle of Mormon and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are particularly powerful, and the message is one that we all have to remind - God does not speak but communicates, if we only listen. As I write this in the midst of the horrors that are happening in New Orleans and the surrounding area for Katrine, I was particularly encouraged by the Mormons who had to leave everything behind and continue after the death of Joseph Smith. People came to this country to avoid religious persecution, yet they could not. The struggle of the Mormons to cross the earth, the costs of living, the difficulties they suffered, inspire awe, showing their enormous strength. As far as Mormon beliefs are concerned, this is not much embedded, and polygamy is mentioned, but it is not even the central part of the film. Actors are top-notch, although others who have commented know more about real characters and can talk about how true portraits are. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mari Astor, Brian Donlevi, John Carradine, Jane Darvell work great with the scripts they get. Although the film could easily fit into its (and certainly today) Tirone Pover and Linda Darnell, they were added to the acting team to bring audiences to the movies to see a movie about mormons. Power is magnificently handsome as a young Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not a mormon, but stays with her family after her father was killed. Power does not have much work until the end of the movie, when it has a big scene, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of the shooting) has even less, although they make a wonderful couple. Their fate has remained unclear about her conversion, and someone is asking about polygamy in their case. However, you can not beat one by one.
