I've seen a recent DVD with Region 2 of this movie shown in the "horor" section of the Okford Street store, and it's also labeled "classic thriller". In reality, it's almost exclusive for Arthur Askei, one of the most popular names in British comedy and entertainment for more than four decades. as a bit of a cultural shock for many who are accustomed to the sour and cynical taste of British comedy for the past twenty five years. Still, there are still those who value his lively and cheerful personality and completely avoiding the pathos. Askei was the idol of the great Tommy Cooper, who often borrowed "self-suffocation" which Arthur was trying to entertain with outsiders. Travers, who strikes like a mysterious Julie.
