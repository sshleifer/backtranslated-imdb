I did not expect much from this film, but he was very pleasantly surprised, because it is light and fun and very well noted. The central trio of immobile bikers was surprisingly cute, as they stumbled and clasped their way through a trip to Vales amidst drugs. Humor was gentle and subtle, as were three characters (witnesses of their cute treatment of an old merchant). The rural Welsh atmosphere was perfectly caught, and the soundtrack was very well selected. Smart and carefully scripted, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic view of alternative culture - I felt with them. Very light and fun - it's not what you'd expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. Enjoyment on all fronts and hard to criticize, although I thought the last two scenes were a little crap - the film was supposed to end when they left Wales. But altogether, unexpectedly mildly film.
