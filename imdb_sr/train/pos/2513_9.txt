Beautifully done. Much anger. Friendship may not endure everything, but in the end everything is important, or something like that is learned by a group of friends. I watched him over and over again. Music is also incredible. When Kei loses a friend, he gives up until he meets Shaw, an orphan who does not refuse from his true nature. On the streets of the malleus Mallepe, they fight for their place among the melting of Asian races and find that sometimes at the top it can cost you more than you are willing to pay. A sudden ending that touches as much as the whole movie. I could not get enough. Gackt and Hide do a wonderful job acting, proving that they are more than just handsome singing singers.
