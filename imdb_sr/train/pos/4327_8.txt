I like this presentation - I read Bleak House and I know it's so difficult to present the whole book as it should be, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit that they made a very good show with Nicholas Nickelbie. I love Diane Rigg and I've seen the pain of Ladi Dedlock, even through the expected arrogance of aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think she's the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could make a better Jarndice, but I'm fine with Mr. Elliott. It's not easy to show these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist would be lighter - this is a long one, and if you do not care about all the legal situations it can be gloomy or boring. I think this presentation is fun enough to not be boring. I just liked the g. Smallveeda - it can be fun. There is always a child - Jo will break your heart ... I think we should be given the opportunity to evaluate ourselves ... I must say that I liked the show. Perhaps if I read the book again, as I usually do, after I look at the movie, I may be more critical. In the meantime - I think it's a good presentation.
