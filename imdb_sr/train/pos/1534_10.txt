I love this show as an action full of adventure, love and intrigue. And sometimes love! It's a good idea to see an idea where all the characters work well together and treat each other with respect. It is also very good that Dick Van Dike is summoned in a television role because I only saw him in Mari Poppins. A mixture of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jessie and Steve is very preoccupied with the audience. This is the show you have to watch!
