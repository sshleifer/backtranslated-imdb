"Yes, Georgio" is a carefree and funny movie / comedy featuring beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie I enjoyed seeing more than once. Some critics suggested that if someone wanted to enjoy Pavarotti, they would probably have served the operatic DVD better. Although a full opera may be a better representation of Pavarotti operas, often, the opera requires costumes and has stories that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his voice for speaking and to express personality and character in the way that the opera would not. Many critics considered the story to be incredible; I do not agree. Unusually talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to enchant intelligent and wonderful people. In addition, people who are very different from others often gain insight into themselves and grow in a positive way from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in a direction that they may not have chosen themselves. Georgio and Pamela become more open to the unexplored parts of themselves than others. Relax and indulge in a visual and audacious rewarding film with Pavarotti at the height of his vocal abilities. The final scenes from Puccini Turandot themselves are worth the time to get there.
