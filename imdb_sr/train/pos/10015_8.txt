The popular radio narrator Gabriel Niko (Robin Williams, a skeptic and a story in quiet, hypnotic tones) gets acquainted and hangs out with a 14-year-old boy from Wisconsin named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who wrote a book describing sexual abuse from his parents. Pete has an AIDS, so Gabriel is even more compelling because his partner Jess (Bobbi Cannavale, good) has survived HIV. He also becomes acquainted with Pete's guard, a woman named Donna (Tony Collette, brilliant!) and when Gabriel decides to meet and talk to them in person and go to Wisconsin, she reveals some secrets which was not (of course) ready to find. Based on the actual events that occurred to Armistead Maupin (who wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this film moves much faster (90 minutes, maybe a few minutes longer) than it could be thought that the film from this genre would be launched. It's good to keep the action and the story smoother and clear. The bad thing is that it leaves various holes on the plot and seams no plot or story. I would rather not enter into any details, except to say that, if you are not familiar with the works of Mr. Maupin or his personal story, you feel a bit out of this loop. Nevertheless, the performances of Villiams (I would like to hear more about his narration, personally), Collette, Cannavale, Culkina and most auxiliary actors (a waitress in the restaurant Collete Donna often does a good job with the small part) has the highest and mood here - namely, the cold, lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York - give a great frame for this story. Perhaps there are bounds that do not bind well, but that's a pretty convincing story.
