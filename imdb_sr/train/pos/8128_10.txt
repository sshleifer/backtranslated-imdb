I saw this for the first time as a child living in East London. The scars of Hitler's Luftwaffe were obvious and the landscape of the film resembled our street. I remember I had nightmares after I saw her. It is strange that it really was not, if viewed as a part of social history in film fiction. In addition to the global destructive war, the scale of the machines were very bad, now more Nano-technology, but overall, an excellent and well-made job. It was interesting to see how the space travel was then observed. I think the shooting of a spacecraft from a huge gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts. However, much was fine. The desire for war, inhumanity towards a man. The means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
