Maybe it was not that good, but the second episode, which was the first one I said, was so memorable that I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mystery. Cocoon Sleng Assistant, Chico Barnes, is much more fun for those of us who have never been close to hearing the London Bow Bell, but the tracks are attractive and the shows were interesting. Sid Hallei was one of Franjo's more interesting characters, and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his own hand. Interestingly, the electronic hands used in stories are obviously less functional to the user than the one that was invented after World War II.
