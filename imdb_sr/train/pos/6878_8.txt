Until 35 years, Groove Tube today looks like a real TV! Special niche networks (naked sports), TV show about stoner dealers called Dealers (Ala Veeds, and even before Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke 1978), weird beer ads (Butz Beer, not less bizarre than Bud Bovls) , dirty - Kloun Koko (Pee Vee Herman's cover), even Chevi Chase, who works slapstick humor a year before his debut in 1975 in Saturdai Night Live. And thanks to the famous opening order that earned Groove Tube the initial Ks-rating, I still can not hear Curtis Maifield's "Move On Up" without thinking about the bare dance rates of hippi ---- For similar sketch-style films, see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Venom on the Mood, Monti Pithon's Beiond the Fringe, Dinamit Chicken, and Firesign Theater - all you know is wrong.
