Lovers of the "capital city" are looking forward to! This first season of this series is now available on Netvork DVD and I recently received my copy! Although it is largely an integral part of the key figures of 'CAPITAL CITI' flooring, it presents us with different moments during the first and second seasons when each member of the team plays a significant role in a particular central or peripheral line of the plot. The cultural mix (English, Irish, American, German, Polish) of the Venda Folei group (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane) is balanced with their own recognizable manners, interests and personalities, which helps make it quite unknown and for Most people, seemingly a sterile object of financial trading, are reasonably engaged through engaging actors' performances. In fact, this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contradiction with Shane Longman's rather stable and old-fashioned senior leadership, represented by Lee Leffment (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denis Havthorne). I suppose that such an unconventional way as Wendy's team engaged would not become a reality that there was no young withdrawn "free spirit" of Peter Longman who inherited his thirty percent of shares in the company from his father and allowed more trendy, relaxed modern way of doing business it becomes reality. To a certain extent, Vendi (I believe), direct supervisor Leonard Ansen (John Bove) monitors the establishment of the company's traditional way of doing business, but his affection for Vendi in most cases sees that he occupies the 'middle part'. The main interest in the series, I believe, stems from the romantic attraction between Dean Douglas Hodge and the cold self-confident blonde German merchant Michelle Hauptmann (played by Trevin McDovell), who constantly asked the viewers whether the situation between these two colleagues would have developed beyond close friendship / preferences that they undoubtedly had. We look forward to browsing this title, and we hope that the second season of thirteen will not be far!
