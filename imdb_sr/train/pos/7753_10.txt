This Belgian film, directed by Tom Barman, a singer of the well-known dEUS group, will not be popular with everyone. For the simple reason that there is no clear story or even a plot. This film shows only 24 hours in the "city" (here Antwerp) and allows you to watch and truly enjoy the dialogues, directions, witty (Dario !, osteopath Bruno!) And the tragic (Vindman, Paul Garcin, ...) characters. There are several unforgettable scenes: Windman on the beach, dance parties in the end, KISS fan, Windman visits osteopathy, ... It's clear that some other viewers did not understand which is so nice and interesting in this movie. They complain that this film does not have a story, etc. But it is an atmosphere that looks at you and which will draw you into it. If you have not watched it yet, be sure to listen to music carefully. Soundtrack is remarkable just like Tom Barman and his dEUS group. I "ssst, mondje dicht he." (do not tell anyone)
