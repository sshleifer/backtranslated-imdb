A comic comedy by Neil Simone, which causes laughter from beginning to end. The late Valter Matthau is a mocking former comedian who is convinced to join his former partner (late Oscars-winner George Burns) at the final reunion performance on the scene. Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew, and the two have the same chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau's sulky character - he's the same as always, but still very different. Burns, as an absent old man, is just as fun as Matthau. > Matthau: Do you want crackers? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. Burns: What do you think of an ordinary cracker? Matthau: I do not have a clear picture. I have coconut, pineapple and graham. Burns: Ok Matthau: They are in the cabinet in the kitchen. Burns: Maybe Or about this: Matthau: When I was black, white people knew what I was talking about! You can see it in the movie to understand it! All in all, a refreshingly funny, sweet, hearty, warm, authentic comedy character with heart and some of the most important quotes of all time. Simply do not make them any more like this! At a time when all the latest comedies are rude, minor and stupid, this relies on a gentle core such as comedy - funny characters, smart and funny dialogue and great fun. One of the best comedies of all time, up there with "Airplanes, Trains and Cars", "Lethal Veapon" and "The Hard Vai". You may find it hard to find it rent or on TV, but believe me, it will be worth your time! 4.5 / 5 star. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
