I admit, I thought this film would not be good, but I soon changed my mind. The film has told you to guess where it goes. Pierce Broson is incredible in the role of the killer, who suddenly gets burned up and asks for help from the man he met in a Mexican bar. Greg Kinnear is a terrific real man, as his role as a gentleman from Denver, who begins an innocent conversation with Pierce in the Mexican bar. The movie will make you laugh while Pierce delivers a hilarious line (mostly about sex). his last job.
