This film was charming. An accountant wants more than life than an approved conventional success. What makes him so good, and makes him so different from the standard dance film is that it's not really about becoming "big," but simply finding a way to express ourselves. In the end, a great triumph is not a victory in the competition, it does not reveal a completely new lifestyle, but a simple joy to do what you want to fill in other parts of your life. No one reveals their passion, they find their silent soul. Japanese background makes subtle oppression and "secret life" dance dances understandable and personal. We can all see each man.
