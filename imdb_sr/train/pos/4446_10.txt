Yes, I call it the perfect movie. No boring second, a fantastic actress of mostly little-known actresses and actors, a large number of characters who are all well-defined and who have understandable motives that I can like, perfect lighting, sharp black and white photo, suitable music, intelligent and harmonious scenery, and a story that engages and works. It is one of those quality photos on which all Hollywood's pride should be based, which everyone should strive to achieve. Barbara Stanvick is simply amazing. There was nothing that this actress could do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than movie goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Cravford, and this film confirmed my opinion. Always as tough as nails and at the same time transmit true feelings. She added that during her long career she got many good parts, and this is far less interesting. The title is very good for this movie. I mean the desires, the human desires that everyone can understand. In fact, no one seems to be joking in this movie, all characters act impulsively, everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone else. The sad fact that this often leads to complications is a dramatic content that I will not go through. I liked this film to tell about youth, about maturity and about the necessity of compromise. The film I most closely associate with this is Alfred Hitchcock's Ska's doubt, he creates a similar atmosphere of the idealized and simultaneously caricatureed Little City of America. The story has a certain resemblance to Fritz Lang, which is a much sharper Clash bi Night movie, made a year earlier, where Stanivck plays in a similar part. I can recommend it.
