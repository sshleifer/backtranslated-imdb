I just read the main comment for this movie that is on the title page of the voting results and cast it down. Why some people can not take a movie for what should be. This film should be a bright heart, tense in the face, family comedy, things that kids will laugh and adult stuff, which is exactly what this film is doing. /> <br /> I laughed at this movie, I thought Carey was in great performance and that the whole movie (if it's looked at Christmas) really show you some fun joys <br /> for all you film critics stop trying to sound like film students and knock every movie because it's not "Taki Driver" or "Godfather" and take movies for what they should be, fun !!
