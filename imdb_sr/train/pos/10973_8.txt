An excellent movie that shows the pathetic lives of two old lady. They could not live together, nor separated. Continuous chatter, sometimes at the same time, scattered the past; it continues to be about what it should be. Sometimes I laughed, but mostly I was taken to the extremely sad and abandoned these two women. Check this out.
