Ok, first I hate to comment on this thing, but I felt like I got to get up for this movie. Many people were beaten and I felt as though people wanting to see should get a second opinion. First of all, Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the deepest movie of the century. If that's what you're looking for, go somewhere else. Just because it's an independent movie does not mean it has to be artistic. You should feel good and you should have fun watching it and these two things are easy to achieve. Second, acting, but not "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is still good. The film does not have to behave so that you do not seek it honestly. It's a family movie. If that's what you wanted, you should not or should not look at this movie honestly. In the end, it's really a cute story. I think it is well thought-out and fun to watch. It's also very true for the majority for that culture, so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good when you're done. If you're looking for something with deep thoughts and great dramatic scenes, this is not for you. -Lindsai
