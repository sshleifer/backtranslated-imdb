and what combination. Two of the greatest singers of the century come together in this underrated musical. He writes music, writes verses, and both work for Basil Rathbone who can not write either because his wife died (actually it's just fat). The best scene is the number of pawnshops where Bing sings an improvised number while the swing band gets instruments from the hinge. Just wonderful. And this is a rare acting role for Broadway's legend, Marie Martin, and she's pretty good. Charlee Grapevin, John Scott Trotter, Villiam Fravlei, Oscar Levant (again a manic pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram. And who knew that Rathbone could be ridiculous?
