It's been a long time, and I've been dealing with the final movie for 2004. Panaghoi Sa Suba (Call of the River) is the second at the recent Manila Manila Film Festival. As expected, it was not so good at the box office because it was too artistic for ordinary movie viewers, especially since the MMFF is a season where many families go out to watch movies. It was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in the Filipino or English language on the screen. I thought that Cesar Montano was a good deal both star and director. His great vision and creativity really helped this film. He was also very effective as a leading star and was able to express the wide range of emotions that were needed for the film. The great actress Rebecca Lusterio was also great. Bikaia, younger sister Duroi, was excellent. I hope to see her in many movie projects in the future, perhaps in other genres. I think the fact that this movie really helped her in her local dialect. Some footage from the camera in the movie have been done very well. The landscape took a breath, although I think that less effort would look completely different. As for the story, I think writers could drown further into the lives of smaller characters in Film. I certainly will not talk about the story of this movie.
