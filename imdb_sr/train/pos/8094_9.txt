First of all, no adaptation is as good as a book, especially when it comes to a master such as Tolkien. This ADAPTATION beautifully synthesizes Tolkien's universe with the psychedelia of the 1970s, aesthetics and liberal culture. Yes - animation and background imaging is sometimes a bit "rough" in technical performance, but it is still beautiful and very attractive in terms of giving a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. Except for the absolute uniqueness of the pictures, an absolutely extraordinary acting - an act that is FAR superior to the acting in new live action movies. While animation in the cell may not be the "technically most experienced" animation, it captures the expressive body and facial gestures of the actors while at the same time remembers it to be subtle and tinted. Background images vary from traditional "fantasy" motive to direct abstraction, but switching to abstract settings is always motivated by narrative and greatly contributes to the subject of the film. If you are a person who needs to have an extensive computer presentation in a movie so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how this movie does not like you, but if you enjoy top-notch acting, transcendental painting, and JRR Tolkien then this movie must be seen.
