May 2004, Wonderland is quite new in the UK. A brilliant film about a brutal, true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will appreciate how well caught. The use of elements that make up his true cinematic style is genuine, reinforcing the experience and bringing the viewer closer to real existence. The use of the unrelated Pulp Fiction style timeline allows you to explore uncertainty about what really happened, while the direction and performance of the acting command is attentive, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; Oscar surely handed them over.
