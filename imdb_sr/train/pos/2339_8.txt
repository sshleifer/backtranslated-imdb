I love this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science-fiction shows, so if I publish them any similarity, I have not noticed. I like the quality of the storytelling. I even love a love story, although while I enjoy it, I wonder how this part of the story can really be developed, since Ned can not touch Chuck or ... well, you know. Even as Chuck, I do not think it's boring at all, and I mostly hate too sweet, beautiful, perfect characters. I even like the voice of the narrator, even if it tortures a member of my family and reminds me of some Valgreens commercials. I could list all the other things about Sunday's trouble and how the writers will deal with this in the future, but I rather watch and wait and see what story the authors are talking about.
