In my opinion, this is a good example of a movie that could have been much better that it was short ten years earlier. I doubt that it would benefit from modern technology, but it would look much better that it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70. Artists and animators did a great job. In my opinion, this film can boast of the best artistic background and one of the best characters. The animation is extremely smooth and realistic. During the film you believe in the world you see, so everyone has done a great job. She can boast of the most sexiest female animated characters, if not the sexiest, who easily extract typical anime girls. so appealing at this time. First, action and exquisition can be compared with contemporary adventure films and are really obsolete to modern standards. Secondly, because of the duration, it would be a lot of benefits from an additional 20 minutes of dialogue. Finally, the setting is not so popular at the moment. Conclusion: a great alternative to another short story about Conan Barbarino, but not a novel.
