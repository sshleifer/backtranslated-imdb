I think the creator (s) of the concept of this movie deserves much more recognition than they ever received. Of course, this is not about the Oscars caliber, but at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression since I first saw it in 1984 (in the theater). I do not think this is (and I hope it is not) a spoiler, but: imagine that you are acting on your impulses. You do the first thought that comes to your head, pronouncing the first words on your lips ... There are no limits, no consciousness, nothing prevents you from saying or doing things that, as intelligent adults, we know we should not say or do. If nothing else, this film just scratches on the surface - it does not go as far as it can. At a time when Hollywood seems obsessed with the transformation of old "classic" to try to cash in today, would not it be nice to see them remake the older film of modest success because of moving to the next level? A little further, or even to investigate what the original team did not, could not or would not have been able to deal with 20 years ago? This is my opinion anyway. : about)
