Apparently, there was no huge budget for this film that definitely made production difficult. But the story and the end were so brutal that they made up a lot of things. I mean brutality at the level of Ju Dou and other (great) Chinese films. The first time I saw it when I was 14 years old, I ran home and asked God to forgive me for everything ...
