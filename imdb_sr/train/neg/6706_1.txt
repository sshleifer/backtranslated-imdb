I saw this move a few years ago at the Florida Film Festival, if I remember. I liked it, it showed great potential. I suppose that most people here curse this movie because the movie looked like it was confused (according to its own recognition on the official site - a short film is shown as a "rough cut"). however, it was a comedy that was easy to go. I think that many people are trying to read too much in comedy. All they need to do is make you smile - that's all. I just did it in his presentation, so he succeeded at that level. Just my 2 cents anyway.
