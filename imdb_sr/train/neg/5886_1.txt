I'd leave the film halfway if I was not with people who loved him. The film is based on real incidents, but it's so on the top that it did not really feel real at all. I have a psychological background, I hang out with many psychotherapists and I know seriously crazy people, so I do not think people like this do not exist. But in the film, the only characters that looked consistently like humans were Auguste's father (Alec Baldwin) and young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Vood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy with a wicked sense of fun). There were some fun moments, but the overall tone of the film was dark, bizarre, and nasty. What a waste of an extraordinary actor! As I watched them pass through their turns, I felt like I was watching the acting. This was brought home during the loan, when several people showed that they just sit, do not act, do not speak. These few moments were more fun than the last two hours.
