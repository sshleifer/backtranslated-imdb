Before I watched this movie, I could already say that it was a complete copy of the Sav (together with a bar-like place and a black guy who wanted someone to break his hand out of the cuff). MJH's name on the movie would usually reject me (uf, can we say GROSS?), But I still wanted to try it. Starting from the beginning, I was a little interested. The acting is absolutely terrible and I almost laughed at every reaction of the characters (especially the man who played "Sulleia"). MJH was even the worst, but I continued to watch. However, the end was the biggest joke of all of them! I'm seriously sitting in shock thinking it's the end! Is this a comedy ?! ". I thought this bunch of shit was funny than" scary movies, "and that it's really something to talk about!
