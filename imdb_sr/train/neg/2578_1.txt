To sum up this film: Without real embarrassment, this film consists of 80 minutes of disturbed characters who drink or make bad jokes. Music is terrible, humor is not funny, and all female characters are crazy or total geek. It seems to me that the film was actually written by a 14-year-old boy who thinks that the drink is cool, women are designed to please men, and all that opposes this view are geeks. Also, the film has nothing to do with original American films, except for a few names and Mr. Levenstein who is a smaller character in this. The only good thing in this movie are pretty girls. Do not watch this movie and do not be fooled by a score of 5.4 because it's obviously overstated and does not deserve anything above 2.
