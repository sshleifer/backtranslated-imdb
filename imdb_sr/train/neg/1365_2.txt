The concept of the legal gray area in connection with love crimes contributes about 10% of the appeal of the film; the other 90% can be attributed to a grueling situation. To say that the performance of Sean Jan as a so-called district prosecutor is wooden, this is emphasized. With his mild suits and excess hair gel, Ioung does a decent job to persuade the audience in his godly hatred of men. Why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just to be able to arrest police officers trying to capture them? This hatred is the only reason why she relentlessly seeks the perverted photographer, giving women the mutual excitement and driving power behind this shitty film. Looking at Ioung from frigid to full-frontal nudity is a little encouraging, but a temperate outburst throwing by the fire near the lake. Watching her speech and rave about her self-contempt and sexual frustration makes Love Crimes a valuable rental price, but it's all downhill and from there. Despite her desire to bring Patrick Berg's character to justice, her police skills are completely avoided in the pain of her tired lust and passion. Patrick Bergin is doing a decent job as a slim sociopath; If it worked in Sleeping Vith the Enemi, it's certain that it will succeed. But I can not help but wonder if the apparent lack of energy that a young man brings into a movie confronts his thinness. I suppose it is, and the result is a "thriller" with excitement that is completely bad, and yet comical.
