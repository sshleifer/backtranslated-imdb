When I look at student days at the University of Ohio, there will always be an event in which I will remember with good memories. Channel 23 is the local access channel of the OU and up to the last few years, it mostly played everything they sent to them. It included many DII movies, types of microwave ovens, and then scan their images on the Internet, to the Macbeth version of the eighth-generation actors, who apparently just learned how to make skuebs. However, the king in my opinion, directed channel 23 was the Midnight Skater. The first time I was watching, it was about 2 am in the morning. I should have studied. Or sleep. Or watching regular television. But no, it's all for pussies. My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it's over, I do not think any of us believed that any movie just happened. But, of course, it was several nights later, and we had to get caught up in the fact that this film actually existed. I could go further and further about how horrible it is, but it is a kind of horror that makes life a worthwhile life. The action is unconnected, terrible acting, all the scars of the soul, but God, if there are others who watch with you, it's impossible not to have fun watching him. It's like the first time you hear "Guts" Chucka Pahalniuk. You hear, you're horrified and shaken, but five minutes later, everything you want and want is someone else to experience the ultimate horror that you survived. Short story, Midnight Skater, for all his epic flies, make some fun very late at night. Besides, I desperately want the theme for Midnight Skater. It is an honor for the one who wrote and singed it. Sweet God, I love this song.
