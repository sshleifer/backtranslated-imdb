This low-profile act of horror B comes with all the benefits - a crazy scientist complete with an assistant, malicious corporate greed of the pharmaceutical industry, eccentric and extreme genetic engineering and information technology .... can not leave it. Start with the weird line of hot looks of the nameless sailors who stupidly decided to dive into the water near an unknown island and end up with a friend for a bunch of sea sharks ..... Cut to a bad story that implies a drop in generic pharmaceutical stockpile a corporation that motivates its evil Shakespeare CEO's quote to entertain an unpublished offer by a former employee / scientist who was thrown out of work as a research director and which is also the case of nut ... of course (Herbert West Vannabe total).

Will somebody escape? Will it be created new species? Watch it and find out. In this movie there is a certain amount of fun, but do not expect a lot ... for a true navy Combs holder, it should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Do not say I did not warn you.
