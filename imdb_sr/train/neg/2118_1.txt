What can I say about seven pounds ... so I watched a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and how that flight was a long and boring movie definitely did not help. Character Vill Vill Smith, Ben Thomas, is almost completely unacceptable even with his redemption in the end. A two-hour film lasts for two hours, spending most of the time on the screen by accidental garbage that only slices the plot as slowly as possible. In the film, Rosario Davson's defense adds a bit of life to the film, though not much. I do not understand how anyone could cry in this movie when I just wanted to turn it off. Vill Smith also kills jellyfish, which proves that killing jelly is the dumbest way to die.
