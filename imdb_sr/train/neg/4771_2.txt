Do not waste time on this movie. It could have been good, but the end was one of the lamest I ever saw. I have to seriously wonder how the people who took part in the production of this film could look at this final scene and think: "Yes, now is the end!" and he patted his back on it. To me, it seemed to me like they were running out of an idea! They made the final scenes to have a cool turn, but instead they just let it all go up on the face. When the last bullet faded into black and I heard credit music started, I was in shock. The best thing anyone could do with this movie is to overcome the end and give it some substance. Seriously, I really would like to get the one who came with it into the room, look them in the face and say - VTF ?? !!!!
