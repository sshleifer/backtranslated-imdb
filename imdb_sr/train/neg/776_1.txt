I remember seeing this caricature when I was 6 or 7 years old. I remember that it was really shit. The action did not make sense. I hated the fox who became Casper's friend. He was so stupid! Casper cried with a head if he could not find a friend. So what? Get over! The only good part, and I do not want to sound evil, it was when the fox shot and died in the end. I laughed at the revenge because this cartoon was so exhausted. The bad news is that the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost. I wish he was dead. I think I even saw and gave someone a video because I hated him. No wonder they offered it free in a mall. If you have a child, do not let them see this. He'll probably agree with me that it's bullshit.
