If you are one of the people who have found a great television comedy "towards Jim," this will break your world. And can I add, praise for proving that good talent, good writing and charismatic stars are all you need on any network other than ABC, which prefers to radiate as Jim Belushi's show year after year. > "K-911" is a big, couples, brown, German shepherd "thank you" for all the geniuses who loved the first movie. This is exactly what fans of this film and Beluri deserve. Jimmy's comedy pieces and project choices never lag behind his ability to wipe off the blues standard. Look for him to show all his diverse defects in every project that casts the public as a chimpanzee of a zoo. If you enjoy Jim's work, this film is your reward.
