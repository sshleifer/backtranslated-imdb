It seems that Susan Seidelman had a decent career with a few top-level loans below the belt. I am surely glad that she came back from a movie that seems to have her fans. I'm not one of them. I saw better acting in high school than in Smithereens. An act like this includes a young Susan Berman who is ambitious to do it in the world of music and is ready to do anything to get there. She even rejects the honest progress of a young artist who lives from her East River run by Brad Rijn. <br /> <br /> Young g. the worst actors I've seen for a long time. No wonder he did not go anywhere. I will say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is good at shooting famous East Village locations where the movie is mostly filmed. But her work with her live performers was not measured. I'm not sure she had so much raw material to work with. Take a quick look and you will see a very young Christopher's Note before the Law and Order and Sex in a city like street scum. br /> If you love punk rock, you may go through this for a soundtrack. I'll stick with Bing Crosby.
