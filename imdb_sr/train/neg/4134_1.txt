I honestly have to say that I could not stop watching this movie from the moment it started. Simply for how bad it is !!! It's like looking at dry paint just a lot more confusing. I mean, sit down here and just wait for something to happen, all in fact, preferably something that makes the whole movie meaningful! At the end of the film I actually sat and wondered if there was any chance that I missed the first hour that explained everything to me or I may have accidentally fainted during the film and missed the pieces that stuck the parcel (it was actually one) together! The main thing that really confused me about this movie is almost the end of the main girlfriend (if she really had a main girlfriend) was in some alternative reality, I mean what the hell happened right now ?! Suddenly she woke up and was in a mental institution, tied to a bed that doctors drugged or something else, and then it was faster than I should cut my wrists, she turned back and she was eaten by a random vampire that did not have sense! I am tempted to send e-mail to producers and look for my time back, I think I lost 2 hours of my life watching this trash! I'm kind of interested in knowing if the filmmakers actually knew what it was about! it only seemed that someone had arranged all the parts that could make sense, although I think the film should take 4 hours to make it happen! I'm completely with another person who wrote another review, and I played with that movie by title, and that's it. I'm just so grateful I did not buy a movie, no matter how many times I saw it at the local store. You thought that would give me a clue that the film was a complete pile of garbage from the film, but to be honest, I think that Â£ 1 was too much money for this movie !!!! which is a huge waste of time and a good razor, I think I want to be OD'ed, less painful than watching this movie !!!!
