I thank God that I did not go to the cinema for this movie. I'm sorry about the money I gave. I saw him on TV and I could not believe my eyes. I wonder if a movie could be worse than this. they spent millions of dollars on this movie for nothing. terrible acting and a horrible scenario. I think other people who wrote comments are the man who works with this film company; In 2000, can I still laugh at this type of film? uncomfortable ...
