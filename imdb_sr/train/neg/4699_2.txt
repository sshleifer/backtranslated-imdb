vov, Naked Brothers Band. What can I say. I guess I can say that this show is just bullshit. number one: they have no talent, they probably can not even play instruments. Number 2: They said they were famous on the advertisement, but no one heard about them until the shy show appeared. Look, I really do not hate so bad, I would give it as 4 out of 10, but what is annoying me is that everyone says they have such a great talent, and Nat is so deep and writes deep texts. Deep down my ass! talking about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. Wow, I could read what was written on the walls of the bathroom and to be deeper than that. And they did not celebrate themselves, their parents were famous personalities and they wanted their children to be too much, so they made a bad idea. I have the feeling that it will soon be canceled.
