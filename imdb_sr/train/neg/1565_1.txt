The film uses a sharp title for the lame story. Kill Kill, it would be nice. The film contains a taboo scene so that the viewer returns to his chairs. The scenes are unnecessary and throbbing. The movie was something that the home screen writer could invoke. Just wasting movie props and network money. I need to write 10 lines of text to criticize this movie when it's not worth ten rows of my time, but I have to keep saying that people know to avoid nonsense. If people count on you to choose a good film for a movie night, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not damage it by subjecting this dirt.
