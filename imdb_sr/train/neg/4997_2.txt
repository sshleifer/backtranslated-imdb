... but certainly not without merit. Already writer-director Preston Sturges experimenting with unusual movie effects in telling his stories, creating broadly drawn but characteristic characters and situations, and writing a clever, sometimes unexpectedly wise and sympathetic dialogue. (No wonder Cohen's next film is to respect Sturges.) The main problem is that the plot has not yet come to an end; he misses his surprise, the unexpected complications of the action and the sudden change in wealth that the viewers speculate. The slogan of coffee is a bad thing to hang the plot, and the ending is completely predictable. Frank Capra works a lot better than this. If you are new to Preston Sturges, look at "Eady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of the Morgan Stream". If you've already seen them, then look at this.
