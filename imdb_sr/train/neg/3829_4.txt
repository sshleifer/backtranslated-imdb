The seized train robber at Iume breaks down his chain of arms and heads for a retired sheriff who is responsible for the murder of his wife (as well as the hidden stock of gold that remains hidden by the scriptwriter). The attempt to bring the Western genre into contact with violence and brutality in the style of the seventies is not even in the same league as some of the new fashionable westerns that emerged from the late '60s. It is impossible simply and squarely, with feminine figures only as a punching bag and possible victim of rape. As the former Sheriff again commanded, Charlton Heston gives one of his lazy, least inspired performances ever (there is one good moment, trying to read the letter and mum for his glasses). James Coburn, as a semi-crazy semi-racer, is also on an auto-pilot, but Coburn has a way to turn even the worst dialogue and situations into something spiky and disturbing. That's his show to the end. * 1/2 of ****
