Poor Michael Madsen; he must be kicked out to know that people have learned about this terrible blow. I really can not think of anything worse I've ever seen except amateur pornography. It's so bad, and everything is here; a wooden act, a bad scenario, a shitty moral ending, you hate it and it's in this movie. My question is: "Who did hell put $$$ into this piece of dog doo? he could see Michael's sister Virginia naked on the scene, but I do not think that even this would save this stinker ... < For a cool guy who made some exceptional films, I want to know what the Strange Church sponsored this piece of crapol.
