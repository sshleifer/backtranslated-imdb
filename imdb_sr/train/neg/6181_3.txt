If you are a fan of Misteri Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Giant Leeches, or Pinata Survival Island, this movie could be for you. I live in Nashville and I did not even know about the existence of this movie until the day before its release, when the advertising company fluttered and covered Music Rov with dozens of flyers and billboards. It was barely two weeks in the movies anyway. Poor acting, bad writing and poor production just begin to describe this shame of the film. To begin with, the names are a bit: Bo Price, Angel and Dicky? Abe. Toby accidentally slowly delivered the lines to ask who the production assistant was stuck with holding the card for the camera. The angelic character is rapidly moving from its city roads to cowboys, sliding into the southern slang after two days on the ranch. Her wardrobe goes from chic to the female version of Tobi's - in fact, in the final scene, their clothes are identical, which makes someone wonder if a wardrobe invites the patient. Sound is inconsistent - perhaps the most obvious example when Toby decides to swim and his voice suddenly sounds like shouting at the gymnasium. It is never enough to explain or develop a character that would be sufficient for what is happening on the screen. Exaggeration, outrage, mood and mood best describe the interpretation of the actors and the direction of the horrible scenario. This movie is best enjoyed after consuming several alcoholic beverages in the company of your best friends. But that does not say much.
