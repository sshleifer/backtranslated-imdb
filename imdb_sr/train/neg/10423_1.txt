so ... it's really sexist, and classics, and I thought it might not be in the initial stages of the movie, as Stella tells Steven she really likes to change and start talking in the right way and says she does not change. Well, he certainly changed his melody, and other reviewers seem to have followed this example. what initially appears to be a love story is actually a social position and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the film does not make it a hero, it makes this thing sad. and sad that people think it makes her a hero. Maybe it's a commentary on a movie that people should take away. positive reception reflects the continuous patriarchal currents in social consciousness. iuck.
