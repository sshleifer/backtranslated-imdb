I would not recommend this unless you are interested in David Copperfield and want to complete the set. There are some good performances (such as Uriah Heep) and well-targeted moments (eg Beaten), but in reality it falls furiously compared to the 1999 BBC version, as well as earlier versions. There are inexplicable changes in a story that really does not serve a great purpose except, possibly, it is quenched (stolen jewels are the case in this case). American actors were poorly selected: Salli Field is a good actress, but she was wrong as Betsy Trotvood, and her English accent is just a bit better than Dick Van Dike's cockney. I see why Michael Richards was chosen to play g. Micavbera; However, it spreads too much and becomes irritating. He also pronounces his lines with an accent that goes beyond eccentricity and becomes simply meaningless. Anthony Andrews is terrible as Mr. Murdstone, but he is almost expected to bring a black robe and link David's mother to the railroad (although this may be partly the fault of Dickens). I got this for free with the newspaper. It helped to pass a Sunday afternoon, but I felt more disappointed than I was at the end
