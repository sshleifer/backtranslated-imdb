Why does this film fall below the standard? In the end, the answer lies in a poor, humorous scenario. Slim / average Travolta (looks pretty relaxed in black I have to say, even with HALF) and Gross behave very well as two young-ish 'slick-dressed' but nevertheless dimvitted Nev Iorkers eager to open their nightclub. In addition, the rest of the movie is just boring to watch. It's very boring that it's really not worth knowing what is happening at the height of the film at any level. Kelly Preston obviously dressed in a sex appeal and a sexually charged dance with her husband Travolta is one of several pleasures of the movie. Charles Martin Smith is quite fun to watch KGB "Bob Smith" fighting. Personally, I think the film would be better if the plot was a little changed, so the settings did not change from NI to "Indian Springs, Nebraska" (which is in the former Soviet Union?) You see the movie ... Obviously, this movie was filmed 1986. ready for release in 1987. I suppose that Paramount was stalled for publishing the film until January 1989 for incredible complication. It is said that this is "unbearable." However, this $ 6,000,000 movie received slightly more than an unpleasant $ 163,000 revenue because it was only published briefly in places like Texas and Colorado before heading directly to the video. This is evidence of the overall poor quality of this film.
