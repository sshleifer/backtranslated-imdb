At least with a teenage girl who gets girls, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40-year-old Virgin, he replaced the 40-year-old guy who was popular among women, but he somehow remained a virgin. But then you should not engage your brain with this movie or have I missed something about being in a coma for 20 years? One of the series of films in which 40 something behaves like teens and women for some reason is enough attractive quality to want a serious relationship with them. It's hard for me to understand how the country that produced such great TV comedies seemed to think it had to rely on rough and shallow characters for laughter. They did brutal films. They made us act like all Americans have a mental age of 15 years. This film is a rough and rough game that does not recommend anything.
