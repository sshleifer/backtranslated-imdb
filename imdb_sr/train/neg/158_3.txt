Warning Spoilers follov. Great recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Besides, defamatory! Scandalous! Filmed in Canada; probably by the Canadian team and the actors. I captured the last half of this film recently on global television in Canada. Nothing else to say except that I was completely amazed that this was an obvious piece of American historical revisionist propaganda; and starring Susan Sarandon of all the people! I can only assume that the Canadian director Roger Spottisvoode was forced to become a hero of the USAF when they are actually true rescuers where a small private airline based in Calgary is; Kenn Borek Air.
