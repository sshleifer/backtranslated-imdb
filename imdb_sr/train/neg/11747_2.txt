Although he got some good news after playing in Toronto Intl. There was more reason for the Film Festival to not expect too much from this. One - it's a Canadian movie with a very low budget. Secondly - it was written, directed and acted on the same person (usually a bad sign, unless Voody Allen, George Cloonei or one or two other respectable filmmakers were not). But despite looking at it with lower expectations, it turned out that much more disappointment than I thought was possible. Do not waste time and money on this party. He claims to be a comedy, but I just laughed twice. In addition, there is terrible music. How this has some attention I will never know.
