I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I have to say that this was extremely central (at best). The dialogue does not explain the story very well, and I have a feeling that there is a lot of holes for the works. There is no cute character in this adaptation due to bad behavior. I just realized that all the characters are too impressive when it comes to someone they love. Also, Cate and Heath's love look very incestuous. They look more like a brother and a sister than lovers. I do not understand why my father would accept something like that under his roof. I watched this movie for several actors I respected and enjoyed watching in previous films, but as I said, it's extremely difficult to love any character. The execution of Katherine Heigl was terrible, which was a complete shock. It was terrible that Edward's old sister was, and for Aimee Osbourne there was not enough lines for me to even criticize her performance. Johnny Vhitvorth went well and it was great to see him in something new, even though his character was a bit silly, he was the only person with whom I was compassionate. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but they reverberated as whistles and overly dramatic. I just did not enjoy this movie or the music in it. There was a short performance by a Christian punk band MkPk, but this little look would not convince me to look at this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job to convince me that it was not a movie. I just imagined something so completely different.
