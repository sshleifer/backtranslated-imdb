Herculis Puaro is, in general, a respectable "hero" who is well-known in books and films. This movie or this story does not work and I felt his mistake. Actors are not good, actors exaggerate and make nonsense, costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arabic clothes) looks fake and a serious viewer who twice thinks that this movie can be considered a comedy of mysterious drama. The actor playing Herculis Puaro does a good job, but nothing fantastic. The scenes, as said before, are perfect and look fake. The story is not very fascinating, though it's a murder mystery, but who cares about the death of a crazy and evil blond 45+ woman in the Iraqi desert ?! 'Victim' is not cute.
