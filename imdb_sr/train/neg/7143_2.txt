This movie has some of the most exciting cars I've ever seen in a movie, and definitely the hottest woman, but I have to say it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Here is a plot, and if you read it with a little inflection, you also have an acting. Start, enter characters, hot female singing (obvious lips synchronization). A musician or producer arrives, thinks he is great and asks her to run. She refuses, too many bad memories. The flash to the war hero, returning from war, has several struggles, and becomes a film hero with the view that he is better than anyone. Take a quick exotic car. The brother is running, and then he dies. The hero who reviled death, cut off his arms from his friend. (You've never seen this friend before or after, but it looks like he really cares about him) Are you sure you want it; Yes; I mean, are you really sure; Yes, give me a weapon; are you really safe? Yes; OK, I guess I can not get you out of it, be careful, I love you. Now she goes to blow up the house of an uncle who owned the car his brother was driving. Finds a woman, decides to save her, She leaves, and he does not end up killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the movie. Oh yeah, you need to throw another scene with the bad people coming to beat people who really do not matter, but maybe it adds a bit of complication. The race is not even so exciting, of course it ends with two races in races, and those who should win at a sudden finish. OK, I saved you $ 7.00. You can send all your money to me, because I should give you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie. Do not misunderstand me, cars are great, and Nadia is beautiful, but it's really a horrible movie.
