A disappointing and undoubtedly boring movie about the real crime that was badly played by actor Jeremy Renner, who silly murmured his way through the lead role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the most recognizable degeneration / serial killers of the last century. "Dahmer", released straight-on-video in early 2003, has opened up a boring, boring, poorly portrayed and practically bloodless smack-fest drama about real crime that has never really dived into the monstrous and crazy psyche of the late mass murderer as if it were perfectly good potential! What, however, makes an attempt to do it for unknown reasons, causes some kind of sympathy for the viewer towards a man by showing him as what is ultimately a lonely, non-serious and seriously socially incompetent homosexual loser who simply watched for love in all the wrong places opposite the cold, calculated and distorted sikko and crazy who was! Overall, the 2003 Dahmer is one that could skip everywhere on real crime because I'm not kidding when I say it's one of the worst biographies of serial killers! It's even sorrier from other pathetic and explosive garbage such as Gackie, Bundy, Ed Gein, and The Night Stalker! (Turkey-Zero Star)
