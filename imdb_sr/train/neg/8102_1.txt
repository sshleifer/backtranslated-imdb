Oh, I've heard so much about this movie. I went to see her with my best friend (she is female, I am a man). Please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream. After the first few tens, "take off clothes," we both felt a very strange combination of nonsense and boredom. We were laughing (not on it), we were jamming (and it would be better to stay in bed), we were convinced that we wasted the money in vain. And we had. The action was unsurpassed, and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to worry. Losing money, losing celluloid. This film does not even deserve one of ten votes, but it is the lowest available. I'm not sure why this movie has a reputation that it's great; I do not recommend it to anyone who has even a little taste or intelligence.
