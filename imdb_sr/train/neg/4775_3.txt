What a complete waste of time. The film starts as a clone of the Savo series, but with more acting. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely terrible. The ending is ridiculous and the story does not contain any complications, not surprises and only a bad end. I liked some of the characters and I hoped that everything would be connected at the end. It just does not happen. It's a total "wrestler" that ends without good acting. I can not believe I spent time watching this. It's not "fun", as some people say. The guy in the mask kidnaps people who are connected and makes them understand it. The connection is stretchable and he was supposed to kill the main actress first.
