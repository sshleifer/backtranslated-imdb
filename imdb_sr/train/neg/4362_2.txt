A group of people seeking aliens and going to the earth to eat a land on the planet of prehistoric beasts, where everyone eats physical mushrooms and acts retarded. Covered with footage from "Planet dinosaurs" and terrible jokes, this is definitely one to be missed. The acting is also terrible, and although this is not as bad as "Chickboker" (which movie can it be?) It's still quite horribly disgusting. It's time to make you feel like eternity for 90 minutes and you'll probably curse your life by making a great service and just go on, skip this shitty movie, you have nothing to see here. Film makers try to resell this shit as a MST3K style that entertains a movie that made a decade earlier, and works to some extent that there's still nothing to watch, Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a rather unattractive voice. /> My City: D- DVD Ektras: Joke commentari, 17 Behind the scenes featurette; 7 minutes in black face; Jessica Mills reporting; Stills galleries; and the original trailer
