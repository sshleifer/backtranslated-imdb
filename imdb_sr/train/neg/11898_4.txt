A police officer (Robert Forster) in a city that abounded in crime, his wife was assaulted, and a young son was killed after he dared to confront a robber at a petrol station. After the killers escaped without help thanks to a corrupt judge, and he himself was sentenced to 30 days for disobeying the court, he decides to take matters into his own hands by entering a group of vigilants led by gray Fred Villiamson. These types of Robin Hood singled out any kind of crime that the law does not want to prosecute, and with their help trying to find those who hurt him. This film is nothing but a big bag. The only thing unusual is the murder of a two-year-old boy on the screen, who was quite ill. Otherwise, it is common for this genre to be a lot of car racing, beating and shooting with many male poses. Although I could not fight in a prison in the shower, including all those prisoners who were naked. Also, did they run out of money before shooting the last scene? I recall it because it ends very quickly with a small closure. If someone knows, give me a bell .. in fact, do not bother. To conclude: File under "Forgotten Nonsense". Next..
