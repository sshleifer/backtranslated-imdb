You can not take too much against it knowing that it was made in four days, and I was expecting it to be camping anyway. (In reality it's not all that camping. With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not realize themselves seriously, the rest of the actors play halfway; Riley Smith is extremely bad.) The funny story is actually paid attention, which shocked me; I have assumed that the purpose of these ultra-low budget horror films is to provide the most basic sexual fantasies and not to worry about the story, but they use many words like "technological" and "physical" in the script to get their point. (Although it's possible that the story is important only to explain why there are so few actors.) Nobody cares about this stupid story, and the only things that are interesting in the movie are the cursing of cults and mecheroism (which are not so nervous). I would have enjoyed more if there were some random killings for no reason. The film is grainy, with television appearance and level of acting. There are several "sexy" scenes that are all right - the guys are cramming in bed in their boxers, they feel; or to be tied up and make orgasmic faces as the wine pops on them - and some of them are a little funny. And I liked swimming in L. Ron Hubbard and the desired irony of stories about religious cultists told by intense gay tones, but that's still not good. 3/10
