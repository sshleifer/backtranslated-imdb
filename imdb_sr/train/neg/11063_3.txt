I have the 'courage' to let you know to stay away from 'Dahmer', a biographical film based on the real story of a grotesque serial killer. "Dahmer" is more hidden than the mentality of his focused subject. Jeffrei Dahmer, who killed over 15 young men and ate some of their body parts, was probably the most disadvantaged serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this horrible spectacle that should have been scrutinized by their heads before they decided to look at this horrible project. This is not easy to digest the film, although Jeffrey could easily digest it with some fireworks' brainsadillas' or even some real 'Mr. Potato skins'. * Failure
