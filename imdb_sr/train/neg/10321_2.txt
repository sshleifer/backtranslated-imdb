This show is terrible, jokes are all terrible and just get worse and worse. I am one of those who have never been a great fan of Corner Gas, but at least I liked it at the beginning until it broke up in the second season, all the jokes were played and the characters had nothing to do with them. Well, at least Corner Gas was good at the beginning, a small mosque in prairie is typically a terrible CBC comedy that had nothing to do with it from Episode 1. Who are the people who watch this show anyway, I'm honest because they are old or maybe just people who really live on prayers? Maybe jokes for them are working there? I do not know any person who loves this show and can not stand it alone, jokes are completely predictable and characters are even less developed than Corner Gas. I hope it will not take much longer, because it seems to me that all the success of this performance is entirely based on the premise of a musical performance that is different and could or should lead to a great performance.
