The writer / director of this film obviously does not know anything about the film. I think the DP on this project was tied and replaced with a monkey, because each sight was either too dark or had warmer points than the sun. The story was terrible, the characters were very dimensional. If someone said that this movie was made for poker fans, not for movie fans, someone was screwing (probably it was a writer / director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. Entering the casino and playing a few hands does not give you the experience to write about poker. Keep your daily work. And if you play poker, then you must be hurt.
