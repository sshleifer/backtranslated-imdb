In the late eighties of the last century, an unexplained rash of supernatural horror films appeared in gloomy prison environments. Rennie Harlin was a wonderful and covetous "Prison" that turned the entire trapped ball; immediately followed a particularly weaker "chair", John's Saxon "Death House", transient psychological painting "Destroier", and this terribly limpid exercise in hopelessly comatose boredom. Your usual disturbing collection of terribly insensitive college students led by the relentless immortal martyr Alec (huge Nicholas Celozzi) goes to the Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances of sudden deadly death - Rock star Sammy Mitchell (bands was played by Tony Basil of "Hei Mickey" fame). Alex's brother becomes obsessed with the evil demonic spirit of the vicious Cannibal commander of the American Civil War and continues with the expected murder, thus compelling Alex to overcome his passivity and oppose this desperate tone. Although photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg, with several decent sets and a rather ghostly atmosphere (the film was shot in place in the gloomy, rusty ruins of the island of Alcatraz), "Slaughter rock", regardless of everything, cut it as solid , an effective feature of fear. This is largely the result of uniform and unbearable collegial characters from smart personalities. The flat that works out of an apparently disinterested actor pains things even more, since the former "Plaiboi" is another and indisputable blonde sweet cute hottie supreme Hope Marie Carlton working especially irritating Linnea Kuiglei immunity as a symbol of excessive nimpho bimba. Dimitri Logothetis's direction shows a little visual style, but the tone is unevenly emphasized between gloomy seriousness and stupidity, terribly sophomoric nonsense, and, badly, Ted Landon is messy, inconsistent, overly complicated and finally quite confusing scenario unsuccessfully develops the necessary inner logic for a far-sighted story was even quite acceptable. In other words, this stinker unfortunately manages to make the scant 90 minutes as if it is a painful prison sentence.
