John Vaine and partner Kansas Charlie (Eddie Chandler) are friends who are looking for Rattlesnake Gulch rodeo. Scott is a pretty fair competitor, but he thinks that if he is not willing to accept twenty-five cents a dollar in a cash prize from a broken promoter, he will have to collect his winnings on the target. Quite coincidentally, the bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fik) decide they would like to take the rest of the rode; They shoot at promoter Farnsvortha (Henri Hall), and make them look like Scott and Kansas Charlie are killers. Wayne and Chandler use the running in a movie where they are preparing to watch him with their fists over various trivialities. Every time Chandler makes a wild swing, Vaine's foot strikes and throws nonsense. If you are very careful, there is one neat Lipton Tea ad in one of the scenes where Scott's love is interesting to Anne (Marie Kornman appears. Later in the movie, friends are again framed by the robbery of the stage Having a heart change and seeing a mistake in his ways, the bad guy Jim wants to come clean and admit to the sheriff, but Pete stabs him while he was puffed up, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne In an incredible scene, Anne move right into the middle of a fight between good guys and villains to deal with the sheriff. <Br /> <br /> < > "Desert Trail" is one of the blond John Vaine Vesterns from Lone Star Productions during this era. "Gabby" Haies and Iakima Canutt are visually absent, one or both of which are usually seen in these oaters, and if you're a fan of John Vaine, you will have to see it once, but it will probably be enough.
