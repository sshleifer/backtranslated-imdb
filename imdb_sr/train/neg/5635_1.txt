And I like Dafoe as an actor, but I spent several hours of my life actually watching this movie, I still can not believe I managed to watch it in its entirety. Did it actually happen to watch the movie? And the end, well, I'm glad I never paid to see this terribly absurd piece of the pathetic pronunciation of the film! I'm not sure I will not reveal the facts, but did Dafoe get married or saw a horrible actress in this real-life movie, if it was an attempt to start a career? if she is so afraid she must failed. I hoped that I would really be able to watch someone watching this movie, even if one person was watching my comments and decided that I would rather watch the color drying, I feel that I did something good in the world , only if I had the same advice ...
