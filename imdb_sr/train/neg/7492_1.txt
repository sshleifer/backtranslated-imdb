It is obvious that most viewers do not know anything about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and all of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Hitler and Stalin. Nuremberg (and much forgotten trials across Europe) was the revenge and injustice of the winner. What do you think, why there were no American, British, French or Soviet defendants after the Second World War? There were no American, British, etc. War crimes? There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Catherine, and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not real. The main thing was: Vae victis! Germany must collapse! (It was also the title of the book in America, 1941). This film is a terrible, unwavering American instrument for brainwashing, full of errors, lies, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. And above all: full hypocrisy. But it's not surprising ... Why was the Nuremberg process not enough? This film is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (hatred and narcissism and the lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacre in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very smart. Even Stalin's envied it ...
