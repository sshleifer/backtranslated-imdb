Why me? Why would I be subjected to such a massacre of what could have made an interesting story?! At least if I can warn other people, it would be worth it. I had to watch this terrible film for college. Otherwise, I would look at the synopsis on the back of things and lean away. The film was slow, it had a better character development and was focused on the idea that a creepy little white man might become cool if he hangs with a black LA-style man. experience the stereo-like LA feeling of sprightly superficiality - watch the movie. Pay attention, however, that this film does not represent DEPICT of what we began to consider as "LA lifestyle", it's a wonderful example of the products coming out of it.
