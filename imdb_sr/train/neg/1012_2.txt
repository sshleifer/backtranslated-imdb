How can there be a lot of corrupted policemen, without any of them being ruined? With enough policemen who will lead a mini-war involving such weapons as flame throwers, you would think they would be caught before somebody writes for weekly coupon papers to hear someone say "thank you" to the corrupted cop. You will never get your 90 minutes back. Life is too valuable to rent this movie. I feel bad about the big actors who made a mistake in making this movie. If you like Justin Timberlake, feel free to rent this movie. He plays a big role in this, so fans can enjoy it. However, I believe that most of his fans are young girls, which violence in this movie can turn off.
