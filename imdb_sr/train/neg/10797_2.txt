He was a genius played by Shak. His name was Kazaam, and he was hit. His rhymes were loose, these lines were bad, some stupid kid for his stupid father of bad actin, bad casting, bad special effects, what's next? this movie is shit Prolley did not earn $ 20 to live in boombok and not the lamps hurt like a cramp like a wet seal of food ... Yes, you realize, stupid rhythm genius who can not act in a stupid movie with terrible special effects. Oh, and confusing like in hell. I will not go any further. Let's say, it belongs to the category "its so bad, its funny". Watch him once with your friends and laugh a lot. But do not expect anything spectacular.
