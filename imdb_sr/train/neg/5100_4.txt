This anime series starts great: An interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully performed and performed. He does not explain everything immediately, watching the observer, listening to the carrots, watching the spectator watching each episode. But imagine the disappointment when you discover that the fantastic thriller / giant adventure of robots is just a background for psycho-cock and quasi-religious exploitation. If you want to hear "You're okay. It's good to be you." After fought with negative slogans and negative emotions of characters, then this is for you. If you want a good sci-fi movie that's just fun to watch, forget about this. Both the original and alternative endings were rather disappointing for me. All this, and this film was too big.
