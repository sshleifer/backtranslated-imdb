Although I have to admit that I laughed more at watching this movie than the last few comedies I've seen. The budget must consist of a pocket change from the actors. Production values ​​are so low that they have made them fun to watch. It reminds me of a robot monster composed of a guy in a gorilla suit with a carton duck helmet. In one scene an unfortunate victim gets a cut off arm and leg. Jesus, hard to believe, but the scene of the Black Knight from the Holy Grail was more realistic. I was constantly wondering why the victim did not start shouting "Nothing will pass" and "It's just a meat wound, I was worse." It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year. The "Gladiator / Demon" was also a seam. Between the terribly cheap bone and the geeky look of the face, the end result was hysterical. True movie that is bad enough to be watched. It's like watching a car accident on a slow motion picture. <br /> <br />
