From the moment the film starts, there is already a disagreement. Since this film is taking place on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East, as well as an international film, it might be expected to display appropriate accents. This does not work as most actors sound American. Also, I think that acting is best practiced, it's a little hard to keep up with the story from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the film is very precise in costumes and landscapes. If you want to see a movie to get a sense of how it was in the past (although the lack of accent) then this movie is worth renting. If you are looking for a movie as epic as the Kingdom of Heaven, then look elsewhere.
