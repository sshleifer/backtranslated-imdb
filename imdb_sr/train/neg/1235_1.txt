I really enjoyed seeing the Planet of the Apes, but that was a great disappointment. The settings and masks are great, but it's the only good aspect of the movie. All other things are really boring. Mark Vahlberg does not play, he's just in the movie, he looks stupid. Other actors are also not very good. But the worst thing is a story. It's absolutely funny! For example: monkeys lie unconscious on earth, but people do not attack them, no, they are waiting to get up again! This is just one example of a stupid story, but it would take too much time to tell them everything.
