HAH! So, this is the movie that was entered by "Nekt Action Stars". Well, I'm glad I did not participate and I did not win ... Is not it funny how you can look at the first 10 seconds (!) And make up for the movie? I mean, come on! Just look at these titles!? I watched this movie (or part of this "teleplai" because it was produced for TV and we could not watch the whole thing) one night while I was serving a military term, and the audience with me was a typical delicacy guys who once watched a series like Las Vegas for girls only. so at least it was not quite high, the most watched movie in my group was Girl Nekt Door (and this was not because of the big scenario; D. But the complete lack of originality, acting, scripts and everything else that makes the movie good, it's quite easy to switch the channel in Las Vegas (or was it CSI? I do not remember ...) without any complaints from the rest of the group, and this is rare (!) \ t Not with this movie! If it is on TV, then yes, watch and think about it. My conclusion: well, since Joel Silver really produced some of the best action movies out there (Die Hard, Matrix 1) I can I can say that producers do not give the film quality, give money to directors, and sell this movie just because Joel Silver is just a desperate attempt to cover up the apparent failings of the crew that really succeeded.
