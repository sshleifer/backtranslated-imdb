I usually love monstrous movies. Even if they are incredible and stupid. But this film can hardly be liked when it's so incredible and stupid, and it's trying to take it seriously at the same time. Like in some really hilarious way. Although the idea is somewhat factual, like Orcs known for killing large white sharks, it's really hard to find it scary when I can not help but only see the angry Shamoo destroys things. Especially the scene in which a building exploded because Orca is doing ... and as it explodes, the thing jumps out of the water and it seems to me to watch a show at SeaWorld with fireworks. Plus they kill many scary moments before they even hint that it will happen. In addition, several JBS are required. It's like, "Hey, look, we're factual and we can think of BETTER reasons why Orca attacks." Yes, you ignore your incredible .... But JAVS had one thing that your movie did not do. It's horrible. Yes, that's incredible. Yes, it's a bit unexpected. But quite honestly, factually or not, the killer shark is not nearly as scary as the Great White. And a bad attempt to develop characters and writing just hurts him more. Even JAVS The Revenge is more terrible than this.
