Ben's policeman outside the city is convinced that his sister is brutally murdered and wants to bring his killer to justice, but Stefan addressed him who thinks his sister was a victim of a cult of insects. So Ben, the best friend of his sister and Stefan, travel to Transylvania to end this evil. This is incredibly terrible thing about B-Class and I wondered how it was even released. This makes the original "Hovling" look like a masterpiece. He was thinking about what Christopher Lee is, because that must be his worst performance I've seen. There was a lot of that bad in this real cheap movie, starting with really hopeful and wooden performances by Annie McEnroe, Reb Brovn, Marsha A. Hunt and Sibil Danning (not forgotten by Lee), cheese fashion (one sunnies), cheap and lame special effects, poor lighting use, humor ... (with a movie that focuses only on an unknown group), the insect has orgies, which is a sight for watching and a tiring story with a flat and boring dialogue. I thought that if it was so bad, it would be terribly ridiculous, but I was wrong. Positive location and movie settings looked great, but that's all ... actually, I will add Sibil Danning a short download scene. During the end, the band plays its song during the strange montage of the scenes from the film, which I'm wondering why? Terrible piece of clutter, but at least not boring. 1/5
