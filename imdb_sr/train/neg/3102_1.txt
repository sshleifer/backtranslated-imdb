No matter how you watch this movie, it's just terrible. If you look at him as horror, then this is a film that is unheard of, and monsters are hand-made dolls. If you watch it as a comedy, then you will notice that most humor falls flat and that it is just chrome. If this is a romance, you will wonder why the guy would stay with such a B ** ch! If you look at it as an action you can not really attract for a Heroic Hero. As you can see, this movie simply fails to deliver anything fun fun. As mentioned, monsters are an obvious doll and this film was another attempt to film Gremlins. This, however, has the worst monsters of this genre. Critters looked pretty good, like Ghoulies, even the Munchies puppets looked better than these. The characters in this film are completely unimaginable. The hero is a silly guardian, his girlfriend is always complaining, have a friend who has a cretin's military boyfriend and another friend who is a spy. At one point in the film, a hero and soldier struggle with the grab ... this film is completely stupid. I love the scene when they are in a terrible club scum (which is obviously not a club, but probably dinner), and the hero tells the waitress that none of them is 21. Give me a pause, I'm 25 and I look younger than any of them.
