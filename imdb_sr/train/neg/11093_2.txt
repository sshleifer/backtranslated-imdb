If this film was a fictitious figure, the film could stand alone and objectively evaluate. Unfortunately, for the viewer, the film is based on "facts" that are unjustly shaded by Ruben Carter. Many of the lesser facts were ignored (Carter was not number one at the time of the murder, there is no evidence that he saved a friend from a juvenile maltreater in his youth), but some of the major facts, as Joe Giardello's decadent decision seems to be due to "racist" judges, is for those of us who saw the fight on the tape and the complete disrespect of Giardella. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero from someone who was at best in trouble and about trouble much more than a normal person should be (repeatedly arrested for beatings by women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter never looked at his actions in the sixties, and even now, when he refuses to talk with his son, the person whom people can look at. Everyone knows that Judison can direct, and Washington can act, but why have they chosen this story as their vehicle is beyond me? Is Hollywood so much needed a black hero who needs to master the truth in all his biological paintings to make them convincing? (Here's a suggestion. How about Denzel playing a movie about himself? Now it's inspirational.) Based on all the inaccuracies in the film, I would suggest that this be transmitted.
