No wonder this is posted on a DVD here in Australia, without any features for redemption. The dialogue was hockey, acting, horrible and hidden text! Whoever thought it would be a good idea to make a sequel or follow a far superiorer John Badham film, Vargames from the 80s, but they had to be on something that was a bad idea !! Amanda Valsh was good at being eye-catching, and Matt Lanter was as good as the second major trail - as far as that is concerned. I would not recommend Vargames: The Dead Code to anyone, look at Hacker or the original Vargames movie - both are better than this piece of shit !!
