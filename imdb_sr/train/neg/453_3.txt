Okay, first and foremost: Sher's show and cinema. Although I'm not a fan of Cher, she gives a great performance and her part is well written. Cinema was well done and recorded a romantic sense. The rest: a slender drawing, a performance by Nicholas Cage, and a completely inhumane and bad attempt to show the Italian-American family from New York. First, every time Cage opened his mouth, I squeezed myself. I do not know what kind of accent he was trying to use. Honestly not, it certainly was not a single New York or Italian accent I ever heard. It was pretty unreal. And it was not because I was a little attractive for precision, his voice was just in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other shows. Secondly, this is a pure anecdote, but I have many Italian relationships, friends and acquaintances in New York, and I sincerely laughed and I felt more joy in appreciating the Italian ethnic family away from this film. And that would be boring in the house. What a descent.
