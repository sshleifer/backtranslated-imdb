Written by excellent McGovern and directed by Frears, this film was a mild disappointment. It looked too short. He spent a long time creating the atmosphere of Hovis and laughing at Catholic demands. Then you very soon have a fascist and socialist who compete for family attention, and a terrible conclusion.
