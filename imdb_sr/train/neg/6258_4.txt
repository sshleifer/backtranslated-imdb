Screenwriter and director Toni Piccirillo adjusted his own idea of ​​a real man, recently widowed, learning in the past three weeks when he is HIV-positive; he finds a homosexual partner he ever had, brings him to the apartment and binds him, forcing blood to that guy and promising a bloody vengeance if the results return positively. An intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it is played. The prisoner of James Marsden is really cynical and silly, but his own artistic manners are disturbing - it's like seeing the version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work more with a more challenging role, but his personality-a shift from a shy guy to an abductor-on-the-edge is not convincing, nor are conversations that two men have. Marsden's gay entertainer is not apathetic, of course - he is currently in favor of Speedman's suffering - but he does not react or behaves the way any gay person does it. The film is not exactly true, but it's a scam that is further aggravated by poor montage, poorly designed flashbacks, low-budget production and a big final that smells like a stupid pretension and a soapy melody. * 1/2 of ****
