This film was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that immediately pop up on me: 1. The forests were more like hills in Los Angeles with a few trees and a brush. Not a big deal. Nevs flash, if you're shooting in southern California, the big bear is only an hour away. They have trees there. 2. Writing is absolutely no doubt the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal, clich√© or simply stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "camp blood" (chrome), the name of the clown is "clown killer" (chrome). What does clown do in the woods do? Is it the only mask they could find? 3. The last, but certainly the least, was acting. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actors ever gathered. Virtual abundance of shady lines and bad behavior. The worst part was when he accidentally flashed back to that thick foreign girl who was naked for a photo. It's a really long scene and I suppose it should have been sexy, but it was not. Also, this was one of the few pleasures in the movie for me, whether this tool should have been "athletic". For example, when he is bored in the film, he grabs a couple of stones and starts curling them. Then he should run for clowns and it was immediately clear with his "girlfriend as he" was running, that he was pretty far from athletics. Oh, and the girl who played Kat, the good Lord stops singing. That song you sing for merits makes me want to kill myself. If for some reason you see this movie, I would at least recommend watching special features. About a group of donkeys who talked about this film as if it was a really original story. In fact, one of the girls actually says she let some of her friends read the script and none of them could foresee the end. Looks like he's hanging out with special kids.
