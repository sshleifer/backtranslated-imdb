I suppose that no novice that is as bad as Mobi Dick would find much sympathy for the public from the age of depression who had enough of their own problems. But every similarity to the classic novel Herman Melville is a pure coincidence. In fact, half of the film is the predecessor of the main story we know, not too much of it kept for the movie. For the first time we meet Ahab Creelia (he has his surname and brother), a lucky happy soul with two feet and the intention to marry Joan Bennett, who is the father of Father Mapple. That brother, Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. John Barrimore is Ahab in top performance. Barrimore did not quite master the soundtrack, and he shared all the silent-minded and stage-shaking scenes that would shake the beams of any cinema in which this movie was played. The leg to the big whale Mobi Dick and I have to say that the amputation was pretty scary. Of course, it was all before the Code. I am still sure that the crowd shook in the 1930s. Then the story of Ahab's whale hunting, which he thinks made him ugly in the eyes of Joanne Bennett. It's not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact, there are no female characters in Mobi Dick while he wrote it. In addition to Kueekuega, a Cannibal harpooner has names but not personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs could be Smith and Jones. I would see this version of Mobi Dick exclusively because of curiosity and nothing more.
