I am a girl for a good romance, but this one can not be considered either good or romantic. I had a complicated post-mortem before the credits were completed. With such a bad dialogue, complication and character development, I suggest you invest an hour and a half. I had to hurry and rent Serendipiti for the third time so I could get a bad taste from this mouth.
