Four strange monsters follow the relationship of a shy, withdrawn videographer and equally alienated artist who fights, who, living in Great Apple, develop an incredible romance with the help of the internet site for dating. This is not so unusual in itself, but what it is is their way of communication. Speaking verbally, they write notes and later communicate via video. The film is based on the creative (Arin Crumlei & Susan Buice) with his own relationship, which, besides writing and directing, plays as the main characters. With elements of avant-garde, anti-plot and docudrama, the film spills into the wind with an indefinable structure that is neatly embedded between narcissism and self-enjoyment. While film wears, a short breakdown and deterioration of their sometimes intriguing forms of communication become old as the couple faces the hardships of reality. Focusing exclusively on the inner conflict, or the affliction of the relationship, the film struggles through a staggering story that is neither original nor touching. It could easily be circumvented by the addition of subplot and external conflict, and the third act, to which it is not - only the installation of melodrames that does not lead anywhere. What is even more aggravating is the film downturn from a story into reality that is suddenly ending with an open and unsatisfactory ending. Everything would be fine and spicy, but there is no question and there is no point in discovering or thinking. (On the side, the film contains wonderful animation and live and moving music, one of the more interesting aspects of production.) But as always, watch a movie and decide for yourself.
