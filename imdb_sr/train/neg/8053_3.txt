As a premise, this version of the Dead Calm story promises. However, the inability of Eric Red's director to provide a convincing hurricane leads to an increase in continuity and lighting errors. After all, the viewer is more preoccupied with the bizarre weather effects than the desired story. Intermittent disturbances from the too much of the ham are similar to the things that interfere. Charles Dance, working 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick, does everything in his power to save the movie. But in the end, raise skueals like a pig ... and there are more hammers for lifting.
