What are people talking about here? I must have seen another movie from you. It was so boring for me to get out of the theater. What about these things. I just laughed once, and even not so hard. Whoever planted this film should be taken to the street and beat. I usually find something that I like in the movie, but this is crazy. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" a classic. It is ranked with such waste as "Bodi Shots", "Con Air" and "The conspiracy theory" as one of the worst. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would share money with people while leaving the theater as a sign of apology, but to my distress that did not happen. It looks like I'll never see that money again or two hours later.
