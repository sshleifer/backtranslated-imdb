Poorly structured, poorly written, loaded with clich√©s and flat dialogue. No scene is shining. Actors struggle with a painfully boring scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises, complications or conflicts. You know from the first ten minutes where it goes. For a film set in New York, there's almost no feeling for the city. There are a dozen other indie films that make it magical in a small budget. This looks like it was shot at Toronto. If you throw Natasha Henstridge, why would she wear it in baggy sweaters? Why does Vartan look bored and gray? Where is the attraction? I felt like watching a movie from a week that was a sub-pair of a Christian film that was so asexual and moralizing. Steven Feder's great success is that he convinced people to make this film.
