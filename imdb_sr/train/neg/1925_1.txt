Ron Howard has directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple trick. In this film, Howard gives us Vhoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Vhos. Jim Carrei is terrible, but I'm sure he's not his fault; I imagine the script was looking for the dumbest imaginable man, so Carrei channeled Tom Green and the result was film magic. Like the penguin Danny Devit in Batman's return, Carrei's Grinch is so unsuitable that any comedy that could be mined from his character simply gets out. Where was the 1966 Cartoon movie that we all could identify with, Carreiev Grinch is the angry, soulless old man we all saw at one time or another, sitting in a parked car mumbling herself or grabbing young children in a supermarket with his staff. This Grinch is completely deprived of any degree of humanity, humor or insight, and his redemption at the end of the film is wrong. The whole movie is fake: there is some stupid Christmas light competition, an unsuccessful attempt to explain why Grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood, and an incomprehensible mystery about why some of these men have such a strange extension of lips and some of them do not . Unlike a cartoon film from 1966, I imagine that children would regard this film as tired, irritating and filled with contradictory messages. Did we really need to see Slutti Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha Mai Vhovier? In addition, Ron Hovard filled the cast with his non-talented relatives. Include the necessary jokes, frenzied jokes, sexual jokes and other mandatory Carreieskue humor, and you have a film that is far from a 1966 cartoon film (or a book inspired by it) such as George V. Bush is a rational, lucid thought. Thumb this fat little turkey.
