The skipper Robert Tailor (like Terry) is "spooky, watery-lucky" and does not see straight through the extraterrestrial Norm Shearer (like Consuelo). "It makes the sun shine, even when it rains," explains Mr. Taylor. But, Mr. Tailor gets a clump in his throat as soon as she approaches Mrs. Shearer. Finally, at the casino in Palm Beach, Shearer often visits, Tailor declares "I love you!" Shaiker wipes him off because he is engaged to George Sanders (like Tony). However, in order to settle the gambling debt, Shearer urged Tailor to present himself as "Her Cardboard Lover," so that Mr. Sanders would be jealous. The title of this movie calls for an obvious and appropriate overview of three words: Cardboard Movie. "The most notable is the latest film performance by Shearer, one of the greatest stars in the world, from the film" The One Who Shuffled "(1924 , playing another Consuela) to "Women" (1939) To be honest, this was probably the kind of Shearer movie that MGM believed the audience wanted to see. However, the part is untrustworthy. Tailor and Shearer were better at "The Escape" (1940). If Shearer continued, maybe she became a better actress than the "lead ladies"; obviously, he she was no longer interested, and she certainly did not need money. Tailor has a great scene, reciting Christina Rossetti "When I'm dead, my dear one" while threatening to jump off Shearer's balcony, according to George Cukor's direction. ** Her Cartoon Lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Tailor, George Sanders
