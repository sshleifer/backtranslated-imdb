It falls into the movie category "Too Funny in the Dialogue and Enforcement Departments to Understand Seriously". While a scream, if you know what I did last Friday, the thirteenth or back of my boyfriend know they are bad, the scarecrows do not. Evil Dead has set such a high standard for comedy horror on the budget genre that the Scarecrow is simply unreasonable. Suspicions about inexperience are immediately played, as there are no indications of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an aircraft in an airplane. A repeat view of a 3-man image just screams for an arch from the story, but nothing comes. Although men obviously scared, there is no explanation. Knowing that this film is too serious for your own good, one can create a smile. I do not recall that Joe Bob Briggs ever scared the Scarecrow, but I do not think it would go down so low. However, with an IMDb rating of over 6, many disagree.
