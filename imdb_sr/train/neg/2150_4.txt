You will recognize the parcel immediately. Daughters of a divorced couple try to reconnect mum and dad again. Yes, it was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here is the ghost thing. Although Deanna Durbin was younger than 21-year-old Hailey Mills while playing the role of daughter, Durbin looks much older, as in adults. And all her so-called brothers and sisters. And this confusion between adults and children goes through the movie. The girls are dressed in cute little navy clothes, but they look funny because the director seems to be trying to point out their wide tips and tushies throughout the film. So you are constantly torn between thinking about them as children or women. When Rai Milland and others start to "hit" on them, you get the feeling that they are pedophiles, and maybe you, and you've noticed those tushie and peaks that the director pointed out. Teenagers or seducers, little girls or small foxes, you're never quite sure what you should think about them. And parents seem very old and the whole movie looks very obsolete. It's an annoying version of the trap for parents and you should avoid it, or at least ensure that your tetanus images are up to date if you do not trust me.
