Dolph Lundgren plays a former cop / boxer who searches for Boston's kinetics scene to find out who killed his brother, who was well-thought-out in the community, but he found out that his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that the serial killer was guilty. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this film, in fact based on his performance here, you could forget that Lundgren's rise to fame included action roles. It says the material gives Lundgren nothing to do with what could be done, in fact, Lundgren is completely omitted to dry in a gloomy thriller that is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the film works best when focusing on the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett, indeed the film took time to investigate their relationship movie would be pretty decent. However, the film is unclear, there is no action, the action is not sufficiently explored (Too boring about the Lundgren investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is unnecessarily bloody and funny. Once again, Lundgren is really good (As the novice Danielle Brett), but the movie only lumber from one sequence to another, making this film particularly disappointing. If anything, it shows how Lundgren is underrated as an actor. 1/2 Out of 4- (Poor)
