The final film for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubic's premature death in production, is a juggling act of sophistication and stupidity, romance and music, fantasy and costume dramas. In the 19th-century castle in Southeast Europe, the Countess falls on his sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian rebellion; Helping her ancestor, whose painted image magically revives. Betty Grable, in a long blue feather decorated with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this scenario (from Samson Raphaelson, taken from Rudolf Schanzer's and E. Velisch's opera) is overwhelmed with various ideas that can not be touched or fun. The results are good, but they do not absorb. * 1/2 of ****
