Many thought this was a good movie, but I disagree with them. At the beginning of the film, the spacecraft was broken on the ground, and some aliens escaped from the spacecraft, and then they killed some people on earth, but for no reason. Also, it's in the dark forest, I do not see anything on the screen, I can barely hear the sound. After a few days, the predator came to the ground, but no one had sent him signals before, he should not know what happened on earth, so there is a contradiction. Finally, the predator found the alien director and killed him for no reason. He was not on earth, he was nothing of his business about the things that happened here. Finally, the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes, the summary is too short and can not be clearly told to witness reviewers. In conclusion, I do not think this is a good movie.
