As usual, I'm really crazy to see movies I have not yet watched in the Oscars. I really enjoyed watching this movie, because it seemed like it was right in my street. I can not understand why this movie got a buzz that it has. No story! A group of people is turning around Iraq. One day they dispersed a bomb here. Tomorrow, they are equipped in the villages, not less than themselves, and the sniper starts firing. Do not wait here in Baghdad. There is no cohesive story. The three main characters are so characteristic that they are just cartoons. By that I mean, we have a sweet kid who feared dying. We have a stubborn soldier who is practical and just wants to get back to safety. And then we have a cowboy who does not respect the rules, but has a weak point for a little Iraqi boy trying to sell DVDs to soldiers. What do you think will happen? Well, do you think a cowboy soldier who does not respect the rules will get a wounded sweet kid with his outlaw ways? Why to! Do you think the Iraqi kid who was a cowboy soldier had a weak point that he would be killed and make him crazy? Why to! There is no story here. Scenario is minor and predictable! The camera shook much to make it look "artistic." And for all of you who think this is a great war picture, go to Full Metal Jacket, Deerhunter or Platoon. Do not waste your time and money on this boring movie!
