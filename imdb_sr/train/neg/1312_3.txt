Tom listens to one of those old radio shows, something that children from the 1950s up to today watch on TV. However, they did not record television when this cartoon was made so that people got fun - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. Tom literally shakes his boots and hears a story about the "phantom". He literally does everything the narrator tells, as "the hair stood in the end, the ice-cold runs down her spine, her heart throats in her throat," etc. - Cat antiques. Then we will get the taste of what we will see for many years after this cartoon in which Jerry tortures Tom for no reason other than sadistic satisfaction. If a cat is asking for trouble, that's one thing, but when he is thinking about his job and Jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) mistreated, it's hard for me to cheer for a "little man". These early T & M efforts were a minute longer than anything that followed. Sometimes that minute makes a difference. It happened here because it actually dragged on for some time. It could have been shortened to five minutes, and nothing could be missed because the sketches lasted too long. It's common for Tom and Jerry. They're usually much faster.
