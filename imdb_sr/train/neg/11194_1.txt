The arrival of the "Order" attractions makes it look like a decent mystery / thriller of horror, but what we get is a plot that has the potential to be excellent all together to form a bunch of garbage. First, the entire movie consists of horrific dialogue and terrible special effects. And acting was nothing to be proud of, but Keath Ledger (I think I wrote it.) He saved a movie in this category. For the name of God: Do not watch this movie!
