For the first 20 minutes (I watched it on PS2 so I really have no idea how long it was) Alienator puts an interesting place. I do not think I saw a movie with a stranger from another planet as before. However, soon the interest turns into an astonished disbeliever when you realize that an "alien" is a huge woman who is building a body in bikini steel. Yes, Alienator is obviously ridiculous. Do not think that I hold it against it. In the world of shlock-horror, apparently ridiculous, it can often be a good sign. However, the apparent stupidity of his premise is that the film really went for it. The alienator is ridiculous as hell, but it is also the highest-ranking Shambolan sikfest. The actors pile up unsuccessful attempts at seriousness, potentially the genius lines of pure cheese dialogue encountered disturbing incompetence and the direction failed to summarize even one or two decent set-pieces. As the film finishes, you can barely see the original concept through the layer of hay that is collected on it. Add to this the fact that 'Alien' just kills people by evaporating them, as opposed to doing any kind of "hacking" as such and you have a gigantic bunch of good ideas that get lost. You will laugh at the Alienator, but you will not. If it's your thing then go ahead and check.
