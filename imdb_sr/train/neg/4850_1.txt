Some unrealistic film spoilers are included. From real life experiences, this film has continued to be disappointing from the very beginning. I am currently on a second tour in Iraq as an infantryman. This film has nothing similar to what would have happened in real life. From the very beginning, let's say a few: bombing carts, EOD elements that appear solo, unaccompanied, the EOD sergeant, who sneaks out of the VBC, has sleeves all the time in the ACU, where I had to invite him to leave on my copy of the haji of $ 2, the sniper scene. The list will continue, however, it is unnecessary to list things that are wrong with a time span of 2 minutes before more things are inaccurate; This film is intended for people and critics who watch without understanding or experience with engagement or military. People with military experience or knowledge of the army will be disappointed with inaccuracy.
