If you've been watching this movie, you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Hehehe !!! Every time they said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed at thinking "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie"? I can not believe that Oscars like Freeman and Space have appeared in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J captured the screen. VTF is Timberlake? Dreaful acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could do a much better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me that I did not have much fun ... but I prefer the actor, not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, empty and boring as hell. I was happy when they both jumped out on the street. The story was fine and I think Dylan Mc Dermott played a good role as a villain. The movie was fun, but I think Timberlake ruined everything. It would be much more fun without him. By the way, the music was fine, but suddenly every time music appeared, the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flash, low movement and the like. Something wrongly conceived for this movie of the policemen. Maybe they wanted to make a MTV spot for Timberlake.
