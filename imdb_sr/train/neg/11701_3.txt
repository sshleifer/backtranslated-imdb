Just another example of why Stephen King's books should not be turned into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, has been ruined in a book-to-screen adaptation.) The story's story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet that "accidentally" kills the old gypsy. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he withdrew, although the accident was his fault because he did not pay attention while driving. The father of a dead Gypsy woman puts a curse on 3, with our main character, Billy (a lawyer) who gets thinner and skinny day by day. Although the film is preserved with the book, mainly, and your typical king ends, the acting has been stiff and felt forced. We have moved from one scene to another without much interaction, such as reading in the show. The king himself made a movie in a movie (like Dave Barry), which confirms my conviction that authors should remain just that: the authors. Leave the acting actors. It's not that anyone in this movie was so big. I saw the main characters in the movies where they were much better.
