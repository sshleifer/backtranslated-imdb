This film just upset MST3K and for good reason. First and foremost because the film is a "policeman" in which Joe Don Baker plays, for whom we all know he is a good cop like Michael Jackson is a singer of the western country. All the typical police film story devices keep their ugly heads, battles fighting, children as hostages in shooting, bad acting, bad police bosses, bad acting, revenge / justice, endless pigeons and of course a bad act. Do not watch this without the MST3K filter.
