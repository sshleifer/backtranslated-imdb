To start by saying that I am not a fan of horror films. I never look at them. Allow me to tell you about my experience ... The only reason I watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her girlfriend wanted to see Happi Feet . I've never seen Happi Feet, but I'm sure it's better than this ... movie? In any case, we did not actually expect it to be good ... we actually just entered to laugh at him. Calm down with me ... I have a problem to ruin a movie for other people in the theater, but since they were just the other couples who spoke and made up, it did not matter. After 15 minutes, other people went to Borat, a movie that I would like to see again. The film was not intimidating, not stupid, and it would be ridiculous ... it was just boring. It was not as scary as "Babi Genuises" terrible, it was terrible ... it's not fun at all. Avoid. Now I'm not an expert, but it seems that the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a PG-13 horror that is boring and not intimidating, or you can have a horrible horror movie that's either too bloody or disgusting for people. Want a horror PG-13 that's bullshit, but is it funny? See "Grudge". Avoid this movie as a plague ... because it literally bites you to death. 0/10
