The director's intention for this film is fairly honorable, but his history of production has made me realize that this may not be essentially what other filmmakers would do. having in mind his big 30-day TV series, and counting in his MTV production "I'll bet you want" that opposes his seriousness in any of the things that document and counting in his rather disappointing production "supersize me" I had no hope It's high. Unfortunately, this film disappointed me, though. as well as with the "supersize me" after a while, I wondered what exactly is the meaning of all this. the main statement becomes clear after half an hour, but the rest of the time becomes filled with rather meaningless things and repeating things that have already been shown in one way or another earlier in the film, so it is exhausted and becomes a very boring end.
