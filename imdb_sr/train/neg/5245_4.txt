I am the current A.S.L. The pupil was forced to watch this film in the classroom, and what I pulled out of him was the apparent bias in the film. The film is obviously tilted to P.O.V. of "common deaf perception" theirs is not the center. Also, the film did not mention or take into account other situations that are also debated in this subject. И.Е. Deaf People who were born and heard later. Is it right or wrong? The film is biased and practically all in the opinion of the deaf with capital "D". It's not that bad, but to be a real documentary, he should try to be a bit impartial.
