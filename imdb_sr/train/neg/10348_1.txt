I was very excited to see that they made a movie from my favorite book. I did not know it was Disney until it was too late. I was appalled by the many flaws of the key parts of the story. It looked like someone shot a movie from the book's report on the 4th grade of the novel. Meg was well in school, and neither she nor her father used to wear glasses. Ms. Murrai (Megah's mother) is not shown at all as a scientist; they left her kitchen lab and replaced it with the Internet. And that's just the beginning. Halfway through the film, I found myself shouting on the screen, much to the grief of other people watching a movie that did not read the book. I wish I had more thumbs so I could give four thumbs for this one. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book, this film is somehow okay.
