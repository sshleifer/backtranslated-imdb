There are some Stallone movies I love, but this movie did not meet my little expectations. I think this film is hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists that ruin the earth in the wilderness are ready to survive for at least two days. Also, in this wilderness, Stallone and the company continue to cross bridges and ladders that provide suitable shortcuts or planning devices. Likewise, Treasury officers do nothing to do with local rescuers. Also, bad guys who could not hit the side of the stall with a really high-tech automatic weapon. I still care for any of my bad guys, or for all of them who were killed. In the end, I could not believe the character anymore. It's not worth the rental price, not even worth the time to watch.
