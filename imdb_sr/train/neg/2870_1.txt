Oh my God! Please, for love for everything that is sacred, do not watch this movie! 82 minutes of my life I will never return. Of course, I could stop halfway. But I thought it would be better. It's not. Anyone who really enjoyed this movie is one seriously ill and distorted person. It's no wonder that Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to filming. Everything about this movie is terrible, from acting to assembly. I do not even write reviews here normally, but in this case, I will make an exception. I just want someone to warn me before I hire this disaster
