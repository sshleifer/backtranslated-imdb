This entrance to Drummond is missing in continuity. Most of them have elements of nonsense, delayed wedding, and so on. However, this has an infinite series of events that take place in close darkness as characters pass from one place to another. The house looks more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carroll, who is so obvious a suspect whom no one sees. He's a stranger and it seems pretty suspicious, but Drummond and people do not look anything. However, this is a pretty good action and a pretty good ending. I know that Algie should have been a comic figure, but like Nigel Bruce in Rathbone Sherlock Holmes, he is so angry that it's hard to imagine anyone with a taste or intelligence around him. Is there a history behind him explaining how he and Drummond became associates?
