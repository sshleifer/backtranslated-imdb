Was it a thriller, as I thought when I saw the video in the video library? Not. Was it a "food thought" that the author might have been trying to do it? Not really. What was that? It was a very average movie, which had great potential, and it was nicely directed, but lowered by a confusing story without strong points, starting from the middle and the end, with the bad effects expected from the serial killer, which, although it seemed too exaggerated in some places achieved the best performances of actors. It was beautiful cinemas, with good colors, good hi-tech material, nice scenes, but leaving you lost about where it's going and where it was just. And with the feeling that we just end up quickly at the end. OK to watch if there is nothing more on TV.
