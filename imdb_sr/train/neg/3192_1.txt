What the reviewers and MST3K omitted are the best (and the only unforgettable scene) of this horrible movie: There is a very good scene of rape in a shower that was committed by a bad guy (Ben Gazzara) on Maria as mentioned earlier, later killed due to incompetence TJ ). Perhaps rape is too strong, "mating ritual in prison" may be more appropriate. The background to this chances, and yet again a forced meeting is a mobster who hides "Ben Gazzaru," and he meets him with the girls who hang out in his pool. Thirty blue blond separates him, but our criminal must be pretty shocked, because he is courting at that moment. His first move is that he tries to drown, while the mafia don donator does not tell him to overthrow it. Somehow like a girl in a high school you did not like, but you still wanted to know about it ... Let's say, he caught her in kasana later.
