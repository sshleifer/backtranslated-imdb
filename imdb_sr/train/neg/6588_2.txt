These are some of the most pronounced problems with this film: 1) clich√©s abound. Seriously, terrible "knitwear" are everywhere. 2) Narration jumps in time, which would be fine if it would be good, but not. 3) Lame characters that do not develop so much that either remain completely static, or drastically change for no reason. 4) Great: HORRIBLE ACTING. At the top of almost every person. Following are some of the best details from the movie: 1) The lead is damn well looked. As I see, there are only two types of people who would be in this movie: a) People who can sit through 90 minutes trips simply because the pencil is attractive. b) People who often think to themselves, "I love Hollivood dreck full of cliches and overacting, but only if I could watch it in Korean ..." There is a lot of good Korean cinema out there, so why waste time with garbage?
