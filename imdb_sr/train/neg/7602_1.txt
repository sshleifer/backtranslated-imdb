One of the other commentators mentioned that they were almost out. If I had not been with my wife, who wanted to stay, I would leave. It's a pity, too, because I think it could have been a good movie. But this is easily one of the worst-case scenarios I've ever seen. It starts nowhere and does not go anywhere (I would say it does not go anywhere fast, but it really does not go anywhere slowly ... painfully slow). From time to time, there are hints that something interesting might happen, or that there is a potential depth below one of the characters, but that's all we get - hints. There is no single payout or discovery in the entire film. Not that I need a tricky plot to have fun ... I love a good character study as well as the next indie buff. But these characters do not give anything. For the entire duration of the film, you do not care what will happen to one of them. In fact, you almost begin to hope to die, because at least death would be more interesting than seeing their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable to think that this is per se convincing, but not. Instead of the strange, noir-eskuire characters who behave stubbornly, you immediately recognize it for what is: a bunch of talented, but mischievous actors, thinking and lifting their eyebrows while reading a bizarre dialogue without indicating the relevant context. All this for two gloomy, painfully slow hours. Terrible.
