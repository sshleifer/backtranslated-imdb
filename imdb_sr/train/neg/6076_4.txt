In FAN, Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Mak Cadi? You see the problem with this type of role is that De Niro played very similar characters in TAKSI DRIVER, COME KING and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scenarios. It was hard for me to believe that Renard would have begun as a frustrated obsessive sports fan in being an external psychopath. Character character is not the only problem with this script. the focus of the character (the problem that I had with UNTOUCHABLES, where De Niro was supposed to be adorable, but ended up a bit evenly), for several parts of the film I thought that Bobbi Raiburn was the main character, and then the story goes back to Renard. He seems to have disappointed many sports fans who think that this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball. I'm not sure if this was originally meant to be like baseball fans, but there are elements that suggest that manufacturers can focus on who and what the story should focus on. I will admit that I He entertained THE FAN (Especially after the soundtrack), but it's a movie with many drawbacks and it should be remembered that by the mid-1990s the characters were persecuted by the lunatics as in ONE WHITE WOMAN, UNRELEASED ENTERTAINMENT, etc. couple long ago
