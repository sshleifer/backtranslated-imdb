I thought this was a great idea, but, boy, it was badly done. We get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of the show, but virtually no specificity about any of them. It seems that the producers did not find any way to tell the story or provide the viewer with a "passing line". (And that does not mean that they did not try, but that the stage followers have linked the synopsis of the Ring cycle because the narrative program does not say anything about the work of physically assembling the opera.) We see a lot of things happening, but little is said about what people are doing and why. It makes little sense to who is who, or how different production departments fit in and work together. For example, we hear about a number of problems several times - it is expected to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it is resolved. Instead, filmmakers generally just go over to something else (in general, pretty generic images of people who push stuff or talk to the headphones.) You see running under the final shows of the show, not anything worth watching for your own merits.
