This could be a cute movie for kids. My grandson watched him once. he watched the other time when I looked at him with some things. When a small bear is lost on an iceberg, and he is in the water, trying to get to a piece of ice. says: "Come back stupid fool". I do not want my three-year-old grandson watching movies with these words. Therefore, it is also rated for children. It should be pleasant for children. I would expect that. They lost the brothers Varner and G, I would have expected this to not be a cursing. The words do not even fit into the movie in most places as it appears later. And the film takes place in many parts.
