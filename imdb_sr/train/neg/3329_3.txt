Get your basic Frankenstein flick, inject some Reanimator (but not good parts), and you have Dr. Hackenstein. Certainly, this is obviously inspired by the mentioned films, but it has never materialized as something special. The scientist accidentally killed his wife, so the whole movie unfolds during the night while trying to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to cut off parts of the body from some women who are stuck and, by chance, decide to stay in his place. I can not say that acting is bad. , nor is it a director. Everything is too standard here. The few humorous attempts actually work (look at the scene when Hackenstein is constantly hiding behind her deaf assistant, because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him holding a woman and a needle), but that's not enough to recommend this movie. Music is decent, what kind of blood is decent, and actors look pretty good. And half the time, I even enjoyed this film. But I never felt like it was more than the time that caused time. Avoid. Instead, try Frankenhooker.
