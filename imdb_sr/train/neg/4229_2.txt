I'm a big fan of such horror films, but come on! This must be the worst part of the monkey S @ # t I've ever seen! I ignored the reviews that were posted on this site and thought that it would fall in a terrible taste, but I was bored and quitted it. from home. Masks are made of what looks like tin foil. Up: Gore was pretty good, I have to give it. But Ittenbach's Burning Moon was better for a budget with a low budget. <br /> <br /> Acting: It was terrible! I did not mind dubbing. I think this is funny as in "Premutos" Ittenbach (great movie). The battle and action sequences were poor. Conclusion: Do not watch Schnaas movies. There are many better directors such as Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with films of the same mountain and theme. Check the Premutos, the House of Blood, the Shram and the necromancy.
