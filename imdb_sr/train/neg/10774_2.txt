What kind of stinkeroo turned out !!! At one time, much earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - without great trembling as actresses, but very beautiful and pleasant (especially in films such as "Mark Zorro" and "Blood and Sand"), but When I saw this monstrosity, memories of her golden days quickly faded. The story is incredible and farce, an actor's second-class, supportive crowd unbearable. I can not imagine more immature performance than anyone compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Grai had to be the luckiest leading man they could choose. In addition, there was also a terrible photo (and I'm not just thinking about color!) Everyone who joined this, must have shuddered whenever it turned out.
