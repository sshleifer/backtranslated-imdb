Okay, somebody, somewhere, a few years ago, thought that it would be good to make a 3D IMAKS movie about some flies that bend to Apollo 11 and go to the Moon. So it was. Somebody, somewhere, was an idiot. I want to give artistic requisites to do homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell, rockets and launcher hardware were pounding. The graphics were generally pretty good - the launch of the rocket gave me a fever, as the good launch of the rocket always works (my crown is still working hard), and 3D was quite efficient. CG was not a Picard quality, but it's generally good. The flies were somehow centrally anthropomorphic, with some half-shaded characters of the late 60s, inserted in color (hippies fly, African-American flies with giant africas and black shades, etc.), And the worms were more like larvae with human heads The baby (although they made appropriate brutal sounds) The screenwriters certainly did not do homework, relying on offensive and obsolete clich√©s (gender policy of the 60's, including mostly-useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil Rousse, fat flies that just want to eat , degree of brutal level two degrees In the film that was intended for IMAKS, they set a great opportunity to sneak into some educational content about physics and space travel - they did not get their real physics (zero in the Lunar Module during landing? PLEASE). and tries to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts, all of them in the public domain; instead, they have written their dialogue, which sounds like shit. But we loved worms. So they get a point and a half for rockets and worms. Uh, iai. 1.5 / 5.
