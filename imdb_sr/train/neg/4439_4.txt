Iikes. This is pretty bad. The performance is not great for the beginning, and the decision to transfer it to the film does not favor - especially because Peploe does not decide how he wants to treat the theatrical origin of the material (we get occasional views of the observer audience, etc.) and decided to go along with the nervous style of editing designed to remind you to watch a movie, and in fact just reminds you to watch a very bad film directed by the director who is flooded with her material. The central performance of Mire Sorvino is astonishingly poor: stage and plummy, as if playing a role through Helena Bonham-Carter's Merchant Ivory Opus. Only Fiona Shav brings a note - and maybe her theater pedigre means she is best able to deal with the material - but it's difficult to watch a movie for just one performance, even if this performance is light, true and whole as Shav. Ben Kingsley turns in an average and distant turn, and daughter Diane Rigg, Rachel Stirling, plays his role of support. Unfortunately, none of Bertolucci's spells have failed to get rid of him if this film is proof.
