Never before did I see a Tarzan movie when I saw it on TV and thought I would give it. Unfortunately, I must say that I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight. Not to imagine Tarzan. And, unless I missed him while I made a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional bag. Tarzan, who was rocking through the trees, was also missing - jumping from wine to wine. After all, Jane was there - Monkey Cheet was there. There was some guitar guy there. There were villains and good guys and romance ... everything is very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad, you understand, but also nothing good. Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan: 4/10
