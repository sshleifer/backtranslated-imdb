I read reviews that obviously had to be a student at a very strict British school in the sixties to understand it. Perhaps this is true, if so, then this film is outdated. ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* The end makes sense just like all the children that are anti-government and anti-corporations without any better solution that does not burn society on Mad Mak ashtray type. Yes, the main characters can go, but not. The reasons for doing so are not meaningful. There is not enough character development to explain why. What should mean the shooting of a bunch of innocent people is never explained or even hinted. It is recalled that the war is finally a creative expression, quite possibly the only discovery that all the characters of this film have, and it makes no sense. The characters who go to murder do not fight institutions, they only kill people. I thought they might have used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary in the end, which would have a greater symbolic meaning, but they did not. <br /> <br /> tl; - This film is an adolescent dream about the struggle against authority that tortures them, although in reality it needs. It has no moral, symbolic truth or significance for it; this movie simply shows a fantasy about killing teachers and people in the "power" that annoy you. You are dealing with teachers and institutions that you do not like, then you will like this movie. If you are like me and are working to make life for yourself instead of just blindly (in this film is blindly) rebelling against the "man," this film is malicious and boring. You can also partly say that funding is lacking, and that the story had a touch of attention deficit disorder. All in all, this seems like a very rough draft of what might have been a fine movie, but no effort has been invested in dialogue, character development, or morality, so it's just ... bad done. If ... only ... I can get two hours back.
