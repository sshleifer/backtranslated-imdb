The worst movie on earth. I do not know where to start, but I hope to save another person from punishing this movie. When it comes to acting and lighting, this film is similar to bad porn without sex. Actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and they could not be worse even if they were trying to make a complete mocking of this movie. The film certainly had a record low budget that I'm sure was lost almost exclusively on the cover of the movie. This movie has now become a joke with friends and has become the standard for comparing other garbage films. I would like to point out that no other film starts to compare. I feel personally responsible for suggesting my friend and me to watch this movie, and I am surprised that he still considers me a friend after the pain I experienced. You do not see this movie!
