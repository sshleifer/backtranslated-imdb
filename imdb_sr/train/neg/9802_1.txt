Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Um, when I was a child (about 7-9 years old), I first watched this show. It was disgusting for me. I talked to other kids about it and, of course, to other shows and we know what? It was a measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize someone's stupidity (whether on television or anything else) we said "Uh, just like Pover Rangers" and laughed. Before you visited this site, I could not even imagine MMPR fans. It was so strange that I decided to look at it again and try to figure out why people like it. I did not enjoy watching it. But it occurred to me: maybe I do not have enough imagination? May be. However, this argument is not enough to evaluate it more than one star.
