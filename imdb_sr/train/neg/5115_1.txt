This had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm 64 years old and the football fan. I went out expecting to see a football movie. About 10 minutes, I began to wonder how such a bad movie (especially acting) could enter the theater. About halfway, I whispered to my wife that it was terrible and explained the facts behind the movie. Although I was a little offended (and I see how some might be offended if they were not Christians), when they were preaching in the cinema, it was not such a big deal. It was, however, a major subject subject to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of acting. It's a convenient movie for the church trip, but it's shown in the church hall, not in the theater. Do I go to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I go to the movie? Not. Would you recommend this film? Absolutely no!!!
