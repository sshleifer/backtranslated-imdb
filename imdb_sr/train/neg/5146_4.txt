I longed to see this movie, here in Latinamerica, Japanese or any oriental film does not have distribution in theaters, we can find some of these films in some underground shops, and I just found Avalon, I was expecting good, but the only good thing in this The film is the first scene, the rest of the film is boring and meaningless, just stupid, with lots of useless scenes and a boring story. I'm wasting my time even when I'm writing about this movie. Sorry, but it's true.
