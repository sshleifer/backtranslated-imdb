*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOJLERI *** Juggernaut is a British "thriller" published in the United States by First National. Karlof is Dr. Sartorius who has to leave his research because his resources have dried up. Karlof is forced to retire to France and begin his medical practice. It is suggested by a subverted woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. She knows Karloff needs money. Karlof agrees with the proposal and soon becomes a personal doctor's husband. Throughout this time, her husband was lurking around the city with a local playboy. Karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he starts. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and finds out that the will has changed. When the pea bursts, she cries and even bites her son's hand. Meanwhile, Karloff's sister lost hippo Carloff who had once killed an old man. When Karloff finds out that he does not get the money, he asks a woman to poison her son. Sister doubts on Karloff and finds out a missing hypo. The analysis shows the poison, but not exactly at the time when Karloff takes away the nurse. To shorten the story, the sister runs away, gets the police and manages to save her son who will be stabbed. would Karloff. Carlof is injected and dies instead. This movie has some good side. Karlof is obsessed with playing a crazy doctor who worked in the devil's command and the man who was living again. Strange, however, is to see him walking stiffly and gently worn. We never find out why he is walking this way. I suppose the director thought it made him more malicious. An actress who plays a woman who is absent twice, turns into something terrible. She has a French accent. Although she reacts badly, she still hates her (or maybe you hate her acting ...). A little below the average for Carloff's vehicle. If you buy a copy of Sinister Cinema VHS, the sound is a bit tense.
