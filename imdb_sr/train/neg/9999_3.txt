This is a movie that constantly watches my enemies, but that's not true. I just look at it sometimes to make sure it's as bad as I thought. Some kind of mobster is snatched by the Boeing 747. (That's, at least, the improvement in relation to Boeing's is a good part of the Pentagon.) The plane descends into the Bermuda Triangle and sinking under pressure, on some kind of post-facto submarine . , stars that fall or barely above the horizon. "We are alone!" says pilot Jack Lemon. That's right. Except George Kennedy. He's in all of these disaster films. Watch the other movie. Oh, not the "Airport" original. It's not good either. Instead, watch a decent movie about stuck airplanes, such as Flight Phoenix.
