The Germans think that the smile is ridiculous (just as Americans think that murmuring is sexy and that women with English accents work). I had to go over my eyes every time the screen again filled up with a huge big smiling face. One of those hostess hacks corporate stories about the mainframe, where she deceived the bank by touching a few random keys on a home computer that was connected only to a socket. The director obviously likes a pretty big lady. I can not say that I share his feelings. It's pretty funny when the whole family sits in front of the television and unconditionally sings with commercials. Obviously, this revision should be one line longer, so it's here.
