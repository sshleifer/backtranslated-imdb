My comments can be a bit spoiler, for what it is worth. Stop now if you care .... Saving Grace should be titled "Paper-thin excuse for old British women to be high on the screen." This movie is stupid. Random music is an obstacle as well as obvious, hacked melodies that appear sporadically to comment on the narration ("The Spirit in Heaven", for example - Oh, I see!) This is essentially a Cheech and Chong movie that has been made credible by its dense English setting and Brenda Blethin's powerful power to put emotions into the audience using her voice. I could literally hear people from the High Times magazine receiving their joy because of the huge "buds" that hinder this picture. The worst scene? Easy. Brenda is trying to sell her unauthorized products on London Street in a luminous white dress. Not funny. It's not original. It's not interesting. It's not a good movie. Rating 7.2 is the result of fanatics. Do not waste your time ...
