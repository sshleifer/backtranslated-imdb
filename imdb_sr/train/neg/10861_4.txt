Maybe I miss something because I read more positive things about a man who deceived himself than I read bad reviews - and I just do not understand. I like that my noirs have a little style for them with characters who speak, watch, and act like Humphrei Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tiernei in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have this style or presence or whatever you want. Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb. His rumpled, roul-out-of-bed look is as far from the summer, smooth-talking noir archetype as you will find. Or, take Jane Viatt as femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of abuse I've seen for a while. Simply not convincing in the role. As for the plot, it's tiring and lacks a real surprise or something new for this genre. I could have predicted the outcome of a man who deceived himself after five minutes. And this final scene of search for a cat and a mouse is plain old dull. Ten to fifteen minutes of something that really happened destroyed any pace of the film.
