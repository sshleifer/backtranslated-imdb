My friends and I left after 15 minutes, and we were not the first. After that we tried to return the money. The management of the film theater would not allow this, but they agreed to see another film. The only way he helped us was to see Dickie Roberts: the former Child Star. As you can say, this was not an unforgettable night. Probably one of my worst film nights. It must be a close second when I saw the double header of the Home Harassment and Heist. In conclusion, for the benefit of mankind, please, you do not see the Order.
