In 1987 John Hughes wrote and directed 'Airplanes, Trains and Cars', which was a funny and touching comedy? the best he ever did. Ten years later, in this second sequel, which is not related to other films, it again recycled the Home Alone plot, but it is not equally inspired and sadistic. Four thieves? That's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for bringing this revolutionary change into a series! ?? Electric shots with metal chairs, wrapped in barbells and blinded with color, ha ha ha haaaaaaa ha, while the new child is even less charming than Culkin. You would think that leaving almost all the key players in the first two films would prevent Hughes from fossilizing the same old routines, but the only surprise is that he did not even appear for Home Alone 4.
