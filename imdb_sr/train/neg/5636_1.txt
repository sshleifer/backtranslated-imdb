This film was the worst I've ever seen. It seems that there is no plot, but the time when you realize this is far beyond the beginning of the movie, so you have to watch the closing for a long time to recognize the total incompetence of the director, the so-called. lazy who plays a tampon chick in the film, and we do not believe Villem Duffo in this movie, he's a clone, because Dafoe says, as we know from the "apocalypse now" and "saint of grace," they would never disagree with such a scenario. Ghost, (Yes) the enemy wrote this account along with his twenty years minus the baby. This film begins with the films of two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then two screenwriters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then Colagrande's director. Bottomline (story); The widow meets a guy, a widow, a widow, a widow breaks the windshield with the guy who hit her. Address in Holland; A black widow (a different title, the same shit). Do not watch this movie !!! It's a total waist of time !!!
