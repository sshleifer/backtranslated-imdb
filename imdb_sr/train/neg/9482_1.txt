Do not even waste your time, let alone pay for this piece of shit! How it's done is beyond me. (I do not know why there are a minimum of 10 rows ... I already summarized this film, but, oh, well ...) The act was terrible, as if they needed all the lessons. The action was bad, the end ... Feh! I think cinema was the only thing that did not totally suck ... well, maybe the sound was minimalist OK. The only good thing is that, if they could make this movie, even make some money with it, there may be a hope for any scriptwriter who has a real idea. So, you are all angry! The same goes for actors ... if these people are really paid, then you too!
