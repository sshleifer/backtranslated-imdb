I do not like this movie, but then I did not even think of a book that, although many were praised as a "masterpiece", thought that the character's development was lacking and that it was inseparable and illogical in complication, although it was far more readable than Fante's terrible first attempt "The Road to Los Angeles" that was not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid-'80s. I was intrigued to see what Tova made with such scarce ingredients. He worked hard on scripts to fix many book shortcomings, but he did not save it for my money. There has never been a movie in Ask the Dust as he has ever tried to remain a faithful book. I consider this film Tova's craziness. In one word: forgetful.
