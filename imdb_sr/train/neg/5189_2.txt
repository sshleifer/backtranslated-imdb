This series would be much better if they just made one simple thing: They made Ian McShane the code name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. The diamond head character needs a person who could stand the role of a lovely rogue, which McShane proved to be able to work with the Lovejoi series. Roi Thinnes, the real diamond head, is really just so in that role. McShane is not as good as Tree. The character of France Nuien, Tso-Tsing, seems to be unable to decide whether it is an unfortunate victim or a woman who is ready to fight. She really earned her salary at the end when she had to play the role of a lover of the Diamond Head. After I looked at an episode or two, I ended up not worrying about what happened to anyone. The tree gives us a lot to hate, but Diamond Head does not like us. Unfortunately, the spy genre of the seventies was not exactly what it was like in the sixties.
