I have to say that this was the worst priiadarshana film (release with a much better coyote, which was its directorial endeavor), it does not contain a specific story and only focuses on showing the body to the debut actresses and some stupid comedies. I think that Priiadarshan has become too repetitive in his comedy flicks just as the govinda and David dhavan did in the past after giving some good entertainers who also lost their audience. So it will be good for him to concentrate more on the script and try some variations in his direction. Give us more heraphic and malamal weeks, and do not give to dudes like garam masala!
