So I'm looking for a DVD and I'm coming to this film called 'End Game'. She plays James Woods and Juba Cube Gooding and has a synopsis of a learned political thriller. Then it's worth a look. Or I thought so. Boy, am I wrong? The end of the game has only the funniest complication that I have ever had dissatisfaction over the longevity. Since I am now something of something, I can not get rid of it, as I would like, without destroying it for those who have not yet experienced this monstrosity. But questions like "Why did he / she / did they do it?", And "Where did the country get the funds to do this?" all are too abundant after the unexpectedly hilarious conclusion of the film. As for the acting - you know those movies in which you can almost feel that the actor has realized that they have made a terrible mistake when signing a movie contract, and then it shows in their performance? This is one of them. Follow this with a funny letter and seriously wrong, irritating direction and you have a recipe for a movie poison. Of course, this was not in the cinema, and for the same reason you should not allow this into your living room; It's horrible.
