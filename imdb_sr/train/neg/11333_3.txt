This movie is just bullshit. Although the directors claim they are part of that culture, it is still very, very poorly directed debut. The topic itself is very interesting and I accept bad behavior due to the fact that they are all amateurs and have never worked before, but the worst thing in this film are dialogues and very inexperienced and naive directing. There is no time in that movie. I felt as if the directors were so excited to do this film (that's their first characteristic), that they never actually wondered what kind of story they wanted to tell. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he is a nice and thoughtful guy, but that does not make him a director. I think that the "American History of KS" is full of clich√©s, but somehow it succeeds in conveying the story. "Oi! Warning" is a lot of cliches, does not say anything new or provocative, and (which is a sad thing about this movie) is far from any Oi! -Realitia. If you want to see strange, but great German films, watch the films of Michael Haneke, Christophe Schlingensief, Oscar Roehler, Hans Veingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: Benny's video Funny Games Die Unberuhrbare Mein Letzter. *** Of ten, due to themes and photographs
