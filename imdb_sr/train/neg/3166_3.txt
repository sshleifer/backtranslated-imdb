I admit I have a rather uneasy feeling about ghost films, and while I sometimes enjoy a genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedy, they really have to be crazy to be ridiculous. It seems that 'Over Her Dead Bodi' takes life after death a bit too seriously, and in my opinion it does not succeed in any way to think. The story, of course, is quite incredible and she did not manage to convince me in the comic or the sentimental register. The choice of the main actresses was terrible. Although Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a good guy, the taste for ladies of his character seems to have to be seriously improved because Eva Longoria is too old for him (I'm sorry) and Lake Bell looks too unattractive (sorry). A romantic story without good reason for romance is due to the failure of the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsay Sloane were actually better, but they only had auxiliary roles. The rest is uninteresting and non-violent, with flat cinema and cheap gays borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies. Nothing really worth watching, nothing to remember.
