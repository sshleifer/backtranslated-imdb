I should qualify that title, now that I'm thinking about it. The cashier is not completely worthless. I had the opportunity to see him twice, and the second time I laughed very much at the expense of the film. I guess it's worth it for it. and it's also worth the pain that caused me at my first glance. as another critic pointed out, this film is hacked in every sense of the word. no original thought has entered this film (which makes a comment below about the originality of the premise completely confusing to me). the film is nothing but a long line of clich√©s that are tied together and paraded as a movie. Definitely not the next clerk, definitely not genuine and absolutely not "good, pure fun". the film is an absolute agony for the unknown (after seeing it for the first time, the second time it can be quite ridiculous, in an insulting manner). As I looked around the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, except perhaps the elderly, was completely boring or sick of this movie. during some particularly emotional scenes, such as where Nick runs his mother, the audience is actually shrinking because it is so badly done. I even heard somebody * groans * in the theater, something I had never seen before. I do not care where you have the opportunity to see this movie, either at a film festival, either in an indie theater, or anywhere. Do yourself a favor, skip this movie with revenge. unless you're like me and you just can not resist the opportunity to see what's really the worst movie ever made.
