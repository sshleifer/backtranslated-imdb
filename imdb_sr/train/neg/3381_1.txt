This is perhaps the worst film adaptation of Broadway musical ever. Even music was destroyed. Attenborough does not know anything about the theater - almost every shot and a moment are fake. I will say, however, that it is bad enough to be ridiculous. Hairdressers are incredibly obsolete. I can not understand what is meant by (conceptually) the opening of a movie with the exterior of the theater in which A Chorus Line plays. Do we need to think that these people are auditioning for A Chorus Line, which contains stories about people who are auditioning? Oh no, the show crashes on itself. I saw the original production, and I listened to hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do it?
