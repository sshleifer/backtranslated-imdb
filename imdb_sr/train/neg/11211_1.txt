There are so many things that are wrong with this film, but to sum it up: It's terrible - so bad it must be deliberate. a bad scenario - they may have had some good ideas, but that was not the best way to present the story. funny bad ending - in some cases the ending succeeds in saving the movie - not in this case. If you manage to sit through the whole movie, you will want to hit the end because the ending is not worth the wait. This is the worst movie I've seen for a long time. It was a complete torture that went through this movie, I would be grateful if someone warned me in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing better. Even then you will regret that you have entered into an inexpressible torture.
