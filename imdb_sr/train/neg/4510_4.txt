I love geometry Memoire so I read the book twice; It's one of the best books I read last year. I enjoyed the film and I was afraid that reading the book would destroy the pleasure of watching the movie. I did not expect the film to be so bad. Some of the best parts of the book were omitted from the film, and the characters were weak because Hatsumomo (Li Gong) was the worst. If I did not read the book, this film would be a little confusing and inexplicable. "Nitta Saiuri reveals how she went fishing ..." Did anyone see how or when did Saiuri become Nitta Saiuri? Forget the movie and read the book.
