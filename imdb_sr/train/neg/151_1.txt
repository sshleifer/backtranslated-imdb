This is really terrible. The only feature that reveals this movie is that next time people ask me what's the worst vampire movie I've ever seen, I would have the right answer. I think it was shot at 35 mm so it's already resembling hell. I would not try to comment, but I noticed that some fans (probably related to the movie) claimed that this is the best Matrix movie. Let me untie myths and lies. There is nothing good in the movie. Everything yells sticky. The actress is ugly. The choreography of the fight is the worst I've ever seen. Scene of fighting are incredibly amateurish. Imagine a girl who helplessly floats around the circle and delivers weak blows that would not hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director simply pulled people out of the street to give them roles in the film. Unforgivable.
