Many other reviewers here, including many whose opinions I respect, hold this part of the European terrible horror in a high regard. Personally I did not like it. This is an unconvincing attempt at the atmospheric period between sex and violence. Jess Franco makes these films very good at their best. Unfortunately, the notorious film director Joe D'Amato does not do this. D'Amato's most famous films are known for their large quotient. This, his early film, has no permanent disgusting scenes with his notorious "Anthropophagous" and "Beiond the Darkness". After all, it's a coherent movie that fails to involve the viewer in any way. Without a factor of sleeplessness, it becomes very boring. As I said, others enjoyed this movie, but I found it to be a perfect example of an incredible lazy writing. Eva Aulin (from "Candi") is in her, and looks pretty hot and often naked. However, the cult film icon Klaus Kinski is completely lost in the sub-cluster without any connection to the main film. He seems to have bored his role and has no manic intensity that works at his best. The music is beautiful and has a few short moments of unintentionally funny sting. Still, this is a pretentious and senseless movie that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)
