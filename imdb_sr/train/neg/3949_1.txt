I got a DVD "Bogeiman" and this stunker was an additional feature. I assumed it was "Boogeiman II" because it was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who "presume": it does "ass" from "u-" and "me". I read before watching that BII contains a lot of original pictures and act as an actress Love. As I watched the "Boogie Return," I decided to go through the original footage to see the infamous scene of death from a toothbrush. Before I knew it, the film was over. Rip off. I think I thought this was BII, because this has a similar name for one of the alternative titles BII. Well, at least this was just an additional feature, was not it? Allow me to stop talking about my mistake and start talking about movie mistakes. Many, many, mistakes. Who does this guy, Ullley, think he is? Does he really think that the same movie will be sold in different forms? There is nothing original that holds the third part. It is basically a flashback from the original through the eyes of the psychic, which gives us a boring play on the game while everything is happening. It's a movie. Oh, and one death-per-stereo scene, but you can read it from someone's review. My interest in "Boogeiman II" is lost forever. Final Note: This is not a series of watching movies.
