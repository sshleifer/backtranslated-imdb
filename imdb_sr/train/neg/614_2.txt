I'm just watching this on the Sci-Fi channel. It's so terrible that I can not stop watching it! I'm a filmmaker and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone connected with this movie. Some of the cameras are good. Most are very questionable. There are several competent actors in the film. It's a shame that they are surrounded by what was certainly the cousin of the director. It's the only way they could be qualified to be in the movie! Music was a bit better than acting. If you turn to watch this, I hope it was because there was no other option! The continuation (to continue) is now .... I think I will skip it! Jason
