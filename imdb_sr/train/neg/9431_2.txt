The premier of the movie, 3 young ladies destroy their car and end up with a terrible family. IAVN. Watching 36 minutes of Owl's car ride with a white sedan instead of a bronze. An old lady with a warm and cold dementia that controls her daughter ... IAVN 23 minutes of watching actors eating - IAVN Trying to identify what fucking they are eating ... OK, maybe it's a game for drinking ... no - IAVN Free scene with shower ... OK got my attention for a few seconds. Fully random and uninspired killings ... IAVN <br /> End ... dude! that psycho is disturbed - why the rest of the film would not be like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately that's it - My advice - fast rewind in the last five minutes and watch it and then put something good in the player - I'm going back to sleep .
