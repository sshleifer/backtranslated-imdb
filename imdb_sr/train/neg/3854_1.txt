Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who, with the guidance of a reputable agent, has many potentials. Obviously, the person who brought her into this travesty is not someone who takes care of her career. I sat in a theater surrounded by teenagers who went to the crowd to find another movie to sneak in and wonder who would think this film would attract everyone. It was badly written, the casting director could only put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously did not care.
