This is an extremely dumb and little-seen film about slavery in West India and he played Puddy from the show "Seinfeld"! Patrick Varburton debuted in this film and is noticeably leaner here. Oliver Reed got a superb fee, but it's hardly in the movie. Varburton plays white goods and it's funny to see all the young and aggressive women of the elderly who are looking for him because everyone wants to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays the owner of the brothel and it's so much nudity in the movie. If they do not have drunken orgies at brothel, then his young women turn around with him. Then, of course, ultimately slaves fight and there is a bloody confrontation. There is no real political message like Burn, but just another arranged plan to start the story. It's incredible that they made a sequel and Varburton and all the other actors are back! I hope they got a lot of money because this first movie is pretty bad. Golgetner keeps an eye on him and Varburton's lack of accent makes it sometimes funny. Very bad movie, but I must admit I want to see a sequel.
