I was so excited to see this movie after I finally read the book this week. My 13-year-old son also enjoyed this. I rented it and screwed it up to enjoy the classic story of life that was revived on the screen. Man, I was disappointed. This film is more away from the book than it can be forgiven. George C. Scott is a great actor, but it seemed to be completely in the image only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time was quite flat. I realized that it was made in '84, before the CG effects, mainly. But that looked like a very good B-movie, especially a meeting with Jacob Marley. The biggest disappointment was that they omitted one of the most diverse parts of the story: When the Spirit Christmas Gift takes Scrooge to a whirlwind tour around the world, watching people in the darkest circumstances that still have light and love for Christmas. I will admit that the g. reformed "the Scrooge in the end. It was a refreshing display. I'd like Bob Cratchit to be portrayed as being bitten and depressed." And Tini Tim ... oh, do not even start playing me bad actors ...
