This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" was easily directed by the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotions, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor ... constantly repeats the same situation. It does not show character development. He does not even show any violent and / or sexual content, and does not add anything new to the sub-genre of the psycho-killer. So poor should be shown at film schools as an example of "what should not be done" in the first movie. there are scenes that are recorded almost identical; There are scenes that have two or more master recordings and it's pretty awesome to see the action jumping from one masters shot to the other for no reason. The camera almost never moves, as if a "very talented artist" was afraid to show his lack of visual skills. Actors who play the leading roles behave like amateurs, and the auxiliary actor is hardly convincing. There are more holes than a plot in the script (if it ever happened) ... Really disturbing movie, and still talented director.
