I do not know what they thought. They, I mean, anyone, even remotely connected with this disaster. I've seen such bad movies, I've seen so bad movies, and there's this. what the script writer has done is to put what might be the most disadvantageous dialogue through a written text on the screen. There is nothing good in this film, either from a technical point of view or from any other point of view. there are several pretty well-known names in this movie. In fact, I reluctant to use the word movie.it is more like a collection of random scenes that have nothing to do with others and make less than 0 sense.anivai, I do not see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this.and got it really cheap , and I've still got ripped of.even if I got this movie for free, I would still be ripped off.this is absolute 0/10
