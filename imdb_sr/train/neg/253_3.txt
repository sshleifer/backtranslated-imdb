The premise of the film is explained, and if you have come this far, you do not have to pretend to be a film critic. With that, my opinion about the movie is quite low. I am a fan of Takashi Miike, but this falls into the category of his not so great work together with DOA 2 and 3, and some other (many). It looks like the movie gets free to go because it's Takashi movie and nothing that Takashi can not be wrong. This is the access to high school cinema. For the rest of us, we will find an hour and a half a kid screaming for no good reason completely embarrassing (and that, it takes away the film), the tempo of the film almost reaches the level of rigorous, and plays ... well ... hmmm. If Takashi competitor you will see him regardless of the peak of your interest. He misses any kind of originality (see endless story) or any development of character from the main character in the conflict, and not quite superficial. As highlighted, this is the first film that Miikeu attributed to co-writing, but this does not mean that what Miike's personality would have transmitted. on the screen. All we get are some of the symbolic Miike shots with the director of photography. The film had the potential to be something great. The premise is not difficult to run wild. But this seemed to be like falling into the ground. My suggestion is that if you just go into Miike you go with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then a film in his works, such as Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Raini Dog, Bird People of China.
