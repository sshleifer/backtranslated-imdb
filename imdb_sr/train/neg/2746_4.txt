I was afraid I would take my nephews into this film, because I did not think it would be good. Children aged 6 and 10 were ready to see her, so I relaxed. I must admit that it was not as bad as I thought, but it's still far from the book. The film seemed to be real understanding and a sense of humor. I discovered that the six-year-old realized what was going on and that he was a solution to the issues that were happening. In the end, I had to explain that movies sometimes do not show the best solutions to problems, because it's more fun to watch what happens if they make "silly" or "stupid" choices.
