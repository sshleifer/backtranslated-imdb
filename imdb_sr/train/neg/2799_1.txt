Whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work at Hollywood at all (even not living there), and they must find another job. The worst hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just kept looking at whether it would be better that, unfortunately for me, it was not. Even in the end, the loans were given. me ankieti. I guess there were not a lot of people behind the movie, so they had to slowly rotate the loans ... very slowly. This film is certainly a great guide "How to not make a movie". Too bad I can not give 0.
