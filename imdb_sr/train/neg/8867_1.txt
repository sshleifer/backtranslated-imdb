This Oscars Petersson film is unique. Its uniqueness does not lie in the story, since many semi-brain Hollywood productions have served us with comparatively miserable complications, but in a thorough way in which complete and complete laziness in one aspect is related to the same disdain in all other aspects. /> Dialogue is worse than unpleasant. The blunt and headless direction is thrown into the mix. Bosanci who speak English with difficult Swedish accents add unintentional element of humor. Uninspired lightning and cameras are frozen Turkish movie cakes. As a kind of surprise for the audience, there are several totally undocumented slow sequences that you least expect. To add insult to injury, the whole thing is cut by someone without any sense of timing. "The bad guy who turns well turns around after hearing a good guy's story" in the church, is the point at which time it is time to forsake Ed Wood from the position of the worst director of all time; Go through Ed Vood - here comes Oscar Petersson!
