I'm sure people who watch this move outside Britian will be fun to watch, but for someone in the UK it's painful in their mistakes. At the very beginning of the film, Elijah Vood gets on the road at the bank's bank, which is destroyed. He tells his sister, who she meets: "What happened here" and she answers: "Oh, Tottenham was in town yesterday!" Tottenham is already in the city ... they are part of the city, they do not have to go there! If fans of Tottenham want to fight other fans, the last place in the world would be done by a banking station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. There are still several mistakes, but the biggest failure for me is the actor who plays hooligans. Apparently he decided that it was not worth trying to speak with an emphasis on East End and instead decided on Dick Van Dike, who made my ears bleed. This was emphasized by the fact that the rest of his gang spoke the way you would expect West Ham fans to speak. This mistake made it incredible in the role and really spoiled the film.
