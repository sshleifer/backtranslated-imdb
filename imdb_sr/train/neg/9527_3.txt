I'm trying to find this movie just by playing bad phrases about "teenagers who seduce and kill a man in their house" and the like. I think I saw the parts of this film for the first time when I was about 10 years old when I worked on the cable. He made an impressive impression! It's a movie that kids know they should not watch, and switch channels when their parents enter. . Then again, if you like to see men who cheat on their wives, then this is an interesting movie. Also, if I remember, there are some rather interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the stupid end of all time, but still ... unforgettable.
