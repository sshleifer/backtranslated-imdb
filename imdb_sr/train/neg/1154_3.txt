Mai (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) pay an apparently rare visit to their son Bobbie (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even when the visit begins, Toots suffers from a fatal heart attack, leaving the Mai abandoned, unsure, and questioning her life and future. Finding yourself attracted to the daughter of your daughter Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions have resulted in inevitable consequences. Beautifully captured, but because of her announced realism and praise, Mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant, rejecting signs and asking the observer to get involved in them. Reid shines like Mai, and her skill and dedication as a wonderfully underrated actor who rescues the film from a completely depressing mud, but Michell and Kureishi allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathrin Bradshaw to create such extremely unpleasant characters, to become more and more difficult to worry about what Happens with May. As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are actually so selfish and cold-blooded to start wondering what Kureishi actually was trying to say. As said, they either are not willing or unable to raise Bobby and Paul above the two-dimensional in their terrible selfishness. It's worth seeing Reid's performance, but a bit more. Shame ...
