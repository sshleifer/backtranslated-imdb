This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that she was so bad she looked comic. First, there is no complication. Actors seem to read maps and do the dumbest things. Like being persecuted by dead people, but still wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also, the zombies were terrible, not where they were fun as any of Romer's works, who joined the film. And the stupidest part of it was that they showed flash video games in action sequences. It's like we're not getting a video game about shooting zombies. Also, all 20 know how to use automatic weapons and hit the target without targeting a gun. And the way people die is so stupid. As if they were running out of ammunition, standing and waiting to jump in. And when they stood in the corner in front of the house, they ran out of ammunition, instead of firing at the door so stupid. with another chance. Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen for years. The B-film about cinema is better.
