Pokemon movie was a horrible movie. Unlike the first, it's not a good movie at all. the graphics were decent, but the story was straight and did not create a real drama. in the first interaction between the characters was decent. taking a brooch and adding tracei was bad. Tracei does not really have much to say or do, and unlike Brock does not offer comic relief. the only good point is to see how the fog actually becomes jelous over the ashes, and its early thinking about calling his girlfriend was fun. In general, this movie is not worth renting, and the short film did nothing for me or my wife. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans.oh well, maybe the next will be better.cant get a lot worse
