Totally average even by the standards of the monogram, this mystery (the remake of the Sphinx) has an unusual plot that has not been exposed to a great extent - you will see it after about ten minutes. Twice at first they had some nice dialogue, but John Hamilton was hopelessly boring as a villain (perfectly played by Lionel Atvill), and Varren Himer is quite boring. However, it is worthwhile to pass through the five-minute performance of the incomparable Mantana Moreland as Nicodemus Domara, who gets a better defense counsel for the joyful appearance of the courtroom. You must give it to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; he was not a lot of directors, but he would always break through a routine programmer with some stupid stance.
