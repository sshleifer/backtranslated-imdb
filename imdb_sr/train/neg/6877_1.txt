I wanted to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and in the end I watched one about Nuioricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I do not see 50% living in poverty. When I see people who are tortured, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans or Cubans who have recently arrived on the island. There is no such thing as spanglish ... or you speak Spanish, or not .... and from what I heard ... you do not know. Pedro Albizo Campos is NOT MLK to me. MLK was a big man. Campos is a great man for those who want independence, which is 1%. For the rest, he is like a loco like Osama bin Laden. Puertorians who want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want any kind of proof to all of you dreaming of an independent Puerto Rico, look at Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all of South and Central America and Mexico. Miracles were done for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about Nuioricans and their struggles. For a person who complained that not enough Africa was on the show ... it should have been about Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will do it for you shortly. In conclusion ... to all those ignorant whites who think that we need green cards to come to the United States and want to learn how the Prime Minister runs things, this is not a good documentary about Puertorian culture. Tell your children to pay attention to the lessons of geography and history. *** Update *** Bocabonite ... "doc." It was about Nuioricans. She was promoted as if we were all feeling. It should have been titled "and soi nuiorican ... lunche ... can not speak Spanish." PLEASE CONTINUE TO PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORIK, OR NEITHER OTHER RELATED TO THE NUCLEAR HISTORICAL LECTURE. God forbid to play this on the island.
