I never knew that this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy, hidden deep in my dusty wardrobe. In the title on the box, "Insect" is written, and the illustrations on the back clearly show that this is another insignificant and badly produced horror film from the 80's. Surely, they can be fun, of course, until we expect an intelligent script and until you're irritated if you see a huge amount of syrup makeup effects. Almost every important aspect that makes a horror movie worth watching is below the standard in "Blue Monkeys"! The action is ridiculous and very unoriginal, acting performances are painful to observe and there is a complete lack of uncertainty. Following the trend of popular "big bug" films, "Blue Monkey" deals with a new and unknown type of insect that deletes doctors and patients in a remote hospital. Manufacturers can no longer avoid the real origin of this gigantic oversized cover! All we know is that it is not out of the universe and that it originally came out of a tropical plant. In addition, there is absolutely no explanation of where this new insect comes from! As I said, do not be hoping for an intelligent scenario. The first half of the movie is fun enough, with some nice stitches and the introduction of several disturbed characters (80-year-old blind and alcoholic!), But the other half (when the entire hospital is quarantined) is terribly bored. It's also close to the end that the "Blue Monkey" begins to rip out older (and better) films. As they approach the peak, they have obviously been left without a budget, because the lighting becomes very poor and the type in the suit is no longer camouflaged. The "Blue Monkey" is worth sticking out in case you are bored or if you really want to see every hilarious movie of the 80's ever made. The fans of the B-cinema can recognize John Vernon ("Kill Clowns from the Universe", "Curtains") in the little and senseless role of Roger, who is in charge of the clinic.
