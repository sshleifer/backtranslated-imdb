My seven-year-old daughter adored her, while Disnei's bosses grossly calculated that she would do it. That's a problem with Air Buddies. It's a strictly children's movie full of numbers full of carefully calculated kindness, a couple of politically correct morals and insufferable humor to avoid the scary G score. As a parent, or even as a 10-year-old, you've already seen it before. Think "101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone" and get a general idea. I think that a good child's story is a good story, a period. "Air Friends", which are original as recycled paper, do not meet this standard. It's not the worst video your child can watch, but there are megatones better.
