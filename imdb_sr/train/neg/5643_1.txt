I have 2 home entertainment stores and I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this one was so bad that he forced me to register here and comment on it. How bad was it? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola earned an Oscar for her performance in Kum III in relation to Giada Colagrande in this film. Her lover just died a month before coming to the 'Rubber House' she gave her. Once she finds out that she has cheated her during her relationship, but it seems that none of them registers with her. Within a day, she begins a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe) the guardian of the house. Although she was married to Dafoe on the screen, her scenes with him were cold and irresistible. If it was complicated, I missed it. Even Villem Dafoe could not preserve this film from an amateur, cinematic accident of a train that is.
