Cheesi, fantastically horrible (and NOT in a fun way) C Grade film. Everything shouts "amateur", from a modest scenario (bizarre room, limited coherence and predictable ending; tense lighting, sound and a handy camouflaged corner of the camera, sexual corn and passive sex and references; messy and incredible dialogue in Z I saw it on DVD and I kept hoping Edward Vood would go out, everything is forgiven - your worst movies are artwork, and more coherent than this twelfth meter. But still, better than "Every night in my dreams I hear you "- are you sure the Titanic team was not involved in this?
