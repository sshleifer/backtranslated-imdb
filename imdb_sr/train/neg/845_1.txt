It's a shame that you can not vote from zero stars on IMDb because I would not hesitate! In fact, I would go so far as to say that this film was in negative stars. I, like many others, bought this movie thinking that because there is Michael Madsen in it, it could be good ... No way! This film was shocking! Imagine the feature film 'Brave and Pretty', so Primal Instinct did not come close to that good, and I thought it would be nothing worse than the movie 'Brave and Pretty'. Michael Madsen, how could you do that to us? The worst thing is that I did not move a little forward, I hoped that eventually they would discover that it was all kind of a sick joke, they thought it would be funny for us to watch such a terribly bad movie. Where can I start ...? Director - Zero Stars, Screenplay - Zero Stars, Gluma - Zero Stars, Cinema - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Make-up - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Assembly - Zero Stars, Trailer - Half Star, Graphic Design - Half Star, DVD Menu - Half Star. However, I think it's very important to see bad movies just to know what a really bad movie is, so for this reason I'm happy to see this movie, just to have a bad movie that I'd put on at the bottom of the list.
