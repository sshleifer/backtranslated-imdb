Wow ... without a speech to film this movie, I can not say much. The cover on the local video player should say everything ... nothing but six actors / actors who are losing on Scream set and decide to shoot a movie! The act obviously was not a budget, but they were able to afford nudity and handsome actors! The styling of the essence almost has its own stamp here, except that most of these failing performances in the classroom continues to forget that there is a plot to go somewhere when reading this script. After only 4 or 5 murders by a so-called masked killer and a confusing story of a murderous club, for which the stupid actress thinks it's the right club to join (only if it can cross the girl who hits her car), you want to you stab your hands with the closest sharp object to remind you that you will never be too excited about a possible good movie like this one. I feel bad for people who bought this movie and can not find anyone to take it away. Another example of what's wrong with the growing number of direct video clips without any thoughts. Drop it if you buy this.
