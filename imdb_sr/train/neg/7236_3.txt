Let's see ... I'm trying to practice finding a positive one in everything, so what kind of things can I say about a carrier? I know! The performances were - no, this will not work because they managed to exhaust all of Gvineth Paltrow's personality, usually so lively, and ended up creating cartoons from Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... Oh - how is it? with the story - no. It will not even fly because it caused doses. What was the genre at all? It was not funny, which turns off the comedy. It was not interesting enough to be dramatic. Was it a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, because I can not be sure - let's call it "losers in a similar way." I'm sure those who stood behind this movie started with a vision, I think, they had to have one to send in the suit to the studio, but I need help finding it. Even if I am a patient person who could forgive the pure nonsense of the story, I could not with good conscience recommend a movie that allows a guy to engage in a professional conversation for a job in the wind and messy, feverish, stupid who are you. Talking about the hair - do we entertain the intentional black roots and platinum locks worn by Hershei? What do I do? I've already lost 97 irreparable minutes in the movie itself - I can no longer devote to this loser.
