What a horrible movie. It starts well, with the order of the title, but it's just as good as it gets. The film is something about rats that turn into monsters and go away. on murder. The acting is not so bad, but the script is pointless and the film is not scared in spite of atmospheric music. It's really amazing that some group gathered this garbage bag and thought it would be a good movie. It's not a good movie. It's garbage and I invite you not to lose even a minute of your life on it! One of ten.
