I felt that this film started well. The acting was noticeable and I felt the situation with all the characters, although the real family unit was not completely discovered. We never got enough information about our father to really feel his pain because of his whole engagement or construction for his animosity with Tobe. I think that in one scene you see how admiring her for her tension, and on the second scene, she just takes her head off. Another problem with the film was to just uncover and lose focus to the end, and I begged it to finish. Any movie with such a long and painful ending should never get an automatic score of 7 or more just for the acting. We are looking at the increasing quality of the film experience. In the case of this film, the end is so bad that I seriously thought about leaving the theater. This film pulled me out and then spit on me.
