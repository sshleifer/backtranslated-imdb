In many of the films I saw by Warren Oates, I came to a certain conclusion, there is one talented individual here. The first time I saw Mr. Oates in a television series from the 1960s called Stone Burke. Since then, I have been following his career carefully and I have been determined to play great roles. It happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him the highest prize in a movie titled, "Bring me the head of Alfred Garcia." Of course, his greatest claim of fame was his magnificent role in The Vild Bunch. I always thought he was able to bring some character to a certain magic, until I saw him on this flop. The film is called "Chandler", a celebration of the 1950s detectives. Created by Raimond Chandler. Because the synopsis said it was a difficult nose for the Private Eye, I was immediately interested. However, I sat patiently throughout the movie and found it to be boring, uninteresting, slow pace, entangled, confusing saga which, if it had a theme or plot, had to be left in some dark room. Together with some of Hollywood's best support stars, such as Alec Dreier, Mitch Rian, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGrav, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this film had enough strength to reach Mach 5, however, it failed on the launch the substrate did not go where. As a result, one of my favorite actors stumbled into a badly built vehicle that never got off the ground. **
