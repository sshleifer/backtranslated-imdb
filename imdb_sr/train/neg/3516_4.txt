There is no doubt about who is in charge of cadet training in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien is a game of officers who adhere to military discipline in creating a new kind of soldiers from their cadets - bombers. But he is not so cruel that he is not unfair or hostile. In fact, he even changes his mind about the value of women working in the army. He is tough when he has to be, but on other occasions he is a clear mix of coaches and pastors, a role he has mastered in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything is turning. O'Brien looks natural in that role and plays fine. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and spectacular completion of special effects.
