They should have called this movie ... Blue women who had to both their roots. And the main character, geezers, dry sweaters. The giggling. I thought that guy did a good job. I hope we find a good 8-star Christmas movie to watch this week. Throwing the arrow. And I had to laugh about it. We still have 3 more on the DVR to watch, we might be lucky. Oh yes, I pretty quickly figured out the guy and tied it up when he picked up the flowers, and then drove off with his cousin. I told my daughters that they were on their way to the cemetery. And how stupid the two women were accompanying them and spying on them? Creepi.
