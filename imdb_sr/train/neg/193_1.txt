Norman Maclean's story is a mastermind; Redford's film is a focal point. He adds the banal scenes of the Maclean Brothers to overturns and doubles dating in a bar that is not even hinted at in the story. The code, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, an open genius, is proving to be either dangerous or depressing, depending on what your original story meant. Some of the flying scenes are nice. Also, Tom Skerritt as a father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men once expected. None of the women gives the impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean liked the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.
