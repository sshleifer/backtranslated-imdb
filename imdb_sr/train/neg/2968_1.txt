Ignoring (if possible) boring free smoking of marijuana (which appears to be mandatory in Australian-funded films), the actors of this film give a reasonably credible play. It is far. The rest is simply terrible. The action is overloaded with "wow" symbolism, which should look good on the film, but it does not go anywhere. A sharp example is a giant peach buoy, apparently left out of the city parade and donated by a local canning factory. It was too tempting to spend what I hope was free, but still insignificant! Peaches are given a superficial, unexplained flushing at one stage, but there ends. Similarly, the "black dot" sign on which Steph's parents were killed aims to symbolize possibly escaping from her past, but to escape into what? She had a pretty good deal where she was, especially given her visual inability and infinite, patient patience and care of her young female guardian's understanding. Characterization of Alan. Alan is successfully aiming for the noble role of a union trade union administrator, but "rats" on his colleagues, becoming the supervisor of a wicked multinational - shuffling! hiss! As a supervisor, Alan performs a nasty dirty job of the boss. He conducts surpluses up to, surprise, surprise, the whole plant is closed and Alan is left as a pathetic, unemployed failure. There is no zone without clich√©s here, mate! Not only that, but Alan loses seductive Steph from the most unusual relationships you encounter. If you think the action is melodramatic and didactic, do not ask about the details. What is the importance of shaving cream on Steph's seductive leg? Why the hotel, where a couple leads love, eventually borders with someone getting illegally entering one of their most beautiful bedrooms, and among other pandemoniums, the sheets are regularly dirty - quite spectacularly on one occasion. Summing this movie in one word: Avoid, Avoid, Avoid.
