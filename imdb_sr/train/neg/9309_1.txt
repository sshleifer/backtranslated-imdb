Hey everybody ... For this movie there's really not much to say. The basic complication is that the guy (Brandon) takes several friends to the road in his cabin in the forest for a weekend break away from work. When picking up a girl on the way there, things start to get bad for all of them. The story itself (written by an actor who plays Brandon, I believe, although I could be wrong here) is unlikely and unpredictable, and accordingly it is implemented. The "killer clown" himself is a pretty sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being dark, mysterious but, above all, intelligent predator, we are instead offered rather clumsy, a singer who sings a rhyme that seems to be going through a small crisis of middle life. The only thing that justified the writing of this comment was the scene of sex and everything that was in the movie (the quality of the film led me to extract something from such things). In short, this film falls below every possible standard. However, while I was watching this, I shared a few beers with a close friend, so we managed to get some relative entertainment values ​​from this film and it's therefore fair to note that S.I.C.K fell on only two ratings. However, in reality (and with a good overview), the rating of a star is more than a legitimate rating for this film. 1 of ten stars.
