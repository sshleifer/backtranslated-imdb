Hello people, Well, this movie is really shit. Think about "Love in the Act". Nothing fits in perfectly fine, nothing is coherent and certainly nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this movie. It is total failure. As already mentioned, there are three points in relation to this corrupted film potential. just to see Little Hevitt wearing a fitting fit. To tell you, guys ... there are some promising scenes ... but it's really a bad candy eye. "Possibilities" are diluted here. Nevertheless, I watched the whole thing in temptation of the next scene from you to know what ..... admiration! B) The end is romantic and positive. This is the opposite, and "above the top" is relevant ... but for me it was still a positive attitude. C) Dougrai Scott plays a nice guy ........ REFRESHING! THANK YOU! 2/5 is not worth your 10 or more dollars. 2/3 times through, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hevitt became the next legend of the softcore. Although I will take it for now ... ... it largely depends on her next film. Oh, and her sister is stupid. Her husband is so stupid ... and what is it, stupid. Next time. I can not wait for the next Love Actually with JLH!
