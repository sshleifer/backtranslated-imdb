I went to see this film in the hope of seeing some of Jet Li's flashes that lethal Veapon surprise us. Unfortunately, too much of his acrobatics are so obviously fake that he even took that pleasure from it. Flying shots would be much more impressive if you did not see the wires held in the air while flying through the air for 4 seconds and 9 strokes. Too crafty and very disappointing.
