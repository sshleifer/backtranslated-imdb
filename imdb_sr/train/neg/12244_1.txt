This movie is horrible. CGI is a very cheap CGI for gray stains. Crocodile looks like a big gray stain. The worst is that no effort is made at all to walk or to appear to be alive. It's mostly CGI, which is placed in the scene, and you almost expect to see a hand that moves the CGI stain through the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies from the Sci-Fi channel. Apart from the terrible lack of special effects, the movie consists of typical low-cost actors who probably work as waiters / waiters in local restaurants while waiting for their big breaks. Perhaps the funniest scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys tries to sexually attack Kate and the giant crocodile jumping straight from the water to the second floor of the General Staff of Zlikovac and through the balcony and pull the bad guy Kate and instead to crash straight through the building (and crushes Kate ), Krok only flies backwards at the same angle in the water. The laws of physics can not be applied to this film or special effects. At least there is an honor among the crocodiles.
