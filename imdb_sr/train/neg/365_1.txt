Poor story, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic direction, annoying soundtrack of pornographic groove that is continually taking place through overacted scripts, and shit copies of VHS can not be used by drinking alcohol. Believe me, because I put this party in the end. It was so pathetic that I had to understand that it was the fourth speed of spring for Hitler. The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only weak spark of interest, and that was just because she could sing better than the original. If you want to watch something similar, but a thousand times better, then watch Beiond The Vallei of the Dolls.
