... for this film defines a new series in Bollivood and set a standard according to which all c ** p must now be compared. First of all, the beginning had elements of style ... .and if it worked well, it could become a cult classic, a-la pulpa fiction or Desi desperado ... but the plot (was it one ?) begins to mend and at one point it completely loses. Throw in a disturbed don with an obsession for English, a smartphone call center, a femme fa talle that can bring bikinis and sarees with the same confidence, levitating, gravitatively defiant hit man, and a hundred or even hundred policeman, commando black cats on their trail .... good ingredients in competent hands. But here I want to ask the director: Sir, what did you smoke? I'm sure this film will be remembered in the movies of Bollywood films - for what should never be done - offended by the intelligence of the smartest dead filmmakers. Probably the only feature that can be used in this Desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is music ... watch the video ... hear the gig and you will not be disappointed. Vishal-Shekhar has come up with some very appealing tunes. How would I like the director to spend money on creating another candy for the eyes .... While signing up, I want to really, badly know how Akshai wound from the bullet disappears in the microsecond ... what did your editors do? Tashan, maybe ...
