I read several good reviews that defended and criticized the various aspects of this film. One thing I see over and over is the harassment of Megan, an idealistic political scientist, who is trying to change the world. I loved her character. Perhaps because I'm a 23-year student of political science and I think that I will change the world, so I'll deal with Megan. Besides, it's cute. She is not a super model, but a cute girl from the neighborhood. OK, so it was crying and scratching. It is very dramatic, and it seems excessive, but does it not match its character? She continues this show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove her opinion. She thinks that people who enjoy such a show are sick. I think she made her argument well. Of course, as a young naive girl, she is afraid of what she will face. I think her acting precisely shows a young girl showing moral courage despite her enormous fear. Moreover, I think she has maintained a certain dignity during the film despite the desperate situation she was in. As for film in general, except Megan, there was quite a lot of what I expected. He had great scenic scenes, according to micro-budgetary standards. The plot might have taken a quick thought, almost no contemplation. It's basically just a dark humor without the meaning of a movie movie, which name implies. I love the sadism of a doctor. He constantly removed Megan's shirt, not only because of harassment (though to a great extent), but also because of torture, before he was killed. The chainsaw saw was ridiculous. For lovers of slasher films, he was probably the best character. I give this film 4 out of 10. He had a good environment, almost no plot, and a mixture of good and terrible acting. I would recommend it for cheap excitement, but hardly a diamond is in a rough form that is a micro-budget horror.
