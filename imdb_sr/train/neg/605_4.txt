I will keep this as a movie that does not deserve a full review. Given the setting, this movie could be something really special. It could have been another "28 days later" or even "Blair Vitch Project". For the first 20 minutes of the film, I was very excited, the director worked a decent job with cinema and uncertainty, although I do not think he managed to catch the true ghost of the empty London underworld. The characters were a great downhill. Our "heroin" in this movie is worthless shit, and you really do not care if she dies or not. As many people have said before, I cheered on the homeless and the blacks, who managed to smile or two (intentionally or not). The main criminal, in the first half of the film, is kept in the dark, but when it's discovered, I was really disappointed. I will not spoil it, but only to say that my ten-year-old sister probably could have wrested him in the wrestling. All in all, this is just another central movie horror that falls into the trap of tracking a simple Hollywood formula. This film had a lot of potential, but he really missed it. Just to emphasize how this film was chrome, the characters in this film had at least five times to finish and kill the main bad guy. . INSTEAD THE THE RUN AVAI.
