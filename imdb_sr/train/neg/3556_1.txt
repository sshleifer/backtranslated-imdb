You know that you are in trouble when John Kasavets runs at half the speed instead of full gas in the movie, and "Incubus" is the terrible, worst case of a big actor who goes through demands to pay bills. In fact, watching Hamm's scenario and John Bush's "baroque" artistic direction, it's hard to blame him. The film has something to do with a series of murders in a small town, in which a lot of supernatural hockey was mixed. Somehow, the direction manages to drain the tension and interest from each scene, and Cassavetes looks visibly PO '. periodically. Incubus itself, which does not appear until the last scene, is a well-created creation, but it's not worth the wait. 1/10
