I just can not see how the film Concorde-Nev Horizons directed by Jim Winhorn and acting Andrea Stevens' talent and the puppets could be bad. It just hits the mind, is not it? Well, let's not make a mistake about it. "Munchie's kickback" is a really bad movie. Munchie is a marionette that has been in existence for many centuries. For reasons that are not fully explained to the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help single mother and her son. The mother's problem (at least her main problem) is that she has a balloon on a mortgage for two weeks ... to a not so small amount of $ 20,000. Ouch. She can not make money because she was fired. OK ... JUST is the key word in that sentence. What ...? Did she plan to pay him one salary? Maybe it would be good to spend the past few years saving you for that ... you mean? Munchie has magical powers similar to those that a ghost would have ... but there is not a limit on the number of wishes you can do! Munchie gets a boyfriend of a fancy stuff for one night, but then the kid asks him to send him back to the shopping center from which Munchie "borrowed". An unsettling furball also uses its extraterrestrial skills to help a boy win a baseball game through cheating. Baseball is hit so hard that it circles the Earth several times. Unfortunately, those stupid parents who watch the game do not think it's really weird. Hmm. Anyway, I would like to finish this because this has already exhausted enough of my life as it is. You will really be inspired by a scene in which Leslie-Anne Dovn, playing the mother, strikes a dog that hits her. Your heart will melt on her charm when she sees the dollar bills floating in her yard and asks how snow could fall during the flight. Loans "Munchie Strikes Back" promised another film, which is followed by the title "Munchie Hangs Ten". To date, the film audience has been looted from what would have been a film tour. Heh. 1/10
