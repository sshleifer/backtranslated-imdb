Forbidden as 'Video Nests' in the UK, Unhinged, of course, got a pretty note. However, the most shocking thing I've learned about the movie was amateur in all departments. The bleeding I could handle: terrible acting, bad montage, horrible direction, bad script and rude music background is much more difficult to take. the storm. They are saved by a friendly alien who takes them to a nearby house. The owner of the house, the old lady and her daughter, salute the girls, allowing them to stay for several days in order to recover. However, someone does not want the girls to leave! One by one they become victims of an invisible attacker. Taking a long time on the go and showing some of the worst performances ever in a horror movie (and this takes somethin '), Unhinged is really an avful movie. Music is a total mess (it sounds like three years old is at liberty on a synthesizer) and as such perfectly complements the movie. Only a few bloody scenes in the end and a bit of free nudity keep Unhinged from getting the lowest possible result. If you are a complete horror (and, unfortunately, I am), you will want to look at this to unsubscribe from the Video Nostalgia for viewing. But be warned that this is really, really bad.
