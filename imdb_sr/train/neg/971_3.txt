After reading some very good reviews about this film, I thought I would watch it and after I was very disappointed with the film, I thought I would give it my review. This is my first time with me. First of all, I would scare myself with horror from the genre, because in no way is it horrifying or terrifying (with the exception of a few bad attempts unfortunately, one of them worked on me.) I would say that this The movie is called a thriller that pushes it because I was not particularly thrilled! The film talks about a spoiled, naughty girl who fainted several times. During these times he visits the house she has drawn, after each visit, decides to add something to the house to make it more lively, one of the features is a sad little boy who is in reality and ill. As she makes friends with the boy, she realizes that her imaginary world, which she created, is actually better than the real world in which she is. As long as she does not constantly add her father home, due to a bad fall, she turns out that her father is evil and the boy has to escape from his claws. Think about his attempt to be a more relaxed version of A Nightmare On Elm Street, but more like a beach trip. In conclusion, my generous 3/10 will, hopefully, stop at least one of you from watching this gray!
