Amateur in extreme. The camera does not have to rotate all the time. The script is really rude and the acting is even worse. On top of that, the story is unconnected and writhing - with some arcing cavities in the logic. At one point, the leader wants to be thrown into jail to rub shoulders with suspected operatives of Al-Qaeda and thus get an interview with Osama. I told you that the story is completely incredible as a result of so many defects. The "movie actress" / lead role really shows a rash, idiot frat boi. The only interesting thing is that the filmmakers actually filmed the site. It really is a shame that they have lost the opportunity to make something interesting. Who financed this shit?
