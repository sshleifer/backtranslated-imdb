I hate horror movies, it's not a secret. None of the complications, bad acting and gallons of blood are not an integral part of these cinematic errors, and this "film" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations actually run this garbage. (This particular rubbish is released straight to the video, as far as I remember.) As if the mention of any other movie was a great insult to that other film, I say this: All the films from Phantasm, all Jason movies, Freddie movies, Chuckles movies, and most of Michael Miers' films can be summed up in one word: TERRIBLE !!! Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
