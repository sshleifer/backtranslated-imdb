Villiam Russ is the main character in this film. He left his family to reappear and began to repay his debts. But he is trying to keep himself away from his family. Where Peter Falk (Colomb) enters, playing several different roles, to persuade him to return home. The story is average and in fact they managed to reach the former star (Peter Falk) and use it to a fairly good degree. But Villiam Russ was not really a star. However, his acting seems to be still fine. I consider that the delivery and the story is very poor in how everything was predictable. In fact, for the past 20 minutes, I almost dictated the word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that. All in all, it was a sub-movie. In the letter grading system, he would receive "D".
