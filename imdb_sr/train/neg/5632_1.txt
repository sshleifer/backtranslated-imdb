I watched a DVD (called BLACK VIDEO in the US) and after that I felt it was a really horrible movie. But they must have been cut off a little from the original film, or I missed a lot. The sex of sex had very little vulgarity and nudity (not even breast), but I read a few other comments on IMDb.com that mention vulgarity and something about the tampon. I did not see anything like that, just a bad, boring movie with unpleasant characters and a banal, sofomoric complication. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from mouth or Botocode to gargle, and the expression of her face touches her. Her name makes me think of the super-dimensioning of drinks in Taco Bell: "I'll Cola Grande!" It was really fun it was so bad, I had to play as I was in my Mystery Science Theater 3000, taking care of things like the fact that Dafoe is too big for his face. It's really like a stupid whale!
