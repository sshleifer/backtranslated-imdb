This is for me the first time I was disappointed in Tim Burton's film. POT is not a bad movie (great sets, costumes and an unusual brilliant performance), but it could have been made by any Hollywood director. The pacing was very weird, the last third was just waiting for the film to end, both the actor himself and the actor. Tim Roth was great, probably the only pleasure in the movie. Tim's back.
