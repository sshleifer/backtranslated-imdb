I was surprised when I saw this movie. I heard that it was the best ever recorded in the novel. How disappointed I was. How true fans Jane Austen can evaluate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. Writers of the script decided to stick in pieces of funny humor that are at best embarrassing, but also destroy the feeling of that period. As for the acting team: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a fairly shallow heroin (but then every "hot" American star would be questioned in the role), Tony Collette is wrong, and poor Evan McGregor was made to look ridiculous! I really could not say anything good about this movie. It seems that I'm among the few who do not rate it, but if you want my advice, watch the TV show Kate Beckinsale plays - believe me, it's far better than this superficial waste.
