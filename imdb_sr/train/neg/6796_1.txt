Linda Lovelace was the victim of the sadistic hate of a woman, Chuck Trainor. I do not understand how sex with a dog (which is animal abuse) can be fun or fun. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to do these films. I know that some people will criticize this comment, but I firmly believe that these types of films are fueling hatred and still misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves "civilized," but I feel that we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface to be civilized.
