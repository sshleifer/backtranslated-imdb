I have to say that this film was shaped entirely by the action stolen from movies like Friday, 13 / I know what you did last summer, this film was not so bad. In fact, it was not as bad as most Horror films Hollivood recently released. Murders, although they were sometimes over-imagined, in most cases were exactly this, the original one. The acting was central, which can be expected from low-budget features, but much better than what the much larger Studio Artisan / Lions Gate offers. My only real complaint that was not due to the budget of the film, which must have been small, was a fictitious "bandage" ending. I'm sorry, but this is what put this movie in a bad category for me. The ending was just stupid and turned on. Before that, I was a little bored, but I actually enjoyed it. 4/10
