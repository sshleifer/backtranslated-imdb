What an opportunity to make an interesting movie about a complicated topic. There is very little research on how to be a real (or gay) man who works in a gay sexual environment. The dancers continue to talk about their art as if they have no erotic component. Not everyone has to be prostitutes for hire, but these are really sex workers who play fantasies and sell private sessions that offer more than dancing. From the film, the impression is that they mostly address women who go to gay clubs and eventually engage "dancers" for private meetings. Even recordings in the club just show women in front of the stage and "dancers" who just play the audience in the audience. This is not simply the reality of these clubs. It would be quite difficult to live doing private dancing for straight women and couples. So, what do they really think about their gay fans and clients? We learn very little. Instead, we get a filler. A gay activist who does not add anything to studying flat dancers. A manager who tells us about costumes for a pullout action, but does not provide insight into the lives and attitudes of the dancers. The pictures of the city of Mecca are generic. A fake installation that shows the baking of sausages is ridiculous. This is a completely simple movie that should be interesting only to those who want to see a few pictures of beautiful dancing boys. The rest of the film is an insult to gay men.
