This is a candidate for the most fantastic film experience of my life. A great title, a great director (before that I saw "To Die For" and "Drugstore Covboi"), and hey - Uma Thurman in the acting team. How can you make a mistake? Well, that's the question that flashed in my temples for hours after I watched this party. at all costs. His critical lambasting was deserved. Here you have one of those rare films that do not contain any single quality. Zero out of ****.
