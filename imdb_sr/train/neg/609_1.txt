It was a horrible movie. Do not be lured by Christopher Valken or Michael Ironside. They are both big actors, but that must be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not buy the funny story of this movie. This film is an American propaganda piece from the early nineties. The most pathetic scenes were when Colombian rebels made their own cases of revolution. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared fake, and her pseudo-love affair with Valken was just a pathetic emotional link in a movie that had no real meaning. I'm disappointed that there are such films that destroy the actor, such as the good name Christopher Valken. I could barely sit.
