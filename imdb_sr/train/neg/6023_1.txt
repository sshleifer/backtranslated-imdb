This reminds me of when I was a born believer who will be minister. I never thought I would be a minister or even graduate from high school because I was almost sure that I would be taken to paradise before it ever happened. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a pile of garbage. I am now atheist, and this only proves that the doctorate "once saved always saved" that Christians say is not more real than the elf. If that's true, then why did I leave after many years of worship? Yes, I'm really saved. I prayed to you with dumb sinners with all my heart. If Christians read their Bible, they would find their God to be thought of as rape, genocide, abortion, and many other crimes are right in his hands. It may be surprising to find out that the word "exhilaration" is not mentioned.
