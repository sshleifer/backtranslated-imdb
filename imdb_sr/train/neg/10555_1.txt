First of all: I love the good Splattermovies and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero budget-flick is none of it! The picture quality is so damn low, the soundtrack is the most unpleasant I've ever heard (!!!) heard about FKS ... so the super-low quality makes some of them not as bad as they would in a real movie (what this garbage is not here). There is no idea, a thin story, a primitive acting and a rare dialogue - I think I have counted about 10 sentences in the entire film, each one repeating 20 times ... the same for many movie sequences (it can be an indication of what the audience did this shit !!!) It seems that the story is that one boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother, that he was mentally damaged and as an adult goes on tour, exposing self-esteem. So far, so good ... But for these pseudo-art-idiots-directors, this action is just a line for putting inexpensive production scenes in a series that do not have a message or make sense (freshly drawn hoses are thrown on the naked, bound woman in the earth hole ... why and why is it the only way to see a woman and a pitcher in the whole bloody "movie" ??? Worrying? Yes!! Sick? Yes!! Necessary? Not! Artisticalli? NOT!!!!! Anyone who misinterprets this inexpensive art show is to visit his psychiatrist as soon as possible or to watch Pink Floyd "The Vall" to see how a similar topic can be worked out in a cunning manner ... I hope this was your first and last ( !!!!!!!!) movie, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all that you are up there, remember: Not everything that looks cheap and obviously makes no sense automatically "Art" ...
