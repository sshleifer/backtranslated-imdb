This movie is simply horrible !!!! Slow acting, slow to reach the point, and wooden characters that simply should not have been there. The best part was to show Iron Maiden singing in a video in the theater and that's it. the end was worth watching and waiting, but that was it !! The characters in this film almost slept me. Avoid this !!!
