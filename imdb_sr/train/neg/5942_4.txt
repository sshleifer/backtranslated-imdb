If this should be a black experience, let me go to the front or back door. Mom's boy one day sees that two young hoods walk from there and it's all downhill for him. . Angela Bassett, one great grace in this film, plays her protective, religious mother. Despite his anger at how his life turned, in the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept it. She allows her friends to come and it's all right to use curses until she's in front of the kids. This is a sad situation regarding the gangster rape. You knew where this movie is going. I literally laughed loudly when, in the end, when Bassett was following his son's body for a funeral, she says that even though his life was shortened at 24, he became a man. Which man? He was a convicted criminal, he wrote the most terrible rap music with constant vulgarity and despised society. This scene in the classroom in which he tells the teacher that he will work as a rehabilitation worker more than a teacher, is a perfect example of what is happening in our schools. A complete and complete lack of respect for the teacher. East coast, west coast, gang rivalry has never been fully explained. All we see are pistols. Terrible painting does nothing to prevent gang violence. What terrible examples are you rap singers and their bad music. The Afro-American community should go into the very essence. Who was that stupid fat lunatic who showed Biggi? He made Rerun's old television show looks thinner in comparison. I know that the streets of Bedford Stuivesant changed this bunny boy into the vulgar monster he was. What a sad situation when it's called fun on the go.
