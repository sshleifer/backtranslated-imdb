I do not want to go too far into details, because I can not really justify losing time watching this movie, but I had to give an alternative opinion so that, I hope, I would help people avoid the film. The animation is raw and the story changes between boring / meaningless and extremely irritating. Humor was completely lost to the audience, and that - Ghost in Shell fans, this is NOT action sci-fi or anything like that - her attempt to stun comedy, and humor simply did not work after translating. It was a total task to watch this movie, and a terrible way to start a film festival, especially considering how excited I was and how open to everyone - I did not expect Ghost in the sequel to Shell, but I was expecting something fun and it just did not work. Iaaavvnnn ... Instead, rent a Kino's Journei.
