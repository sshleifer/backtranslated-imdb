I bought this movie blindly and I'm quite upset that I paid as much as I paid, but I would say it is at least worth the rent for some cool death and funny acting. It's not a good movie in any way, but I have to say I was pretty fun. I suppose that can be called so bad - that's good. As I said, acting is terrible, I feel like I could do a better job by showing, at least, any emotion. The story is nothing new and it's done better. I guess I have only a few places for any movie carnival type. I'd say you rent or download it, but you definitely do not buy it. It's not worth more than an hour.
