I have to admit that I have captured this several times in the United States Network. There is only something about, so, the stupidity of this film that makes me watch it whenever it's turned on. Yes, you are right in terms of subordinate behavior, a plot that may only appeal to a seven-year-old, etc. But I can not feel sympathetic to some actors. Again, several of these actors have applied for even more horrible sequels.
