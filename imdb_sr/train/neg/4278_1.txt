I just picked up this movie for cash in National Vholesale Likuidators, and after I looked at it, I feel like I was pissed off. I do not know that I've seen a worse movie than this. Sincerely. And I would never write a negative film review that I did not have such great respect for the subject, that is, Stephen Foster and his music. First, what is it? Is it a music biography? Yes, a lot of the melodies that Foster then intertwined here and there are those pseudo-Broadvai-Jerome Kern numbers that smell more than a delta of Mississippi. I mean, someone paid to write this? Secondly, the real story of Foster is fascinating. Why do not you come in close to me at all? Third, what did they have with Raio Middleton to make him do this? Pictures with little boys ?? With Communists? What a loss of great talent. So, Foster friends, and the truth and good fun, be afraid ... be very, very, frightened.
