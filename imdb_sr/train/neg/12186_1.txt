This remake of the original 1962 movie in the book has some very good parts to be praised by some fine performances by some fine actors - however, Scorsese opts for the most complicated complicated complications and the shamefully overburdened Shakespearean death. watching my watch. De Niro is a wonderful actor, dedicated to accomplishing everything in a job that works, but he needs direction to focus his talent, and this has been missing out in the last five minutes of the movie. Thunder Gregory Peak is useful, but nothing more while Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with just a few rows like this. Nick Nolte turns to better performance than Lorenz's oil, but is not in the same form as "weed". Joe Don Baker has some great lines while Juliette Levis once again proves that talent sometimes skips the generation. Some good side? The initial credits (!), The first look at the Codie when it comes down to prison, the scene in which Codi is attacked by baseball bats, Sam Bovden is decent in full panic, Codi is calm outside but disturbing. The worst? "Cleaner - But NOT REAL !!!" part. Holding her bare hand to the bottom of the car for hundreds of miles at high speed. (Does the US have a speed?) "He's dead - But NOT REAL !!!" part and above mentioned unsuccessful end. Perhaps I'll look at the original again, but I just have to be tempted to watch the remake for four years since I saw it.
