I myself was arguing whether to rent this or not. I'm always afraid to rent something I've never heard of (I do not remember being in theaters). Great cast ... that's what dragged the scales. In 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching. The first few minutes are fun to watch, but incredible. It just worsens after that. The writers of this film could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their films even better. Or they could just try to write something a bit convincing. I give her 3 .... a 1 for writing (just because there are words) and 2 for that I can get so many good actors to adhere to this movie, despite having to read the script. Oh, my God, this movie is shit.
