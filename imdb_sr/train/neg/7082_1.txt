Ok, I wrote a sharp review b / c movie is horrible. As I was waiting for another review (for Derrida) that appeared, I decided to look at the old critics of this terrible film. See all positive reviews. They ALL, I say SVI, come from collaborators who have not rated any other film other than this. Crimmini! and wait until you go to the "rosebud" [sic] review. Checkout other Rosebud films reviewed and had great recommendations. Oh, shoot, they are by accident for other films by two writers and directors. Holy window wipers Batman. Joe, Tony, you're shit like writers, and Tony, you could not write a bad scenario. No jobs for you! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CHECK THE POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR NOT EXPECTED FILM!
