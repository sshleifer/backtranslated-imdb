This film seems to be totally meaningless. There is no reason for anything happening in him, as if it was written by a little child who bored half way and thought "how can I twist it?". And what did Jared Harris and Christopher Valken think? Did they do it for a bet? I could not tell you a plot, I'm not quite sure there is one completely honest, but if it exists, it did not register. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after falling down the stairs while being attacked, as do you. They go to the house with a very boring little girl in her, meet Christopher Valken who dug an ancient woman preserved in the peat. He returns to life for nothing but the continuation of the story and shows his gratitude by instantly frozen. Since then everything has become a little stupid. A few hours of my life I would like backwards!
