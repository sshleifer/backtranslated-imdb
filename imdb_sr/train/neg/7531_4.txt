This is, allegedly, a film about multiple sadness. As such, it should launch the viewers and make them sympathetic with the starvation of the main characters. However, its irritating postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera is constantly shifting from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to another, creating an aggravated, unrelated effect. Most of the characters seem to live in a devastating, unstructured life, held together with their professional duties. (Also, the credibility is expanding so that the man who just received what is probably the death penalty is happy to be left with a sexual disorder with the woman he just met). The story (if there is a story) is difficult to follow. All in all, the overall effect is rather disappointing. In spite of all this, acting is generally good and some scenes are quite powerful.
