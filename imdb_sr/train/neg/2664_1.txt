An unpleasant, clich√© thriller has a young couple who is engaged in research at the most famous American killer sites, becoming partners with a blurry young woman and her boyfriend - who is a real psycho. Arte and alienation, the film film changes between pouto-pseudo-irony and nonsense. Very handy, but ultimately funny. The effect of Brad Pitt as low-rent killer is divine. * from the ****
