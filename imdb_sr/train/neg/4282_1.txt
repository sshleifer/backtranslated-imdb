I just can not understand why all these relics from the time of Ceausescu refuse to let them go. It can be clearly seen how frustrated they were during the communist censorship that banned so many things from showing themselves in their films, and now they imagine their ignorance of what a great deal of freedom is, so fill the screen with people who suffer, wet, vomit, and all other forms of disgust that can be imagined. This is not cinema, friends and neighbors! This is simply visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, David Linch, about Forman and Neo-Reality and other filmmakers who were able to work with the aesthetics of ugly. These people have mastered their work - well, no! Do us a favor, all of you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresani and Marinescus and Margineanus and other old-fashioned old people, and leave us alone! It's been a while to watch some Romanian movies on the screen, enough with your immature terrorism! You are not directors, you are ILLITERATI !!!
