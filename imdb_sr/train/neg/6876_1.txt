Yes, this was pure incredible humility. We know that the French often have a distorted idea of ​​the US, that is puritanism and attitudes towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) living in France, I have enough opportunity to observe these views. And while some of these prejudices can be true, NOT the ONE element of the city in the middle west shown in this film rings. A man who never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years before his penis was too big? Where would I find it? Juke's in the bar that only plays vintage? A city with perhaps 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but without a large gas station, no TV in the house, no McDonalds, no children ... A population that knows intimate details to each other, but relentlessly gathers as a large family to be hates. Adult males grow pads at a local café, have farms but do not read, kill a guy they do not like in front of everyone and seem to get out, all with equal emotions? Free French girl who will fuck a nineteen-year-old boy for sexual generosity, too much of a man who leaves corn fields just because of the breeze of an Illyrian breeze to help the deflorant of this 17-year-old farmer? HELP! I am so confused and stunned by the absurdity of this film that I do not expressly say how ridiculous it is. Go look for A-to-Z beginners about what to avoid. God, I hope that I did not destroy it!
