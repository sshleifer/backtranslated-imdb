I usually do not take the time to comment that few people will read, they will see little movies. However, in this case, I consider that I must warn all those who might consider spending time on it. I was just looking at him just five minutes ago. This is, simply, one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The operation is terrible, the plot is nonexistent, and the value of production is at best the level of poverty. I know that even a budget with a low budget can be great, but not this one. There is only one thing that could save this movie for the needs of any fan of horror - more on the screen and killing! Overall altogether, this is happening outside the screen. Although it is effective and ruthlessly disturbing when this happens - especially the ultimate scene - it simply is not enough. The movie is too long for minimal content, and the dialogue is difficult, so it's almost impossible to watch. What happens? In order for all this to be briefly with them for which it would be free, three teenagers irresponsibly and consciously went out through an isolated area where more than 20 girls had been kidnapped and killed before. Their car is, of course, broken down and taken to an old boring house in which three crazy men live - one of which is a psychotic killer. All three were eventually killed, one by one, out of the screen after what looked like the eternity of boring, slow nonsense. As I said, the only things worth watching are even one murder. Please, do not buy it, or just rent it for yourself, and do not be fooled, as I was due to the wrong description of art and film. Save money and your time.
