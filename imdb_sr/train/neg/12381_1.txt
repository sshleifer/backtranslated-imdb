This movie is really rotten. He plays in the urban paranoia of the 70's and 80's and puts it in a school context. I am not saying that urban crime was not a problem for many people or that schools were not / are not problematic areas, but this disgusting part of exploitation takes biscuit. Violence is above all realistic imaginable, but in this case, this is not the case with social problems, but a student of the white, middle-class uses it to turn into the crime of his local high school. And of course, he knows how to play the system. Does that sound familiar to you? Yes. This shit is pure violent exploitation, a really nasty thing. This is disturbing brutality dressed as a social commentary. This belongs to the same category as trash such as Ekterminator, Death Vish 2-5 and so on and so on. The only significant thing is that Michael Fock was so broken that he had to do things like this.
