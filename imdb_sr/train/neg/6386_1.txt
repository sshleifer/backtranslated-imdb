I really wanted to love this movie, but that was easy. The act was an ultra hammi, the plot was boring, and the tempo was SLOV, sooo slovvvvvv. All the while while I was sitting in the theater I wanted to finish the film. Twenty minuses in movies and I pray for the end. Certainly some of the pictures were nice, but come on guys, I mean really! And for a movie about the type of magic instruments, there really was not much music. The music that was there was boring and boring. Sometimes sound loud sounds sounded, and that was irritating. Mostly this movie managed to bother me and crawl at the same time. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's over. I have to go see Tideland and wash this bad taste from my mouth.
