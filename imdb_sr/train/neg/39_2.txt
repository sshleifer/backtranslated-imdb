The actress who makes the film in Africa was kidnapped and taken to a jungle where she was held for ransom. Producer hires someone to go and return it back. Everything is complicated by the jungle jungle fans who adore a really ugly "god" who likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> This is a silly movie. There are abundant volumes of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. His film for exploitation is designed to appeal to the deepest, darkest parts of our being, and if the film is not so boring, this film would be a classic. Let's face it, despite the worse, nasty sex and abuse, and the ugly monster this movie is snoozer. Pacing is completely off and exposes you. There are several lines that appear to be happening separately from each other, although in the end there is one story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Much of the minimal dialogue is about the cruelty or protests of one character that I will "do what I want". It's such a quiet and boring film that, if there were no frequent screams of victims, I would recommend this as a sleeping aide. unless you need to watch each Euro-Cannibal movie. AsAsia has just published it as part of its Terror Tales series, their Japanese-made footprint (there is a blur) that was wrinkled to remove the subtitles.
