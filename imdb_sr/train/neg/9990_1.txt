Watching this movie on the SciFi Channel, I can only conclude that this movie was made by a bunch of amateurs who never saw a movie in their life. The film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences, or "pleasures" as a friend tells me over my shoulder. The action is not worth commenting, but basically the plane carrying the football players is being demolished on the territory of Ieti. Before the film finishes, we treat us until we pull out the heart, we are still pushing ourselves in an attempt to run before we jump 50 meters, and we are still torturing male legs and hitting them, a woman who kills a rabbit at 30 meters with a spear Jeti he survived several bullets and set himself on fire without obvious injury. Yeti hung from the cliff holding the man's shoe, then jumped, and a whole collection of further, bizarre events. Basically, if you do not stay on Saturday because of the obvious goal of watching the worst movies from the SciFi Channel, avoid this film as a plague. Or as my friend reads over his shoulder says: "That's the best movie I've ever seen." To whom the friend on my right says: "Only tech music in the fight could be better."
