There was no characterization in this film and really shows how much this homeless hack who directed this should learn his craft. All his characters in this film were so unfavorable and it was easier for me. The best thing about this movie was the end of the loan and the long-standing shower after that, because I felt so damn dirty that I spent money on this stinking load. Hey genius ... triads and Jacuzzis teach you about Asian culture from two different places. The dog's scene in this felt so immodest and useless. This DVD has proved helpful. I love my new paddle. So children do not spend money on this hostel instead.
