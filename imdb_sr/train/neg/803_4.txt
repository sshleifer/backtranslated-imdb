I read the novel Reaper of Ben Mezrich a few years ago and I accidentally came to see this adaptation last night. Although last year since I first read the story, the differences between the novel and the movie are huge. The very important elements that made the whole thing credible are just being written down or altered in bad. If your shop sounds interesting: go and take a novel. Much, much, much better. Another 4 out of 10 because it was difficult to stop watching because of the great basic story of Ben Mezrich.
