This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are funny, and the script is pathetic, and the biggest question is how is this modest script written through the selection process. I like all kinds of movies from deep drama to more male-oriented kills everything you see a movie, so I can not say I'm picky. I'm trying to find something that I compare to him, but I simply can not remember anything that could be dealt with, perhaps to the soldiers of the ship. compared to these effects are great. Excellent acting and scripts should be rewarded. You know when the movie is bad in a fun way, so people are not one of those who kill your soul minute by minute.
