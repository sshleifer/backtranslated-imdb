I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were glittering, the acting was terrible, and if everything was complicated, it was on the back of the box. I do not think I remember the movie for a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and suck !! ;) Even that could not save this film from being just a horrible excuse to pay someone to stand (or lie in this case) in front of the camera. I was pretty lax overall "zombie" effect. Since it is obvious in this film, zombies are so commonplace that they run over a pair here and there, and they are casually talking about it at a gas station (one with a windshield in the house, but there is no indoor bathroom), the zombie-movie genre is not even a factor to the end. Even then, a comedy of dozens of zombies that takes away the clothes of a girl does not mean that it is a zombie movie. On the vampire: Obviously all zombies are male and all vampires are women, which is okay. I'm not sure how the vampires are in the daylight, or why the soldier's vampire was standing in the middle of the road, still holding the pistol through his hip through the heart, just waiting for the queen Vampire to break it to the end. The last segment in the old women's monastery did not make any sense, and when a hot lesbian vampire asks other hot lesbian vampires "Do you think we did the right thing?" killing two obvious heroes in the film, about putting it to the top. The performance and special effects were at the lowest level. Almost you could see the hose that fake blood was exhausted during a major zombie plan that was overtaken by the general. When we're at the General, where did they find this Kenny Rogers at all? I have no idea what he was general, other than generally confusing and lost. All in all, watch a movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have a strong need to spend $ 3. Just my $ 0.02.
