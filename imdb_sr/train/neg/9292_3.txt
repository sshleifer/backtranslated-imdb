First of all, I also expected another hero - a fantastic artwork for the genre of action. I only saw parts of the Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine it is better than HoFD. The basic elements of Hero are found in HoFD: Great landscapes, enchanting cinema and sincere acting (I mean, if you can not understand the word they say, without subtitles, but you still care - it's good behavior) What went wrong? What begins with political intrigues waves into a love story. Worse, it's a love triangle like a soap opera. You have three characters who, I suppose, fall in love with one another - without good reason. This film is basically falling apart after the escape from prison (I fell asleep for about forty minutes). Almost as if they had changed the writers at that moment. The rest of the film is about how the character is "like the wind". Ick. Also, you really need to stretch the suspicion of disbelief to believe that the action is set. This is not unique to this genre, but since the story is weak, you can not wait for the action, and then, when the fighting is kicked out, it really was not so good. The start gets you, but then this movie just runs out.
