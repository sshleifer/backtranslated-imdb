I just saw a movie last weekend, I'm upset and disappointed. Basically, the film tells you that immigrants, especially those from the former Soviet Union, came to this country, brought with them everything they could from the old country, and attacked and took over what the Americans were doing. What is a very wrong way of looking at immigration, and a much worse way for people to talk about it. That's the main thing. Another thing, whole writing, directing and recording is at the level of village amateurs. The actors were pretty good, but they were not there to save this bunch of shit. A few jokes were funny, but most were bad and cheesy. I can not wait to get out of the theater, I want my money back.
