I will not mention any action, because although it would be very predictable anyway, one significant plot is given everywhere, in the comments about the film, in the summary of the actions here, and even in the synopsis on my Netflik envelope. . Maybe I enjoyed more if I did not know that. Maybe. This film has a seemingly good actor, most of whom are credited with acting with rather limited material, including Donald Sutherland, Leslie En Voren and Thi Carr√©, and Ruzmarina Densmor in smaller parts. It was impossible to love Villiam McNamara, but that was obviously by design. And there were several quick bare scenes called Callipigian Lenore Zann. But none of this makes any recommendations from me. Does not any of these fine actors actually read these scripts before they sign?
