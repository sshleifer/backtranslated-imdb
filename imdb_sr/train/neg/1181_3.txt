this film has been wrapped up for so long with a scandal that it has become a very demanding thing ... anger, mystery, etc. she had everything to be a big piece of the movie, but after all she did not succeed in every way. It's a terribly bad comedy, a pathetic horror movie, a lousy erotic movie. DVD with two discs includes a beautiful booklet with photos, interviews, bestiality essays, and so on. more than a pretentious director. For those who have heard about it, but have never seen it, the package will look fantastic until you see a movie. Disk 1 contains a feature film, poorly translated into English, but with good visual quality. Disk 2 contains a director's cut, in a terrible transmission, in French. What can I say about the real beast? the handmade Kermit's frog would be more efficient and shocking.
