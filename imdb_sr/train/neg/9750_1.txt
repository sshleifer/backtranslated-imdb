"There's no explanation for why it's needed, but Professor Paul Steiner (starring actor Briant Halidai," Devil Doll ") thinks it's something to be devoted to his, and his assistants, Pat Peer and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen ), is alive. During the experiment, before being noticed by the Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his machine failed due to sabotage, so he himself "designed" his secretary Sheila (Tracei Crisp ) to seek vengeance.Of course, she screws up and he comes out as a "pork baking" with the power to make people n With this new power, he succeeds in killing some Cockney idiot, a security guy named Latham (Derrick de Marnei) and his laboratory head, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Voodland). in a condition to break into a pharmacy and steal rubber gloves and a black coat.
