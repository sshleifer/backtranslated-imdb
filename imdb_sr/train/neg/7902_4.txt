Sweet and playful, but silly and cheap. "Munchies" is another Gremlin clone coming out of the 80s. I'm not really a fan of imitations. First they were excellent 'Gremlin'. Then came the very average 'Critters'. We must not forget the bad 'Ghoulies'. But the complete pits would have to go to 'Hobgoblins'. Is there any more? Now "Munchies" would have to fall for me somewhere between "Ghoulies" and "Hobgoblins". In fact, I probably considered it more fun than 'Ghoulies', but I prefer a darker tone. From the very beginning, she plays by her foolish nature (which is better for her), but because of this nature of hammi act (Alik Elias and Charlie Phillips), they can get pretty pride that you prefer to just look at how cat runs. The party is happening there. Most of the light hearts, because the story focuses mainly on munchies (who are either hungry, aggressive or destructive) in the whole crowd of alleged comic encounters (some moments are working) in a small desert city, as few people are hunting. It's stupid, but unusually attractive thanks to zippa pacing. The creatures themselves seem pretty smooth and poorly detailed, as the basic puppets are swinging. Where did their personalities come from, that they can actually speak ... and with the attitude. Charlie Stratton and the lively Nadine Van der Welsh (who were in the 'Critters') were fair leads. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo appears. Fun is fun for unpretentious.
