In an attempt to get back the teenage genre that he took away from liars like Scari Movie and Shriek if you know what I did last Friday 13, Valentine does not work. Why did people like Night of Witches? Because it was original, new and surpassed everything that was ever done. Why did they love Screaming? Because at least that made sense. Valentine is just a stupid jerk that almost does not exist. The land is so much like Halloween and Urban Legend, which is not funny. And when the killer comes to the screen, you know who it is, it's just ssssssssssoooooooooooo predictable. The teen slasher genre is DEAD Get over it! <br /> <br /> 0 of 10
