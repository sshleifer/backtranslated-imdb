I love these actors, but they are lost in this movie. I can only wonder, what did they think to agree with this shit? in; Dennis Kuaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you like "Breaking the Vaves", you'll probably like this too. I hated both of them. 3/10
