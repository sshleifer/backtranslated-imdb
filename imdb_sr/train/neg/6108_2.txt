Tarzan Ape Man is a remake of the film from 1932 at the same time, and as the earlier film, it is a bit similar to Burroughs's literary character. But while Tarzan of 1932 was reduced to the speech "Tarzan-Jane," this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, does not speak, or even murmur. He made Tarzan shouting several times, which sounds like it was sampled from an earlier film. No, Tarzan plays another banana Bo Derek like Jane. Or rather, as the third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and her right breast. This film does not make any sense than to show Derek naked. The two action scenes in the movie are shown slow and really are bad. More evidence that nobody cares. Strangely enough, Tarzan has a side impact of orangutans in this movie. Perhaps the car fitted with Sumatra with Indian elephants that are also exposed.
