Sunshine's European imports were set up in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, an epic story about the Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name is literally translated as Sunshine. The family has modest beginnings, then it is prosperous, it moves upward, changes its name, and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society, so that successive generations can develop professionally. The story is told by the eyes of the eldest son in each of the three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who have missed the VV-II and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschein's approach to life does not work well. The sun is recognized as an artistic success, but it is an opportunity missed. The story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; This has been strengthened by voice guidance and video footage. The family 'sinks' from a predictable event [i.e. Habsburgs, VV-I, VV-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. The subject of Jewish assimilation is unconfirmed, and important subtopics [secret] diaries and family philosophies that could give family character and credibility are all the way to the end. Alternatively, filmmakers ensure the continuity of the generation using shared incest / unbelief themes. Ralph Fiennes shows flash glare, but its performance is far from rewarding material. "3 for 1" casting format is a spectator's distraction and feels more like a cheap movie quiz than for a good theater. Sunshine is basically Hungarian "Histori Channel" material. It has the look and feel of the Wind War, transformed with Forrest Gump, transformed with Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
