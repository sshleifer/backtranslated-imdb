I am a big fan of the Trombone, but I can not figure out why they bought the rights to this movie, it's so boring that I felt like I was watching 3 hours. Some of them summarize the summary, "but what Satan does not know is that he is stuck with boring tourists." Well, it seems that they did not bother him in the movie, just me. The only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I love bad movies, but that was just boring.
