In accordance with Disnei's famous theft of stealing ... I mean, by buying well-known assets and their collapse, this live-action version of an honest cartoon must be one of the worst re-made in the year of bad. re-makes. I grew up on the original TV series. Every episode of the original series of cartoons will give you more laughter than this whole movie. There is no Penney's cool computer book. Likewise, there is no node with self-destructing orders that always ends with detonation on the boss. The new Gadget is a convertible that speaks without problems (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic Hollywood romance. Do not fill the cash box to pay for Disney's executives and even their _ek_ekecutives - you do not see this movie. <br /> <br />
