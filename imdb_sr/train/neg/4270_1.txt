This is another typical incredible and insensitive piece of Hollywood's shit. Kurt Russell, like Snake Pliscine in the business suit, assures me that he is better at 2. Basman. Rai Liotta as a psychotic cop is completely predictable and absurd. Madeline Stove is her usual carbon selfishness, and does not seem much to be a convincing victim. him down and out. Kurt and Madeline then compulsorily finish the film, and EVERYONE --- other than Russell and Stove, KNOWLEDGE Liotta will return and endanger the couple. Naturally, Russell had him 10 times drilled with 9mm, which is completely unnecessary. This film could also end up with a dazzling scene - PREMA Hollywood's story of unnecessary violence, and as far as I can add, or "reinforce", it's more greedy.
