I found that Dark was too dark. She had some kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas, not a bad action scene and a few moments that would make you go to UGH! OR, it was underlined to the point of confusion. You really do not know what's always going on in the dark scenes, and for the film that was filmed on the Super 8, you already have all that stuffy grain. As with Nathan Schiff movies, that's too much. It seems that the director Leif Jonker wants to make an original film, but he lacks the money to do it. The camera is never focused on the right place, the lack of basics such as capturing simple dialogue scenes and lighting the movie. The actors are rather uneven and hammi. But in spite of these negatives, music is good, it's up a lot, and it's moving from a stupid kitty to really good devices. Is this a classic as it says? Is it worth the praise of the two discs? NOT. But this is a good first attempt. Now, if these guys stop dancing on the back of this movie (from what I understand here only that they have ever finished) and tried again, it might be better.
