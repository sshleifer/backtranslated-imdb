This is the worst brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, stupid, meaningless piece of garbage I've ever seen, incredible rubbish of the current cult status among the bizarre fans. If you think that Ed Woody's "Plan 9" is bad, so ... let me tell you, it looks like "Citizen Kane" in comparison with that. Effects Special Effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars." Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so he's out of the bad, really. But if you are looking for such incredible movies, it's for you! I am a fan of American International for so many famous horror films, Price-Corman-Po saga and some great things, but with "Star Creatures" they go down to the Z-level. Of course, my 1 in 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad entertainment movies (the guy who plays the Indian boss is great) so have fun and enjoy ... if you can.
