I did not like this film intensely and I was left on a scene in which the British shot a loyal gang. The film effectively blames the people of NI as the cause of their problems. This suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of intransigence and nothing to do with the British division of Ireland, and the dominance of its history, i.e. NI was created by Britain in 1921, regardless of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. The characters are portrayed as unfortunate fools, although I despise the loyalist paramilitaries who fought for the cause - retaining their artistic privileges over the Catholic community. It is well known that the British intelligence service cooperated with loyalists during the war, no doubt keeping the Catholics and demoralizing republicanism. Belfast is portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish 'psyche' that leads to violence. The stupid song of a woman in the club - an old Ireland green field .. blah .. blah .. - gets a symbolic status, i.e. Poor young fools who are struggling for an impossible cause. Convenient, historical, cheap and nasty waste. O'Sullivan gave a personal statement of the conflict that requires serious political analysis.
