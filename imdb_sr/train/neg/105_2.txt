There are many good women in this movie. But, alas, this film is free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike 1. <br /> <br /> Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Why are the main characters behind the Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anybody? As you may know, this film is published in stereoscopic 3D format. And that's the scariest thing I've ever seen. I'm not sure if someone ruined the job on this, but there was no 3D, just a double vision of blur. I did not have the same problem with other 3D films of this company, HUNTING SEASONS and KRP KRP. Of course, the 3D in them was sucked, but with them I could see the illusion of a 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. Women were the ones who played the daughter of the lady ears, iam! I'd like to see her more. And in movies. It looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
