This kind of "inspirational" saccharin is enough to get you sick. He telegrates his feelings as the largest traffic light on earth. It removes the audience's own interpretation and feelings by making decisions for it. A big ending is swimming in poster orchestras that should function as jumper cables on a dead car; I guess you'll need such an incentive to feel if you're stupid enough to watch the film as simple and dark. Streep lights up and you wonder if there really is a depth of feeling on the screen or it's just - the screen, turned on and off as a light. Because I can not see in my life that she can find life in such a film. Although based on a true story and an inspirational one in which I am certain, the setting, performance and performances are played as a third degree of television film or semi-witty high school.
