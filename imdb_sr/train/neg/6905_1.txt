Klish's Polynesian men drink, fight and make the electricity of sexist, stupid and awkward remarks. Real life Polynesians are much more fun than these stereotypical, cardboard characters. It is assumed that the Samoan girl did not look at all or behave only to herself, she looked more like a white woman who has sex with anyone on the delusion. With poor water lines you can not say anything about acting - even the brightest actors could not do anything with this scenario. It's sad to see polynesian actors who are willing to play such sad stereotypes in a movie that does not have a good scene, and only two or three 'jokes'. What a loss of taxpayers' money Kiwi, what a lost opportunity to make a great movie about a living community. It's better not to shoot movies if they're so bad and foolish like this one.
