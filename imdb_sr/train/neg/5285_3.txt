Somewhere on this site, someone wrote that you should read them for the best version of Jane Austin's work. I agree with that. However, we love adaptations of great literature and the current strike of the writers reminds us that without good writers, actors find it difficult to revive their roles. The current version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION shows us what happens when you do not have a good basis in a well-written adaptation. This version can not be compared to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which worked well and retained the essence of the era and limitations on characters (with the exception of a bizarre parade and kissing in a street scene in Bath). . The 2007 version shows tweets Anne that seems to be under stress. Other characters were not very developed, which is a crime, given how Austen could paint such beautiful characters to some carefully selected inconsistencies. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely rejected, and Ms. Smith, Anne's bedside and impoverished school friend, walked to Bath - he was chirping, as many characters did. The power of character and intelligence of Captain Ventworth, which Anne liked at first sight, did not look like she was enrolled in Ventvorth in Rupert Penry-Jones. Ciaran Hinds had more content and was able to convey much more with a look than P-J was able to do with his poses. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. The novel seemed to be reduced to a hand-held, costumed melodrama of discrete value. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances to Austen's work, they had to do what they do with Shakespeare's adaptations: adjust it to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was extracted from historical and location settings and it was fun to watch, like "Clueless". This was not, but they did not know what else to call.
