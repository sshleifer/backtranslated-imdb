NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CLASS REUNION was a flop when it was released. It did not stay long in theaters in my big city. Why? Because it's BAD !!!!! Not bad in a good way, but bad in really painfully awkward way. The whole act of the actors was then largely unknown and remained unknown after this Turkish. Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more valuable than spending on nanoseconds watching this unpleasant inflammation.
