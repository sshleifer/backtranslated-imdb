I remember this film when I was 13 years old (I think there are many comments that say the same thing as 13 years old!) With a group of school friends. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first movie, and fell for the typical commercials that tell us it was a great comedy. We spent about 45 minutes, and we all agreed to leave the theater. She was grotesque and inexperienced, and far from the ability of Billy Cristal to smile us, we did not laugh. I accidentally came across this review and decided to register only to tell the rest of the world what the loss of the movie was, if you now hire this, you deserve what you get, WARNING!
