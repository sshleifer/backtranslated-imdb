So, I know I voted 1 out of 10, but it really does not deserve more than half of the star. I hated that. It was so dumb and unreal, I can not believe that some of the stars signed this funny absurd project. James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent in her characters, and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate was also good, but the story was exhausted and encouraged by anyone who sees this in the video that he does not even try to pick it up and read the last mask, but rather just go ... I do not want to embark on what's in the movie, because it's too stupid to pontificate. Do not rent this! It's horrible! Terrible!
