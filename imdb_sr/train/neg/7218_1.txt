There is a scene near the start after the shooting in which the horses run. If something looks red to you, it's because the white van parked behind a bush near the path. I thought I saw it bad, but this is it. A white van in the west. Did not they catch this? Well, I paid the highest dollar to rent. This will make you want to grab your friends and put them all in 10 thousand and make a better movie. The conversation was so slow, the acting was mostly fine, but it could not be seriously understood because of the poor nature of the recording. In the sheriffs there are doors that look like doors today with special decoration. I say I watch this movie, and move the Cabin to # 2 at the worst of all time.
