This is the highest clich√© and the worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Each scene is worthy and two main actors - Corei and Danny are so boring. Corei was very dumb and naive and he never had to listen to Dana's false promises. Neve Campbell and the killer from Urban Legend are the only redeeming qualities in this bad movie attempt. Danny (Dean Paras) looks in her late thirties and the girl she's trying to sleep - Corei looks like she's still in college. Here in Australia, this movie is called Too Smooth; There is nothing smooth in this film. 1/10 Avoid
