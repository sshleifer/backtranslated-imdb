After we stopped at the movie store and found something to watch, we came across it. It seemed attractive from the summary, so we tried. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes is interesting! It's really nice! Oh, wait, he spoke too early. Somewhere in, the film grew disgustingly in the fundamental, right-wing Christian brainwashing. It's not entirely certain what's going on, but I think the script writer found God somewhere in there, finished writing this script, and he did not have time to edit it because he had a meeting with the KSK in order to come with his friends from Westbrook Church and his hood was not clean . Can I put warnings on this? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Similar to video games that have rating systems, movies need some symbol: maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that the movie will be up. Unless you share feelings with any moron that came with this story, and have your Bible open in the lap while you are watching this and planning to convert your neighbors, do not waste your time. It is one of the worst trash that has come out for a long time, and radical religious nuts no longer need financing.
