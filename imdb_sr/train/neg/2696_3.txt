I know John Singleton is a smart guy because he made Boiz N The Hood, so how did he write and direct this? It's like a pilot of a bad "going to college for the first time" teen soap, a parade of boring stereotypes and clich√©s with some worthless violence inserted into a commercial proposal, I suppose. Who could have assumed that the victim of the date rape would throw a sausage for the seafood? An angry loner will be attacked by a group of neo-Nazis (and will be housed with black and Jewish - just for laughter!) Even Laurence Fishburne is a freaking reactionary history professor who just irritated me and I love this guy, like everyone involved in this film just lost a plot. Except Bust Rhimes, of course. Big ups.
