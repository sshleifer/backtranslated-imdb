* Can contain spoiler * I leaned back to be fair to this movie. I knew she was playing Madonna. I knew it lasted a whole week in the movies. I knew there were many bad reviews. I did not expect a deep and careful examination of class, culture and sexuality as we received in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted for ten minutes. Madonna plays a rich, pretentious, imaginary Gorgon who goes on vacation with her husband and wacky friends (brunette is as bad as Madonna, showing some really dumb facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the first ship on a boat that Madonna likes to humiliate and treat as dirt in every scene they have together. Why is he such a whore? Simply because the plot requires that later, when the two become devastated on an abandoned Mediterranean island, the tables are turned and he will teach the lesson. It's equally unexplainable that they fall in love despite having nothing in common and being mistreated by two-thirds of the film. "Swept Avai" is a dumb, simplified, superficial film from beginning to end. Madonna gives a typical wooden performance. There are many stupid scenes: Madonna sings and dances awfully at Giannini's request, fantasy scene with Madonna and many scenes where she hits and hits her ass. Gui Ritchie makes her "stylish" installation that's funny here. The film contains some of the worst dialogues I've heard in the big movie in a few years. The end is gloomy and unbelievable. Basically "Blue Lagoon" meets "Overboard" minus the nudity of the first and the sense of humor of this other. Maybe Madonna's ego is so great that she insists she continues to be proved as a competent actress. Please, surrender, Madge, for our good as yours. This is not her worst movie. This difference still belongs to "Shanghai surprise". She did not do anything worse than that ... yet.
