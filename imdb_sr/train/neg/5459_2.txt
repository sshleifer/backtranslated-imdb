This was a very short episode that appeared in one of the "Night Gallery" shows in 1971. The episode featured Sue Lion (from the glory of Lolita film) and Joseph Campanella who play the baby and the vampire. The vampire hires a babysitter to watch his child (who looks like some kind of inferno or monster) while coming out at night for the blood. The nanny is completely unaware of the appearance of a vampire when he sees him for the first time and only starts to put two and two together when he notices that there is no reflection in the mirror, has an unusual collection of books in the occult library, and hears strange sounds as the vampire goes to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she originally meant. She leaves the door, the vampire comes out suddenly and the episode is over. I do not know for what purpose she made such a shortened episode that lasted only 5 minutes. It only needed to expand the earlier episode in those 5 minutes and skip this one. Spent effort.
