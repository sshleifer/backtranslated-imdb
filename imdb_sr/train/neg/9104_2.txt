When I started to watch this movie at Cinemaku last night, I was shocked to see what was done. Cruel intentions, in my opinion, was one of the best teen films made in years. This bastard had certain things inconsistent with the original. (Sebastian's father married with wealth, why then has a rich aunt on a long island?) Then I learned today that it was not a new movie, but a television series, Manchester Prep. After I heard it, it made sense that it was not the same as a movie, just as Buffy's vampire killer is different in TV form. I think Roger Kumble most likely added the ending that this film had, AFTER the series not picked up by Fox. It looks like something that would happen too quickly (Sebastian has become a male version of Katharine), and I just do not know where to go with the next episode, because it would not lead to the 1999 film (which is more recent One thing I did not like was that Sebastian and his father stated that they married in wealth, which usually did not look good in this area in New York, and that Katherine's mother was only her adult version, it did not look as if a woman in her position could have been to marry a man who is not from her social class. </ br> As It's a bit lame, but I'd be interested to see where this went as a batch.
