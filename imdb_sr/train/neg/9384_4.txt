Mae Clarke will always be remembered as a girl whose face James Cagnei showed a grapefruit in the same year as a PUPPIES. She will not be remembered for this strange little story about a girl who has discovered that her past will always be with her. In a way, this looks slightly antique for 1931, almost as if looking at the famous inert light in 1928. But do not be fooled. Although Ted Tetzlaff's photo is still in big scenes, there are many movements, indicating the interference of viewers in sets for them. But in competition with the fastest themes that everyone seems to have worked with Varner, this attempt to get the female view into the genre as a tear gas is not working, nor is Mae Clarke an actress who is carrying this effort.
