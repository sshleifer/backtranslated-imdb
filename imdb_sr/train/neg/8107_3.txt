This movie is pretty boring. There are cuts of the naked meat that are thrown around in a chromium attempt to keep the watcher awake, but they do not succeed. The best thing in the movie is Lena Olin - she does a masterpiece with her character, but Dai-Levis dresses most of her lines. Kaufman apparently had no idea how to record this. The discrepancy in jumping between domestic household / marriage issues and political crises is poorly matched. Character attitudes change without explanation. Badli disjointed.
