I'll be short and accurate. This film was an insult to anyone with room temperature IK. I'm sorry, liberals, feminists, etc. No woman will ever be a seal. They can forget about the course or fight. It will not happen. You see, it's hard to understand or accept, men and women are physically different. Regardless of the fact that in 2007, reality can not change things to keep people from feeling their feelings hurt. Men can not give birth or babies (Oh-I forgot to San Franfredo). Women lack physical strength to be in pairs with men in combat or other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? In the end, I could not give bloody juice to hell if you disturbed what I wrote. Can you think about it - if it only disturbs you, my heart will warm up. I did not write one thing that was not true. This imbecile film is nothing but comedy and bad.
