It was almost inconceivable that this film would be a bust, but I was really disappointed. Since I've been an expert on Peking's cinema for years, I found this DVD, dramatically reduced, for sale and thought it was worth the effort. The opening of several points, the legendary fans of Peking, has an inter-section between man and animal, but here we have the non-dietary ambient noise of children playing in the school yard as a bomb is placed. Fantastic suspense. Then, when the policemen, Caan and Duval, traveled to their next mission, Duval released a bomb to Cann that his meeting had a STD last night, found only by sniffing through the purse while Cann was intimate with her. The laughter that followed was fantastic and the honors of Brian Depalma's Dressed to Kill, at the short-term cost of Angela Dickenson, were honored. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the opening of the loan, the film falls. Even bring me Head of Alfred Garcia has a stronger productive value, a brave call for anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Peking's points as a supplementary material for the lecture, but when they finish, turn the Killer Elite.
