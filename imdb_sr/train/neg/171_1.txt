I thought Hedi Burress (who managed to escape from the water grave of the first part) would be in Part 2. I just think that it should have been killed as on Friday 13th part (you know what I mean). This movie, like Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2, followed the films in the movie. /> <br /> This was PURE CRAP! The whole movie in the movie shit. Bad to stay!
