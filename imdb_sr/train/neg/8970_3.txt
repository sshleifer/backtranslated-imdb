The first Cube film was an artistic film. She established a world in which all the main archetypes of humanity were presented and showed how they struggled to understand the enemy world that they could not understand. It is, at non-literal level, the plot of "a man against the cruel nature," where in the end came the individual who presented innocence and goodness, triumphing to confront a new, indeterminate world outside of man's quarrelships; a world in which there was no more fighting, but peace. I rated Cube 10 out of 10, and that is a movie that was never intended to continue. The second film, Hipercube, was a big disappointment. Some of the ideas were somehow cool, but in the context of the original film, both the story and the setting did not make sense and did not have any meaning. Still, because I was pretty fun, I rated it 5 out of 10. Third film, Cube Zero, ignoring the other, is playing as a pretty inferior B-movie advertisement on the first, with no symbolism. There is no "honor" or "honor" here; there is only ripping. The same type of plot, with some elements that are idiotic (such as letters instead of free numbers between cubes - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else that this is a cleavage without absolute originality and nothing to say). To see something from "behind the scenes" does not mean anything, because the observers are only part of Big Bad Ekperimenta, of whose architects we do not hear anything. And, in this film, those who come to the exit (like Kazan did at the end of the first movie) have just been killed - where is * bleep * the meaning of it?! It's just stupid. I'm glad I did not pay to see this. The production values ​​and performance in Cube Zero are not too bad, but stories and ideas are so devoid of inspiration that this movie can only get from me a grade of 3 out of 10.
