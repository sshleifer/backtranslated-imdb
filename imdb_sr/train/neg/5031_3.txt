The original Japanese film "Gamera" from 1965 was basically updating the darker, less-oriented Gojra (Godzilla) for the sensibility of the 1960s. Gamera is, of course, a giant, flying torch that casts a flame and literally consumes energy - not as big as some versions of Godzille, but mostly similar in most ways. This version of the original movie was edited and recited by the notorious Sandi Frank. And just like the American version of the Godzilla King of the Monsters, Gammer The Invincible gets more from the wrong writing. American scenes are not nearly so funny and boring as those who are added to the great Gojiri, but they do not add much in the story, because they are a little tracked. The film begins promising, there are several scenes that are worth the development of character, and it has enough personality to create some tension outside the main plot. However, when Gamera appears, the film begins to descend into a rather small movie. The acting is good enough - even American accessories are fine. The director is pretty good for this period and genre, and special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backgrounds are actually very good. The biggest problem, of course, is that in this movie there is nothing original. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you're a fan of the chai.
