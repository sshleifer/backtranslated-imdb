Okay, let me clarify this for you ... It's URIENT! If Roger Kumble did such a good job at the first cruel intentions, why did he do such a bad job on this. I'm sorry, but this movie is stupid, the truth is that it may have improved if its series is ever broadcast, but let it be realistic ... this movie is stupid! A lot of bad acting * NOTE The Shover scene * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What is that line? "Sliperi vhen vet" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This movie made an effort, I'll give it to you, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it funny by giving the slaves in the house a stupid accent that actually ... FREE! It was pathetic. Not to mention that everyone in this looked like Absolutely NICE as the original composition. It's like they are intentionally or something like that! I like to watch it when I'm really a real board that does not happen occasionally. For those of you who loved it ... Okay, what did you think? Could you choose this film over another who had a great acting and incredible Sarah Michelle Gellar? The film is golden if there are Sarah Michelle Gellar, DUH! But this film is not, without the insult Ami Adams. Oh, yeah, since Sebastian has a heart? UGH!
