I saw this film for the first time not too long on the TCM series of Essentials. Around the observation clich√© was never more appropriate. This observer did not see anything valuable in this. I was confused by the endless attraction that Lauren Bacall owned. I agree, Mrs. Bekal was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character comes more than attractive. I think people like Mike Wayne and Kyle Hedley would probably ignore Luke rather than for a moment to fall in love with her. In Bacall's defense, this film was recorded at the time of Humphrey Bogart's latest illness, and the severity of his health deterioration could have affected her performance. Of course, Luci was part of this mousyousness to confront the wandering Marilyn, played by Dorothy Malone. The scene in which she deals with wild sensual dance while her father tears up stairs to a fatal heart attack is by far the best scene in the film. Malone's performance overshadowed the rest, although Jasper Hadley's murder, because of the disappointing behavior of his two children, was brilliantly displayed by Robert Keith. In general, however, I must say that I am not really a melodrama fan. Cartoon character behavior makes the story too unbelievable for my tastes.
