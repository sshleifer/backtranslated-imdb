The director tries to be Kuentin Tarantino, the screenwriters are trying to be Tennessee Villiams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faie Dunavai, the late James Coburn trying to be Orson Velles, Michael Rooker trying to be Gene Hackman, Marie Tyler Moore is trying to be Faie Dunavai (older version ), Cameron Diaz is trying to get out of the box as fast as possible, do not ask Joanne Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader are trying to conceal their shame with these shitty things. It provides an endless, insignificant dialogue and very little action. Tulsa is a city with beautiful lifts, art deco by the church of Bruce Goff and a beautiful, spacious villa by Frank Lloyd Vright. Visit Tulsa, do not watch this movie. It does not do justice to the site.
