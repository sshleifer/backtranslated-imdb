It was a disappointment - nothing of the originality of the nuance. The British seem to be able to make a really disturbing film without any top hysteria of the American version. The original series also combines nasty stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and adjustments. I watched the series many times and I'm still fascinated. Just another bad adaptation modeled on the terrible adaptation of "Cracker". Join BBC BBC or BBC Canada and follow the pleasures such as Vaking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Vitness, and Judge John Deed. See the original Touching Evil, and then look for "Vire in the Blood" for more than the truly underestimated, elegant performance of Robson Green. Hollywood should look at this actor!
