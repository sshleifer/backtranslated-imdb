The worst movie I've seen for some time. An interesting first half with an interesting, solid dialogue among the suspicious characters in the late night bar.

However, time is precious (as the director himself has noticed in his introduction) and I'm really sorry that I spent time on the other half of this. film, especially female leadership.
