Gainiggers from Outer Space is a short side film about black, gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble across the Earth. Being gay, their goal is to have a male universe in which all people are gay. Therefore, when they discover women or "female creatures" that live on Earth, they are initially terrified; in the end, they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and free the male population. \ t However, below is a little substance. As another reviewer pointed out, there are several jokes except the names of characters (eg ArmInAss); I think I once laughed at one little gay joke. I think I quickly realized the meaning of the film, sat in the bad science fiction, but after that I had enough; I always wanted the film to end (and that's a short film!). Not brilliant or especially well written.
