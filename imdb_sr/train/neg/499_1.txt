The horror channel broadcasts erotic soft pornographic films every day from 10 am to 4 am, but their 'fear' factor is very limited, if at all. In fact, I am sure I will come across a lottery worth millions more than anything that this channel can offer. Bloodthirsty water dance deserves special attention because I feel an indisputably low channel full of loves. I can not even tell you how bad this movie is, but for the purpose of completing the minimum of 10 rows requested by this site, I will at least run it. First, the title is wrong and does not resemble the action on the screen. In fact, the movie could also be called "toothbrush" or "wallpaper" for anything that has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpapers. No miles around the blood and worse there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they made two different films here by mistake. Suitable title would be: "The Horny Italian Count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us in 90 minutes." Yes, it fits better. The act is terrible, and the dubbing is terrible, and this guy who plays Seimour was almost equally wooden in his walk as he was in his character .... foolish. The only rescue grace of this film is a small but somewhat interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sexual scenes, and an added attraction in that every female character gets his kit. Bonus. Otherwise, do not lead a wide birth away from this. There is no vampire, no dance, no scenes of brutal or creepy nature, and there are no ways on God's land that I will ever again look at this again. There is no word about lies, this film could put a life movement.
