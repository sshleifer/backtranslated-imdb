I do not know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he got his name in the title, but maybe he should not have been bothered. As the other commentator mentioned, there is not enough horror or eroticism to bring fans of any genre. The action is unsurpassable, Sade's sequences are free, and most of the acting is so-so. Englund worked with poor material, and Zoe Trilling has a really great bottom, but none is enough to carry this movie. This is a tape. Grade: F
