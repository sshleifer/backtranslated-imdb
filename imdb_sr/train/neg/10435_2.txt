With these people playing so many shots, they use old shots, and trample animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were shot on a created set with actors, what should we believe? The old film of the countries is beautiful, but the abuse of animals and the degradation of indigenous people is painful to watch in these films. I know that in these old films racism is fine, but there is more to lose this credibility. Listed as flyers, they never flown their planes, Martin Johnson was a former Vaudevilian, used friends like Jack London for financial gain while hiding from royalties, refusing the apparent depression of his wife, using it as a sweet foundation, all this makes them films unbearable. They were not the first to travel to these countries, or the first to write about them. He was as good as a director and photographer, but that's all.
