Odd slasher film producer Charles Band. At the time of the greatest success of the Full Moon, Band said that he would never make "real killer movies" because he felt that small puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the film better - people who kill each other are so real and less entertaining. It's a beautiful philosophy and a shame that Band, destroying Full Moon studio through possible bad jobs, so desperate for a home theater profit that he started doing exactly what they loved Blockbuster and that's why he sacrificed creativity and originality. The team behind this also worked on Delta Delta Die! and 'The Birth of Birth' - both are equally gentle by the standards of the full moon. Debbie Rochon is in the usual top form here as a beginner in a gang of guys and guys who decide to invent a story about a 'killer club'. She - as it is obvious - does everything she can to join, and then there is a panic, because it was not a true story and stupid Mrs. Rooson believed in it, and now everyone will have to run around to be covered with blood and maybe They are killing or maybe not. The choice is here and as far as this film is concerned, your ... it is not advisable, but it is not even quite bad.
