Disbursement is a game that plays in this drama and the revenge action is canceled with an absurd story that sets the stage for a fireworks coming later. Why would a man get into the trophy of a ruthless mafia boss in a gangster house with suspicious supporters all over? Why would an unhappy woman encourage the attention of a complete stranger and expect her to take her with her and leave her husband and boredom to live happily ever after in life with her new love? Surely, the hero, Kevin Costner, here, certainly expected the reaction of the husband of the cuckold that the film gives an excuse to abandon meaningless killing and violence. Anthony Kuinn, the great actor who was, surely deserved better, and Madeleine Stove is a tragic figure who is suffering greatly as she cares for her prince. Stove is fine, but its Spanish emphasis does not work. Quizzes of smaller players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo, and Salli Kirkland is interesting as a pink rock star.
