What I discovered so interesting for this movie - I've seen the full version of 4 hours, as it's unusually impartial. For a film about two very charismatic men - Castro and Chea, who are engaged in a huge political struggle, almost completely deprived of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who are at best a second-rate actor, with a little high voice) have no drama or depth and basically they descend to Castro by saying Che: go here, go there, do it and that , without explanation as to what effect or use this action will have. Odder still has an actor in the acting team who has the necessary power to play Castra - Joakuim de Almeida, but he is turned aside to a lesser extent in the second half. Without the tension or passion you would expect to release these people and their followers, the film will become a film about a hairy epic film about hairy, bearded men who go through the jungle and shout and shoot for no special purpose or end. Several criticisms I read were admired by the director Steven Soderbergh, while the actors were almost completely ignored. (One actually spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than about the plot or actors or the fact that he is completely in Spanish with subtitles in English.) This is weird, strange that can be done after Soderbergh was only paid for film, and b) this is nothing more than a competent job, with an unwavering support for JFK Oliver Stone in a black and white work camera when Che visits New York. If you can imagine Red's director Andrea McLaglin instead of Varren Beattie, you would get an idea of ​​the boring competence of this film.
