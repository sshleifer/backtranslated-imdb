I'll be open to the point. This movie is not good at all. The movie part hated my acting, script, story, direction and almost all editing. Amanda Peet has proven she can play because she was the highlight of "Whole Nine Yards." So, he had to avoid this ten-foot film. However, the infantile part of me considered this film to be very funny. If you can forget about how much production quality is lower, and if you think the hams are funny, then it should be fine. And for those of you who can not get off your stand, that's your choice. My inner child did not die, and I laughed. Even then, only 3 out of ten, because as a movie, it really stinks.
