Quite typical for Swedish films of this type. Strange that the acting was so bad, these actors usually give a good idea. Casting is bad, it made you expect something (I will not tell you what). The main character was horrible ... I do not know where it is. In any case, stay away from this and go see "Day of the Treasures Vagen" instead, this is the Swedish action in which the prime minister is.
