I watched the Malaysian movie "Boeing Boeing" from 1985 (which is probably inspired by an English film of the same name) that has long ago been back. The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it was said in a pathetic way, classic jokes replaced by routine ones in normal Hindi films (probably the director did it to fit the taste of the Hindus audience) ... br /> I did not see the English original. But he really enjoyed the Malaialam film (which was made by Priiadarshan himself), which was then a comedy that shared the party. Of course, the performance of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who played the role of chefs) was so natural and spontaneous. I'm probably overwhelmed by a Malayalam film that can not tolerate even less flaw in his remake of Hindu. But I still feel that Akshai Kumar and John Abraham have exaggerated. Paresh Raval has done a decent job - but he does not even come close to Sukumari. But all in all, if you compare it with other recent Hindi comedies.
