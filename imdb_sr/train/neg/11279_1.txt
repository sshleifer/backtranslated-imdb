The words really can not describe how bad this movie is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least it had some nice shots and occasionally a good beard that caresses a moment there and prevents you from kissing. This is just funny! A terrible letter, a bad direction, a terrible acting, and you know what? I can not think of any single thing I would recommend except for the fact that it is not too long. If you want 100 minutes of fun, book with a dentist and work with a root canal - much better and much better value for money (assuming you need it!). By the way, I need to get 10 lines of text to complete this review - please do not buy this movie. IT'S HORRIBLE!
