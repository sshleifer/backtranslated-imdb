Looks like this show was good. Kira Sedgvick is OK actress and I love the police series, but somewhere in production this program was very wrong. First, the writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did it EVERY TIME !!!!! It makes it boring. The main character is incredibly unpleasant and incredible in any way. I know they wanted to be tough, but it means stupid and bad. Crimes are uninteresting and pale, and it's just crap. As stated above, I hate it ... </ br>> All in all, this was a great disappointment and very bad ...
