A really horrible movie. However, this is expected. Clearly low budget: nothing innovative, actress (if you can call what "acting") always has roles with nudity in the scene of a shower, a man in a suit with reptiles almost like a predator, a cab in the woods, etc. But there are some points to buy. Although the story is not new, in most cases, there are several parts that are not coming back. First of all, a black man does not die when he is attacked (for the first time) and he is not even one of the first to die. But that's a little bit. More importantly, there is a very interesting turn about Kat's experiments and Vesa and Steve I have not seen. When Steve told Kata to know what she did, I believed in what he said and what Kat responded. But when the creature discovered who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised with the novelty of revelation. It could be because of my lack of experience with the genre, or because it's really a smart turn. In any case, the movie is pretty bad and do not look at it if there is something better ... Unless you are in the mood for a cheap movie.
