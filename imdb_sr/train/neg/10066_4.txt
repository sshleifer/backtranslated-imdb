I recently watched it again and there is another version that is shorter in 1999. I have the feeling that it is the same movie, but I would like to know the difference. One is Japanese and no dots short can all make sense. Ohthervise why vote for the same movie twice? Prof Ivi was pretty boring. She sounded as though she had almost fallen asleep, without any expression with a few lines she had. It was comfortable enough, but there was not much at all. The collector (who after Lugia, he has no plan to destroy the world) and the usual characters who try to stop him as he tries to catch Lugi causes a lot of destruction. Pokemon films that follow are somewhat better, deokis (poke 7) is excellent, no. Almost here.
