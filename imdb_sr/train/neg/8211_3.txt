I read the book "7 Years in Tibet" by Heinrich Harrer and I was fascinated. then I immediately grabbed the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember when I first saw him 98, and somehow I liked it. Well, I looked at him again in full knowledge of the book on which he was based. and I soon realized that it was said that everything was wrong: When they entered Lhasa, people began to stagger their mouths, and Thevlis and Pitt had the impression that it was the way to be greeted in Tibet , so they are greeted ... in a book that Harrer explains, pushing the language is a sign of absolute modesty and loyalty in Tibet and they can do that in front of the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for these two Europeans! not only the mother, but also the Dalai Lama himself wore spectacles in public. in the book Harrer mentions that no one in Tibet had worn glasses by that time (I'm sorry I forgot the reason, but he is also explained in the book). and what about Mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala before the young "living buddhas" ?? childish ... and the tailor made Harrer and Aufschnaiter Tibetan clothes not European designer suits! why were so many events that really happened eliminated from the story, just to fill the time with a fictitious love interest (a female tailor ...) which is completely unimportant? just like the whole story of Harrers' son, rolf. the book does not mention any word about him or even any member of the Harrer family. but that was fine for me because "7 Years in Tibet" is not a book about the people who broke up. about Tibet. I am very disappointed with this "adaptation" of the famous book. and I bet Heinrich Harrer was also ... 3 stars, just for the cinema.
