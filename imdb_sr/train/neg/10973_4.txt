If you liked Pulp Fiction and handheld cameras, you should love this movie. I liked the strange story (although I think "Pulp Fiction" was the most preoccupied film of "The English Patient") and that characters are unreal but interesting. It is not "On the coast" or "Citizen Kane" and is burdened with European pretentiousness. But the worst part is a handheld camera. It's so confusing and boring that I was desperately waiting for the film to end. I do not know why the new directors think that this way of shooting is so great. If you are prone to nausea, move away, a hand-held camera will torture you for about 10 minutes.
