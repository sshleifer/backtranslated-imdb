This film is a disgrace to the main franchise league. I live in Minnesota, and I can not even believe they've dismissed Cleveland. (Yes, I realized at that time the true Indians were pretty good, and the Gemini took their place at the bottom of the US League, but they are still consistent.) In any case, I loved the first Major League, I loved the other, and he always expected a third, when the Indians would finally go to the series. You can not tell me that it was not a plan after the end of another movie. What happened? In any case, if your true fan of the original Major League did a favor to you and do not watch this trash.
