Obviously you will offer enough money to the actor to do anything. I'm not sure how much John Ris-Daves got, but most of the money he earned should go to his fans as an apology that even connects with such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse than the effects of B films from the 1950s and the acting of other actors was even worse. In terms of acting, children in my opinion gave the second best performance. English was terribly stressed and I think that no one could even speak English, but only remembered that these words should sound, instead of remembering the script and trying to make their character "life" and real.
