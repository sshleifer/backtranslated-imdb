This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only has no acting skills, but the scenario is incredibly shallow and chrome. You actually hear a serious dialogue that reads: "I love you more." "I do not like you anymore." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half an hour, I could not stand it anymore. Its "southern charm" simply does not work and it's really very boring; her attempts to break the humor falls and she delivers lines as if she reads the script right away from the page. Poor Luke Wilson. Did he read the script before he agreed to do it, or fell on Pope Joe (Jessica's father and producer of the movie) who promised big wages? Hope he knows better now than to sign up in another movie like this one. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate to see a painful expression on his face as he suffers from a bad dialogue. Also, I think the previous commentator who gave this film 8 out of 10 was probably or somehow included in the movie or hired by Pope Joe to get the film a better rating. Nobody in a healthy mind would find this film about. Jessica has a lot of money, is not it? Maybe you buy some acting lessons?
