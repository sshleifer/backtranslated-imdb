I think this is one of the worst works by Kenneth Branagh Shakespeare. After so much effort as there was a lot of nothing, etc. I thought this was bad. The actors were weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but my biggest insult was that they broke up with Bard's work and cut out some of the performances they put into the music / dance sequences. Just do not work Shakespeare and then you mess with the show. I'm sorry, but that's wrong. I love someone like Cole Porter just like the next person, but Jesus, do not mess with Shakespeare. Skip this and watch Prosper's books if you want to see Shakespeare's stunning adaptation.
