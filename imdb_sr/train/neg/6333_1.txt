I actually saw this movie in the theater. As soon as I gave my money to the cashier, she said two words I never heard in a theater, before or after: "No return!" As soon as I heard those words, I just had to say hello with my money and go home. But no, stupid, I went in and watched the movie. This film did not laugh at anyone at the theater. Not once. Not even inadvertently! Basically, we sat there in astonished silence. Every ten minutes, someone would shout: "This movie IS SATISFIED!" The audience applauded with enthusiasm, and then sat in an astonished, boring silence for another ten minutes.
