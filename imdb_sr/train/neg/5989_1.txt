Wow, I paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this movie in the cinema. I do not believe I lost my time. The acting is at least decent and the special effects are rough. It is the worst scenario in the history of some extremely unpleasant quotes I have ever heard in my life. I swear God is "swept up" better than this. Madonna needs to win Oscars in comparison with these guys. I want an hour and a half of my life back. Frankly, people do not see it, even the child would consider this film to be an insult to their intelligence. I found this film very strange in the fact that it was hard to say who is more wooden, it's about here about real dolls. Please do not waste time on this movie that you will regret.
