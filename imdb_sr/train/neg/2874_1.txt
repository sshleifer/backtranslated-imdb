This film begins pretty silly when a woman is tied and mentally tortured. There is a male full nakedness, dead parts of animals, dogs licking nipples, and the female loses control of the bladder. All shot in gray color. Effective, but a bit too much. Then we move on to see the young men of the BTK killer, as well as the present and its history of crime. The tension is completely psychological, and the scene of the killer entering the homes of their victims and talking to them lasts for a long time and it is creepy. We do not see a fancy or a good picture here, it looks like it was shot by a home camera. It does not look terrifying, but in some way looking at the criminal to hire his victims for some time before he kills them, that's pretty unusual and cold. This movie has no drama, really. There are some scenes of a cop, but there is no excitement in finding the killer. There are not many ports in this story. This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of insanity. Unfortunately, the film is filled with real recordings of slaughterhouses. She is scattered through the film and comes suddenly over and over again. Sometimes you do not know that it's coming and you do not have enough time to look aside. And I have to refuse it. I am for horror films of a low budget, but I do not tolerate the suffering of animals. It was unnecessary, exaggerated and came without warning. I'm glad that Lionsgate issues things that nobody else knows, but they were supposed to convey this film or to change animals. Keep away from this trash.
