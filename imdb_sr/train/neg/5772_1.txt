I just have to add, in case someone reads this and has not yet fully understood it. These other reviewers do not joke, this is really the worst color film you'll likely see. When the film started, I could not believe that something like this was made for the world to see it. They do not just say it when they say they look like a home movie. It really is. As the "director" took a family hi8 camcorder (before DV camera and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound equipment, etc.), did not grab some decent actors and went to shoot the movie. There are no scenarios, I just make up while it's gone. When I watched it, it was on a mono TV, so I only have one sound channel (to the left of the right speaker). At first I thought that I wronged it wrong. The film was silent until someone spoke for a few minutes. I got up and switched to another channel, and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects, but then I could not hear the dialogue. They recorded sound on different damned channels! I mean, there are movies that can be fun to watch, so bad they are good. I'm not sure this is one of those. I mean, I admit I was a film producer. And watching a bad movie just makes you want to go out there and prove that you can do it better, you know. But watching this made me regret the one who made it. As bad as they are, the actors are the only good thing about it. I thought that the fish was hot and that she was disappointed in the shortness of her bathing scene. Little T and A from it would get a score from zero to perhaps 3 or 4. But, no, no. If you want to make a movie, but it's a shit, throw some free nakedness. He worked for Roger Corman.
