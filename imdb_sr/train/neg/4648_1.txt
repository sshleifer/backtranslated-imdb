This is a bad B movie that turns into a mockumentary. The pornographic documentary in the movie has almost the same time and dialogue screen as any other character. It completely destroyed any "documentary feeling" that they might have wanted to create. The fact that the movie is not actually mockumentaries is the least of his problems. The film is not funny. The film is not sexy. The film has nothing to say about porn business. It's not even cute. While there is simulated sex, the amount of nudity is mild for R film. One day somebody will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry. That's not it.
