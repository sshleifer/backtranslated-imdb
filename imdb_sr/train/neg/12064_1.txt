This is one of the most horrible horror films I've ever seen, because it's absolutely horrible, John Carradine has a very limited time on the screen. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus I could see two turns in the end that are miles away! A great environment and a dreadful house would definitely help not be so damn bored, and there is not one character that would be the root for any of them, plus I hope it will be the way to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion . When John Carradine finally comes to an end, it's a pretty good scene, but it's already too late, and the only time on the screen he had was in flashback, plus the only real bloody scene in a movie is when a character gets his face ruined by Bee, because he was pretty bloody. I got it in the DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really exaggerates in my opinion, plus it's lucky that it's included in the set I bought, otherwise I would throw it out of the window! This is one of the saddest horror movies I've ever seen, because it's absolutely divine, John Carradine has a very limited time on the screen, and I say I avoid it as a plague! You do not want to go through torture. The Directorate is absolutely terrible! Carl Monson works absolutely awful! work here, making everything look cheap, spending his potential to create a nasty atmosphere and just holding the film at an incredibly boring pace. The acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene, but the other then he is barely in the movie, not in the flashback scene. (Carradine Ruled !!). Merri Anders is terribly acting here like Laura, because she did not persuade me at all. Ivey Bethune is fine, and a bit scary, but also exaggerated, but she had a terrible smile at the end. The rest of the actors, I did not pay too much attention because I had a lot of problems with that, but they were all very bad. All in all, avoid this, it's not worth agonizing! BOMB of 5
