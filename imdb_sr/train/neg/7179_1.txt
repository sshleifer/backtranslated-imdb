No matter how much his "message" is benevolent - this film is a terrible venture - a terrible acting, a lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try to piss - he's bad. Watching DVD accessories and the way the camera is watched - it just absorbs - it's like being at the center of attention. He's a bad actor - it reminds me of another arrogant director - Eric Schaffer. Something as Carr portrayed this movie in the City Youth Centers and Nev Age Churches - where the damaged people who only seek reinforcements and attentive talk about how the film touched them, and maybe it did - but as a film it's changeable, predictable and sappy .
