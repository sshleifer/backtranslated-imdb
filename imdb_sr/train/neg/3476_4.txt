I liked it, I really am. Please, do not think I'm an idiot, but I must admit I enjoyed this movie. I expected it to be shit, it's bullshit, but sometimes it's okay to relax and watch a shitty movie that does not have to concentrate too much on it, right? I did not expect any hidden meanings or morals, and it was not, but it does not matter because I was just watching it for fun and it was fun for me. Such films are the reason why Ben Stillers (apologizing "something about Marie") and Vince Vaughns (whatever you write his last name, I could not check) have a job. It's okay to watch a shit movie as long as you do not expect too much of it, and I'll stand alone, run, maybe running, but not drive because I do not have a car, in Blockbuster Video, or even the Elections, and rent a bunch of these toilet humor movies and stay in one night looking at them. Good afternoon, readers. P. If you do not say that this comment helped you, then I do not like you, if you say that it helped then God bless you, you will go to heaven.
