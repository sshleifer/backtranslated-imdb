The film is almost funny, and Debbie Reinolds and Shellei Vinters associate themselves as mothers of convicted murderers. With a horrible note after the trial, the two women are joining and leaving NI in California to open a dance and dance studio for girls like Shirley Temple. From the beginning, it becomes clear that Reinolds made a mistake when he was led by Vinters in California. Vinters play a deeply religious woman who seems increasingly distant from her rocker. To make things worse, women who live together receive threatening phone calls. Reynolds, who puts on a blue wig, soon saw the rich father of one of her students, well-run Denis Viver. Sister Alma, to whom Vinters is a faithful listener. The film really belongs to Shellei Vinters. It is difficult here and it seems that weight has made it even better. Winters always worked well in roles that tested her nerves. The end is evil and who can forget the Vinters on the piano to hit this totally crazy look?
