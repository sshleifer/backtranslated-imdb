When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Like "The Harvei Girls". It's not. It was a pudding that was cooked, hit the kitchen ceiling, and it was erected and tiled together. No music, not periodics, but incredibly incredible. and home. So we think it will be a historical intergenerational story. And that's for a short time. Then it turns into a story about the cold-blooded Stanley's fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead against him? Well, why else? As we learned in the strange sequence of flashbacks that Stanvick had told us, she once thought she could inherit some money (for her sisters, as well as for her, of course) with a mate. She hit someone who she assumed was a farmer, who was actually lawyer Brent. , is - well, you know ... They had a quick marriage, and for a very short time when they were together, he was inaugurated. One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Ioung, played by Gig Young. The other sister is trying to take him. Etc., Etc. It's a breakthrough, unbreakable mess - worked well enough, but without bits of logic or conviction.
