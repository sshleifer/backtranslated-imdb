This film seems to have been disconnected from many films that have dealt with the same topic in the past. Let the future viewer be warned that "Art Heist" does not add any genre. Director Brian Goeres has no idea what to do with the film. Villiam Baldwin reappears in movies, and frankly, she is wondering if she has a great agent, or is it that directors and producers love his unusual movie. a dull look, complimented by that strange hairstyle in most of his films. The only good movie in which he appeared was "Squid and Whale", in which he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his lead lady, is not much better; There is no chemistry between Mrs. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. Film that can be seen at your own risk of viewers.
