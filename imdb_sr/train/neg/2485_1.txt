There's only one use for a movie like Bulletproof: it reminds you how bad it can be. We often watch films that we describe as "pretty dreadful" or "not very good," but then you come across a movie like this one and you can see that, although all of these other films are not "good", they are not as stinky as they are in any way Bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds while digging for DVD transmitters at our local store to fulfill the obligation (ie, give me a gift). It could have been a random discovery, but it was not: it's so completely clich√©, so badly written, so badly directed, so bad that I'm surprised that everyone involved was not arrested and sent for 10 years. God, it's terrible. I suspected it was about 30 seconds, but it's continued because sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are so bad that they can be comfortable. This is not one of them. It's just bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I will throw it in the bucket.
