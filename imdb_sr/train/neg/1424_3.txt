The film has a good start to the portrait of an interesting and powerful Shannon Lee and introduces two very sympathetic characters through the first half. But later something happens and all the sudden Shannon turns into this stupid girl with a direct face, and the film is lost in its context. In the second half, there is a lack of any charisma and full of cliches, bad acting, terrible plots and even worse coordination of the stuntman. Not to mention the terrible actors they chose for the Chechen mobster band. The "Game of Death 2" was bad and clovnified by Bruce, but his daughter is at the top, making even more shame of himself than a double person. then Bruce Lee played. I honestly believe that she can do much better than this and I hope she will participate in better production for the next time. If you are a true fan of the core and do not worry about the quality go ahead and watch this movie. Personally I rejoiced, but I was disappointed terribly.
