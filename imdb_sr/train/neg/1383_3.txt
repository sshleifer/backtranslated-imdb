Lame, a cliched superhero action movie. I had great hopes in this movie, and the shareholder's shareholder from HK Buddy Cop is the one I do not despise, but very rarely I see the story as banal and funny as it was. It could be forgiven, as it is always in such films, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it is not. The action carries with it the trademark and the superiority of the HK action, but this does not involve much, rude, and in fact it is often completely incoherent (perhaps because of re-editing for the American edition, but it shows signs in many places of the patchwork). I was very disappointed.
