There was the truth in this film. I recall one story reported 15 to 20 years ago when the fishermen found the body in the water and they decided not to report it until the road was over. I also remember that they were accused of interfering with a corpse (or some such charge). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. Spectators outside Australia must think that we live in a country full of rapists and serial killings. Volf Creek and this film would encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of a simple plan. But how much one of the best Australian films ever, as someone claimed, can not be so generous. So, I would not try to look at him anymore.
