Once I thought that "Stone Age" is the worst movie ever made ... I made a mistake. "Hobbobs" surpassed him in every way that I could imagine, not a few. In the "Stone Age" I hated the characters. In "Hobgoblins" I hated actors ... and all the others who participated in the creation of this crime. I will not include the teaser on this movie, I'm not that cruel. I could not subject such innocent people like you. In fact, any discussion about the action relating to this film is meaningless and humiliating. The words I would use to describe this film are: insipid, asinine, and ingenuous. In conclusion, please do not watch this movie. I beg you, from one movie lover to another ... no, from one man to another, PLEASE. Because of your common sense and intellect, do not look at it. Destroy all the copies you encounter.
