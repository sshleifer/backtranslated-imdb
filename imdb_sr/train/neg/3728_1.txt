As some other comments show, this movie could scare you when you're a little kid. (And that's probably all for what it's good.) However, if you are older, this film does only one thing: shit of a major - and thus I do not mean acting, soundtrack, cutting or s. th. So. I'm just talking about a "plot" (if you can call it that way). SPOILERS before ------------------------ <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not want to give any more spoilers than if it's necessary (if after reading this text you really want to watch this movie), but if you have completed any school, this is just a great insult to your intelligence. When I looked at this, I was stunned most of the time, because what was going on was just so stupid. Association) <br /> <br /> -> we just have to believe that it is evil. is it evil at all? If so: why is it evil? - A sign of evil in the form of tattoos -> There is no need to impose this on people, so why, the damn (without the boring) worked? - We call Christ in our heart only as a service on the hands. saying that stupid prayer. So ... just say that prayer before the ascension and you are saved - no matter what?! So, grade 1/10
