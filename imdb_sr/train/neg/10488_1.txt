Elvis left the building and was lucky he did not have to look at this barren stink. Scenes by script Joel Zvick finds ways to make another fun scenario infertile. Filled with infertile death, brazen gai characteristics and hack scarves, this film is more desperate than fun. This is a film that makes one hope Kim Basinger follows Doris Dai in early retirement. Let's remember how she was (talented), not what she became. David Leisure, delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are all lost talents here. Zvick finds a way to minimize his talents at every step. The guy playing Elvis sounds more like Gomer than King. The only really good role is the young girl who plays Basinger as a prey. She really looks like she's actually pretty good. The only other reason to watch this movie is to ask Tom Hanks. Kameya is not so funny, but at least not painful. It should be asked whether Zvick has incriminating pictures of Hanks or something that would make him do this film.
