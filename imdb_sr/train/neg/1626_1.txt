This film recently appeared on local television in South Africa and I thought I would warn even those who enjoy watching B-rated bad films (what I do) that it's not even fun. The parcel refers to a couple who visits a country house. There are some strangers and .... The problem is that most of the film, apparently recorded in the early 1970s, consists of extremely wide footage of people walking, in real time and terribly slowly, from A to B. In extreme situations and the expected payment of blood and blood is never happening. I'm really curious - how many people have been watching this from start to finish?
