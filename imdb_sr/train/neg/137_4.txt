It's easy to see why Scari Movie creators could easily fake these movies about teenagers. They are so incredibly formulated. And if Valentine was released a year earlier, I'm sure they would set up this movie - if they found some real original material that would distinguish it from Screams, I know what you did last summer, and Urban Legends. Valentine does not offer anything new in this genre, except for the better than the usual ending which, of course, leaves plenty of room for the inevitable continuation. As always, a masked psychotic killer catches a bunch of beautiful young women, killing friends of the protagonist, one by one, in a typical style above. A lot of T & A exhibitions, without character development, bad acting, and excessive elaborate bloodshed. What I can not handle in relation to such films is to surrender like 'who did it?' '. The point is, this is not because the motive was discovered only when the killer discovers, and tells the main character who all his friends are now killed. Usually something that has never been clear at all during the film (for example, the Fisherman's Uncle's Uncle's main character has kicked off his father's dog). All those who live during the film are "suspects", but they are more "red virgins" than the suspects. As we all know, at the moment the main character manages an incredible escape and kills an ill-fated psycho-killer after the motive has been revealed. Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway) *************** Valentine's motive is not revealed, but more, left for you to consider that the film did not completely conclude in the typical '. teen slash 'vai. The issue is only part solved, and the main killer's goal may or may not be fulfilled by the survival of bloodshed and the killing of almost all. Will the killer want more, or are the demons really victorious? It has not yet made Valentine a good movie, but has simply saved him from being as bad as usual, which is still not counted for much. Anyone who thinks about making another movie in that direction, please do not. The originality is so important and it is difficult to see any originality that emerges from this genre.
