I did not have background knowledge about this movie before I bought it, but it sounded cool, and I wanted to see the real kick-butt Viking movie for some time ... unfortunately, this movie was not what I was looking for. I was hoping for the best, but instead, it was boring Nordic soap opera that seemed to be getting too long, despite the fact that it lasted for 84 minutes. The premise of the film is sufficiently intriguing: it is the Viking warrior who defies his God, and Odin is so angry that he curses the son of a warrior, called Barek, until his death and rebirth as Berserker. This guy from Barek is then forced to live a frustrated, crazy, and violent life after his life. The film was shot quite competently, with rich cinema and quasi-good performances by actors, but again, I found myself bored and questioned when this lead would end. Film makers had the opportunity to make something fun and semi-unique, but they dropped the ball. Maybe it could have been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics inserted into, such as free nakedness and much worse ... I mean, we're talking about "Berserkers" here, right? The Vikings should have been bad enough, which with all the rape and looting, would not the Berserkers be even more extreme? All in all, unless you are the fan of The Ioung and Restless (etc.) or you are, in fact, crazy Berserker who loves only torture, I would probably quit this stupid celluloid.
