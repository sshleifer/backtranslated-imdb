I'm usually disappointed with online movies. Even the flick that attracts big actors is usually broken by TV people. However, this is the worst of the worst. The scenario is bad and acting, especially Tracei Pollan is disgusting. I went to see the gig of my childhood school and I behaved better. Pollan behaves as if reading a script while speaking. When trying to express fear, anger or sadness, it is extremely hollow. Because of the overall quality of production, it was difficult for me to take it seriously. If you choose courage, just be prepared for a great disappointment. Terrible things will not scare you, sad things will not saden you, romance will not make you feel warm and unclear and you will probably be upset as I myself wanted to come to an end. "The First Die" speaks a lot about this film.
