Designed to aggravate (or entertain) any intelligent person who respects himself. If the director's intention was that the viewer does not like the title character, then that would be fine, but I know that there is no such thing as a Hollywood director who would criticize the US pro-Marxist movement of the 60's, especially not the 70's director. There is so much idiotic dialogue going on, that I sometimes wondered if I actually watch comedy. Would not you be guilty of what you thought was a satire? so the naive film appears. Spacek was in her part of the left-handed films that led me to the obvious, inevitable conclusion that the redheaded peasant was one of those Hollywood's liberal morons. But, I mean, are not they all? Nice tits, but with ** t for the brain.
