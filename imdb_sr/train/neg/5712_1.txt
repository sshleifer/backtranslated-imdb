After I went through this crowd, my husband and I wondered if it was actually the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a movie. It was voluntary and formal. But the American propaganda you threw in the face during the film proves - disappointing - it's people's work. Call me as a conspiracy theorist, but I quote: "We need to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it" looks like a way to justify actions like an invasion of Iraq, etc. To use the Declaration of Independence as a pricing token "with the right face, both me and my husband asked if the entire actress took over Valium before shooting each scene. "Thinking" behind every turn and the new "track" is really funny and impossible to follow. And there is also the bonus page of the puzzle of misogyny, while Dr. Whatever-Her-Name has been drawn by all involved for "never closes." She's obviously in the movie just for the looks, but they felt the need to slap a "doctor". the title of her character to give her a bit of gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, "Have you never shut up?" and the camera turns to her, looking into the hands, as if she were a child. It's really grotesque. The only benefit that this film had was that it was so incredibly bad to get out of it. It's really scary that most people who watch a movie with us seem to enjoy it. Creepi ....
