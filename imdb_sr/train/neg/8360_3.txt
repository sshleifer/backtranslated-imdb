What about this movie? It is in color! Has an impressive underwater photo! It has rhythmic music in the background that works well in time! So, 3 out of 10! Sometimes music is accelerating! Especially when a shark or bad people are about to move! Sometimes it is slowed down! As if transmitting to the audience, there will be time for sympathy! As Others bite dust! It's as if the "Spaghetti Western" has a lot of similarities! It is not that the Italians can not produce quality productions! There was a series of television films titled "Octopus", a number from about 1 to 7, shown on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s on conflicts of mafia type! And they were great! But, unfortunately, you will not find it here! I assumed it was made in the 1960s! Unfortunately, it has become obsolete for 20 years, as evidenced by the funeral scene at the end! Then there was a sharp bite of fast shark that makes red dust constantly appear in bluish waters! In the midst of all this, either in a fight in the bar room or in the observation of the latest bloody demolition of the sea side by a mercilessly hungry shark, another hero looks through his glasses of little concern, as if he was boring in his own ruthless role amid lack of much evidence of complication or development of any character! At least a delayed hero indicates short-term concern for his ex-wife! But, of course, even if music does not awaken our knowledge, we have a malicious sound in the voices of criminals, as if we wanted to encourage us to show another dark work! And close to the end, someone thought of a reversal! Just when we thought it was all foreseeable! But stay with us, people, because you may find another craft! If you watch carefully! Yes, more or less, warm your heart! Follow the tips of the hero and take some beers! This will make your watching "Night Sharks" more enjoyable! Then you will be ready for something like "007" movie to make it easy to return to reality when this is over!
