Please do not let the cover of this movie deceive you. And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh: that's not it. I'll usually go to stupid things if it's funny, but this was stupid that stupid that almost (or maybe done) made me stupid. The quality of the film is better than manual, but not much, and it is quite possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 button on the Casio keyboard. These problems should never be detectors of watching a horror movie, but add this incredible (cry) cast, and you have a real humdinger. The story is about a guy who invites his friends to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend. He also called for his lady to strike at his office. On the way there they encounter a woman in distress, whom they then call other girls. Staying in the cabin involves sex and nudity, and soon all the panties in the crowd are soon gone when a girl disappears and strange things appear in the house. From there (audience) and morons, actors, trying to understand what is happening and soon begin to dislike each other. All in all, I think I've done it sounds better than it is. The main struggle with this film is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the action is fictitious, the performance is bad, and I do not know the motivation. Once more, when it was farewell, it was the least funny, but unfortunately, it was not. The ending is just a craft in which no one would think it's easy because if you really return the movie would not make sense anyway. Please, do not let this review prevent you from seeing the film about interference. (Voah, my nose rose 8 inches.)
