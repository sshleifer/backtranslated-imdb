While the original raises the intellect, this cheap remake is designed exclusively to shock the sensibility. Instead of tangled complications, this so-called thriller only emphasizes sudden and seemingly random changes in stories that only serve to further degrade it with every bizarre development. Worst of all, replacing the original spicy dialogue is a overturned container full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving behind a sharp, but uninteresting taste. There were promises - an unfulfilled promise. The prospect that Michael Kane will take the Keller-Sullivan diploma, similar to Patti Duke, is certainly intriguing. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor only deteriorated his reputation, first by accepting the role in this terribly re-scripted nonsense, and then turning to a performance that only looks competent in comparison with the amateur exaggerations of Jude Lion. > If you did not see the classic original, overlook his pictures and tricks. Hunt him, watch and enjoy the story and the way. As for remake, download this insult to the original.
