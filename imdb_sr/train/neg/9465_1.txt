From acting, directing, screenwriter and artistic direction, this film is just completely mischievous and money would be better spent on shoes for mine victims. When we become so sad that they have to fill the child's film with sexual insinuations to keep the parents' attention. Dr. Suess is currently rolling in the grave, what with the "dirty ho" "SHIT". "and false erection of the scene etc. etc. His shameful how to trade in the name of Suess for parents to bring their children into the curses to try for teenagers and a few sad parents who will not watch a movie with their child if there is no T & A. Poohlep greed and greed. Compare this with classic children's movies and we can get an upsetting look at the world it's turning into. These guys should be holding MTV videos. votes, because it's perfect 10 outside of me (unless the family of the director)
