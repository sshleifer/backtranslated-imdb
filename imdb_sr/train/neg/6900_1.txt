I was just sitting in the theater, boring, and I wanted to leave the movie. The action is simple. Samoan boys destroy weddings. So they have to bring dates to get to the wedding. What I was most bothered with was the so-called rough jokes ... They were very unimaginable, clich√©ped and thrown into your face to make you enter an already boring movie. The acting was below the average and I felt that this film only continued to deal with something other than a bunch of unusual jokes and predictable complications. All in all, one of the worst movies I've seen since 2006, an optional, bad acting, just ugly. Well, thank God, my friend shouted at me. Avoid.
