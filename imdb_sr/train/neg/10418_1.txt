This is not a children's movie game! This film is like "bad acidic travel" for children under 5 years of age. "Why did this rabbit bleed from his mouth" or "Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?" (And that was not the worst). We stopped him for about half an hour, but the damage was done. Intensely morbid, aggressive, violent. Fortunately, he finally forgot about the whole unfortunate thing. Whoever decides that this film should be sold to children, should be prosecuted. ... (Let me censor, my conscience is pure.)
