While exploring some caves with her wife, a doctor bites a bat that causes some alarming side effects ... Occasionally a dreadful atmosphere and some decent (although underneath) effects of makeup do not save the seal of horror from sub-paralysis about man-station-creature. The Bat People aka Lives Night would suffer because of their pointless story that is cluttered and uncomfortable in the rhythm. It seems that the shop never goes so far and the film never offers an explanation for what is happening, or even a satisfactory conclusion to all of this. The actors are quite central in their performances. However, I give the film a few points for its boring thematic song and nice location for recording. The work of late Winston Stone is also quite good, but here they do not get a lot of shop windows. Missed opportunity for sure. Definitely one of the smaller people-beings is moving there. 1/2 of ****
