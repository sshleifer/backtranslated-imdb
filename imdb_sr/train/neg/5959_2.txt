Спойлер. Which three words guarantee you a horrible movie? Cheap Canadian Production. MOZAK perfectly suits those words. Terrible script, idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every BAD movie lover. Horror is hilarious. The post-production team seems to have given up. What makes the MOUNTAIW is wonderful in the second half, actually trying to be good! Can a little genius and consistency preserve what is already a joke? It's about Christmas. Mother and daughter kill one of the happiest villains ever. A day later, a rebel teenager suffocated enough to send him to psychiatric analysis. Some children did it, whom would you believe? What starts as funny becomes bored and fatigued by the end when it can try to be serious. The child can not be scared by the scary moments. MOZAK is too funny to try to be rough. The Institute for Psychological Research is bigger than the big production plants! Our ugly criminal and his group get credit for pulling some of the worst performances I've ever seen. The audience's discretion is highly recommended.
