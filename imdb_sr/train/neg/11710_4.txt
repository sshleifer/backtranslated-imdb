There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or the producer: actress Nichole Hiltz. She is a performance in this slow and wild incredible story of revenge. Directed by Simon Gornik, the movie is played by Joice Hiser as a released woman who decides to revenge her wife. Oh, but not in a conventional way. She is planning a total guerrilla war and recruiting a bad girlfriend Nichole Hiltz as her weapon of choice. He wants Nichole (as well as Tuesday) to approach his former (handsome but boring Stephan Jenkins, who needs to keep up with music) to embarrass him and destroy his life. David DeLuise is good in a few short moments, and the former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennison is virtually nothing else but frowning. Hiltz, on the other hand, appears at various times as sexy and playful, and then evil and cunning. She also handles well with vulnerable and "maybe a little psychotic". It is also very hot (although there are no bad bits) so you can understand how it can reach any type of target. But in this film, the performance is somehow futile, which is simply not entertaining enough or interesting enough to be recommended.
