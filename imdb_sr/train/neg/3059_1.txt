All right, I recently got the chance to rent this and watch Santa Claus wrestling martense. Although the children in SCCTM were much more sadistic, I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse film. As a Spanish task in Spanish, we all had to look at it. I'll tell you, usually when watching a movie, we all talk and eat food, but not for this movie. Everyone held open jaws, wondering what evil Mr. Pitch would do next. Would Merlin help Santa ?! Or would his robot rooms come and save the day? I suggest renting it because it's the biggest piece of garbage I've ever seen and I love it for that. : D
