There were some low moments in my life when I was confused and depressed. One of them was sitting through rancid aluminum. The warning signs were there. There is no premier (even the stars did not want to attend) and there are no reviews in magazines. The only reason I went through the film was the hope that I might sleep. Nothing in the movie has been explained. The story was idiotic. I cheered at one moment when it seemed that the film was being shot, and then to my growing despair, it was discovered that he was not actually killed by alleviating my joy. I sincerely hope that everyone involved in the film is hanged for this crime. There were some positive aspects, mostly unintentional moments of humor. For example, a scene in which the main character, for an unknown reason, feels the need to be freed manually in the toilet cabinet while telling the person in the next cabin to put his fingers in his ears. My words can not explain the anger I feel, so I will conclude this. Bad aluminum: for saddle, nonsense and regressives who just want to be troubled.
