As a southern baptizer, it hurts me to give a below-average grade to an open Christian film. It's certainly not that much that I want to dissuade filmmakers from a genre that is very poorly exploited. Nevertheless, I have to honestly say that "Love Will" is typically a low-budget, low-key, self-conscious Christian film. The action is predictable, acting central (I am kindly), and editing is terrible. As a television movie, he may have been a bit above average, but as a feature film, he leaves much to desire. Try the guys. You must have a movie about the true Christians in it somewhere. May I suggest that you contact G. K. Chestertonu or C. S. Levis for some inspiration?
