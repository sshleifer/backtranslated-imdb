A stupid and just strange movie about a kid who becomes traumatized when he finds out Santa is not real (???). He grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who makes lists of people who are inferior or fine. One Christmas he breaks and starts to kill the naughty people - dressed like Santa Claus, of course. Boring and just a bad movie of Santa Claus killer. If you're looking for blood, it's not here. Only a few murders are shown and they are not as bloody with VERY fake effects. Most of the films contain only Brandon Maggerty who talks to himself and slowly crazy. The scenario is banal, the acting is terrible and leads to the end that stunned me on TV. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and look at it again to make sure I did not hallucinate! A really poor end. If you want a frightening Christmas movie "Black Christmas" (the original version of the 70's - NOT horrible remake). Avoid this at any cost.
