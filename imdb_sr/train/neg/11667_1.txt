This film was a great disappointment in the direction, intellectual niveau, complication and the way in which he dealt with his theme, painting. It's a slow-motion movie, like the episode of the Wonder Iears, with an astonishing lack of depth. It also fails to transfer its message in a convincing way. Access to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to unclear and subjective terms as "beauty". According to the creators of this film, 'beauty' can be experienced only in the bustling landscape painting in the style of Bob-Ross. A good art to this film can be achieved by applying the basic theory of colors in elementary schools and a lot of feelings. In parts, the film is offensive, e.g. at one point it is stated (on the contrary, it is celebrated by dancing on tables) that mentally handicapped people are not able to have emotions or to express them through painting, their works by definition are worthless "shit" (quote). I do not understand how the movie could get such a high rating, so again, so far, not many people rated it, and they chose only very high or very low ratings.
