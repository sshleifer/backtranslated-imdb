I did not really know what was going on in this movie when I went to the theater to see it (the hype about Satanism etc. etc.). Because the trailers in the last movie I saw seemed quite interesting. Oh dear, Roman Catholic mythology? It's not my idea of ​​good fear and sincerity, I just felt like watching a really good, frightening movie, and not some loosely drawn religious fars trying to get cheap excitement by letting some fish be cursed every few minutes! <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll try to keep away from the spoiler (!), but it was strange to me that an atheist, who receives a series of crowns from the deceased priest, suddenly ended with Christ's wounds (no assumptions assumed) deeply religious?) I mean, she hangs out with losers, for losing things, she behaves like a typical rebel and the rest, and here she shows the wounds of Jesus Christ? Come on! Scenes of her crucified, head thrown back, screaming, blood everywhere, became quite tired after seeing him dozens of times. It was neither intimidating nor scary, just repulsive. However, it became pretty painful to watch - these scratches were very unpleasant ... CONCLUSION: If your Catholic, you do not see it. If you do not, you can not see it yet.
