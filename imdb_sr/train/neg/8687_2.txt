When jokes against the bush are really easy to set up, such a show would make sure there is something extra. When it's an extra children's version of political figures who are joking about the future they do not yet have, it's just a senseless nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush have gone well, but Dick Chenei mumbles mainly. There is also Condoleezza Rice, who is in love with Bush for some reason, and Donald Rumsfeld, who is not so much like Donald Rumsfeld at all. Democratic characters rarely give their names, so it's a mystery who could be who except Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Episodes have coherent stories, but this is not enough to make this sink.
