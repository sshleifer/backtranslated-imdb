What is the disadvantage is that a potentially incredible and refreshing story with a low key succeeds in catching your attention at the beginning, then gradually lowering you further and further until you leave a scratch on your puzzling head until it reaches its final conclusion. . Unfortunately, that's what happened to me until the end of the VHITE NOISE. Not guilty of Michael Keaton; it was my pleasure to see him again as a star of a whole new film, perhaps a little wrinkled, but still able to give a strong and honest performance. As a man whose wife has recently died, he becomes obsessed with his wandering spirit in the afterlife (it's not a new idea), it's obvious that she's calling through this funky electric fuzz business you see on the television screen when nothing is broadcast. The idea that ghosts communicate through radio waves are called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are many people who really believe in it, so I will not comment anything I mean, or on them. Let me just say that I am a suspender of disbelief when it comes to buying fantastic movies like this one, but what I can not tolerate is not an understanding of what was to happen, which is where I was stranded when the loans they finally started rolling. It's a lot static. Occasionally there are films like this that completely confuse me, but if the film fails to make me clear, I think it's the fault of the filmmakers, and not mine (unless I watched while I was too tired to I would focus or something like that). Well, for WHITE BACK I was awake, bright eyes and shrubs - so guess who's guilty?
