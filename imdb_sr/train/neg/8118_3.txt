Well, EIEboi, I have to say that it pleases me to the end, when someone extracts me and tries to ridicule me, especially when it's someone who is intelligent like you. My favorite part of your post was "But not a big bang - a good guy here, kimosabe. I suggest you keep the movie with lots of bang bang." Good words! I love action movies, especially if they are well-made, but I also love movies that do not have much action, as long as they are well-made. I'm sorry, but Secrets and Lies does not fit into this category and it's just a very bad movie. I really do not see many non-American movies, so I may have been spoiled and I did not realize how bad foreign films really were when I saw Secrets and lies. Perhaps if I judge foreign films on some other standard, one day I can see that secrets and lies could be one of the highest films on the IMDB. Hmm ... If it's true, it's very scary.
