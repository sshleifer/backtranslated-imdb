I like to see the 30s and 40s in the movie. I love Salma Haiek. I was more than willing to love this picture. but . . . BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! No, sir, nothing good about this. The only entertainment aspect for me was the character of Colin Farrell, who is an unsecured writer and this script, despite the fact that he deals with the juicy theme of racism, accesses the audience in the ABC Afterschool Special mode. The only person who did not sound like he was "playing" Sutherland, and his number was a bit. There was an approach to tired complications.
