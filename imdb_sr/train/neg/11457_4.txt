OK. I know that the John-Hughes of the 1980s were unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this film were fairly low. However, after we pass through this shit, there is one key thing that I can 'Looks like I'm getting out of my head: I just spent through the movie Rob Love from the 80's, those who did not have nudity and only the hints of sex in them. The acting is terrible, the characters are boring and flat, the portrait of Okford's absolute insult, and the rowing scenes are incredible, ineffective and inaccurate. Fetish, there's really no reason to see this one.
