I expected a documentary focusing on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead, I watched a man who was ruining the fact that his grandfather lost the empire of tobacco from the Duke family. And it lasted and lasted. If the family is g. McElvee has overcome the Dukes, I doubt that Mr. McElvee would have any problems with fatalities caused by tobacco-related illnesses. I grew up close to the area where the g. I expected more than McEvee's continuous focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the consequences for the state economy with stricter regulation of the tobacco industry. The nebulous references to the movie "Bright Leaves" are not in place - So what if Garry Cooper played the grandfather of Mr. McElvee? Can the viewer understand the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by showing old movie clips of a fictionalized film? I'm not.
