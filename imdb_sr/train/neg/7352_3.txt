This was not funny in 1972. Now it's not funny. Unlike many other people, I will not hit a movie because it's incredibly sexist - I quote that I enjoyed it, or rather enjoyed it in the reaction it provokes in boring people on the computer - that's because It's badly written and acting. The only truly unforgettable character is Blakey, whom the British will recognize for 25 years, because for a long time she was favorite with the impressionists. Avoid. <br /> <br />
