I watched anime, but I'm not a furious fan; and I do not read manga. I say this because many of the reviewers who make the leaves of this movie seem to have this background. I saw a "cantarion", and although this is not a masterpiece of any part of the imagination, I made me pick up "Shinobi", especially as it seems that everyone likes it. Well, I watched him this afternoon, and I was struggling to continue to watch. Yes, it is very beautiful - slow water scenes, leaves on trees, even CGI flickering eyes - magnificent. I loved hawks, costumes, even some fighting scenes, but all in all it was boring like dirt. It seemed as if someone had taken "Romeo and Juliet" - the translation even mentions that they are lovers of the stars - and have been thrown into some "X-men" for good measure. Two of the characters separated the powers of VVolverin - a guy dressed in a bear's bear had his claws and the gray guy had the ability to cure. Then you have a girl who has a poisonous kiss - that's Poison Ivi (from Batman). Why do these women give such nonsense? Poison girl shows her leg and then loves you to death. Man, that's a great power for you. And the other girl can create bugs from this yellow dust rubbing her hands. The other woman, one of the lovers, turned into a hypnotic look. Wow. I kind of got to the end of the film, by passing it quickly, and I saw a little more tragedy than I expected. Some people compare this to "Flying Duck House" and "Hero". Do not make that mistake. They can share similar endings, but this is where the similarities end. "Shinobi" was made by amateurs - other films were made by experienced filmmakers. I would say that you avoid this film unless you are 12 to 18 years old.
