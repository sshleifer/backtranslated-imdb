The genre of volleyball is unusually ignored by most screenwriters. Luckily, highly respected director Nelson McCormick brought us the second best volleyball film of all time (rated lower than Side Out and higher than, well, umm). However, do not allow the title of this movie to be taken away from you. Kill Shot stars and coming star What a modern day Sherlock Holmes. Using such high technology as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy, who is able to help FBI agents in tracking a man who has not committed any obvious crime. While there are other actors in the film, including short stories, Denise Richards, a gay black man and an absurdly ugly and boring girl, who wears this movie himself. Every movie admirer like The Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot.
