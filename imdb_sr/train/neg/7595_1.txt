"Ask the Dust" looked intriguing from the trailer, and we especially love all the actors. Unfortunately, the film was not sufficiently impressive to be considered a drama and it was not funny enough to be a comedy. It seemed to be practically saturated and there was no fun effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this to improve, my wife and I left, valuing that we no longer waste time on such nonsense. It was simply not interesting, moving, funny, or artistic. It looks like it was written, produced and directed by a high school student; Worse, it was such a shameful loss of otherwise talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
