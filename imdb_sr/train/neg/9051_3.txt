I was so excited when I discovered that this was available! I was barely waiting to see him. What a loss of energy! It's like the CD Rarity is your favorite band that you found on the back of your local music store. Being a fan of a hard core, you were sure it was a valuable discovery. But when you heard it, it became clear why your dogs never made it to the right album. This DVD is recommended only for "finisher" who must have everything Linch did. "Sik Men Getting Sick" is visually interesting, but short and repetitive. Lynch's later work, "Grandma", is simply an immature job. It's tiring and looks like a student film. But it was in the '70s ... It is only interesting if you hope to psychoanalize the director. But you can see, in short, the seeds of some of its trademarks and sounds. "The Alpahabet" is forgotten (Not really! I can not remember this!) "Amputee" is meaningless. "Cowboy and French" is simply stupid. "Lumiere" is the only one in the group. Without dialogue, Linch speaks to a disturbing story that is comparable to his best work. I had to watch this a couple of times. But it takes less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth the effort to rent or buy a DVD.
