To be honest, I am surprised by the positive voices this film has received. The film only retreats through its 81-minute lifespan, and the audience must go through the whole path. In fact, there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives decent performance. She gave her a fairly pathetic dialogue and acted well. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's boyfriend from family relationships), on the other hand, is a pretty rough clock. I suppose the climax of his performance is a witness that the guy lying on the beach wears tiger-colored pieces ... give me some rest. Also, Valentin gives us a coarse and pathetic picture of a vampire who suffers a day that misses the day (to see a more convincing performance of the vampire who suffers, see Denise Duff in Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4). The film is moving so slowly that it is only positively accentuated and, to be honest, Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. This film can only be honestly recommended to the hard fans of Charlie Spradling (which I am, and I still had a tough time watching him!).
