As much as I can gently, I honestly believe that this film is a waste of time. I did not find him as a 'warm, emotionally satisfying' movie that others worked. I was bored, with music that distracted the attention from the film. The story was skinny, the characters were outdone, and the pawn in the direction of movement. Fooei. line minimum. There is really nothing more to say and shortness is important, but IMDb has its own minima, so here it goes. cartoonish homophobia. Aging, an angry mentor turns out to drink a lot and teaches very little. Conflict arises. Although I do not think this is a spoiler, I added a warning in case someone feels that much information is too much. Basically, the film was boring and pretentious. Losing my time. Frankly, I do not understand what a small crowd looks like, mostly on this website, about the transcendent quality of this movie. I think it's really worth avoiding. But, as Dennis Miller said, "Maybe I'm wrong."
