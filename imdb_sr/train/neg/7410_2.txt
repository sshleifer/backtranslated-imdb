I love horror movies that give a true mystery, such as the "quiet hill" (which I found to be pretty good, but still, I'm missing something) and movies that keep you guessing, which is one of those movies. Initially, the film begins with very good tension and creates a good starting point for a good horror scene, but then it just crashes down the hill and from there it goes only faster and faster. First I mentioned a quiet hill for the reason that I can see many "stolen" themes from that movie ... All in all, I would say, watch the quiet hill instead of this, better, its more terrible, it has much more uncertainty, and the end is much better .. And best of all, you will not feel like I am with this .. This is just one of those "I love this movie, so I will make it again in my bad version" kinda movie .. Oh and more one thing ... Lord ... in a horror movie ... it's like trying to scare a child with a caring bear that throbs me and I love you forever " ana on his stomach.
