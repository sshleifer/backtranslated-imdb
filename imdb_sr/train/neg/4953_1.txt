I've never commented on IMDb before, but I think I have to watch Batman animation. His absolute stupidity! Varner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early nineties, so what the hell are they trying to mess with the winning formula? I want to write a letter of complaint to the UK. The original animation was dark and imaginary, just as Batman was supposed to be. The VB had to mess this up with some triumph Batman of the Future. Now they produce this mess. Joker does not resemble Joker from DC comics. DC should be sued. I invite everyone who agrees with me to send e-mails or write VBs and use the power of people to return the original formula
