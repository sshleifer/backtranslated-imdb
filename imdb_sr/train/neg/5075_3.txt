The animation was good, the pictures were good, although not completely original, however, the story was too long, too confusing, and at the top dramatic. After about an hour I could not wait to finish. With so many characters who have nothing to contribute and point out the elements that come from either where or go anywhere, this film was not a single movie at all and would have been better than short films or two films. If you like this typical story, you may like it, but frankly, I was disappointed with many more creative stories that actually have some sort of message. Rent a Miiazaki movie and watch it twice, you'll get a lot more than that.
