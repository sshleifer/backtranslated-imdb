I and my friend rented this movie because it sounded very good. We were wrong. The first act ... wow ... the act was the worst, the effects were very bad, it seemed like a movie made by a kid. The action was pretty good, but it was done. The most destructive films were the actors. The main guy was the worst actor ever ... it's a shame that I even call him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie is that it was so bad that it was funny ... so if you want a good laugh you see ... but Besides ... stay away from this one. I usually love movies from the B list and the like, but this ... I do not know how it went even to put it on the video ... this is the worst I've ever seen ... and I've seen some bad ones.
