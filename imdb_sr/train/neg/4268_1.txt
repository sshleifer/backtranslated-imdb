I remembered these performances since I was a kid. I could not remember too much about it, only a few small things about the characters. For some reason, I remembered it was really intense. it was also really very early in the morning in PA. Finally, after a long look at the net, I found an episode. first episode without reduction. Criminei! This performance was so terrible. it is obvious that he was just made to show the children that they are playing a laser tag and have a good time. the show opens up the buzz if he tells his mother "my names are not Christopher, I'm the li li li-PHOTON VARRIOR !!!!!" then we are forced to watch kids play the "labels" song "foot loose". and not just a little, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. Oh yes, and as if they can not get worse, you can not even see the laser beams from their rifles. as if they were just running around to the whole song. Later, after the bugs go up to space or wherever, they have bullshit with a Phil Collins song laser gun "su-su-sued". Ah, believe me, you do not want to know the rest. what can I say ...... LIGHT SHINES !!!!!!!!!!!
