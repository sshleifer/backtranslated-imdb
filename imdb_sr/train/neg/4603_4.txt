I was drunk when I could not see this when she was shown at the Philli Film Festival last year, so when I saw that she was going to be on the cable tonight, I put it on a reminder as soon as I could. Was it worth the wait? Well, let's go back, like I had yet to give you a plot. Sean Cravlei is a young man who does not know what kind of way he is in his life. Enter Duke (George Vendt) who introduces him to his boss Rai (Danny Baldwin). One night, Rai totally rang, asks Sean to leave the guy Sean's escort. And from there it continues. What brings me to the question asked. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the construction was pretty good and George Vendt stole the movie for me. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it's not nearly so violent as I said I believed in cinema movie somewhere, the time when the ball was not just dropped, but it was also tried in the other direction. I know exactly where this happened, but I can not say I do not spoil the movie. But it is unnecessary to say that it happened. And the ending does not save the movie. Poor Stuart Gordon can not be as good as "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". My Rating: C Where I saw it: Shovtime Ektreme Eie Candi: Kari Vuhrer shows her to-do in one fantasy, and then in the next more thats and that pans down and ... OH MY GOD MY EYES MY EYES !!!!!
