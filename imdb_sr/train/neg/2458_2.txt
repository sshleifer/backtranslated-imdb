I can not describe how this film is horrible. Am I the only one who finds the way he's being animated here totally disgusting? People from Rohan look 100% fake with their poorly colored hair, which does not even come close to what the actors look like. The Orcs looked terrible. Why does Gandalf walk with a bad lashing? Why can not I say things right? Saruman is not Aruman. There was something else that sounded like the terrible pronunciation * of * Tolkien's characters. Everyone was pleased that the studio that made this pulled out the plug from the sequence, it was just a horrible terrible adaptation. Go look at the hobbit for a better drawing of Tolkien's work. Even the cartoon version of ROTK is better than this dribbling. 2/10
