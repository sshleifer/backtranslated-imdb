I'm still trying to decide if it's really the worst movie I've ever seen - A very disturbing problem with this movie is what the learned scientists are interviewing, but their footage is edited to look like it supports the ideas of many BSers who inhabit this film. The BS to signal the interview ratio is about ten thousand at one - in the end, it seems that respondents say: "We want you to _think_ !!", but they themselves are lazy to do simple research on things that claim As a fact. If you feel that you are open and want to expand your awareness, be open enough to read some real books on quantum theory: "Einstein's Universe," Nigel Calder (thin volume, not a challenge), "Cosmic code ", Heinz Pagels. If you can not read the book, do not complain to the reviewers that they are "open". To repeat, this film is incredibly bad. Do you know what a really good movie is about to question the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Smart, sexy, challenging.
