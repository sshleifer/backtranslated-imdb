The Crater Lake Meteor Lake (hence our title), waking up Plesiosaur, who continues to enjoy the peasant population (in California, the capital of the world.) There are bad movies, and then there is "The Crater Lake Monster ", which somehow managed to escape MST3K. Alongside the grid, the decent stop-motion beast, and much more, this is a horrible piece of low budget exploitation from the 1970s / monster movie. While the film is to blame for many crimes, the greatest is Arnie and Mitch, two disgusting peasants who serve as our comedic relief. They interfere, struggle for "bando music", watch women and behave like pathetic excuses of humanity. The characters are so bad that they should be considered a crime against humanity.
