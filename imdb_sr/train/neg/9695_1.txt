WARNING! Do not even watch this movie in any form. It's not worth the download from the Internet. Every little pornography has more substance than this lost piece of celluloid. The so-called filmmakers obviously have no idea how to make a movie. They could not say a good joke to save their lives. It's an insult to any human being. If you are looking for a fun filled movie - go look somewhere else. We hope this g. Slow / painful death and NEVER again filming a movie. In fact, it's even a waste of time to NOTHING NOW about this shit, so I'll immediately stop and watch a good movie.
