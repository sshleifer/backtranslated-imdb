I watched the whole movie, waited and waited for something really to happen. Maybe it's my fault that I expected evil and horror instead of psychology? Is it strange to say about the Oedipus myth: I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose a musical theater with him? I did not understand why some elements of the plot were even present: why the building was on the floor, why it was a large staircase with the perfect place to fall to their ruin if no one actually did it, why would he have scenes at all with his father at work, why you have such a nice kitchen if you eat only to eat, why would the boy want to be baptized, and parents are the ones who will resist instead of the other way around. I see a lot of good reviews for this movie ... is my taste corrupted by going up with the b-movies of the 70's and the old sci fi fi shifts?
