Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and it deservedly, so I'm happy to see any of their films. Basically, the man in the horn fabric is the fourth that cracked, and soon Ollie will crash with all the sounds of the horns. He was sitting at home with Stan beside him, he needed silence, and the doctor (James Finlaison) said he was coming to check Ollie. Having realized that the plumbing and electricity were blurred by a repair specialist, the doctor comes to review, and after some tests, he recommends drinking goat's milk and getting some sea air in the ocean. After Stan takes a trumpet, hanging out of the window through a telephone cable and a traffic accident, he and Ollie to the port for renting a boat. They put a boat on the dock trying to milk the goat, and Stan brought his trumpet! In the meantime, the front page of the newspaper reads that killer Nick Grainger - escaped convict (Richard Cramer) escaped, and he sneaked into the children's boat while they were sleeping, and the goat chewed through the rope, going to the sea. In the morning, see their location, and the killer goes out looking for something to eat, and he sees Stan and Ollie making false food, e.g. a spaghetti rope, a cheese soap, a bacon belt, a meatball sponge, and he forces them to eat it. When Ollie begins to squash, Stan strikes a trumpet to help, and Ollie's anger forces him to kill the killer, and it continues until the police arrive, only to put Ollie's anger in jail. There were the smallest moments of comedy, but it's not a big black-and-white film. "Well, here's another nice mess you've got me in!" was number 60 for 100 years, 100 citations, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on the comedian. Okay!
