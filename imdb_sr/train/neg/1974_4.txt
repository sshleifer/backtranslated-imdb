Some people have made the point of dissing this film because they are questioning the credibility of black people in the Old West, Asian people in the West, or women with weapons in the old West. Grab and read the book. There were plenty of Asian (Chinese), there were plenty of black people (liberators) and everyone outside the class of gentiles had access to weapons; that's the second change you know. As for the use of the modern language, none of those people from Western nostalgia spoke about the language used in accordance with the presented epoch. The Americans had different accents, they used different expressions, spoke at a very different pace and used many words and phrases that would today be unrecognizable. Do not blame historical inaccuracy due to the fact that you simply did not dig up. Be honest Be honest. Maybe you are embarrassed with what you see.
