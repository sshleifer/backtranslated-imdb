Unless you are a evangelical Christian, then become Egyptian and avoid the biblical plague. Terrible - why oh IMDb lists the most favorable reviews on the top of the list - it's because of one of these that I just spent ending what started as a good evening on this clap. The plots of land began to be strong enough - I was drawn into a movie and I was interested in the point where the Bible preached took over. What a loss. This film made me so angry that I first registered with IMDb just to complain about it - I hope I will save someone else's evening. /> <br /> Hai - like a Christian act on my side ;-)
