This film smells. I do not think I've ever seen a movie that's so burdened with shock. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super-flat and the acting was mild. This could have been a good movie. I think he rely solely on grotesque paintings. Usually I can deal with graphic scenes and human taboos, but it seemed to me that Miike had shot it for shooting. Only one bad movie. Just watching this movie, nothing can be fun if you do not fascinate exhaustion with explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self-indulgence, mistreatment of parents and brothers and faecal dispersion. I think I just sold the movie to many of you, but I thought when I said it smelled. He has succeeded in other films, but I think you'd better look at someone stealing.
