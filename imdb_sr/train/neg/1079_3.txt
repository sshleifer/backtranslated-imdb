I feel like I'm the only kid in a city that was upset with Branag's performance. He is a good actor for most accounts, but he simply could not draw South accent. I mean, it was sad. It was like trying too hard to be Iank. One of the previous reviewers posed the question why actors in the United States are not thrown into this film. I confirm that idea. It's great when actors / actors want to expand their horizons, but one more thing is to do too much to make the performance tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he's such a good director ... Well, I really do not want to break Branagh because of his absolutely disgusting accent. Everyone deserves to get screwed up there and there. But it's hard to see something so disturbing that you'd rather quench the chicken bone or eat a bite full of shit than sit through a Chocolate Man.
