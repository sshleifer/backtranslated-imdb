For the local audience I see how to greet this film. For outsiders, without interest, it did not make sense. The Germans were shown as incompetent, and the Russians were heroes. The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and disturbing. As a young woman could "like" a lieutenant to look at him, they are nonsense. As she could, as mentioned at the end of the film, she never married only because of this fall out of me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots, and this is illustrated in a swamp in the swamp. Several hundred German soldiers advanced, pushing the Russians into a swamp. So the Russians hid, and the Germans stopped at the edge of the swamp and only stood and listened. I suppose they did not want to get boots, but I'm sure a cop would order 20 or 30 men in the water to search the wetland. But that would end the story. Also, the Germans entered the barn where the Russians hid in the attic and did not try to shoot on the roof. In the worst case, a soldier would threw a bomb into the loft and would not rise to the ladder to inspect it. I wonder why? You knew this little band would disappear, and that it was nothing that pulled the heart out.
