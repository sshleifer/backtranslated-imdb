Not close to the original. It's a very accurate copy that does not bring anything new in the story. But the direction is very bad. Basinger is weak - without good direction. Baldwin is simply just another league in comparison with McKueen. I watched him out of curiosity, as a great fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost B movie with second-rate acting and directing. I was not even disappointed, I just do not know what they were trying to do. This remake does not try to play with the original material, it's not a gift and really miss one really good actor of his time. br /> This is a complete waste of time. Save 2 hours or look at the original (again :)))
