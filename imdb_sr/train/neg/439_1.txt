Just a stiff opening up of the infinitely better "Murder, She wrote", it's absolutely unbelievable that this badly-written garbage lasted for eight years. I'm sure most of the people who watched this insecure shit in their sixties and seventies and just got involved because they had nothing better to do, or simply remembered their star from old Dick Van Dick Shaw. Van Dike, who only had a decent career in the sixties, was never an actor at all, and was already too old to play the Doctor when the series started in 1993. the result of many years of smoking and heavy drinks. His son without talent, Barry, a wooden actor who was rarely in something that did not involve his father, plays his son in the series.
