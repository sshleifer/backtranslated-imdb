I have to say that I was very curious when I was watching this film, and this was considered a notorious catastrophe when it was released by the 20th Century Fox in 1970. I had to see what made this film so bad. Since I see him, I think I have my answers. Although I will say that it does for curious watching, the acting, direction and script are so ridiculously bad that the supposed satire is completely lacking. It seems Rakel Velch is trying to carry a movie, but after the introductory sequence of the sex change operation, the film goes so far downhill that it can not cope with this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner certainly does not help, while he lyrices and writes on the screen, sometimes he seems to be wondering what he's doing there. Rek Reed refuses as Miron, Mirina alter ego, and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene. Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Favcett plays a dumb blond; she certainly worked convincingly in this role. But, of course, the most important role was Mae West. A look at a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face that caused sexual allusions seemed more appropriate for a horror movie. I do not want to put this in person; but in this film nobody comes out well. The direction seems so unprotected and non-existent, that the film is not only bad but also boring. Throw away some old movie footage of old stars, and the film becomes even more disconnected. To everyone, everyone who enjoyed this, and I was glad to have at least seen it, but Mira Breckenridge looks like a disaster that has always been known since the beginning.
