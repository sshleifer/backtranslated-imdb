The most inconvenient moment in this film is when Brady Corbet says, "You're cursed," near the end of the movie. I practically died. I'm still not sure why the screenwriters put that line. Was it supposed to create a romance? Because it almost got me sick. The rest of the scenarios were almost as bad. I never liked the original Thunderbirds, but the Thunderbirds movie had the potential to do a lot of things. This film does not. Had it not had a large Thunderbirds card, it would have been placed directly on TV, or in a can of post-production. Maybe even before. As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the voices turn and play Busted's song 'Thunderbirds are go'. I can not believe I lost $ 7 watching this through pai-per-viev.
