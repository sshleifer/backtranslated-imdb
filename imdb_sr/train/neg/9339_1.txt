I thought they should call this film "Whites" instead of "Visa". Great ... the kind of movie that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so obsessed and think that their lives are so important ... give me a break. Such a white lily Glenn Close was the most ethnical character in it, this movie cried for someone who would come and steal it ... and so they presented themselves, got this, a character who even escaped from the others. cast (I thought it was an albino at first) that should be Welsh! I'm still trying to figure out that accent! Intellectually unfair ... this movie is a movie that is able to deceive so many people to think it's worth it because it has something more ambitious. It's better to fill the MI5-10 theater than with these pretentious shit ... it must have been a better game because you can not fall off the floor.
