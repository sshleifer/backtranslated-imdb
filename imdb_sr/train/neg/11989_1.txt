This film bundle sets a new standard for bad film creativity. Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance of a very badly created character in a malicious film, creating a net effect of a very bad film. The main goal of the film is that a boyfriend's temporary trip to the Canadian wilderness after surviving a solo plane crash allows an unhappy adolescent to cope with his pain to discover his mother's extramarital affair. Unfortunately, it turns into a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two particularly hockey scenes that involve fighting with a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid just sits in the street somewhere in the pot dreaming the entire movie (and what it is nightmare!). In addition, despite the rumors of some reviewers about the visibility of the film's family, there are several scenes that are not suitable for very young children or family viewing, including a deadly pilot's underwater figure with apparently exploded eyes. All in all, an awful film that nobody should be subjected to, and even less innocent children.
