It's not a "female movie" but a movie for the gang. One of the worst films ever made by a male director about a woman. Director Andy McKai simply does not know a woman. Tops of bad taste, American humor style humor, raw story, meaningless, ungrounded story, discarded characters. Vulgar fantasies appeared on the screen. It's offensive and definitely not funny. I wonder how three good actors have accepted to take part in it.
