OK, my girlfriend and I rented a DVD and about 30 minutes into the movie, we exchanged a lot of "ehhh, what's the matter, and more importantly, do I care to find out what ends with" views and decisions or we were needed medication to be interested in a "complication" or just ending the pain there and then watching something else. We decided for this second. Very much I liked "But I'm a cheerleader", but Mango Kiss is too stupid and surreal for my taste, I'm sorry! I definitely prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better than Chocolate", "Fucking Amal", "Memories Memories" and "Fire". -Sorcia
