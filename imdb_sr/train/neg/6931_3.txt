A stupid rich man around 1800 wants to visit a nearby psychiatric asylum to see how the famous doctor cares for his patients. Despite the initial hostile response, he will soon be cordially invited and visit a good doctor. And, as the doctor tells him, he speaks and talks and speaks !!! And while he speaks, there and there they fight there and do not do anything particularly productive. Although there are some actions here (and some of them are very disturbing), it's incredible how much it's boring and cerebral - the lack of life and energy, which is unusual for a horrible movie. Even a guy who thinks he's chicken and dresses like he gets pretty tired. The further the tour leads the visitor, it becomes more disturbing until you finally realize that prisoners have taken over the hospital and tortured their guards. Again, in spite of this reversal, the film is incredibly lifeless in many places - especially when it's moving very slowly because a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people just wandering around the set. Only when workers from asylum who are in a prison cell, starving, the film has any real impact. Given this plot, it's definitely hard to imagine it's boring, but people who made this cheap exploitative movie have! Now with the same complication and competent writing, acting and directing, this could have been an interesting and valuable movie. original TV shows "Star Trek"! You know, the one with "Lord Gartra - Lord of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock are captured by this madman and his crazy followers. Nageness here and there and involves the scene of rape, so be warned - it's not for children. Actually, given how much the film is worthless, it's not for everyone! However, with the version included in the "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics", the press is so incredibly bad that it's hard to see all this meat because the print is so dark.
