This is a film that shows that mood and music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Certainly, the viewer was treated with a number of fine scenes in Los Angeles for the thirties - I particularly liked to see the carts approaching the tunnel and the tram raising on the slope - but in some way this good cinema is winning because it creates the mood that "something will happen "- and nothing. The scenario also continues to turn into a complication or an action or trauma - and it does not repeat itself. Not even the delivery (I suppose) of the subject of the film, the essential defect of the characters. The main actors, both too beautiful for their roles, did not convey any repression or agony, and the script did not expose us to anyone. Now, Donald Sutherland? This is another story. His character was so modern, so perfectly lit that I wanted the camera to follow him.
