It's pretty generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGEIMAN, although this is not really BOOGEIMAN promoted on the DVD cover and we all know it! It drove me out. But this film is something else. To be directed by a guy who has been working for a long time and directed many films, it seems to have been filmed on a VHS camcorder of 10 years! Story and acting are horrible! David Hess, and you let me down. After playing one of the most horrifying villains in film history, have you resorted to this? The story and the acting, however, could be forgiven, if someone took the time to make the video look kind of professionally. There are many videos on video movies that do not look like this or at least not so obvious that it takes your attention to the movie. I can not say it's the worst movie ever, because I could not go through the whole movie, but it's definitely close.
