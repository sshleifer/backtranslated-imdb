Anyone who really had the ability to sit through this movie and go to feel like a good movie does not appreciate quality movies. This film was an insult to watch, the direction was in the high school as well as the movie class. The Witch Project Blair had a better cinematography, and I hate that move with passion! The story had the potential to be a very intense, very good movie, but it fell from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the film. Someone mentioned that this film about the child's imagination, that's all good and good. But they could still do better things with these scenarios than they did. I mean, come on, the Indian in the store. Did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the whole story of an Indian spirit called Vendigo? What they mention to an employee in the store and she by chance says that there is nobody but me who works here, so you think that there is a horrible scenario of ghosts, but then she only pays for the idol and we forget about the little kid who sees him. . It was so miserable that it went beyond pathetic. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis at the hospital, but also to the OMG feeling !!! Why am I, hell, wasting my time watching this !! This is a move I recommend NOT to watch, there are definitely better quality movies that will not offend your intelligence! Thank God I never had to pay to see this movie, I would ask my money back! For those who have enjoyed this film easily ... it is very sad that you lowered the standards to this level of film creativity to say that it was a good movie.
