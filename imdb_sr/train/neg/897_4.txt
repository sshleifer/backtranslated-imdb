Two years before he wrote and directed "Arthur", Steve Gordon had a smaller hit with his script for this stupid comedy for Henry Winkler, then TV "The Fonz". In the fifties of the last century (and a versatile jerk) college pulls out and gets married without looking for employment on the horizon; to bring the end to the end, turns to the glittering world of wrestling, becoming at the end of the "magnificent George" as a celebrity person. Converting a cute Winkler into a disgusting madness probably sounded like an interesting idea at that time (and a sure way to separate him from a television alter), but jokes and situations are often wrong and evil, set up pretty neglected director Carl Reiner. Especially crude is that Herve Villechaize (from "Fantasy Island") puts moves on Polly Holliday (Flo from "Alice"). As Henry is loved, Kim Darby looks a bit out of her element - especially when surrounded by all these TV-shots - making the romantic aspect of the script irrelevant. * 1/2 of ****
