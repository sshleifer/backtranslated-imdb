Coiote Ugli may have been much more effective if filmmakers made a movie that was found guilty of enjoying / exploiting R-rank (with lots of nudity.) But since PG-13 is the rating what all studios want today, it ends with a movie like is this: PG-13 "tease" a flick that is not allowed to go anywhere close to how much film should go. The script goes generic that it's easy to guess which point will draw 15 minutes before it actually happens. The acting is adequate, but the characters are so thin that nothing can be done with them. There were also many points that seemed to be watching music-video, not a movie. The only movie property is incredibly beautiful female performance. We see them in some extremely tight and fairly revealing suits ... but only so much could be shown because of the PG-13 constraints. There are plenty of décolletées and tones, which pull the bodies by doing some choreographed dance numbers, but there is no talk of nudity or sex. Tira Banks (with age, she's getting even more beautiful) also has very little time in the movie. Sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy for the eyes (and there's a killer smile) and shows real authentic potential. Still not allowed to watch R-rated movies. This audience can draw a lot from that in the aspect of titulation, but the adult audience will feel angry and deceived. Rating: film-1 women-10
