I think Stuart Bliss is the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was terrible and the action was ridiculous. The fact is that the main character's wife who left him triggered a mental breakdown, but it became so stupid and boring, after a while I could take care less of any character. over and over again the same ideas, without anything fresh or surprising to add complications. The whole thing with the Geiger counter was getting too much time after Stuart began to open his wall to see what was behind him, after the counter showed something was there. and confusing ones in which they meet. It was supposed to assume that this film was a flop when I did not recognize any actor. Do yourself a favor when this film appears, read the book! You'll be better.
