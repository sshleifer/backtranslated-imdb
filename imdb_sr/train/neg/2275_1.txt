Remake Abre los Ojos Alehandra Amenabara, but this time with a live breathing mask as a lead. For the dubious advantage of the English soundtrack, we suffer the soulless performance of Tom Cruise, as usual, with a zero depth. Yes, the figure is identifiable with his personality, but we usually get some character below it to keep our interest. His empty poses deny any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz. language. Cruise's masking only painfully highlights his inadequacy as an actor. Do you see the original Amenabar from 1997?
