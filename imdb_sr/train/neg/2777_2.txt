Unfortunately, this has been shown on Star Movies here in Thailand for the last week. It's totally nonsense. As another member said, this film is a good example of 'how not to act'. I did not see a movie that worked so bad for a long time. Actors (can you call them 'actors'?) They are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that you really understand how much the acting is, you would have to watch a movie ... but that would be related to torture. I run as long as the lead lady delivers lines, and the rest of the actors with their accents (fake or fictional) is equally terrible. Another actress with a fake British accent was pretty, yes, but a good lord was her terrible accent. Mix this with her (lack of) acting and you have a disaster. She should have said nothing, and I could accept her as a pretty girl. Oh, we just got to the scene where the lover of the leading ladies says "Really?" after forced crying from her. Laughable. No, really, I just laughed loudly. The sets and art directors of the film provide some savings. Some of the sets are colorful, and some scenes are pretty nice (minus actors). An old lady with a magical beverage? What?! Another member mentioned the "modern" love song that was in the movie. Fully inappropriate for a period of 500 years ago. I realized that the movie in Thailand was considered a "big budget" at the time of its production. I would be seriously upset that I was the producer of this film. It turns out that money does not necessarily make a good (or even central) movie. I would give King Maker 1 of 10, but the costumes and sets will save the movie from such a movie. a rating. 2 of 10
