I am a passionate fan of the B-Rate horror movie and I've watched my real slasher pictures, so I have a significant measure to evaluate this movie. It is easily classified in the upper echelons of the worst horror films of the 1980s. It's not as scary as the Night of the Demon, it's not as cruel as a Re-Animator and it's missing a Camp Nothing there out there. Given this, this film has no value. Keep in mind that working on a movie for a completely different movie. Images on the back of the DVD box are not taken from this movie. VIOLENCE: $$$ (There are many violence, but we've already seen it all. The killer kills the nubile pupils and the occasional members of the institution by cutting the lamellas and all other tired methods of homicide using horror films) . NURSE: Nothing STORY: $$ about Francine Forbes - who wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley after the film was filmed - who accepts a job at a university.People they begin to die and Forbes believes that the killer is on her. To be honest, it's impossible to worry because the script does not make any character outside Forbes. ACTIVITY: $ (Horrible at all levels. school production - high school is because students can make a better movie than one. As one of the students, but everyone else is from the "supplements" of the caliber of acting .
