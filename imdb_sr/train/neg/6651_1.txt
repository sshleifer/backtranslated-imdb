This is the absolutely worst movie I've been watching all year. First I will say that the acting was very good, and all the actors. This obviously meant it was very unusual, and in that sense it succeeded. Likewise, the story revolves around a sexy vannabe, which is a meaningless, brave chronic liar, whose source of self-confidence comes from a pair of leather pedals. It was worse than watching a car wreck.
