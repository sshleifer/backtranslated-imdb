Now, I love sci-fi caricatures. However, when "Robotboi" appeared in Canada at the end of 2006, I watched the premiere and was inevitably stunned. The characters are generic and stereotyped (IF YOU MAKE REALLY MUST REQUIRE THE APRILIAN WOMAN TO WOVEN TIGROW WALLS AND GIVE THE JACZALIAN ACCOUNT? WHY are all Asian characters yellow and flickering? Does the mother have big thighs and chests and are constantly complaining?) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, rude, and sometimes disturbing. There are heavy similarities with, even sting, at Astro Boi. Let me explain (dub names for the young): Robotboi / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Konstantin / Senka, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shai, and so on. Briefly recalls "My Life as a Teenage Robot", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Stone Riders", "Sailor Moon" and associates. are in progress. Not to mention the abundance of racial / gender stereotypes. They do not even get into allusions. I'll just say they're hidden and pretty dirty. But seriously. Do not even look at this. Especially if you like Astro Boi.
