Rarely such an incredible trail was so futile. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Havke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Valken and John Turturro all jumped on the roof, just to be a torpedo script that looks like nothing more than Hollivood in a joke. The binding of Martin Scorsese's name to this was probably a draw, but the end result is much smaller than the sum of its parts. Recalling the terrible wrong nightmare, each scene looks more fanciful than the other. "Search and Destroy" is nothing more than an abstract, modern, self-confident nonsense, and the entire film is extremely boring .......... MERK
