It's a good thing that the result came for Marlon Brando as a farewell performance, because I would hate to think he goes to Free Monei. Not what his fans should remember. Brando in his last years looks more like Orson Wales and Free Money is a movie that Velles would ask for to finance his own work. Brando is the manager of a local jail who is in America when he is in a small rural environment, usually the largest employer in the area. It gives someone who is in charge, a lot of influence. Unfortunately, he has one weakness left to him, his two twins that are otherwise called daughters. Even when they are a pregnant couple of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to Dad. Do not be afraid because Brando is ready to give them a job in jail where they work under conditions that are not much better than convicts. What to do but commit a robbery of a train that passes through the site each time carrying the money used to be burnt by the Treasury. Although free money has some moments of humor, most of the time is quite below the talents of all involved. Some of them would include Donald Suterland as an equally corrupt judge, and Mira Sorvino as his stepfather, as well as an FBI agent who shot with arrows. many consider it to be the greatest American actor of the last century. Had it not been for Brand's presence and that it was some 40 years ago, Free Money would play a drive-in circuit in a red country, where the population could see how they were being saturated. Or made a bad attempt to satiate them.
