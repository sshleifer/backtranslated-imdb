Cornel Vilde and three dumbbells look for sunken treasure in the South Atlantic. Hunters on Treachered Trees are fighting with a group of territorial sharks with a sweet little mockery on their hungry faces. Wilde and his cheerful men have to find a way to get off the menu so they can start digging through the old Spanish galley filled with golden laces. By discussing and listening to Ville's boring health advice, five crazy convicts embark on a boat and complicate things. Now it's a battle of wisdom about who gets the treasure and who sees the inside of the stomach of the shark. At least Wiley is in shape carrying the same thing he was wearing. 'The Naked Prei' 10 years ago and he stayed in excellent condition. It is made on a 75 cents budget.
