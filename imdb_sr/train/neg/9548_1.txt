I can not believe I've been watching this expecting more. It starts OK. This film moves the boundaries of reality far! At least the first was somewhat real. He discredits the first film and mentions the Joshua project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. It still has a good message in it, and watch BIG BRAT !!! The film only makes it look like Big Brother is much bigger than it is in reality. That was very aggravating. Even the makeup of the actors was completely bad. Some of the acting are pretty good. Some of the acting are still bad. The script was OK at some points and completely messed up in other parts. This movie plays in practicality every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe that I watched it expect more. I think I'll appear in the original to get back to the ground ... K
