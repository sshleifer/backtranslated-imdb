Some have praised _Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as Disney Adventure for Adults. I do not think so - at least not for adult thinking. This script suggests the beginning as a live action movie that has hit someone as a type of shit that you can no longer sell to adults. "A lot of staff" of many older adventurous films was done much earlier, (I think Dirti Dozen_) but _Atlantis_ is one of the worst films in this motif. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member shows is at best inconvenient. A doctor of medicine, a medical man, whose father always wanted sons, if we had not seen them before, we saw boring combinations. The story of how one companion, Winnie, played by Don Novel (Fr. Guido Sarducci), left the flower shops to demolish completely inconvenient. Just the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis academician expressed by Michael J. Fok, has a depth for him. Milo's quest for Atlantis continues with that of his grandfather who raised him. The introductory scene depicts much younger Milo, who relied on his head on his head, while his grandfather put his head on his head. And while the characters were at best thin, the best part about the Athlete was the voice of the talent. Perhaps Milo's depth is not lower than Fox's charm. Commander Rourke does not lose anything that James Garner has expressed. Although Rourke is a fairly military type, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into characters simply by his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the highlight. I'm sorry to say that the king of dying Leonardo Nimoi is nothing more than compulsory. In addition, Don Novello as a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also known for one or two well-made, funny lines - but I always loved Guido Sarducci's father. Also it is well done Computer Animation. Animation of the background, that is. The character animation was not so bad for Disney than the minimalism that brought Don Blut out of doors. Character animation does nothing if it does not make straight characters. Except for landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. The plot was the worst. Some say they are truncated or banal. I'm not sure about that. Any useful plot can be turned into something new with proper treatment. Shakespeare often went from a famous story and complicated, and was only known for putting a new layer of color. So, treatment is a matter. And _Atlantis_ obviously does not. I can not start to enter all of the logical gaps without the spoiler section. The plot was bad. The bridges of the plot crack like a rope, and the ending makes no sense. Adding to that, the script and animation are filled with boring mischief. ** SPOILERS ** 1. At the very beginning, when Milo reveals that the Rugged or Celtic symbols are incorrectly transliterated, and the "coast of Ireland" should read "the coast of Iceland "we begin to have problems. Script writers should know that the British are taking for Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignore the older Latin term Hibernia. But more than that, they must know about the Viking conspiracy to call Greens Island and Island Greenland. Writing the question of a "mistranslated" letter, writers condemned the need for a rugged version of the English language and a post-Roman date on the letter, since Atlantis was to sink into its submarine cave, and without visible traces and less technology than Milo had , the inscription made it much less reliable. 2. Shepard's diary could not have been written before sinking Atlantis, or would not know anything about a cave or crystal lying "in the king's eye." That must have been written after sinking, but without the technology that Milo's expedition and how can, for example, be any of the leviathan, then how can he know more about anything after that? And why would it be written in the Atlantic? Automatic writing and clairvoyance or an astral journey can explain these things, however, the clairvoyance and astral journey they do not require the shepherds to write on the Atlantic, so it must be some kind of automatic writing. Since no one else in Atlantis can read, the spirits of crystal-clear messages must surface. That would make more sense. But it could also be explained in the film: Milo could discover that this power was called his entire life - appeared in dreams, etc. That was to be explored in the film. 3. The Atlanteans simply could not understand the modern languages. No one expects the native Indo-people to speak in Europe, more than the Romans would understand that it is difficult "c" or their day to become French "ch" (pronounced as "sh", no less!) < 4. The present Atlantic lived before cataclysm - when they could obviously * have read it, and now they are not able to read what they used to do or work similar machines. 5. Mass illiteracy points to the key disadvantage in the film. It seems that nothing has happened to this culture. It seems suspended in the air until Milo can save him. Although it seems that life is not a constant struggle for survival, nobody wants to write poetry or write novels, and maybe it is a combination of the Atlantic school system that goes downhill to the end and the lack of good fiction that led to Atlantis falling illiteracy. 5. Kida can apologize for not knowing how to read or manage the machinery if she was so young when cataclysm is set in nonsense - but any of it ** hard ** training her father for worship !! Kashakim's stupidity almost wiped its people from existence by hand. He killed a crowd in cataclysm, stopped the progress (he was not much killed here, but he monitored a massive slide in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill anyone if they were not first cooked in the lava because Giant Robots were not there to protect them . The flash of blue electricity was supposed to break Kashakim's similarity when Kida tried to merge his father's image into the circle of great kings of Atlantis! 6. Although Milo was the only one who could read the Atlantic, Rourke and others knew enough to look at the book of nonsense and found the page on the crystal - which he knew was a crystal, not some stylized astrological or "phases diagram of the sun." 7. If Milo's grandfather told Rourke about this, it still does not explain how Rourke would endure Milo reading it as part of a book. The plotting of the page - which was full ears in Rourke's hand, although Milo did not find any sign of a broken page in the book, obviously - he was just there to turn g that "something is wrong." Unless the word "crystal" in Milo's head triggers an alert that someone will try to steal it, Milo would not suspect anything. It's just a thick front shadow. 8. "Crew Double Crew" was not a change in character, but we found out that Vinnie, Sveet, Audrei and Cookie had been working with Rourke from the beginning, but "heart change" was falling, it was a change and it should have been better motivated. is with characters who did not get anything to start. 9. Ignore the little lion flowing over the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area from which we look at the sequence. It's fluent; It will not run over the protective dome until it fills up all the lower spaces. 10. Finishing STINKS! - and it makes no sense other than to calm political correctness. After renewing the energy source, Atlantis is no longer a weak force to be lazy. Huge robotic guards and celestial lightning shooting cycles indicate that they have less fear than we could. Technology is superior to ours, and definitely to the beginning of the 20th century. In the end, Milo should teach the Atlanteans to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave your own small, peaceful, suicidal culture, not to send it to a hyperdrive. ** END SPOILERS ** Perhaps, the plot of the lost world and the turning point setting should tell me this is more respect for the pulps. The flaws I found in the film agree with that idea. But I'm not sure why I would pay to see thin characters and plan holes just because they had many novels. And pulp stories are part of the "shit that can no longer be sold to adults." We have become a bit more sophisticated and our cellulose has also to grow. The Raiders of the Lost Ark did not lose any sense and escaped so bad. 4 out of 10 - the movie is pleasing, but while thinking about complication, everything is lower.
