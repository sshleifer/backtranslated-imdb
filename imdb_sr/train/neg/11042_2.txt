I wish I could say that this show was unusual for its banality, but it is usual in every respect. She has a stupid husband, his smarter but boring and conventional wife, along with an idiot assistant for "comic relief" - it's very necessary Stable foreseeable jokes, with even more predictable reactions from the harp, point out this harmful mental innocular nausea insidious line to leave me or physically ill, or in deep sleep, more like an induced coma. But that might be for some time, because it gives the average American a person to be truly identified. "Regular" type just like you and me. I live in the southern US, so this show is just opposite to escapism. Down here, this disgusting character is everywhere, in some form or in some other way. Watching TV is brutally excessive.
