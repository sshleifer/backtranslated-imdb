I noticed that the previous reviewer (who appears to be still at school) gave this film a very good review, and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer did not see the BBC's far more subtle adaptation to this classic novel. The biggest problem I had with this version (1999) was the casting of Anthony Vai as Tom Long. Anthony Vai was a talented boy triple who celebrated after appearing in the Mini-series TV "Choir". I can only assume that he acted for the role of Tom Long in the power of his great acting in "Choir". Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in "Choir" grew into a tall and handsome young man when "Tom's Midnight Garden" was shot and as such Anthony fails to convince Tom as a schoolboy. It's too far from imagination to believe Tom (as Anthony was playing) make friends with much younger Hatti. In the 1989 BBC version, Tom and Hatti are much closer to years and the development of their friendship is much more convincing. For the 1999 film, even special effects fail to convince and there is no visible progress on TV effects from 1989. The casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and in all the film was the lack of a great version of the true classic. As a final observation, I emphasize that the BBC's 1989 version of the BBC gets more than £ 20 per second, while the new DVD of this version can be bought for less than £ 5.00, should I say more?
