I thought that watching a video about corporate adherence was tiring. This film did not go anywhere fast. What could have been a slightly orphan half-hour episode of the twilight zone turned into a seemingly endless scattering of the film on people who parked their cars, a picture of a pool of a guy (he really must answer the phone on the road). his work, while Heui and Louei sit in a brightly lit control room and repeat the "T minus 10 and count" as if something exciting happens. That does not mean I do not hope. The best thing about this movie is to see James Best and Gerald McC, in something other than famous TV figures, and this stretches to find something good. And do not start me on music that was entirely composed of Timpani, some great marine mammals, and microphone feedback. This film is as close as I gave him another, but he gets 2 because I actually managed to finish this insomnia, and I did not have to go in the middle. AVOID ALL COSTS.
