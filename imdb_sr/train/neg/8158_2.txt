What is the purpose of creating sequences that are absolutely not relevant to the original movie? Does not make sense. This is why the prom Night Proms are so unpleasantly bad. The original film meant a group of children who hide the dark secret that ultimately killed them, at least one, in a brutal act of revenge. Can someone explain to me what the dead queen is - the prime minister rising from grave to steel in connection with the first film? Prom Night 2 had uninterrupted holes that left the audience constantly wondering how this happened and why would that happen? But in the end, I guess it could be one of those films that are so bad that you finally laugh at yourself.
