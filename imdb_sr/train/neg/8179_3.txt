"Three hunt hunters search West Indies for hidden treasures, and golden baits increase tension as men approach the location of the treasure. Deep-sea divers hope to find gold, but they will find that greed and hatred lead to homicide," according to the synopsis of the DVD sleeve. "Manfish" is the name of their ship, not the monster. Skeleton that gives Muscular Captain John Bromfield (as Brannigan) half of his treasure map is very good. The old Victor Victor George (as a professor) gives the other half of the map. The first friend of Lon Cheney Junior (like Swede) plays stupid, and sexy Tesa Prendergast (like Alita) keeps the rum (not very well, obviously). Serious problems in editing and continuity change the picture, which could otherwise be something. *** Manfish (2/56). Lee Vilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jori, Lon Chanei Jr.
