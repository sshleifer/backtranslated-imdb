Okay, what kind of TRASH did I look at now? "The Witch Mountain" must be one of the most unusual and crazy Spanish exploitation shifts ever, and at the same time it is unusually tempting. There is absolutely nothing that would make sense here, and I even suspect that there was ever a script that could be worked out, but somehow I could not exclude it. Scratching the head with confusion starts immediately, with an introductory sequence about an angry girl who killed a cat's mother. Do you think this movie revolves around children who have evil powers? No, because after this introduction, the girl and her crimes are no longer mentioned. Then cut the guy, with the most impressively trimmed mustache you'll ever see, who breaks off with his girlfriend in a pretty unbearable way. When he asks him to spend his vacation with her, he immediately invites his employer to ask him for any task! Great move. The film finally begins now, while traveling to an isolated mountainous area to photograph some peaks. Although not before picking up a new girlfriend (Patti Shepard) and taking her toples! During their journey, are all kinds of strange events happening? you guessed ?? they never explain. The girl is awake in the middle of the forest, music is heard loudly everywhere and someone is stealing a jeep! Really, witches for the car? Obviously, it is owned by mountains of quiet witches practicing voodoo on offenders. That's the closest thing I've described the action, but is there a good chance that I'm far away? Here is more important atmosphere! "Witch Mountain" is occasionally very nasty, with its spooky music and interesting cinema. Supporting characters look strange, and the ecstatic Patti Shepard plays a good heroine. This is the type of European horror film that could have been a bit of a surprise, just to make someone write a structured script.
