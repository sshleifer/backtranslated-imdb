Jesus from Montreal is actually an intelligent film. The actors are really good and the technical side of the movie is fine. But, although I was very interested in the topic and liked to think and argue about religion (I am an atheist), it was difficult to force myself to watch a movie on a bitter and, in my opinion, a kind of unconsciously funny ending. Why is this film so incredibly boring? I do not know. It's simple and therefore not recommended.
