Horror movie? I can not believe how bad this movie is, what's the point of this movie? The film was almost 1h and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes, only Lena walked with this stupid expression on her face after she had suffered an accident .... not much story, even a lot of action at all .. I have to say tho, the last 20 minuets got a little little action .. and it's still stupid ....... and finally oh my God, I do not know where to start, it also ends with this stupid look at the lazy face lol .. do not get me wrong I love Lena Headei, I think she's a great actress, but I do not know what went into her to do this movie .. she does not waste time and watching because this movie does not have a story, no acting ... it makes no sense ... not to mention how slow film goes and looks like watching it forever.
