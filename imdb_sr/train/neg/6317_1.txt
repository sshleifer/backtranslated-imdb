I have no idea what came out of San Francisco from this stupid plot, but obviously they need to go away regardless of the drugs they are taking and put their analyst at risk - NOW. this is a credible story if you consider a sequence of alien abductions in "Life of Brian" to be credible. If the US and the USSR renounced nuclear weapons, the result would be to eliminate the only real obstacle that prevented them from the war. As bad as Korea, Vietnam and other wars from that period, they were "proxy wars" who fought to keep superlatives in direct engagement. High school students will strike a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As if somebody said, "Mr President, some children in Drastic High do not eat!" and Ronald Reagan would answer "My God! I'd better revise my defense policy!" Right. Like this movie? Would not it be better if the Soviet Union collapsed because they could not support their massive construction of weapons ... Wait, it happened!
