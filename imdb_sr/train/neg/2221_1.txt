I'm sorry, but this may have been frightening in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just is not true. The only interesting scene in the whole movie is the opening scene in which Michael kills his sister, Judith, carrying his mask for Halloween. The most inconvenient moment in the whole movie is when his parents remove the mask to see their son kill his daughter. The movie goes down from there and does not rise until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it was too late, the audience lost all interest in the story. There is barely a character development, and people are always crazy that Laurie is such an extraordinary heroine when she really is not much. I'm sorry I do not agree with everyone who is terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie, watch The Shining or Rosemari's Babi. These are the two best horror films ever made. The witch's night is certainly not in their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert gave him four stars, because there is no way this film ever deserves such a high score.
