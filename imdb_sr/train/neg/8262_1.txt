This is really terrible: painfully irritatingly stylized performers, twisting and stuttering inseparable dialogues taking place in scenes that have no purpose, beginning, mid or end, cut off without any apparent narration or even cognitive intent, all in the service of some completely uninhabitable and almost undiscovered "stories ". What exacerbates it is the film's pretensions to "stylize": suddenly firing cranes with remote heads spirally lower down, and for no apparent reason, sudden whip-barrels or sections that are inconsistent: all this "style" serves only to increase the almost incredibly huge misconception about the project and the almost offensive material gaps. Definitely the candidate for the worst movie ever recorded.
