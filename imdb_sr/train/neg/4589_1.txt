Do you remember the smoking channel of chains that was exposed for 60 minutes a few years ago? This is her. Many people reviewed this film without checking the credibility of filmmakers. Producers have been very successful in using false promotions, without revealing financial and philosophical backgrounds for this part of the marketing cliff. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, a new age of aging, and daily nonsense, this movie is for you. If you want to discuss quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this film is to convince you that Ramtha is not a fool, so you will give her a lot of money. If you can go through the Ramtha Web site with your fingers, without getting into disbelief, then you may think that the money you left on this ad for madness is well spent. <http: //rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section? categori = ANSVERMAN>
