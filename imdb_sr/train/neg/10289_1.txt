This should really earn a "O" rating, or even a negative ten. I watched this show for years, and the show jumped on the shark around the series 7. This episode, however, proves that the show has jumped on the shark. His writing is lazy, absurd, complacent, and even worthless garbage like Beavis and Butthead. It's quite possible to be funny and still fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, Mummy Count of Monte Cristo - all "fun" movies that do not need to be taken seriously. However, there is something that's funny like "This is the worst thing I've ever seen." And indeed, this is the worst episode of the Stargate I've ever seen. It's absolutely terrible, and it comes from someone with a star door in her basement. I want to sell all my stellar props, and that's the most serious.
