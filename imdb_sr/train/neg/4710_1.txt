My brother is in love with this show. I totally agree with people who said it was copying a Dekter lab and pretty unusual parents. I never liked pretty unusual parents, I mean, some things were laughing at me, but most of the time it's really boring and not sweet at all. It's almost the same as the Johnny Test. Besides, NIÅ TA makes me laugh at that show. The gags are so stupid and meaningless, and to tell you the truth, maybe I'm just me, but the kids can not dress like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is terrible, but c'mon! And the Decker Laboratory, which was once one of my favorite shows and still does not bother to watch it. What makes me shy and I am ashamed of what Johnny Test made absolute JOKE from this wonderful performance! Another thing. The. The dog. Is. That's right. Annoying. He's louder and more disgusting than Johnny! And gai accent? What the fudge! I hate the dog to death and I hope to die, because it would be better for children to see than listening and watching the disgusting shit that takes place in that show, and taking gai's accent. Unless you want your eyeballs up in a marvelous flame, and your brain is fried from this show, do not look!
