Except that people obviously buy this garbage! As it is shown as the "Moral Eagle," even if you tried to make the most unusual parody of evangelism you could come up with, it would not come close to the joy of this performance. It's hard to say what happens when you look at it. Is it a news? Emission? Who knows!? They are beginning to report on various international news, but in seemingly random points, the news is broken by this strange, troll-like little man whose forehead is bigger than the whole face, murmurs and laughs and is generally creepy. > Pat Robertson at first glance does not look like such a bad guy. He just looks like a senile, but still harmless old doll that stuck in his archaic convictions (like most of our grandparents). But this is the man who called for the assassination, who made friends and offered help more than once, but two killer dictators who illegally used donations for the launch of diamond mines that supported forced abortions in China, which regularly implicate white people ( especially the American Caucasian men) superior to all other races. Still, all this would be ridiculous, except that he obviously has enough large fan base to keep his little show in the air 40 years later (or that, or enough money to bribe some TV executives who do not give nothing to show). The idiotism of the play becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, have to watch it and hang on each word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt it is, people still listen to it. I do not know if it's ridiculous or scary. I assume a healthy mix of both.
