How did this piece of shit stay on TV for so long? It's horrible. That makes me shoot someone. It's so fake that it's actually worse than a sci-fi movie from the 1940s. I'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense. I remember seeing him when he first came out. I thought, hey, this could be interesting, then I found out how absolutely, crazy, funny stupid it is. It was so bad that I actually pulled out my pocket knife and put my hand on the table. and canceling quality programs that require some thoughts to be created.
