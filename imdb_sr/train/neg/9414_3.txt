Despite the recognition on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed, this film was a disappointment. Yes, it is much more realistic than other war films from the period to show mud, boredom, and frustration, but unfortunately, he is moving away from it, thinking that everything is in this movie. There is no complication and the dialogue is monotonous. Not that a good war movie must have a fighting scene every five minutes. One of the best World War II films, "Twelve hours tall," has very little action. But it compensates for the cracking of dialogue and psychological tension. The exception in the "GI Joe's Story" is a short battle segment (dubbed the "City under siege" on DVD) that takes place in Italy. However, this is one of the fastest and most convincing fighting scenes of any war film. But, unfortunately, the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this climax. Another exclusion is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Valli Cassell, who is thought to be "romeo", but comes out of perversion. On the contrary, Sgt. Varnish is sympathetic, if he is defective, man. He tells Captain Walker (Mitchum) when he volunteers for another patrol: "Every step is a step closer ... home." But that last step? One patrol too? he drives him over the mental edge. Too bad the rest of the film does not justify some other fine phase. As for Meredith's painting, Pile ... he's practically in a coma.
