CARRI ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it became clear that the series reached a natural end with the best entries such as CLEO, UP THE KIBER and SCREAMING from mid to late 60's MATRON was alone by It is by no means bad that we have already seen all of this with a thin parcel (a bunch of sleepers trying to break into a hospital in order to steal a stock of contraceptive pills that they plan to sell to third world countries) surrounded by gays somewhat amusing, although unsettled nature. I think that's the problem - Gags are not really fun with an unsophisticated nature that begins to show off their years. Do we need another movie that uses a man dressed as a woman to drive a plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I can say is that I saw CARRI ON MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago and I have a problem trying to remember very funny lines. This is a serious problem for comedy
