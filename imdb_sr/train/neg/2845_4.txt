This film moves from 4th to 1st without having to bother with 3rd or 2nd, grinding the gears to the socket, the b-film of the final line. Kon is at first easy to be the best and smartest part of the movie. It's worth seeing. The Harlow scene in the bathtub takes place so fast that you can miss it. Definitely not worth anything that Robert Osborne gave in his TCM introduction to this loose-central confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this alleged society turn out to be saints - especially incredible character, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
