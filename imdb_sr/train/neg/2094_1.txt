I had to endure a teenage, high school fear and family conflict for almost all shows. I really do not care that high school girls care about their relationships. I spent my time in Hell and I was dealing with such issues and I do not care about the fictitious teenagers who are going through the "lite" versions of horror I suffered. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. It was a few seconds of science fiction late in the show. Finally we see proto-Cilone. It was good, but with one problem. His red dot would be closed for a matter of interest. We all know that Cilon eiedots always scans back and forth, giving the machine a map of the world. The red dot does not stop moving back and forth. I hope the writers will correct this abuse before another episode.
