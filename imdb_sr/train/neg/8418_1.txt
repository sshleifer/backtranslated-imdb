Yes, there are great performances. Unfortunately, they are happening in the context of a movie that has no idea what it is doing. During the first 45-60 minutes, all music takes place as a realistic performance. Suddenly, for about an hour, the characters who always spoke to one another suddenly began singing to each other suddenly. To further confuse things, a bit further, out of nowhere, they actually work around 15 minutes of dialogue, and then they seem to drop that idea and switch to other things, such as the number that starts in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turn into a completely orchestrated piece with a massive invisible section. Above all this inconsistency in how the music is used, the composer's inability to write music in the style that is allegedly displayed is clear. While the first couple of pieces mimic the sound of Motovn from the 1950s, the rest of the film is only (bad) Broadway music. Then there was the pure nonsense of the clipping of the group that was imitating the bad family of Jackson and Eddie Murphy from the Little Richard to James Brovne to Lionel Richie. When he started to channel Stevie Wonder, I could not laugh out loud. It was obviously one of those films that made me realize how much time I have on the ground and I regret that I lost two hours watching this movie.
