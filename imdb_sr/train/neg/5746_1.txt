About the worst film in distribution! I love zombie movies and I saw it in the used stand so I thought why not? Oh, my God, disgrace for zombie movies and fans of genre! Whoever made this movie should remove the camcorder and go to the film school! There are so many Greyhounds that have invested time and effort into their films and have something that this film is not a dignity. I know what is needed for filming movies and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent on the meat market, but none of that money and time went to make it good. You need actors, scripts, real cams, invest in some books on how to make independent movies. I do not know how you got a DVD release, but whoever did it, or is a really good friend or bangs your head on the wall. The quality of the movies above is quality, not quantity, the effects are weak! I was so angry that this was actually in stores and that I could not get my money back. Please, if you saw this movie, write here and put a dot on the shlock. I know I'm very rough, I only had 10 rows so I'm trying to get over the thing.
