Do you know when you look at your collection of old, recorded movies, and realize that there are some that you've seen only once or twice, and you can not remember the time it takes to see them? Alibi is one of these films; I found it recently and I decided to give it a chance. I'm not quite sure whether I'm satisfied with my decision ... on the one hand, the film is really, really bad, on the other hand, now I have another free tape ... yes, you realize. The action is predictable and in no way original. Pacing is bad. The acting is bad, but that's not surprising, since these two guides of the former soap opera ... are accustomed to exaggerating. The characters are poorly written clichés. The film even manages to fuck the simplest way to impress me (through a movie): scenes from the field. Even they do not cause any emotion for or against any cardboard. The movie simply does not have the right redeeming quality ... even the dialogue is bad. The thing is, it's so full of clichés that it's funny. And that's the only thing that raises it above the rating 1/10: (although inadvertently) the comical release of many clichés and stereotypes. I did not pay much attention to the film, but almost every time I looked at the screen, something could be laughing. One last note: I was thinking about using the line "Tori Spelling can not work" as one summary, but I suppose everyone knows this, so I decided for the moment, because it is more informative. All in all, a bad movie, but not the worst if you have nothing else to do and if it's on television. Good for a few laughs, if you can sit. 3/10
