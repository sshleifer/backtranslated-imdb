Barbara Streisand also directs the stars in this very Jewish story. To have the chance to get an education, Babs enthusiastically disguises himself in a boy who is not hard to work because he already looks like a boy anyway. In her new school she meets many male colleagues who do not have any problem believing she is a guy. Do not miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when Babs's male friend thinks he's a man, but "hits" him on the ground, sits at the top of him and looks sympathetically in "his" eyes ... * cocoon *. Middle film; an interesting story about nothing special.
