If you are looking for a sweets for the eyes, you can enjoy the Ski Captain. Ski Captain is just a video game injected into live performers. Visuals are nice and interesting to watch throughout the movie. Now, by saying that, the images are the only thing that is good in the captain of the sky. After ten minutes, I knew I was watching one of the worst movies of all time. I was hoping this movie would be better, but it never reached any interest. After thirty minutes, the staggered departure grew and grew. Now I have over 2000 movies and I probably saw five times as many. Still, this is just another movie that seemed to me to get out of my life. Act --- No. The three main performers are poor. Jude Lav (also in the second film I wanted to get out of) was horrible in the title role. I'd rather sit over Ben Affleck in Gigley, but look at the law again. The last article I read said that Paltrow is thinking about staying home and being a mother, not playing. After this performance, I would applaud this decision. Story - Soaps are better written. The story behind the Ski Captain begins badly and constantly worsens as he progresses. Direction --- no. Everything is put into the special effects that the story, acting and direction suffer greatly. Even the "Phantom Threat" had a better game and it does not say much. I would have to give this film "0" from "10". Avoid paying the prices in the theater and wait for video editions.
