To be honest, this film is another in a series of big disappointments ... most of these so-called "master horror" films are just scary in terms of their sub-parallel effects and funny stories ... except Ron Perlman, everyone else in this movie does not they can save their lives ... the shots sounded like someone playing Bop under the boom or something, and it seemed completely unrealistic ... all in all, this movie is terrifying like Home Sami ... the only good masters They are cigarette burns, Jennifer, and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how these directors can sleep at night saying they destroyed the genre that some of them used to understand ....
