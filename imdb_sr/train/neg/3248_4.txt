Why did I go to see this movie? Frankly, because Jim Carrei was in it and in the past made hilarious movies that made me cry with laughter, so you really blame me for expecting it again? In addition, the premise, the funny trailer, the participation of Jennifer Aniston and his fact that it was a huge incentive encouraged me. However, as my "Summary from One Line" suggests, I was disappointed. For various reasons: Reason 1: It was not funny. In a two-hour film, I laughed for about 5-10 minutes ... all together, the rest of the time I sat down thinking: "I really should have ice cream." I admit that it may be wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what he really does when he realizes Gemes such as Trumanov shov, Liar, I, I and Irena, Dumb and Dumb, Mask, and 'Ace Ventura' movies then produce, in Bruce Nolan's own words, such a central film? Reason 2: The role of Jennifer Aniston was criminally signed. I mean hello! It has been around for ten years in the eyes of the public, and in this film it has about four words. Wrong. Reason 3: One word - Cliche Reason 4: The occasional application of specific US references - Jimmy Hoffa, Valter Cronkite's "Clean Week" - is a trail movie that is particularly appealing. "Teenager says no drugs and education - it's a miracle! Want to see the miracle soon? Be a miracle!" God tells Bruce that in the United States, it seems, he has had a tough feeling, but he may face a stronger resistance in markets that hold the hint of subtlety. In addition, I'm still going to school, and this statement suggests that all my friends are miracles ... or maybe just means we have a brain? In this film, there are enough funny Carrei moments to make you laugh and prevent the almighty Bruce from being a total disaster, but we advise you to start to change your expectations downwards.
