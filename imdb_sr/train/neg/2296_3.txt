"Back of Beiond" takes place at the diving / petrol station in the midst of an Australian desert led by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy man suddenly in trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We get what seemed, at first glance, confusingly to look like a flashback in which he and his sister (although their relationship with each other is better understood later in the movie) are accelerating through the desert on their motorcycle. After that, he appears as a terribly quiet, and sometimes a strange character in the presence of arrivals. We know that one thing is certain and that it is McGregor's spiritual sense, his predictability of danger, and such - his clairvoyance is just a little relevant to the story, and most refer to the three thieves thieves who break down and who rely on Thomas to help them not to be on the spot, without getting them on the road. Of course, Tom falls to one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and all of a sudden, all three already doubt their allies against each other. But not in a way that really results in anything from a lot of mystery or action. The fact is that the whole movie wants to build something important all the time, but it really does not work. Even the ending, which is played as an ordinary story of a campfire (and which really reveals many narrative errors), is almost as ridiculous. Perhaps it's worth a try if you do not think it's a terribly slow pace, but they're at ease, at least, for something a little different from the usual one.
