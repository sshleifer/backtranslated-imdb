Below the dense green glitches of computer graphics, Ichikava Somegoro's amazing art and skills flashed. Unfortunately: he's lost in everything. The scenes of the Old Edo - with a jacket, floating on Sumida, training and acting in Nakamura - were exciting and interesting, bringing you back into an interesting and rich era. The action on the stage Kabuki, in which Somegoro stands out and excites, was more enriched than any absurd high jin that followed. Skill, audience energy, color sets, were far more satisfying than any nonsense that took over the action and performance. What a lost opportunity! One of the best Kabuki actors alive, and he is lost in his sleep.
