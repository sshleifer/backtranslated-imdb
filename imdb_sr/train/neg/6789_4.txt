The action of this film lies at one important point: that this killer was responsible, loving, a caring father. It is not impossible to be a father and a killer. But this man shows the murder of a teenager without provocation, reason and no emotions. This girl was someone's daughter. I think that the father who was so concerned about his daughter could not be so cold at his daughter. Or, alternately, it could have been so cold-blooded, yet to worry and worry about your daughter. The idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victims' parents to take care of his daughter is incredible. However, the actors were acting with conviction. I thought that the color change of the eye of Scott Bakule made it look colder and more threatening than usual. You could not see in his eyes.
