I entered this film thinking that it would be a fine drama of football (in the same spirit as "Remember the Titans"); However, I lost the feeling that I just attended the preaching of Ted Haggard about Rapture. The only thing that was lacking was the demand for a tenth at the end of the film. In fact, it would probably be more from the televangelist preacher that he got out of this bad pronunciation for the party. At least with sermons about televangelists, there are quotes from Scripture, not quotes from popular self-help. The action was quite predictable to the extent that anyone who had enough time for attention could arrange the entire action in the first 15 minutes of the film.
