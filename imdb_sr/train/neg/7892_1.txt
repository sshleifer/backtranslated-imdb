It started with an interesting premise. I always love things from the Civil War and the ancient secret of society. As the film progressed more, I realized that this was at best the B film. In the second half, movie C, then D, then F, and then "I want this is not a rental, so I can put it in a microwave!" I can not say that acting in all cases was terrible, only the majority. However, writing ... I never read the book. Maybe the book is well written. The script was written by a 10-year-old. It was funny, shallow, diamond and uninteresting, characters that were as interesting as a 5-pound sack. I really hated this movie, as did my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problems with films that promote or support Christianity. This film has done a great deal of damage to the service. Terrible, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I strongly recommend Superman 4.
