Kojak meets the mafia. Tell Savelles is one of those guys from the past who seem pretty forgetful. I never thought his performance was so great. This is its one-dimensional characterization of the criminal boss, with very predictable results. If you take automobile chase and general wandering, there are not many plans or actions. I think mafia movies are boring because I do not have respect or interest in ordinary criminals and their actions. Hollivood, in this case, Italian cinema, treats these people as heroes. I've seen a movie and in a few days I will not remember much. A lot of shootings, innocent passers-by who die, betray this sick loyalty. The film is well recorded and the acting is decent. But dubbing is so bad (because of the voices that just could not get out of those bodies), I almost started looking for Godzilla as it approaches the bay.
