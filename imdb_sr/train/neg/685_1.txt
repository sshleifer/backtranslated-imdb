My wife and I thought that with this actor and director the film must be at least worth watching. We're wrong. In fact, we gave up this after 45 minutes. The idea that Cravford, Young and Tone were British, but to speak with American accents, was impossible for me to pass - it is hard to believe that it is England when no one speaks with British accent. Between Crawford and anyone, there is nothing, and to repeat the previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Cravford suddenly declared their love for each other for no reason is ridiculous. There is no reason to worry about any character, which is why we dropped a towel halfway. It was hard to believe that Havks directed this, as none of the actors spoke with the trademark Havksian war-a-tat delivery. Save time and skip this.
