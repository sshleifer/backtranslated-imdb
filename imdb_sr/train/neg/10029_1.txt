I had no idea what the film was about to do before I saw it because Tashan had only commercial trailers while promoted. That's why I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said, "It's the director's debut Vijaya Krishna Acharie who wrote scenarios for Dhoom 1 and 2, and son Ibrahim Saif Ali Khan debuts in the movie by playing him a child in his flashback . "After I looked at it, I realized why they were not a suitable trailer because there was nothing in the movie to show. The story was remarkably dumb, and even a 10-year-old child could think of a better story. There was almost no action, and the camera was shaking at all possible angles and it's hard to figure out who is killing. And the action was crazy and unrealistic, for example. One man with a pistol managed to kill about 100 people with machine guns. While I was watching Tashan, he reminded me of 3 movies: Sin City: during the opening of the loan Koila: Terrible English Anil Kapoor like Amrish Puri in Koila. Jhoom Barbar Jhoom: Unforgettable funny jokes that are not even ridiculous. I also heard that the budget is 40 crores, the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went. In any case, if you did not like Dhoom 2, then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan. The race was hot on the heels and it's one million times better. Only two good songs are Dil Haara & Challiia, and both songs were recorded in Greece at good locations, but what kind of use is it in the rubbish movie? Even the horrible English Anil Kapoor could not preserve this discomfort.
