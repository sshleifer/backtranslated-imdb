The Invisible Man is a fantastic 1933 movie, a top movie at a time when the objects seemed to lie on the top of a man who is truly invisible. Come on, watch the movie, you will be shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first real movie with special effects. Come back in 2000, computer-assisted special effects look like a children's game, the audience is not released with special effects, but are disappointed if they are not right. Special effects in Holl Man, the updated story of HG Wells, are fine but not the biggest problem with this film directed by Paul Verhoeven, which you can remember from Shovgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Beckon plays Sebastian Keane, a scientist who deals with the world of bio-invisibility (yes, I know it's not a word), but of course to fight the higher people who threaten to take away the team funding. So, while film characters who are willing to stop funding, tend to sacrifice and become a guilty for invisibility (yes, I know, I used this non-word again) process. The process has terrible consequences, not Caine dies, but instead becomes an aggressive, violent creature called a guy. Now that she is invisible, Caine catches a sexy neighbor, a co-worker, former girlfriend Elisabeth Shue and a man who took his money. Then something strange happens, Caine becomes a new supernatural being, "A thing that will not die". Laughing face-to-face with all natural things, Kane faces death and spits in his face, because it takes time for this creature to die, pulling the end of the film. The film is silly, stupid, and finally funny with the way in which realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. There are good opportunities in Holl Manu, but of course, none of them are explored. For a more interesting look at the invisible being, prepare for some good old-fashioned black-and-white cinema, and look at the Invisible Man from 1933. Kevin Bekon will remain invisible when he returns, probably still living at the bottom of the volcano.
