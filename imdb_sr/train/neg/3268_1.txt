It is a real challenge to make a film about a baby that was swallowed by wild goats and a mother who is wrongly charged with murder, but it seems to everyone to succeed. Meril Streep gives the performance of her life, melodramatic, overloaded, but with this comical genius who keeps you laughing even when her mother struggles with extreme horror. Your glass may be embarrassing to watch this and, yes, it's a strange choice of the theme for a farce, but really a bit of the movie has anything to do with it because it focuses on showing Streepu its Aussie accent and facial contortions. Rejecting in media bias and sensationalism and neglecting truth or ethics gives the film a chance to make the point of departure that these things are bad.
