Once again I risked and rented this shitbag. Made as a horrible movie, there was no scene, no one, which was even terrible. NO ONE!! There must have been some nudity, but all the lesbian actions became a bit old. I suppose this might have been the savings of this movie? And Dan, what a boring ass! From the very beginning, I knew that I was about when the first Day was the first to speak. And it should have been scary? What a laugh! All in all, this film is terribly horrible! How the hell are these movies doing? If you want a movie with some excitement, do not rent this movie. This movie is just as exciting as Teletabis.
