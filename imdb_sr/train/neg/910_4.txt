The story was very simple and easy to follow and it contained a lot of comedies without any sense to the point in which it became annoying. Some viewers thought it was funny, but I love more intelligent humor. There were several famous Swedish actors in the film and their performance was decent considering the scenario. Lena Endre looked good as always. I do not recall the original movie so I can not tell if it's better or worse. If you enjoy movies such as Sallkapsresan this movie may be worth a look.
