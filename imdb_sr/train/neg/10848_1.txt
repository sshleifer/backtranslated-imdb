In all likelihood, this could have been an interesting movie. With the score of the mighty Cradle Of Filth, acting on his frontman Dani and raising himself as "the future of the British horror," I expected Alek Chandon to have a chance to live up to the hyper. I was wrong. All about this movie is either a cliche or is incompetent. Setting up an anthology for a short story was made to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. The idea of ​​the 'hospital room', however, has sent the cold in my spine, but as with most films, poor writing of the script and acting has been lowered. Chandon can not write a dialogue. Every sentence with the chief police investigator is full of cursing and audacity (a typical 'policeman on the edge' is ridiculous, I'm sure I saw him elsewhere before ...) No Chandon, you are not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. Sounds bad. Add a funny OTT cast with a very dodgy casting (do not misunderstand me, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but the actor is not) and performances are beyond the laughter of a vein that fills up. Give me Bruce Campbell any day. Visual effects are mostly bad, with some terrible CGI, terrible burning effects (for goodness, Peter Jackson worked better, and that was ten years ago with less budget) and editing a filter that screams OVER- USE! As for the often mis-rated Cradle Of Filth ... man, they should sue. The basic problem with Cradle Of Fear is to take it seriously, trying to build an atmosphere and encourage terror and repulsion in its audience. too many good horror films made in the 1970s and 1980s make this much better with far superior effects above (for example, a maniac, meat-eating zombies, overseas, suspicion, etc.), making Cradle of Fear, in my opinion, second-rate and I hope that Chandon can learn from this disgusting gully of the film and continue with some sort of high-quality horror that actually scares. Better luck next time.
