The fact that this film is entitled to the most successful film in Swiss film history makes me shake my head! It's true, but at the same time it's poor. The sound about the Swiss Army could be much better. The story sounds interesting, at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to free military training by the army while Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). The acting does not differ in some way from just a few recruits who are drunk and stoned in reality. Melanie Viniger plays her role as the central Michelle Bluntschi central, I personally found her pretty embarrassing. The story contains a comedy combined with a romantic, which does not function as expected. The romantic part is too messy, and the comedy is not at all funny, it's just a cheap attempt and it does not change during the whole movie. It's funny for students 12 to 13 years old, but not for those who are searching for fun comedy. Humor is bad, except for some shots. Dope? Cool! Theft? Cool! If you want a real comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure you have not yet released military training, and even do not expect too much! I will give her 4 out of 10 stars because Marco Rima is quite fun during her screen. However, there is not much time for the screen
