I tried to watch this horror movie when I was five; I've never been the same. Filled to the top of the images of drugs caused by the usual behavior of your average asylum tenant, this "film", despite its colorful appearance, is not for people, SPECIALLY not for children. It starts quite innocent, with a poor boy who destroys the drum of his colleague from the class (wait for him) to go through his head; Yes, putting his HEAD through it. Do not be afraid, my friends! Quickly comforting his chirping flute, which is strange enough, I will give you, but still acceptable. Then: The film turns into a combination of the Wizard of Oz and where there are wild things, but loses all the "warm and fuzzy" aspects of either of these two books. So, this Barney cousin of seven feet, makes friends with this poor boy and throws him even deeper into despair. In order to add a pleasant series of horrible topics, a mixture of criminals was added to the carnival ship, once a friend of the colorful crew of grandparents' hobbling and doped "dragons". The most painstaking picture in the middle of this chaos is the villain, appropriately called "Vitchiepoo" (?). Of course, it has its own problems: what with an obvious plastic mask that limits the expression of face to wear with a broom whose gas level was always the lowest in the most unfavorable moments. As a result, one of her favorite shows was diving in the nose that separated the land from Pufnstuf from its degenerate, decaying habit (I do not know where I would rather live). In short, this movie is terrifying ... If you want to watch a movie that has similar effects on the audience as an Ecocist, then this is for you. Enjoy.
