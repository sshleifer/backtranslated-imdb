you have to watch my comments on many films under Evren Buiruk .. I'm leaving to make another comment on a movie that does not even cost a minute of talking. This movie is essentially two hours of Daphne's character who is drinking alone - almost literally - to death . The only surprise in this movie is that you did not have enough trace or signage to be surprised. It was just an eclipse, a sad waste of time. Villem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this film was just sucked. Slowly, it does not make the film bad, it was just bad. The sketched shop, mixed with artistic wanderings of anamorphic details, is not meaningfully assembled in a meaningful way for the plot, except to highlight a bunch illustrated from several perspectives, finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as a party, it made me sleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and I had to watch the movie again - which was still disappointing.) Mostly I do not like to comment negatively or evaluate the works of others, even when they are sucking, but this film deserved. It is a shame that these great actors were ashamed of this end result.
