This is so bad, so bad. Acting is the biggest joke in history. I do not even try to see it, I did it after 20 minutes and it was just as disappointing in the end as at the beginning ... I really do not understand the taste of people, I am a fan of horror movies and I'm not nasty, but I have a limitation! Perhaps it was a quarter of a star better than the beginning of Hoast, but that's it. That's why I recommend that you do not lose 15 minutes that you will be able to watch. I think actors do better monkeys. And a big brother with a parental role is terrible. Are not they paying for C-movie characters? No, I must say that it is not the first time that I think horror movie is bad, but it is absolutely one of my ten films and it will be a cartoon with Vampire Portrait, Cabin near the lake, Hoast!
