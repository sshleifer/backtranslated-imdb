OK movie, set up in Mexico, about the hit man (Scott Glenn) who rides with an American writer who fights himself and his Mexican girl after a blow. Paying them to take him to the border? but things get out of control. It starts well enough, but it fights quickly and dies. ** SPOILER ** The possible relationship of twisting is poorly placed and hard to believe. The absence of passion, and in essence no reason behind it, leaving one man behind another, made it ridiculous - and the end was predictable and boring. ** END SPOILER ** Harvei Keitel is an American agent on the trail of a hit man, but it seems to be a bit confused as to how boring and slow the scenario ...
