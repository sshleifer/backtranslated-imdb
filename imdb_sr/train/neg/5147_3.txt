'Blue Desert' may have had the potential to be even halfway more likely and more comfortable trilera with the protagonist, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Coke) was not that stupid. When a victim of another attack on the streets of New York, comic artist Roberts moves to a small town in the West. In his first days there, he met a suspicious crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, who plays well this part) that will eventually leave his side. Fearing her safety after having been in the situation twice before, she establishes a friendship and relationship with a suspiciously friendly city policeman, Steve Smith (DB Sveeni, whose character does not seem sufficiently convincing, leaving disbelief among viewers who should otherwise be unbelievably convinced in the red herrings that were cast by writers). Smith needs Roberts' co-operation because, as he says to him, Atkins is a former slave and guilty of sexual abuse. But the police lacked evidence to take him before. The film had enough of a move to at least make an interesting movie, because soon there is such a confusion about who Roberts should be trusting. However, much of the expected uncertainty seems too compelling because Roberts's character never responds to simple things as we think any reasonable person could. And her delayed answers make it possible for most of these uncertainties to happen easily and unconvincingly, especially in the ending. Perhaps Swede was the wrong choice for this role; Too many babies faced a way that resembles the character of Kevin Anderson seen in his character in the film 'Sleeping With an Enemy'. Or, if Lisa Roberts is written as a stronger character, it might be enough. In the meantime, the movie is not very big, even as a low-budget B-thriller.
