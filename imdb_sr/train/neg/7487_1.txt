Unfortunately, this film is so bad. Original Out of Tovners was manic and very funny, of course, they used a script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, in this movie, the Neil Simons script is not used, so that it goes down again and again. Not even an audience I've ever laughed with. The direction is very slow and boring, and when a joke is given, the vic dies, i.e. Couple has sex in the park. They announce that it is a lighting ceremony for New York, but we all know that lights will light up and we will be able to see Sweet and Wealthy Goldie & Steve make a little slap. A whole movie appears like this ... a joke is set and given. Why Goldies did not mess with the film. You will also notice every closeness of Goldie (using very intense soft lenses). I suggest you rent an original with Jack Lemmon and Sandi Dennis, that's if you want to laugh.
