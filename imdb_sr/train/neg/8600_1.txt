Throughout the history of a low budget. this film must be one of the worst. The truth is that there are some comic scenes of the film, but in general it was simply terrible. I just can not understand what a person could not launch a bunch of snails. I think they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part that is in this movie is an attempt to bite your finger with a finger. It was pretty fun.
