The story is a bit slow and a bit stupid. Greta Garbo does not look good and I could not understand half the things she said about her accent, which was excessive for this role. Melvin Douglas, meanwhile, plays her usual role, and Constance Bennett is just so-so apart from a couple of her shouts, who were ridiculous. On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the movie. I wish he had more lines, as he disappeared in the second half of the story. Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon so young. I only saw her in those crazy roles she played from the late 60s to the 80s, and the old woman who was kicked out. The story was the best, and it may have been the last few minutes when we saw a stuntman make incredible things on the skis, pretending to be Douglas falling down a slope. It was incredible and humorous recording. All in all, I can see where this film - the last Garbov - was not successful at the office. He pulls too much, continues to keep on scams. It's a boring story. And Garbo knew that and called it a cancellation.
