Turkish cinema has a big problem. Directors are not interested in global cinema. They are local and folklore, but they want to be international. Such a film brings kitsch results. The film has jokes translated into Spanish from Turkish and have no meaning for non-Turkish audiences. Even for the Turkish audience after 10 years. Players, even Ferhan SENSOI have worse acting than average. They act like puppets. The film was filmed in Cuba, but nothing includes Cuba. So Cuba is thought of as a banana republic. Dispersing money, wasting time.
