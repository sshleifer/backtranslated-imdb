I've seen better films of teenage teenagers in my time, but this one takes a cake. More comedy than a horror, "Full Moon High" puts "c" into a cheese-fest. The quality of the star in this movie is not bad. Only the way it is made sends only rolling downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a 50-year-old American high school player who ends up not because of the aging of insects in Transylvania. The most unfortunate part of the movie was a violinist. He drove it all! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who finished his shot. Adam's father Alan plays a psychiatrist who does not seem to be at the top of the game. After all these years, Tony seems not to be in the spot because of the attack, and then he will get a chance to catch in his condition. More laughter than bloodshed, this film is just the beginning of the '80s, "Teen Wolf" is an improvement from this! 1 of 5 stars.
