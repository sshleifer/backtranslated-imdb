This is a very gentle and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most lively performances. I can only assume that the intention was to make the play accessible and comprehensible to an audience that has not been exposed to Shakespeare until now. By doing this, though - making each line clear and obvious - they emptied the game of life and turned it into a straight caricature. Somehow this is boring - a very difficult feat with such a wonderful material. The act is at best forgotten - Sam Waterston like Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, do not live so well. April Shavnham's hero is a powder, an air that leaves breathless and which often causes thunderstorms. Don John Jerry Mayer is a senseless cartoon character at the level of Snidela Vihplasha (although Snidlei was much more pleasant). F. Br. F. Murrai Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) Not in this version, unless he's dressed up and his name is removed from the loan. Given that the producer, Joseph Papp, is basically a theatrical god, this production is not only disappointing but also scratching the head. Do not bother. Instead, watch Branagh's Much Ado - his version is flooded with vitality and humor, not to mention wonderful performances.
