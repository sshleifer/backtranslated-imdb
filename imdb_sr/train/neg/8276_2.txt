I knew this film would not be amazing, but I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson so I thought he had the potential. Unfortunately, a large number of dialogues in the film was fake sound and cheese. I think that Akuafresh gave some money for the production of the film because they seriously dropped some indications. There is a clip in which Akuafresh indicates that you can not but notice it. Perhaps they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times we can drop Akuafresh's products into a movie, without people being annoyed. The film had its moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater.
