SPOILER: A young lover, Jed, was thrown out by anchors, Kate (Andie McDovell), because she mistakenly believes that Jed has an affair with one of her two catti friends. Kate thought she caught them. Kate throws Jade's shoes on the door. The squad reluctantly leaves, then sits down the middle of the road to put shoes on. Then the truck will be overrun ("Crushed", one of the meanings of the title). And he's dying. "And then the truck overtakes him." Can you imagine a scriptwriter who actually sends a script with this item? Until then, it is a comedy that intends to be sparkling, but it lacks any real rustle. Everyone except Jeda is just boring. And then they kill Jed, and they are all sad, all the way to the end where the gals learn to kiss each other and to support, not destructively. I give him 2 ughs.
