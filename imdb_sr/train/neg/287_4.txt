As an admirer of Altman, for years I have been looking for this film, thinking that with such a great acting I would have to be at least marginally brilliant. Big mistake. <br /> <br This is one of Altman's big mazmas, which are gathering randomly and improvising (or feeling so) with hope that they will all be gathered in the editing room. Not. As Maltin points out, this party stands out only for Alfred Voodard's debut performance, which surpasses the veterinarian all around her. But in addition, avoid at all costs. (It's pretty easy to do - it's never posted on the video - as far as I know - and the appearance of cables has the frequency of the Hallei comet.)
