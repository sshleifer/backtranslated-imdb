I just saw it at the Venice Film Festival and I can not decide on it. We were never allowed to get close enough to any character to take care of them. Maybe it was the point that we all were in our own balloon, but these people did not make me worry about them or I was shocked by their various fate. In the time that lasted just over an hour, the characters were not well developed. A lot of time has been dedicated to recordings of factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); and the dolls that look a bit creepy, with surprisingly realistic eyes, which made most of the characters life, were somehow more interesting than living people. An interesting experiment, but somehow it never complied.
