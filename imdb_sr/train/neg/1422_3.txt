The original Lensman series of the novel is a classic genre. It's pure SF adventure with some substance (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood did not record it literally because it's the kind of stuff they like: massive explosions, super-weapons, uro-heroism, the hero gets a girl, aliens (large CGI potential), good in relation to evil in the purest form, etc. etc. Instead, (and keep in mind that I'm an o-phile and anime lover) we get this horrible movie for the kids who discard all the Stories, mix in Star-Vars (ironic because they occasionally ripped books occasionally) pate and nonsense to the level of 'Thundercats'. To see the Kimball Kinnison, the portrayal of the Galactic Patrol officer and the second phase Lensman showed as a little boy, is poor (etc.). I just can not understand why the manufacturers did it because they obviously had the rights to the story and could make a lot more money (FAR!) Speaking straight. Does not make sense.
