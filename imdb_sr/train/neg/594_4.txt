I just hired Creep and was not impressed at all. I did not feel anything in this movie. I felt sick because only shock was shocking. I came out of my living room several times in despair, that something will happen with this film. Have not we seen all this before? I did not like any of the characters that are the type in the sewer cage. I felt bad for him. But again, I could not imagine why he was still alive, not killed by Creep? Many questions need to be answered. Someone mentioned the calls to PS2 game Silent Hill and vaguely see the similarities. It's not bad movie, it's not good. judge yourself.
