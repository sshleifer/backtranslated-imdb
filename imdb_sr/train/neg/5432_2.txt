The battle ship is tone ... His survivors, hanging on a nearby raft, are sitting there and doing nothing until we enter each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks. only the one you notice during the loan, everything that is in it is film due to Lean. And under technical conditions, it's very good. David Lean has just KNEV films from the very beginning. There are many instances in which Covard's studied dialogue took the second place, and Lean's visual meaning takes a central place. Try to get soldiers out of the ship at the end, and that whole scene; A recording of the hymn walk, a scene where we are in a bombed house. Noel Covard is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. It is completely wooden, it does not show emotion, character or humanity. In his eyes you can see that he really does not listen to what another performer says, he just waits for them to finish so he can get out of his line. 7/10. His episodic, somewhat repetitive, and flashbacks overwhelm the story: there is no central story that advances, just give a general insight into the characters. Still, his interesting movie is worth watching - and a good debut for Lean. It's not a very deep or prodigious movie, and it's definitely a propaganda movie, but it's also a showcase of Lean's editing skills - all about how pieces are made.
