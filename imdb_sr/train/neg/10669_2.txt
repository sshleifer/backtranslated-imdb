The Ensemble of Uninteresting and Unsuitable Characters turns and turns through a thin parcel that might be interesting, only to be able to take care. This "turning and turning" that I'm talking about does not relate to a story (which contains all the uncertainty of tuna recipes), but rather the impossibility of the director to keep face faces even distantly centered within the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear. The only real surprise in the movie are the great names that have convinced them to do it. When you consider that this movie was not released into the cinema, despite having actor stars, you may be inclined to think that something is stinking. I really have it.
