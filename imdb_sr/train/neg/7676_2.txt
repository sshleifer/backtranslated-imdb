I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad, I barely believed what I saw. There are no characters, only a few stereotypes wandering and killing. The degree of character development has given each character the name and interest, and that's all. There was no real complication and none of the characters had any motivation. In fact, many action scenes began by themselves, which came from nowhere with the techno track. As I watched this movie, I wondered, "Where does that happen? What's happening?" The acting was a high school drama, with a solid wooden delivery, as if the actors were reading from cards without understanding their lines. Their problems in delivering lines became even more apparent because of the awesome sound design. The ADR sounded like it was being shot in an open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to strike their tracks, looking almost robotically in their movements. So these idiosyncrasies are shifted through a series of incredible and confusing scenarios, often without the benefit of transitional scenes. They were here, they are right there. This happened, now it's happening. Random scenes with little rhythm or reason. It was fun to watch. It's definitely not worth nine dollars.
