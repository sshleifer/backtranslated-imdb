If I checked IMDB BEFORE renting this DVD from Netflik, I would have had a couple of hours of my life. I'm sincerely suspicious when I see that the film director wrote it. In this case, according to the allegations, the same guy was a "writer and director" - unfortunately, an indicator of the overall quality of this production. There were several interesting moments (for example, the scene by Judy Tenuta reminded her of her early comedy routines that were promoted by Judy-ism) that led me to evaluate these two stars and not one. However, these moments were few ... and I almost did not see them because the introductory section was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention the condemnation of her violence. I admit I'm back to look at that part again to see if I missed something that would help me figure it out if I saw the whole thing. No, even at least I recognized who the characters are that will be important later. The technique of the "rotating camera" was excessive and essentially meaningless. I found myself talking to the TV screen: "What?!?" or "For God's sake, be with him!" Not recommended.
