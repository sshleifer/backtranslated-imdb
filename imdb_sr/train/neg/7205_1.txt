If you like to watch what had to start as a two-hour movie in unrelated ramps of invisibility, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, you will just wonder how they could make such a movie out of something so simple to translate into a big screen as Inspector Gadget. In movie reviews, many scenes that were not in the film, and in the film, some scenes simply do not make sense. While the movie is less than an hour and a half, I can imagine just one really unforgettable moment, and it's just before or during a loan! <br /> <br />
