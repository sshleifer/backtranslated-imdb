An absolutely terrible Mexican film allegedly based on a short story by Edgar Alan Poa about a journalist who wants to get into an asylum shelter hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc. Considering the great performance of Dr. Maillard, the chief of asylum, we see all sorts of things that should be terrible, such as men who stay long in dungeon and comedy, as our hero joked by soldiers as climbing down the ladder which hangs over the building. Then there is a scene that could be both: a man dressed as chicken, yes, that's real chicken, which picks around the ground for chicken foods. The scene was supposed to be a comedy of the peak of the film, but, at least for me, it was the lowest point of the movie and really disgusting when you thought that adult men and women think it could be even fun. Ah! It's really the real horror that Dr. Tarr and his Legion change name. And that brings me to that fact about a movie that most movies that go through multiple titles change usually have some kind of serious problem. Yes, that's obvious, but some have distribution problems, and others, whose one is this, have a number of changes to the title so that someone can undoubtedly buy the same garbage more than once. This is definitely garbage. Very little goes for it. The only worthy looker is Claudio Brook as the chief of asylum. He is one huge plate of ham while laughing maniacally, changing orders, catching a sword in his hand and praising chicken. I was so tired of hearing him talking about a "soothing system" as his way of curing the mentally ill. What a bunch of madness (Hey, such a movie with this kind of script deserves this word). You will not have to understand for a long time what happens in asylum, nor will it be more interesting. Cinematic chicken scratch!
