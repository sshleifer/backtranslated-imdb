I do not understand why processing has become a trend. Every remake I've ever seen is terrible, and this is no exception. If any of you saw Ben Jones' quote, that it's a "piece of garbage", he's right. Why would I take a great TV show, which I loved, never missed an episode, and I have Season 1-4 on DVD, and ruin it, I will never know. Television broadcast was a family show, and although Daisi had a body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the show, except for clothes. The family show was turned into a dirty piece of garbage, and I would not recommend anyone to see it. Another thing that I did not like is that John Schneider and Tom Vopat are great actors (along with the rest of the original actor) and are also very sweet. New Bo and Luke are not a bit cute. It was one of the drawings for the show. Casting is terrible. At least they could get a brunette for Daisy. I do not think Burt Reinolds is not a qualified head of Hogg. Any other role he has ever played is completely opposite to that role. The only role played by half-decent is Villie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still not a comparison. Denver Pyle is his actor and it makes him perfect for the role. I think the casting is terrible, the story is terrible, and in the whole thing it destroyed a beautiful performance and turned it into a dirty, horrible movie. I would not recommend anyone to see him. I only saw from curiosity, and there was also a free ticket in the DVD of the 4th season. I would never pay to see this movie, but it was free. DO NOT PAY THIS FILM.
