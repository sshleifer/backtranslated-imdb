What is this ...? This must undoubtedly be the biggest loss of film, the environment and the camera ever. I know you can not put your expectations for the 80s, but this is too stupid to be true. I got this movie for $ 0.89 and I still feel the need to get the money back. Can you imagine who hardly killed him? Who is the violent killer in this movie and what are his motivations? Well, in fact, it was not easier for you. And why would you? Manufacturers of this piece of garbage certainly did not care. They did not try to create a little tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I guess it is much easier to find money with that name) was also made by Kindred (1986), who was quite comfortable, and he has recently survived the souls. Complete shit, but at least one had Eliza Dushka. This garbage has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who?) Yes, that's right, Melrose Place Chick. Her very important character dies about 15 minutes. after opening a loan. She's the other person dying. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but it seems that nobody is mentioned or missing and who cares? The rest of the actors ... they do not really deserve the term actors, they are completely uninteresting. You hope to die fast and painful dying ... and not just their characters <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
