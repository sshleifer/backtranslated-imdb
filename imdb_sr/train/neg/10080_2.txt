I had to search the actresses to find the record of this film because the title is now an unexpected love. It's not worth asking, but I did not know both of these potentials and I wondered why a lesbian movie was set up on Lifetime. Everything is rather restrained and you do not understand who these characters, as a spectator, have been able to become emotionally invested in the story. I guess I'm not the target audience for this, but I'm not sure who it is. Everything is muted and soft focusing and earthy tones ... nothing is interesting. I had a passionate interest to see two women, but it was so discreetly processed that I was disappointed. Instead, hire the best personally.
