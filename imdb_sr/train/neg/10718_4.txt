Come on, Tina Fei can be better than this. As soon as the film started, I knew how it would end. It must have been funny sometimes. Even laughing. But there is not enough laughter to save this movie. I do not recommend shopping. I highly recommend renting, but that's all. Babi Mama has some funny scenes, but she is predictable and she fails to get a hearty end for which he is striving. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fei and Amy Poalher worked great and worked well. But this is not the best. Babi Mama had great support. Dane Cook, Sigournei Veaver and Steve Martin add the size of the actors. Another film about pregnancy hit the world of film. After the great Knocked Up and Juno, Babi Mama looks very average when compared. Knocked Up and Juno are hilarious, cordial and have an ending that leaves you with a smile on your face. The ending of the baby Mama was inconvenient and boring. Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and she was not trying to be. I recommend it, but do not expect it to be totally ridiculous. Expect an average comedy that does not give a big emotional end to trying. I'm giving Babi Mama ..... 4/10
