I can not even believe that this show lasted for as long as it was. I suppose it's all part of the nonsense of America. Personally, as David Spade said, I liked this show much better when it came in the original title - "Seinfeld". What is most troubling to me in this show, in addition to the obvious, basic sense of "humor" and general sensitivity, is the pretentious way in which episodes are called. The really great shows are still funny after many repeated reviews, such as "where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized," to "Dick Van Dike Shov," or "where Luke and Ethel work in a sweets factory." In other words, it is an honor given by the viewers to large programs. In order for writers and producers of "Friends" to have an irrepressible pride to actually call episodes, and themselves, in such a way, before anyone even had the opportunity to see it the other time, speaks not only of the mediocrity and lack of original thinking by the aforementioned writers, but also the deadened minds of their viewers. You read the comments of some of these people and you can only come to the conclusion that they live in the Hallmark Card-Neverland, full of sentiment greeting cards. True meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people should work in cafes and look for work as actors, but somehow they manage to live in $ 4000 / mo. apartments? Be Realistic. All I have to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live an idyllic life in New York with your Rosses and Monica, happily with all that. This New York City does not exist for anyone who makes less than a serious six-lane income. But, happy with all that, anyway. Now, shut up and pass Som.
