This is a really horrible movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. At the same time it is mild and offensive, with nudity and a lot of violence. However, the nakedness is not so exciting, and the violence is repeated and it's boring. Also, the plot is at best weak, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and acting is some of the worst I've ever seen. I heard this film should be funny, but not. I did not laugh once when I watched her, nor did I even smile. The producers of this film tried to combine comedy with action movie and failed in both cases. Some bad films are funny because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.
