If you have not discovered what will happen in this film in the first five minutes, then give it a few more minutes. Lilia is a widow. She has been left on the shelf for too long and wants to burst. She has a daughter of a teenager who only emphasizes that she does not become younger. While checking for her daughter, she discovers a world that has never dared ... cabaret, where she can dance in scarce clothes with embroideries while men throw money on her. The film is very misogamatic. Showing people is sad. Which is rather weird as Lilia descended to bypass them, not for money, but only for hell. When she succeeds in arousing them, she seems to feel again as a woman. She does not want to connect with them, but she is addicted to attention. Other dancers are mostly older women who look like men in retreat and realize that their time is at the center of attention short. I'm not saying briefly enough. She finds romance, no matter how short, with you. You have not seen any surprises here. Though the end is good, you realize that he could not finish the other way. Perhaps this film simply does not target my demographic population
