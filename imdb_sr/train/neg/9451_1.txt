I've seen some bad things in my time. A half-dead cow trying to get out of the mud; head of a collision between two cars; a thousand plates that break down on the kitchen floor; human beings live like animals. But I never saw anything bad in my life as a Cat in a hat. This film is burnt out of 911, worse than Hitler, worse than the Gulf Impaler, worse than people who put kittens in microwave ovens. It is the most admirable movie of all time, easy. I used to think it was a joke, some sort of joke, and that Mike Miers might be a drug addict who killed cocaine and who killed drugs and who lost a bet or something like that.
