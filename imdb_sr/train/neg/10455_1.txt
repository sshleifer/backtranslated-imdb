$ 25,000 Pyramid Clues: Deep Blue Sea. Tremors. Slither. Eight Legged Freaks. Piramida Category: Movies that were more fun and exciting than Snake on the plane. To the devil, with this definition I would have to include a relatively disturbing journey by Ted and Elaine on the plane! as superior to the snakes in both laughter and excitement. The sad truth is that this is not even close to the mother of all the deliberately intentional funny snake movies: Anaconda! In addition to never again seeing the role of JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Vuhrer in the same film, Jon Voight has withdrawn all the time of the film robbery. His final scene is everything that SOAP tried to do and failed to do as a movie "so crazy - it's fun". Finally, Snakes on the plane are definitive evidence that studio studio and fanbois make possible the worst associates. Every big scene was discussed and so much spread last year, all that was left to be fun with the opening was the amount of fanoviszny sweat that had to be erased in my theater. I heard more forced laughter than in studio recording for "By Jim".
