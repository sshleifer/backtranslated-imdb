Okay, first of all, Steve Irvin, rest in peace. Many fans love you. Now ... this movie was not a movie at all. It was a TV program "A crocodile hunter," with bad acting, bad scripts, and poor directing between Steve, who caught us or taught us about animals. He was as fun as an animal seeker / specialist. Millions will miss him. But the whole idea of ​​the movie was a big mistake. The plot was so broken that it was almost non-existent. Casting was terrible. The act was not even worthy of elementary actors. The direction must be wrong. If you can not get half the decent performance from your actors, no matter how bad the script is, you should not be so good. I could write a better script. I wish I never saw this movie. Of course, I watched him for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son.) While I was with friends who insisted to see this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so discriminative, loved the film in order, but he still did not ask to see him again. If you want nice memories of Steve Irwin, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this film as a plague. If I were Steve, I know I would not want to remember me for this movie. Respect It: Avoid This Movie!
