This film is so enthusiastic about the "demon" and it's the only thing that makes a movie worth watching. The acting is terrible, action scenes are accelerating, the script is almost painful and the budget does not exist. If you think this movie is good then you have not seen a real horror movie, skip this and take a copy of the demon movie.
