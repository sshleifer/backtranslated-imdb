the more I think about it, nothing has been rectified about it Film. I saw it 9 months ago, so my memory could have been worse than it was, but I know it was at least bad as 4 of 10. After I looked at the movie, I met the director. he looked so meaningless about what he did or what he did, and as far as I could tell, he did not care for the movie either. he even agreed that he really did not know what he was doing, and he was forced to do certain things because he was shot digitally. I felt that the film is trying to fit into the formula it made for itself: "9 people must be connected in some way. Can we get from the point 'A' 'to the point' B ', so get it from the prostitute you see at the beginning and back to it at the end of 10 minutes of each person's relationship with another person. It makes you feel quenched with a 2 dimensional, poorly drawn character.Steve Bouchemy has a scene in which she is amazing. That's it, as I say ... 4 out of 10.
