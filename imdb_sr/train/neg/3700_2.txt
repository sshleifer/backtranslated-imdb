because this is the only way you will not think this film TOTAL is a waste of time and money. Remake "Heaven Can Vait" (which is at least worth watching) is a bad excuse for a romantic comedy. It's more a vehicle that gives Rock a while for a bad comedy movie that does not play well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes were mostly from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man, but they are depicted from Roque himself. How they offend black people and whites, chemistry is all wrong. The film is not ridiculous, the actress is poorly recorded, at best it is weak. Go to "Heaven Can Vait" and live rock video and you will be far ahead of the game.
