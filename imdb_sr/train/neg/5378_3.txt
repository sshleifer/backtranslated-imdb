I watched this film without expecting much, I got it in a package of 5 movies, which were pretty terrible in my own way for the five, so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, everyone was terrible, this movie has several (and a few stretches) interesting points, the occasional look of the camcorder is a nice touch, the drummer is very similar to the drummer, i.e. In fact, the problem is that it is just so boring, in what I can only assume that an attempt to build tension, much does not happen, and when it makes it extremely tiring (a thumb I put on a speed) a button for the front, ready to push for most of the film, but it went) and he is seriously the lead singer of the band that looks great, because they do not mention half how wonderful, I thought a lot, I thought he looked a bit like meercat, all this, and I did not even have I mentioned the killer, I will not even get into it, but it's just not worth explaining. In any case, as far as I'm concerned, Star and London are the only reason to watch this, and apart from London (which was actually quite funny), it was not because of their acting talent, I certainly saw a lot of things. worse, but much better. It is best to avoid being bored with bored looking color.
