My first exposure to the Templars is not good. I was thrilled to find this title among the offers from Anchor Bai Video, which brought us other cult classics such as "Spider Babi". The quality of the print is excellent, but this can not hide the fact that the film is deadly. There is an exciting opening sequence in which villagers point out the terrible revenge to templars (and launch everything), but everything else in the movie is slow, difficult and, finally, unfinished. Adding insult to injuries: The film is synchronized, not titled, as promised in a video jacket.
