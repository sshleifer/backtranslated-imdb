Before watching "Dahmer," I thought that no film could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. To summarize the "Dahmer" above, it's a story of a gay serial killer who has almost no murder and almost entirely consists of Dahmer's gay men before they were killed. There is no complication that could be found, and there is no purpose that tells us anything about Dahmer. All you'll learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men. Terrible acting, horrible director, terrible writing, terrible everything ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and returning the projectile for three hours, go with vomiting ... it will be less painful .....
