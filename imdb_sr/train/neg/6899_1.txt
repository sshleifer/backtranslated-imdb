Have you ever wondered why Pacific Islanders automatically take on the sense of humor of black Americans? regardless of their ethnic origin? This film will not provide any answers to this often-considered issue - but will provide an excellent case study. which immediately questions the exact meaning of such a task. Was this meant to perpetuate the entrenched stereotypes of New Zealand inhabitants on the Pacific Islands? or intends to take advantage of this potential market? The story is poor, the joke is humorous, and the end is expected. This film did not do anything for a cinema in New Zealand, because it is just a romantic comedy that has no merit.
