Another case of a decent DVD that issues movie quality. It was not so bad. Rochon does a good job and a curse! cast is a good look. I've never seen many men usually hang out together. This movie really wanted to think Rochon was a killer, but that was not the case. My biggest problem with the movie was that I did not really care much about who the killer was, and the real killer did not make any sense, because it was unusual and the filmmakers thought 'ha, betcha did you see the one coming, fool! 'Yes, there were continuity-related mistakes (mostly with Mrs Rochon's constantly changing wardrobe), but for the indie slasher it's not that bad. I was pretty sure at the beginning that it was just a thinly concealed excuse for girls to go to toples, but it was just a trick. The dialogue was sometimes excessive and painful. We just do not have great expectations in this, and it will not be that bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's name is beautifully underestimated.
