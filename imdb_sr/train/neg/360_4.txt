I read the book and really enjoyed it from start to finish. However, when I saw a movie, I was very disappointed. First, there was no disrespect for Deborah Raffin, but she was too mature to play a woman from 24/25. The late Christopher Reeve was also wrong - the same reason. Vill, according to the book, was about 30. I would like to see a little more research into his military life, his friend Red, Elli's journey to see him as an important part of the development of the story line. Also, Miss Beaslei was wrong, because the book wrote that she was the Plus size lady. I know that the film did not have a budget "Bridges Of Madison Counties" that I believe was published at the same time. But for me this was a very badly made, low budget, miscast movie. As somebody mentioned, I want Miss Spencer to get out of retirement and write scripts for her books the way they should be. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope she will think about it. Film failed me!
