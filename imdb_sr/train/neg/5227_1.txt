........ and extremely bad in that !!! How long has this wreck of the train gone? 14 episodes or something? Now I see why. I bought the episode "Serenity" from Amazon Unboked. It was my first purchase, so I was free. It's ONLY a good thing about the incident (incident) I will not comment really on the act, because it was, it must have been, that quite new people who did not really get the job are still right. At least I've never seen them before in any kind of big show, theater or television. If I did, then I easily forgot them. But the special effects were absolutely terrible. True, this is not just a multi-million dollar $$ project, but the original Star Trek was better than this and it was thirty-five years ago. I was particularly laughing at the bad guys (reapers or something like that) of the ship while he was hunting the hideous Firefly, and from the engine there was a smoke that looked like a giant rocket. I fully expected that I would finally see Vilei Coiote at the top, as they would run for Roadrunner. MODERN jet / rocket engines do not even work so badly. And it was not even the worst. A wild west gunner asked me if I was watching a movie from Sci-fi or Gene Autry. Regardless of the hyps, do not waste your time ... it's ... all 80 minutes of a catastrophe called "Firefly".
