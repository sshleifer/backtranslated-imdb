The movie is pretty fun and involves about four dates, and then it becomes an obvious ad for someone who (and even his "friends") really does not stand it. It's a pretty interesting concept; movie dates in search of true love in modern LA. The problem is that sometimes it feels incredible (and bad) scripted and obviously self-promoted. It's hard to worry and get into any of the characters because the writer / actor is so egoistic, rude, untrue, and simply unsuitable. In the end, he regrets his meetings.
