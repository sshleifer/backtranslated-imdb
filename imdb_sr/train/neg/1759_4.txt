This effort was like a glamorous TV movie ... I do not remember it ever being published in theaters ... If so, it must have died fast. Looking at the DVD, in the comfort of our bedroom, it was obvious that this film is intended not much more ... Ed Lauter is an art critic with greed? What a fun turn that must have been ... I did not see Eda from "The Longest Iard" ... All the rest were mostly playing the numbers, which were led by Baldwin, except Pompe ... She had zero charisma and it seemed as if sleeps in most of the pictures ... Pompe's daughter had one dimension ... she played every scene like a pretty little puppy ... the slowest delivery line of any 3 years I've ever seen ... Br /> Scenes in a hurry gave my wife and my headaches ... too fast and angular hitting ... If you want to record a scene in Barcelona, ​​you may be eljet several videos to take advantage of the beauty of your background, right? The whole story was quite incredible and amazing, but hey, we liked better than "The Life Akuatic ..."
