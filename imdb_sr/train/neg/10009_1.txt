This film is a huge burden. Paul Schrader is completely lost in his bad scenario. His direction is as comatized as it may be without the fact that he actually was in the month during the process. Worst of all, however, is Voody Harrelson, whom I usually love when he is properly thrown. He plays a "walker", a homosexual man in D.C. who plays a social companion to the boring women of the Washington elite. He could not have been more dimensional if he had been cut out of the magazine and jumped in front of the camera on a stick with a pot. Its "southern accent" is the one-off "rack" version that shrinks from the beginning to the end of each line it delivers, as if the heat and humidity of the south still exhaust every amount of energy it has. It's monotonous. But he is not the worst accent in the film. His "boy", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, is trying to influence some kind of accent in the Middle East, which is so clumsy that he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him. He is incapable of driving his goods despite the fact that he is in real life a German, and speaks several languages ​​- one of them is Italian! That's a good reason to throw someone else, do not you think? From stories, to scripts, to directing, to working with the camera, to the performance it leads, this movie is bad from start to finish. The only supportive moments in this film came from three auxiliary actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to survive this film with their dignity in the clock. In fact, all three are great, despite being trapped in a really bad movie. Unfortunately, no one could ever be good enough to buy this endless series of defects. If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.
