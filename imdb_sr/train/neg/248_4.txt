When will the pain stop? I never want to see another version of Christmas Carol. They continue to make movies with the same story, fall to each other in an attempt to make the film better than others, but unfortunately they do not, because that's not a good story. Moral, old-fashioned, conservative happy thoughts. It's like people are learning. Numerous versions of this film prove that we do not do it.
