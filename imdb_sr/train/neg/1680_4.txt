Even with a plaster that can boast of such generally trusted names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrov, Earth of Miracles fails to provide a sense of depth to this film. She barely cleans the surface of the incidents that happened that night in July 1981. Kilmer only goes through moves such as John Holmes and Kudrov and Kate Bosworth both hoping in the other two leading roles; like Holmes' wife and a little girl. The rest of the actors have such small roles that it is impossible to get any dimension from them. Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Frankie G, MC Gainei, Dilan McDermott and comedy from Paris Hilton are also in the film.
