Reading my review of HOUSE THREAMED, many can assume that I am a 14-year-old who thinks SCREAM is considered a "classic" horror. This is not the case, because I am 30 years old and most of my life I watch horror movies. But, yes, I'm a child of the 80s who grew up on a slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal, etc. ... types of horror movies - so I usually prefer horror films that are graphic and faster. Just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting, or in this case a movie - but I do not necessarily love them - I can figure out why some people can enjoy this kind of movie ... I just do not ... <br /> A HOUSE THAT IS BREAKING is an extremely boring and boring movie about a school for unrighteous girls. A hard-working mistress in the school has an iron hand (or whip in some cases ...) to keep the girls in order. She has a young son crawling around and looking at girls as they shower (in her nights there are no less (?!? ...), and in the meantime, girls disappear from school because they are victims of a killer who is lurking about the campus ... I see why the HOUSE WHO RETURN is often compared to SUSPIRI (which in my opinion is the masterpiece of the film ...), in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between girls and their guardians - but this film is So boring and insignificant I could hardly stay awake. I'm about "tension" and "uncertainty" in horror films - but this film was not even held for me. Fortunately, I did not expect much to go into this, so I can not say that I was really disappointed - the HOUSE OFFICIAL has only strengthened the fact that I personally do not enjoy most of the horror films much older than the 70's. This is not a difficult and quick rule, but it definitely seems that those I enjoyed are more an exception. Probably "must-see" for horror fans who enjoy underrated and suggestive horror films - but since I do not know too many fans of this type of material, I can not quite recommend this ...
