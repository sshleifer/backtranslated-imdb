"I Love New York" is another VH-1 (MTV NetVers) video that shows the funny side of the funny, disgusting, women. It must have been an easy decision to take the farthest, craziest competitor speaking to the Ebonics - and her mother - and to appear on this network. Many will argue: "this is a performance." True, it's not as bad as the previous show "Flavor of Love" - ​​but it's just as bad. It reminds me of a 90-odd live-action live show in which Keenan Ivory Vaans imitated Mike Tison's boxer on The Love Connection and chose "Robin Givens" for the meeting. Mike was talking about how the date was fine, but how the sour mother kept her. This performance reminds me of this. Men are selected and given their names to be degraded and the woman they are having fun with. more - (I think an intelligent man who wants an intelligent wife would not allow - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto, you'll be embarrassed every time you appear on TV.) professional actors of reality, so why to torture yourself. It avoids me to discover what's so fun in this. The fact that this is as fake as her new implant? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising time for the network? (Well, you can not hate them because they're trying to make money.) Maybe it's a miracle - who would want to be with this woman for the past hour? Or they wonder if she and her mother will be on VVF! In any way you cut it, it's a wreck of a train that you have seen countless times, so that the value of the shock to zero has so far been. Without twisting or turning this will be more interesting wreckage train, or any other than anybody else. Calling on the smallest common denominator and for those who call the "end" of real shows, this is just another nail in the suitcase for why they should be done right away.
