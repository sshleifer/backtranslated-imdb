Tim Robbins is strangely benign here, thrown as a mechanic in a garage in the 1950's in Nev Jersey who falls in love with a lively blonde who turned out to be the nephew of Albert Einstein! Although he is on the screen for most of the time, Robbins cancels the internal functioning of his intense personality and fades into the background (it's easy to forget that even in the picture!). Lumpi is a romantic comedy with a trick, that Valter Matthau played Einstein (who does what he can with a caricature-conceived character). Otherwise, it's cute and sunny, which was quite dumbfounded by Fred Schepisi, who shows the heart, but not brain or brain. Meg Rian is her usual kind person, and the chemistry between her and Robbins is charming, like her from a kind sister and her big brother. ** from the ****
