Good God, whoever made this party should be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other reviewer can not watch this movie, he has to look something else, or never see a movie ... 9 out of ten stars? He says what, this is the same as Ben Hur or Spirited with the wind? Unintentionally ridiculous, massively incredible characters, absurd situations, seems to have been filmed in Griffith Park (which works pretty well - MASH is filmed in Griffith Park), a fucking script, just about everything that could be wrong in the film in one package. It would be necessary to watch for all future filmmakers as an example of how a movie can be terribly wrong. It reminds me of what the USC student can do for film lessons. Give this pass if you do not take drugs and enter the high camp.
