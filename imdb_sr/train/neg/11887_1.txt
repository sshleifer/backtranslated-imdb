The world may have ended up. Unfortunately, this film has survived as yet another evidence of a Canadian impossibility to record films that go beyond conviction. Perhaps this is because all our really good people (Norman Jevison, Martin Short and others) go to Hollywood.) In fact, it's very bad. Maybe he gave him some credibility. The Canadian government should understand - and this film is a magnificent example - that pushing money into the trough does not result in a good movie. If people who gathered in these public funds had to compete, they could have been forced to think something worthwhile. As it is, they have produced another malicious shame.
