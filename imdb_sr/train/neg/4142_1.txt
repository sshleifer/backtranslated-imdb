This is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen! There was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. I've seen some bad movies, but this has been filmed. There is no plot and much of the movie, or you quickly rewind the movie to speed it up or wonder what the hell is going on, because you can not seriously think anyone thought about this movie and watch it. I'm sorry anyone who has to go through this painful hour and a half. Please, listen to my advice and do not watch this movie because I know you will think it's the biggest waste of time you've ever spent in your life.
