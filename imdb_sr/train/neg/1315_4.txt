Oliver Hardy wakes a hangover and soon finds out that his uncle comes to see Aldi's new wife and baby. The problem is they do not exist - Ollie obviously made them! Therefore, it is up to him and his friend to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to represent him as his family. This is not a particularly unique idea of ​​stories, as I have at least seen a few more quiet short trousers with this exact complication. The best of them was Bobbi Vernon, NOT ME ME KID. Much better than ONE TOO MANI - probably a lot because it was made a decade later - when the comedy became a bit more sophisticated and less relied on a senseless slapstick. Now I am not against physical comedy, but in some films, people began to shoot wildly, to hit and drown each other, etc. With a little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of one thing, this is exactly what they are doing. None of this makes any sense and it was as if they were running out of the idea for a story. Overall, it's not really a milestone in the party. There's simply not enough payback to watch it, unless you're an obscure silent fan like me.
