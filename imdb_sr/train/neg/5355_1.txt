Now I do not hate cheap movies. I just can not see why you would spend money on a movie that you could capture with your dad's cameras. If I rent a movie, I want to be a movie, not a bunch of people who think it would be a good idea to spend some MiniDV tapes. Perhaps this I hate so much because the guy in the videotape said it's great, and it's not. Maybe I hate him because he's cheap, he has the dumbest story EVER, the most unrealistic characters ever and really, really, really BEST SHOP in the history of EVER movies. Not even Tom Savini can save it. Seriously, this is a complete waste of time.
