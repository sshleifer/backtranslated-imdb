A woman (Silvia Kristel) seduces a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brovn). They have sex ... but everything is related to some stupid plot or something. Easy is one of the most exciting sex comics ever. Does anyone understand that this movie creates a light of child abuse? I suppose that's okay because it's a teenager-if we had him with a man who seduced a teenager, he would (rightly) be insulted. I'm sorry, but it's not done to the boy. He's still sick. I realized that Brovn was an adult (he was actually 18 years old when this was done), but he seems to be worrying that some people think this is okay. - but it can not work, Brown is easily one of the worst children's actors I've ever seen), and a constant nudity becomes boring and not even erotic. I saw this shit I was 19 years old and with my 14 year old cousin (who could easily pass 18). He wanted to see him - I did not, but I decided what the hell? We went in and bought tickets for three teenagers who were obviously underage. My cousin thought it was boring and left three other children halfway! Let me clarify this - three TEENAGE BOIS left a film with a tone of female nudity! That should give you an idea of ​​how bad this is. I'm surprised that it's ever been published. 1 to the end.
