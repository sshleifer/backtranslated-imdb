I must say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They had a pretty good story to go on, but then it was so messed up. First of all, the actors are all wrong, from where came this van (dumb actor) and puff daddy? Carlito seems to have come from a hood, and sometimes he hung with some real idiots. This film does not make Carlitos Vai any justice. I am so happy that the sequel to Carlit's Road came out first, that I saw this garbage for the first time, I would never give a chance to the Pacino version. In any case, the pacino was supposed to read this story, he thought it was bullshit and he continued with the sequel. Carlit's Way: Stand Up in Power - 1 out of 10. Carlit's Road - 9 of 10.
