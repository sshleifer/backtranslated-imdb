The lower part of Freddie's bureaus. This is the worst movie in the series, winning the "Freddi's Revenge" for this title. Cheap look (with central special effects), incoherent confusion, with Freddy who has become a punter. It has one or two cold lines, but this does not save this illogical and messy sequel.
