I can not believe how much this is trash! I want back $ 3.99! The words defy the description of this bad shit! Synchronization does not in any way shape or shape the actor's roles. The film seems to have been shot by an old camcorder from the 1970s. I shot better movies with my camera. Gore is funny because of the stupid incredible plot. The acting is what you can expect if you invite all your friends on Saturday afternoon and continue to completely dissipate and then try to put the show in your garage. Do not misunderstand me ... I did not expect O'Neil and I to love Zombie movies, but the production values ​​are so low in this movie to make them invisible. Avoid!
