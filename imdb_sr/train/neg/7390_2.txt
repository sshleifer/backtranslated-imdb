How do you spit on a laughing fat Italian who barely pulls a movement for martial arts without the need for some medication for the heart? In this film, we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of achievement - since his career began, it was a steady decline in the pathetic behavior of the behavior that sank his career. In this film, most of his training seems to have been ordered futcini alfredo every day in his restaurant. He is fat, slow and very old in this movie, hardly an action hero of martial arts, More like a clown who laughs. It's time for Steven Seagal to withdraw - the film is about 2 hours of why. Plot: a fat Italian guy with great reputation in power gets the news that a criminal group might be playing with drugs designed by the military to create the ultimate war response. This claim, although pathetic and funny, gives the opportunity to some of the top combat struggles that include blasting through walls as a strip. Have I mentioned that this movie is totally crap and that Steven Seagal is a complete joke? Yes. I did.
