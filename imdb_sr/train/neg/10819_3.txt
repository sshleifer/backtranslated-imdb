I agree with one of the other writers of commentary on a good story and good actors, but incompatible, and I would also say that it hurried. It's been about 24 years since I read the book as in school. But I felt that you would have to know the story of Jane Eira when you were watching this, because the parts were left out and that makes no sense. For example, Jane & Mr Rochester barely talked and suddenly suggested marriage !!! Actors do not have time to let the audience know how their character feels about every thing that happens in the story. Actors are good, but they do not have time to do this story of justice. I'm sorry to say that, but I did not really enjoy this version. The 1970 version with Susanna Iork and George C Scott would be a Jane Eire movie about my preference. & Timothy Dalton in 2 main roles. I love it so much that I watch it regularly. There is a short version that runs 225min or full version for 330min.
