Believe it or not, this movie is worse than the number three. It's slower, the acting is worse, and the story is very weak. There is not much to say about this movie. Number three, and I would think it's impossible. This is a very slow 90 minutes. Sick, in fact. I stuck it, hoping it would be better. cheap rent it.it is hard to find (for shopping, that is) and probably for good reason. as number three, this film has nothing to do with the first two. I can give Best of the Best: No warning is 2/10
