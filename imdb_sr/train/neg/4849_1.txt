I just rented this today ... I've heard many good reviews before. VOV !! What a bunch of rice poo this movie !! Does anyone know the director's address, so I can get my five dollars? Finally, someone got "Stop-loss" from "Worth Iraq Var Movie Ever" in the first place. To be honest, I think there are no good war films in Iraq anyway, but this is really bad. I will not indulge in any technical inaccuracies, there are a hundred reviews of other GVOT veterinarians who describe them in detail. If the director tries to consult even the lowest E-Nothing about technical precision, they could still make the movie more realistic .... maybe. I guess the writer should have been given "merit" for this loss of the film. Obviously, he pulled out a plot for this film from a living imagination that did not come to the limitation of reality. Is anyone, except me, wondering what the meaning of this film is? Was there a message? Seriously though ..... VTF ??? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty amazed by all the positive reviews. This movie is difficult to watch as a veterinarian for all obvious inaccuracies, but even if it can be overlooked, the action is bullshit, the characters are shallow (at least) and the act is at best bad at best. Ironically, I suppose this film should be about the disposal of explosive devices, because it is the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
