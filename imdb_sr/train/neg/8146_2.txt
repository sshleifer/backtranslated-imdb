First viewed 7/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): Pretty lame gangster movie about a Brooklyn-like family, who loves to say four words and kills people. The only thing that was interesting here was their attempt to show that the Feds are much like gangs. This is the only attempt to make a good movie. The rest of the film was predictable and cheap. The quality of the photo on some of the bars and flicker scenes has almost doubted that there is a problem with your DVD player due to poor contrast, and some of the actors were hard to hear sometimes because of bad sound. The acting was pretty much the character of all your favorite gangsters from better filmed banner movies such as Vinnie `Knuckles 'and Jimmie` Tattoos', and the shop largely followed these patterns. So, go see a better gangster movie before you put your money on this one.
