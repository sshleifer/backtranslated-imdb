If there is some strange inverse Oscar Academy Awards, this film will win everything. It has all gods, great plot, extreme special effects combined with extremely good acting skills and of course there is a star in every role. Well, this could be a scenario if the world is reversed, but it's not. Instead, it's the worst horror film ever made, not just bad actors who obviously read scripts from teleprinter with poor dyslexia, but also extremely low on special effects. For example, the costume of the devil (which had to be seen by the way) is the most funny thing I have ever seen. Whenever I saw a red-black so-called monster on the screen, I could not keep my laugh. And to the top of things, it seemed like a funny creature was driven by a conveyor belt. Do not make the same mistake as I do. Having checked IMDB that the film was released in 2003, he had less than five votes and he thought, "Well, it's worth shooting, it can not be that bad." Yes, I could. /> I will not even lose more words on this movie.
