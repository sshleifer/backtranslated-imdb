I grew up on the theatrical version of 'Superman II' ('S2T') and as a kid I liked more than the first part, because not only contained Superman and three Superman worms, but started with a scratch? ? Best Clark Kent for Superman Transformation and Rescue Scene. Children no longer had to eagerly wait for Superman to appear on the screen, as in the first part. Now as an adult, I can see how powerful they are with S2T (see: my review). The story of how prematurely and unjustly fired the original director, Richard Donner from II. (It must have been then that it was rare to record two separate films at the same time, now it's common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 and 3, for example.) Unfortunately, after I finally saw Richard Donner Cut (or, S2RD "). I still can not fully recommend it. She left, there was a big Superman change scene, the entire Paris rescue, and a wonderful recapitalization of the first part of the S2T's opening. In fact, everyone wrote the words: "Previously in Superman?" and S2RD. Special effects were not great neither in part I nor in S2T, but S2RD were mostly funny? such as Lois from the Daili Planet window. I admit, some new scenes were working, and some went out and welcomed the departures, like any scene in the "honeymoon suite". All in all, if you grew up on S2T like me, and loved him as a child ?? not like I'm an adult, you absolutely need to see S2RD because it's almost a whole new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change is the last: a strange kiss of amnesia from S2T has also gone, replaced with the same end as 'I.' This is not just a lazy, non-original dance, it does not make sense why Clark would return to the restaurant, if those events never really happened. And will it continue to "return time" for each conflict?
