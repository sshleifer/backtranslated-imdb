In 1988, Paperhouse was greeted as a "horror film of thought". Wow, you can say, sign me. This thing is a mess. There is a young actress who has a range of 1 to 2. G. Headlei with a bad British (synchronized) accent, and a story without a night, excitement or spill. Not even an interesting psychopathol. You'll just laugh with your cheap effects and long for the display of Leprechaun 5. In the story it's about a gallbladder who runs in her dreams. What you get is not a good horror, art house or even a decent specialty after school. I found myself after a two-hour plea .. where I was two hours. The direction is non-inspiring and I wish it could even be pretentious ... something interesting .. it looks like the manufacturers were on lithium. Even in the world of dreams things are boring. Briefly on this.
