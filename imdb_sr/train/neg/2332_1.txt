What was the purpose of this film? I suggest that a handful of actors and their producers and directors have made a big salary for nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, could not keep my interest in this boring movie. A former ex-pugilist falls into a strange woman and her relatives. He starts as a fixed man for a woman, and ends up with a piercing man and caught in a hijack scheme. It was so confusing that I can not even write a decent critique. If you see this, my sweet, make sure it is after dark, so you can go to sleep.
