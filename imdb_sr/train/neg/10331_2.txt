God, I got tired of my head as I watched the pilot. I had a lot of expectations because I'm a big fan of James Cameron (and not just Titanic, I would add), and his name in the credits that I thought would be a guarantee of quality (again, he also wrote Lead Strange Dais ..). But the thing failed because it attracted me attention at any point of almost two hours. For all that time, it hardly crossed its two-way synopsis, and it would be very hard for me to try to figure out any kind of coherent complication of all the riots that went nowhere. Above all, I do not think the acrobatics surpassed even those in the regular episode "A-Team". As far as Alba is concerned, yes, she is beautiful, of course, but the fact that she shows only one expression of the face of the whole movie (pouti and surli), I also think my "gal vit" attitude is stunning pretty fast. You can count me out of this, Mr. Cameron!
