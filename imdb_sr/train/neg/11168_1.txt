- The Mexican priest is becoming a wrestler to save an orphanage or something like that - I went to see this movie because it's a non-VVF wrestling, so I thought it might be fun. It was not. It's annoying to watch. Shocking. Every and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly wasted. I admit I do not like Jack Black anyway anyway. After this, I smashed my brain to come up with a good role that he did. The only thing I can think of is where it is located. was a necessary foil to the character of John Cusack in 'High Faith'. Jack Black is one of those terrible, tough guys with cockroaches (such as little fat in Abbot and Costell or Jerry Levis) who should be said to be too idiotic is not the same as being ridiculous. It is not even slapstick. It's just annoying. It's not even scary, it's just stupid. I heard the good stuff about Napoleon Dynamites, but if it's any of it, I will not be hurrying to find it on a DVD.
