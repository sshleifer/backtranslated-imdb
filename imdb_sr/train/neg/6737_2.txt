If Deborah Messing was not already portrayed as "Grace", it could be a tolerable movie. However, this is just another story about a frustrated young person with problems, who is hired by a paid escort (Dermot Mulronei) about which in the Time magazine writes to travel to London for his sister's London wedding. How much is this new store? Neither funny nor romantic, the date of the wedding moves through the story of incredible sex by the bridesmaid and the best man, and pays escorts to go away from the movie like Four Weddings without Hugh, and definitely a blind street for a naive youngster who is not referred to the sexual history of his bride (Ami Adams). While Messing perfected the suppressed princess, a 30-year-old woman with an unsuccessful relationship history, her neurotic and drunken moves to another fauk beau is simply a rewriting of her TV series. If this woman is an actress, you get a role that does not reconsider what is already in the hitting term. Many drunken female relationships, visual cricket jokes and Mulronei in the towel (nice!), But the movie is boring with an obvious happy ending. Expected Messing extension: Divorce date.
