It's pretty unrealistic what these flies can do ... well, well ... this is a cartoon, so everything can happen in it. Unfortunately, this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a list of shortcomings: 1) I quoted a line of tags. This suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I did not see any, at least not something I never saw before. At least they could make them black. But cyan flies, seriously? With huge heads and thin torsos? 3) Story. I suppose it's written for six-year-olds. I could say in two sentences that it is so simplified. 4) Extreme patriotism. For example: "They are, however, an American file!" Oh, let me go.
