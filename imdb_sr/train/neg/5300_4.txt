I'm one of the millions of addicts around Columbus around the world and I've just watched this episode that started off on the British Channel 5. who noticed the enormous potential of "Columbo" and added all the fine details that made him so beautiful and classical. In this regard, this film is not as good as the rest (except for the unfavorable final episode and sponsored British episodes). If Columbo was made by the original 'pilot', he certainly would not last long, or be watched and loved all over the world. In this film, Lt Columbo is smartly dressed, riding a normal car, having a partner, not talking about his alleged relatives and encountering himself as quite aggressive. There is no chemical between the cats and the mouse between Kolumba and the "villain". It can be watched, but only because of the novelty of how Columbo started.
