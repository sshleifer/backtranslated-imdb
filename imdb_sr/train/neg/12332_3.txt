The movie looks great on paper. A romantic comedy in which a crazy lover enters the smuggling thriller should be a general crossing of gold, especially with this great pussy. I'm afraid that Lavrence Kasdan simply gives her two stars too much, and they are coming back neatly. Adam Brookes script can be blamed, but you expect better than Kevin Kline from Fish Vanda. Instead, two ping-pongs from one another and an unusually rising romance never reconcile in a satisfactory way with the reason of any of them in France. Jean Reno plays as friendly as a policeman -Serce and I suppose he wanted to be star-with-work. You have to keep in mind that he continued to work with Pink Panter remake (s!) So maybe it was ok with this ... 3/10
