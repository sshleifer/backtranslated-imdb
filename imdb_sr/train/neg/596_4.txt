Basically, what we have here is a bit more than a remake of the hilarious classic kitsch of horror film from the 1970s 'Death Line', which was ironically like this cobblers, also partially recorded on the abandoned Aldvich subway station. Good use From now unused Jubilee Line platforms in Charing Cross, as well as the aforementioned Aldvich, this film essentially contains the same plot - a dubious kill zombie in tunnels dealing with lost passengers who have missed the last train - Originality is not strong this movie In fact, the strong points are missing. The mountain ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily overburdened, while the sub-Gollum lunatic is never fully explained, as it seems to be just a little less than a developed planning device. Franke Polenta has little to do with a thin script than she was running down the tunnel and screamed every time, she was really like everyone else in this movie, they came out of a small dog and a pack of pitted rats. If the creepy movies set up in London underground are your bag, or just want to play 'spot the tube location' as you pick them up on a DVD when you hit a suitable bin. If you are looking for a classic horror, go and dig a copy of Death Line (aka Rav Meat). If you are looking for a quality well-written and acting movie, you will need to change the trains .....
