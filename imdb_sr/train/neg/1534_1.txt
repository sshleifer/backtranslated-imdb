From blocked digitized footage to Keanu's acting "I'm so wooded that I could be Plank me" Reeves looks like an Oscar winner in this film that kills (it's not intended). The best thing about it is the eRATic box in the second segment (which of three looks to be the strongest piece in terms of story and 'twisting'). I'd love to spend Â£ 3.99 that cost me something else, like erm .... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you buy this, you are really disappointed, do yourself a favor and avoid it as a plague. If you are looking for something amateur and actors who are lesser than 2k4 then go. However, if you want a quality inferno action, look elsewhere, such as Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: The Wolverine Hunt.
