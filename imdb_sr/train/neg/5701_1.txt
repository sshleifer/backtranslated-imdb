And so much of the copying of history continues the Hollywood style. It was ridiculously ridiculous rubbish. It shock me that such an incredible amount of money can be spent on producing what is the most unusual, poorly-guided, inaccurate movie I've ever seen. It's horrible. It seems that Nic Cage's short flirting with serious acting is over. I can only assume that leaving Las Vegas was a problem in the otherwise litany of terrible movies. Diane Kruger proves her performance in Troy was not a coincidence, she really can not work. Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of himself for doing such a trips. Just recommended to those who are recovering from recent lobotomies or people who think that America has invented the world.
