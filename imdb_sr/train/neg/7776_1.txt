What a waste of garbage. I can not even begin to describe how this film was terrible. The rating it has here is really hard to believe. Avoid ... Especially if you enjoy the first ginger foxes. The first one was well written, well-directed, superbly performed ... a great movie with fantastic aesthetics and atmosphere. The other was 'alrite' - decent as a standalone movie, but obviously not to the level of the first ... The third is insult to the series, the period. I evaluate films: 10, 6, 1. That's so bad. Oh, and yes, it's really set in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... with some semi-adopted American mythology. Sisters do not have a real story, or progression, or even a clear connection ... They only try to survive and be "together forever". It's about as deep as it happened. Observed by the script, the girls agreed to be in this crowd of shit. Oh and something else, the staging action was horrible - people who appeared out of nowhere on a regular basis, as the girls turn around and there is an elaborate lamp with a mysterious American woman sitting there, who will enter the speech . The sets were terrible, they could not escape the fact that all this was obviously based on a set, which really did not help. Also, there was always snow outside the camp, but there was not a trace in (... on the set). Arrghh ,,, so bad! I really hoped to be at least as good as others.
