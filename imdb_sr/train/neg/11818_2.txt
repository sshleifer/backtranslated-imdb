The distant planet of the psychopath is saved from executions by a cosmic monk. He releases several prisoners and exits jail in a spaceship. They adhere to the absurdly huge spacecraft circling around the star of the supernova. This massive craft is inhabited by only three people, probably because the film's budget does not extend to the employment of many actors. After all, to shorten the story, three good things end up in the game of a cats and a mouse with villains. Psychopath in this film is curious about being dull. 'Unfavorable' is not at all a term that would be used to describe a madman - unappreciated, intimidating, dangerous perhaps but not 'boring', but he is. The three people on a giant boat are seriously unconvincing as they guarantee such important roles - this ship is practically the size of the city! Bearing in mind that the film is set about 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge person could exist, regardless of the fact that it is used for such a relative everyday task. Despite the enormous size of the spacecraft, the crew has stunningly equipped rooms, small rooms, and the dining room consists of a plastic table and chairs. But there are plenty of corridors. The film has pretty well acted and works as an average sci-fi thriller. But nothing big.
