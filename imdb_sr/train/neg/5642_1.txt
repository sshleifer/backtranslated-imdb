This title looks more like a movie exercise than a movie that should have been published so the public could see it. For Dafoe and his wife, it must have been fun to work together in the movie for the first time, not taking into account that people could watch. I felt like it was 90 minutes when I was impatiently waiting for the plot to develop, or even begin. or end. I've already seen 'arty' films and this does not even come close to artistic, abstract or original, it just seems totally meaningless. The only people who rated this film were under the age of 18. There is no doubt in the constant meaningless erotic scenes that the film insisted on throwing on us. That's if you can call it erotic. He certainly had no taste.
