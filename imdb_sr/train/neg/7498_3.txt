Spike Lee is in decline from his early success and this mess does not help anything. I looked at the watch that often hoped the movie would end up or get to the point. Lee's first film with a completely white film is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What is the point? That the Italians swear and love sex fun, but not with women? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I would go to the Scorsese movie. The incredibly bloody goddess figure only contributes to the stereotype. I admired several Lee's films, especially "Do It Right". This movie is a waste of time.
