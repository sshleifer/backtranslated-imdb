I understand jokes well, they're just not good. The performance is terrible. I understand, and that's another terrible thing about it. The only cool character ever in the show was that hobo in one episode, but then I see another episode, including that episode and the show is terrible. It's not funny, NOT funny! I do not want people to say, "Only smart people get it," because if they are so smart, why do they estimate people they do not even know and say they are not smart enough or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying "The sky is red," but it never looks out. But in any case, this is absolutely the worst performance I've ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, I think, you can understand them, they are just horrifying, its controversy is very limp, its furious jokes and other jokes about the body Liquids are really stupid and usually consist of very bad behavior. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show, but to judge others when they do not know anything about any of us is not a smart comment.
