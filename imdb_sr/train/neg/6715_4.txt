I entered the theater with the intention of spending a pleasant 90 minutes if I'm not having fun. I did not leave, neither entertained nor enlightened. This film can not decide what it wants to be, and it ends with nothing more than anything. There are several funny lines and some incredibly pretentious movie references (The Blov - 400 for this character?). Although none of the characters is treated with much respect, more than thirty gay men get the worst of all: all predators, fat, sad, unpleasant. If you're in the mood for a gay relationship, check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Gui, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. Thank you. <br /> <br />
