this film is banned in England? why? This savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others have done much worse before and they continued so ... This movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70's or early 80's horror movie . good girls (who otherwise can not save their lives), a terrible storm of lightning with a plentiful splash, a hair, a crazy brother wandering in the family estate, and actually a pretty good craft at the end. but forbidden? Seriously. when the English parliament banned this film, the Italians were probably laughing with their collective asses in a way that the British were really cautious and cautious. which is much less than that). There was nudity, but no sex, although allusions to sex were made, obviously. but absolutely nothing worth being banned. I would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work. At this point, the movie is fun, but the lack of quality of picture and sound takes away the end result. Forbidden ... What a joke ...
