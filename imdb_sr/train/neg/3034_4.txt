This movie has a great number of great adult stars, but you do not care about how adult films should be. You can not get bangs from any scene between all the stars. The film was shot in the dream as a medieval set that is shamefully syrus. The acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, sex scenes are just as exciting as listening to neighbors to talk about their kid in college, and the dialogue is worse that I saw in the movie. The store was also up to ten times. I would hold an amateur road. Audio comment was useless, because it was skin, but even then it was bad. Unless your irritable fan Jenna Jameson is here a little. 4/10
