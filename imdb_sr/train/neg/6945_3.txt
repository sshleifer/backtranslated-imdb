Thomas Ellard killed his child and his wife was attacked in the house. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) is trying to help him through posttraumatic stress. Then Archer found himself confronted with a man (Til Schweiger) who was tied and clinging to the chair. He was told that it was the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes. And there's a great assortment of instruments that will help him ... The film is initially interesting (and shows real restraint in terms of blood and blood), but it gets duller at any moment and has little chance of rotation . It all ends with a final turn that was so old and stupid that I was shocked that anyone thought it was more useful. As such talented actors as Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer included in this shit, it's beyond me. This gets three stars for acting, but the stupid plot and really incredible turns make this a tiny business.
