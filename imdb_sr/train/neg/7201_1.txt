Fortunately, I did not pay to see this movie. Also, I can not even detect any spoilers because I walked willingly after about forty minutes of film. It was so bad. I once laughed when Yahoo! The advertising board fell on the guy, and the theme was created. However, it was just because I thought it was being washed out, but then I realized that it was another product placement. <br /> <br /> I liked the cartoon. I watched her almost religiously. (although I missed the last episode, I heard Dr. Clava show that it was nothing more than Clave, somebody commenting on the shov site). I hated setting up the whole thing, reminding Robocop. Then Broderick waves with the full sense of the inspector. It's not nearly so clumsy as a cartoon. Another fact is that its devices actually work to the point I've seen, except the oil stains. He also screwed up the tone of "Vovsers" in an excited tone. I felt so disappointed that they had so horribly slaughtered a cartoon. Everyone felt that way. Our 14-17 year olds remember a cartoon and we loved it every minute. I went to an open-minded movie, knowing that you would fuck with a cartoon. I was surprised that the film was retarded. She relied on a spectacular and stupid humor dialogue. Disney relies on pain and body humor to push the movie for children. Placing the product is pointless in this movie and it shows. Wise-shooting car is not so good at shooting wise. The gadgets look nice, but they are almost overly brilliant. The cartoon was a better look. Stupid scenes were shit. In the 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, no laughter was heard and they laughed at the Dudley-Do-Right review. This film should not be watched by people who want intelligence at their family fun. I highly recommend "The Iron Giant," which was sad, but very good. This film is a travesty for the whole family drama
