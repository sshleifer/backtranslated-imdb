This film is AVFUL. I did not laugh so much in a movie that was unintentionally fun for a long time. Leno was supposed to have a late night-watch. Cars in the movie were cool, but the film itself is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. it's pathetic, the acting is terrible, and the plot could have been written by a four-year-old. do not misunderstand me, and lazy is hilarious, but not in this movie!
