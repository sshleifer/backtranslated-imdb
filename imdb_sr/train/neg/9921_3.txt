Strummer's hippie past was a revelation, but overall it seemed to have broken the spit. The stories of campfire work best about the intimacy of campfire. Too annoying anecdote of old friends and too much stock. I love The Clash and Joe because they have not reunited and sold their songs (FU Mick Jones) until now, but this document left me with the desire to connect more. The use of story tellers for campfires without the proper explanation of who speaks an anecdote to a certain extent alienates the viewer. They should have been interviewed by themselves. Even using Strummer's "DJ radio voice" there was not much to do with the film. Can anyone explain all the flags that fly behind the scenes of the campfire? After the terrible "Filth and The Furi", I hoped the Temple would be able to deliver. Dr. Joe Strummer deserves better.
