As the film starts, the narrator warns us that the CREATING OF A LADA is so scary that you can die of fear - and if that happens, a free burial is guaranteed. Well, I do not think anybody died of fear of watching this movie, but a few may have died of boredom. THE SCREAMING SKULL is a movie that makes Ed Vood good. Very poorly based on the famous story of Francis Marion Cravford, SKULL is about a rich but nervous woman marrying a man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. Once installed in her home, she is tormented by a semi-smart gardener, poorly portrayed portraits, peacocks, and finally a skull rolling around the room and causing her to scream very hard. And after her, the actress Peggy Webber screams pretty well. Unfortunately, its ability to do this is the peak of the film. The action is, at the very least, fairly transparent, and while the acting line is fine, the script is terrible, and the movie is so inspiring that you will be ready for yourself. True, the thing lasts only sixty-eight minutes, but everything feels much longer. Add this really terrible print quality to this and you are there. There are movies that are so bad that it's fun to watch. It's true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few screams - but the movie is so drawn that I could not withstand more than the occasional whimpering, and by the time it's all over, your head will get you out of trouble. If there was no Peggy Webber screaming, that would be a safe remedy for insomnia. Let him miss it. GFT, Amazon Reviever
