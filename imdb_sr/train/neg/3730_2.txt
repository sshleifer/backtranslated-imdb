First, there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. There is nothing wrong with making a movie like this in order to try to present a gospel message. So, my doubts in this film are neither in his sincerity nor in his aspirations. As a Christian, although an amylenist, I believe that there will be great tribulation and I believe that Christ will return as he said. And even if I have disagreements with this film about enthusiasm, that's not why this film is so low. No, what makes me this film so low is not his honesty or message, but rather his lack of production values, the terrible script, the central acting and the poor FKS. This film is located down with some of the most important experts from the fifties. No, this movie is below with Plan 9 from Outer Space. This film did not grow well and was probably dated at the time they made the sequel. Producers of the genre movie apocalypse could learn how to not make final films from this, but they failed. The Left Behind series, the Apokalipse series and the Omega Code series failed to learn from this because they dealt with FKS problems and a problem with the date of watching, but their scenarios are still poor and their action is wooden. There are great Christian movies, with extremely low budgets, but this film is not one of them. I'm surprised the crew of the MST3K never ruined this.
