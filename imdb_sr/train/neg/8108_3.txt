After reading the book, which meant much to me, the film did not give me any feelings that the book had transmitted. That's why I wonder if Kaufman even liked this book because he managed to do something else. Either it's or it's just bad. Most importantly where is the easiness?! From the first scene, music dampens most of the dialogue and feelings, and this continues through the film. I think that the creators thought that with the tranquil music going through the film, this story would feel the light - however, they were completely ruined here. Instead, music is able to provide everything that "feels the movie", in some way dramatizing events so that we stay on them, so that everything really feels difficult. Another example of how this adaptation fails is to decorate the story line makes it more dramatic. In the film we see Franz as Tomas passes on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this accidental encounter / transience, which certainly did not happen in the book, gives Thomas the story more significance than makes it brighter. There are many other examples where the continuity story has been changed, I had for the worst, but this may have been done because the book simply does not turn into a movie, such as Kunderin style. That is why we are wondering if all the generous reviewers on this site write with their experience in the book and film instead of writing about the film. A film that's as long as it's unstable. For those who have not read the book yet, I recommend that you read it easily. For those who have, I must say that you will just waste your time and probably end up here writing similar warnings about your stay.
