The only quality of this movie is a real story ... Otherwise, this movie was horrible. The acting was ridiculously bad, and the set was inconsequential and very sticky. The story was decent, but it was very difficult to watch because of all the terrible acting. I would not recommend you to watch this ... The only quality of this movie is that the actors were attractive ... Especially Rian Bauer, the man playing the soap opera. Some of the edits are well made, but there are continuity errors ... I started to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we get a good one soon?
