Although R is a movie, I really doubt that you will really enjoy it, unless you are a teenager. Why? Because there is no real complication, no character development, no funny jokes. The only thing that this movie has is a lot of nudity. Tonnes and tons of naked or almost naked chicks (pretty nice that I could add) to enjoy in your eyes. I really can not understand why this film has the title of the American Pie because it's just a bad combination of erotic film and comedy without success in being one of them. My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chickens, but you are too shy to rent / buy an erotic movie. I gave 1/10 for 2 smiles that I had in the whole movie and 2/10 for nice fish
