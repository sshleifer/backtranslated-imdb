Recorded in documentary style, but you can pretty much say that the participants are trained. The recently divorced film producer (Miles Berkovitz) sees a chance to revive her love life and at the same time step into a business film. He intends to make a documentary on finding love by recording twenty dates, including the consequences. Comedy is the best; there is an accident after the accident. Participants include Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and the tempting Elisabeth Wagner. Trying to get credibility, Tia Carrere was brought in line. This will be enough as a manual on how to NOT get a satisfactory date.
