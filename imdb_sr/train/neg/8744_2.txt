Somehow I accidentally finished watching this movie. I'm still not sure whether I'm sorry or not. I felt like watching a movie made by that group of film school students who did not exactly make that cut. Every Hollywood clich√© can be imagined, and as long as "corporations are the ultimate evil" message, we are shouting. The subtlety of this film does not know. Regarding this, it even manages to provide its own spoilers. It seems that the story is a fantastic world of computers. The main character is an attractive teenager with a girl, but a program genius and an obvious hacker (I think), among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you will have to see for yourself. Likewise, I should have known that this would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he has a tendency to be a good guy. I can not recommend this. One, I'm afraid.
