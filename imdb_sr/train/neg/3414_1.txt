This is just terrible, really terrible trash. Yes, we have beautiful naked women who dance and have sex. But while this can work in the mechanism of pornographic film? Maybe it was even hit as a porn movie? This is trying to masquerade as a "movie" with real things to say, with real emotions and struggles. It's not. It's an excuse that some girls have a naked and fun. I'm sure all these women (and men) in this movie could be decent in the porn business of the seventies. . . but not in real cinema. The act was robbed, so bad, I think really terrible. Writing was worse. Can not I blame everyone on these actors? they had nothing to do. A very wide structure or film action could be done and done well with good writers and competent actors. A very wide structure or plot is that psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from a distance, as a sniper. This shooting was motivated by men who did not respect their wives enough. If there were more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less unreasonable sexual images, we might have something to do with what we do. ; I would make more money. It's practically already a hardcore porn movie, and it's still the only non-porn movie I've ever seen showing a male penis in erection.
