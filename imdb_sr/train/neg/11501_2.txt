A romanticized and completely misleading vision of unemployment from "middle class artists" with comfortable upbringing ... It is clear that the writer-director has not directly suffered unemployment and certainly does not have a personal experience about it. If you would have to believe in this absolutely funny story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teens, have no anger, fear, frustration, etc. All the characters live day wearing jokes, jokes. They never look for work, they almost never experience rejection or pain, etc. Life on help is almost like a summer break from school ... Funny. Especially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces like Ken Loach, etc.
