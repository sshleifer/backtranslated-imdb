Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything that Brookmere's first novel had. All but a story, a laugh, a black humor, a political intrigue, a characteristic, a plot, and an apparent sense. Connectors; Godamnavful, from beginning to end. They mocked the plot, had a romance between Parablane and a policeman, and what was it, Dr. Slaughter was portrayed as an observer, and who was Annette Crosby supposed to be? It seemed like they made three hours of adjustment, then they cut it off for 90 minutes. (Although it seemed that the 90 minutes lasted forever.) Please, please, do not do this for any other book of Brooklyn, (in particular, The Land of the Blind).
