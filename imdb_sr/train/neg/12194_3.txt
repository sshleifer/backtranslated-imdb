The film begins with a voice that tells the audience where they are and who are the characters. And that's the moment when I started to dislike the movie. With all the endless possibilities that any film director has, it's really a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice that talks about everything. Actually, I believe that loud overshoots are betraying the concept of making a movie. I do not like to hear from the voice to say where we are, on which date we are, and especially what characters feel and think. I believe that the director must find a visual way to convey the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. But after a bad introductory introduction, a very striking movie begins and continues to take quite a long time. The lives of middle-class families and all members are individually presented in a perfectly realistic way. I think the director has the talent to record real life situations. For example, a father who has to make private calls from the bathroom at first may seem abnormal, but life leads us to some situations that may look abnormal, but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer in real life. But that's it. After a while, realism in the film begins to sacrifice the story. I really felt like I had a big headache because of non-stop characters. It's as if the actors and actresses got the subject and are allowed to improvise the dialogues. It's realistic, but the characters who always ask "really, is it," etc. To each other, or characters who say "no" or "listen to me," ten times when you say it's only once, I have enough headache. I also think it's a play that is practiced and scenes for reading books more than they should be. I understand that the play and the book in the movie are largely associated with the plot, but I think the director has missed the point in which he should stop showing those scenes.
