There were plenty of unknown films or movies due to bad reviews that I really liked. This was not one of them. It was exaggerated and used camera techniques that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera. It was absurdly predictable and took most of the movie to go and leave you asking "that's it?". Once I decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view, it became more pleasant. This is a movie that would end up on the MST3000 if it was still on.
