This could have been interesting? a story about a haunted house in Japan from the point of view of a newly-established American family? but it is declining due to excessive simplified treatment and incompetence of actors and directors. The film suffers from the same problem that I often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such indigenous dishes, i.e. that the spirits show themselves evil without the right reason, except that they are expected! Besides, that does not bring much in the fear department? Giant cancer is just stupid? As a matter of fact, ghosts inhabit a certain character and cause him or she to act in a completely unusual way, as Susan George seduced a diplomat / friend of the family of Doug McClure and Edward Albert who forced their daughter to have a bowl of soup! At one point, the old monk appeared in the house to warn Albert on the danger if they stayed there ?? In the end, he was called to expel the premises. However, history must be repeated, and the tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation that has been properly created? leads to a violent but inadvertently funny climax in which Albert and McClure, obsessed with the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, participate in improvised karate duel to death! After all, this appears as a harmless time? tolerable in only 88 minutes, but in no way, essential viewing.
