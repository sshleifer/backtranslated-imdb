A novelty of pure bone cleansing Jai Leno's four-letter word is the only unforgettable aspect of this formal incompatibility-the police-partner. In the COLLISION COURSE, a comedian with a pelican team is merging with the late Pat Morita to find a stolen prototype of a turbocharger (thinking that the car lover Leno played a plot on the plot?). Two seekers work hard, really, but Leno is not an actor, and Morita's routine for water-free fish gets old in a hurry. The film carries a little prank appeal from the '80s, but its worthy moments are becoming increasingly scarce as it fills its long-lasting 100-minute work. Fans of Leno's great comedic talents will feel disappointed; Everyone will be bored.
