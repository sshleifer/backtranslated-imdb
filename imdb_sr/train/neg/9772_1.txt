Too many incidents of violence. Film moves from one scene to another, and virtually every one starts out of violence. Now I am not the one who is shocked by the violence. , and for me a movie without fighting there is something missing. But, please, not one after the other. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was: "Here again." Between scenes of violence there is some similarity of the story, but two thirds of the way through a movie that I completely excluded and I could not wait for the end. If this is the best thing filmmakers can do, they should find something else about their miserable life, such as making shoes or mail delivery.
