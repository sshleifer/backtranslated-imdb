My girlfriend chose this; As a born and raised African, I found a plot of this film and premise completely without credibility. The belief that class and racial prejudice will be so easily and comfortably suspended will only come from someone who is completely unknown to ante-bellum south. Totalli absurd !!! I wonder how they got a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDovell (who knows the southerly better) to take part in this shit
