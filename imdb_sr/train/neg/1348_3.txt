this animated film Inspector Gadget is pretty weak. The story is very weak, and there is little action. Most characters have little to do. pointless.it is visible, but just right and is nowhere near the caliber animated TV show from the 80's. It's a good thing. As in a TV show, characters are not worth the cheering for this. The last case of Gadget is disappointing 3/10
