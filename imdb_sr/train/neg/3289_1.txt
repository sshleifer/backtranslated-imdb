I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to destroy one of the best shows that were on TV. Do we really need a big screen? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all fans would feel they made the "Rocki Horror Picture Shov" remake with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, pulled out all the music and made a drama. Do you think they would love to! This movie does not have the same feeling as the original. Of course, sometimes the original was a bit banal, but Bo and Luke were always good, they were embarrassed because they were always ready to get into trouble, and their main goal was to help people who went through the city. None of this mattered to people who made this movie, they may never have seen the original show all the way. My big question is, what then will it destroy?
