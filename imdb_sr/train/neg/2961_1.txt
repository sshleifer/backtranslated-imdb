I kept a family of three young children in one night and my mother gave me this to show them they had just caught him in Val-Mart earlier this week. All three children were physically ill as they watched her. I'm pretty sure it's the pizza they ate, or something they all picked up from school, but it could have been this movie. Absolutely disgusting. How can anyone produce this caliber of garbage is beyond me. Luckily, I turned off the movie when I noticed that children did not react and act strangely. For all parents, I advise you to refrain from watching small children watching this movie.
