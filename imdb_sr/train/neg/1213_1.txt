I can not believe that Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger have been involved in this trash! The script is so poorly written, and the direction is so weak (both of the same person) that it's hard to find more single-dimensional characters in the movie. Dialogues are so poor that this so-called. The thriller got a laugh from a few fools who entered the theater. Setting up is awkward, inviting you to believe that you will watch a cool thriller and suddenly it turned out to be the dumbest movie of persecution. Bassinger's character is so stupid that he stops screaming to God "Where are you?" so that people who follow it can follow, and then leap! And then she obviously entered the smallest forest in the world, I think, she runs everywhere, and the killers never lose a trace, and this happens in the middle of the night. It makes me really weird that really the best people writing in Hollywood can find out that they are spending millions on production.
