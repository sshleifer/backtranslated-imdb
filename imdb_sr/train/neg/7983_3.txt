All in all, long and filled with more substrates than the Swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-writer said he wanted to mix genres - in this case, drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two are mixed up like vinegar and oil. For lifting, comedy is not so funny and juvenile. In addition, the movie is not really realistic. Freedoms are taken into account in the legal system when French citizens commit themselves against their will and the apparent ease of escaping drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on my big TV screen at home and I found myself shouting on the film to continue on. In the end, I quickly passed the last long speech that makes one of the main characters the son of his former lover. At that time, I was exhausted by a senseless confused plot involving a dead lover, a marriage of comfort, and an exasperated former lover. Sometimes the action turns to the families of the two main characters, and then returns to one of them - either Ismael or primarily Nori. At the expense of the audience, views are constantly changing from Nora and Ismael, her former lover who was imprisoned against her will at the psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films, none of which is well developed. The epilogue does not end many of the sub-complications and it seems that the viewer believes that Nora will somehow find happiness, although its circumstances in real life are chances that are equivalent to the chances of snow in hell. Actors do their best and attract, but this is not enough to overcome all the obvious mistakes of bad writing, editing and lack of focus.
