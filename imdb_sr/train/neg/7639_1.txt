I watched this movie at NI Gai & Lesbian Film Festival and I thought it was pretty bad. The first and most memorable way was the way in which much was captured; that is, a lot of slow-motion images and excessively artistic close-ups that seem to make no sense-a wise or aesthetic story-besides showing the skills of the cameraman (which I believe was also the director). This film looked what the pretentious student of the film would bring. The main actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very cute, but at best he was a central actor; and the rest of the head moved from that, to the bad. The story itself was mostly boring predictable. I must admit that most of the viewers enjoyed the film; she was constantly laughing and sighing, but I did not like that much.
