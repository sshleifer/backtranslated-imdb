All right, this movie is in the rules. no doubt it is one of the most technically advanced films ever made. It's absolutely terrible, but you see it. Rent this with your friends and invent a game for a drink or just have fun, that's ridiculous. and the background behind it proves, you can do anything with paper plates and fingers. avesome. All right, just rent it for one scene: the two characters actually walked about 3 minutes in the shot. the director (on the commentary) says "yes, the tracking was so smooth it looks like they are ...". Yes, real man, they're completely on the move. It is so funny.
