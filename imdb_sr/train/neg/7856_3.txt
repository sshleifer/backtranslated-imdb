This film is quite sucked. I am in the army and the soldiers shown in this movie are terrible. If you are in the Army and you see this movie, you laugh and disturb the whole movie because of the way they acted as a detachment. It was funny. They acted like a bunch of normal men with military uniforms that they did not know what to do. It was a pretty nice movie. There were several scenes where they were trying to make you jump. I recommend that you see him if you are bored and want to see a violent movie. It will be a better movie and if it is not in the army. I also had to say that I liked the first one better than this.
