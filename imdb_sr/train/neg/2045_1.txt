This film must have been the absolutely worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to Zodiac (2007) and by chance. I thought it was a joke before the film itself. This was terrible, I waited for it to be scary and never. this movie had no real facts about the real Zodiac killer. The filmmakers obviously did not even try to investigate anything about the killings ... they only liked their name ... so they decided to write a script about something that's true. I'm upset that I did not realize that the movie was not before. I'm trying to love something from every movie, I do not hate movies ... ever ... except this one. If you could not give him the stars, I'd definitely have him. 1 of 10
