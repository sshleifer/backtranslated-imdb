I could not recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless piece (believe me, there are double negative ones here - that's so bad). This film was troubled by introductory credits when it was discovered that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. Music numbers are too long and neither of them is good ("Thank You Veri Much") has a decent melody, but lyrics are stupid behind the word. I would like to carry the chains that Scrooge wore in the bizarre hell of a movie, but re-live this insult with movie musicals. like Jacob Marlei. Dressed in a silly white costume, Ginis is constantly spreading through his scenes in an attempt to look as if he is floating like a ghost, or to show his contempt for being in this terrible film. Albert Finney, meanwhile, merges the best of Alistair Sime and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly filthy character Kuasimodo / Scrooge. Finney Scrooge is so disgusting, it's impossible to believe his transformation. Stay away from this horror movie creation at all costs.
