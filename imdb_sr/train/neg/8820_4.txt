Entering a movie like me, I expected absolutely nothing fun except full of killings ... what I got was even less. while Dad is in the santu. He is horrified, running up the stairs and cutting. The story starts 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your normal everyday life ... ... because he is obsessed with Santa Claus. After his boss ridiculing him, he goes crazy, dresses like Santa and begins to kill the disobedient believers and his boss. An inconsistent neighbor gets him and just as he burns it, drives a van from the cliff ... to the moon. Not the best end I've ever seen, but it was genuine. It was a slow, boring film that did not have a quality of quality except when Harry went to church visitors. There was almost no blood, and even "sex" scenes declined. Too annoying ...... 4 out of 10
