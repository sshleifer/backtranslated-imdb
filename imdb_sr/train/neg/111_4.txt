My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to buy this video. Though he had great actors / actresses, there were too many subtleties that kept interest. Plus that was not very interesting. The dialogue was cruel and confusing, and the story was too overturned to be persuasive. I was pretty disappointed that I believe that one of the last films was Audrey Hepburn. I will always love John Ritter most of all. He was too pathetic here.
