You are not sure why this movie seems to have received such urgent criticisms. While watching "Bang" one night on TV, I found myself bored by the absurd, accidental plot that took place on the screen. It seems that the entire film is nothing but an exercise in a senseless, artistic Farsian self-release by the filmmakers. The fact that the director / writer goes by one nickname only increases this feeling of pretentiousness. For those who are interested in indie flickers it would be better to look for something better written and dare to say, more fun than this total waste of time.
