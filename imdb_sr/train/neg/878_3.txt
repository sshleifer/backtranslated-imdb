I can only believe that Garrison Kanin had to be two people. The one who wrote the brilliant "Double Life" and the funny "Born Yesterday" and the co-author of such great scenarios as "Adam's Rib" and "Pat and Mike" with his wife, Ruth Gordon, and then the one who wrote and / or he directed such a tired, sad chuck like "Bachelor Mother", "Some Kind Of A Nut," and this. The actors are trying, but the script is so tired and clich√© that even the efforts of always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated. The scenario sinks to its lowest level in a truly offensive series in which Janssen's character tests Drivas's character to make sure he is not gay. An ugly sequence, but unfortunately the one that can be easily played in the film today. "Ethnic" jokes are now completely verbatim, but "gay" jokes are still "good, pure, family fun".
