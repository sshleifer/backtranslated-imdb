At that time, I remembered seeing a stupid Nintendo Pover comic that had the same artwork as this show ... and then the word came up that this show came on television near me! I was not esthetical, but curious ... I was curious about how this series would be bad. My friends said that this series does not make any sense and it's too stupid for people like me to enjoy (I'm actually gay), so I decided to watch the show with low expectations. HORRIBLE EKSPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate how much fanboi slip over Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how cooks Kalasaki (or whatever his name was inappropriate) a good guy who owned a restaurant. Bad move, 4Kid TV! Escargoon is not an advisor to King Dedede (who is a big loser in this show) and I hate the face of one company that constantly supplies Dedede with that terrible weapon to destroy Kirby. I'm so stupid, I hate this show. Then I started to hate Kirby even more, because it was obvious that Nintendo just wanted Kirby to be popular. Kirby will never win Mary in the fight for the cold, and Kirby will always be nothing more than a small creamy creme. NUF SAID !!!
