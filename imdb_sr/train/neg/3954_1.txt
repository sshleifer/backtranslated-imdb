A TOTAL FILM is a flashback from Boogeiman's first film, as well as, unexplained, a clip from another film Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love Brainvaves. It is framed still by some current (from the early 90's) recordings that are boring, poorly behaved and cheap recordings. Not only is the movie almost completely flashy, they repeat the same flashbacks through the movie. So you're looking at recycled images again, as if you had not already seen them. It's like the originals are not bad enough. I've never seen a movie that's so loaded ... Someone milled the last dollar from these movies. Total ripoff. And talk about padding ... why do I have to write 10 rows about this waste? If I can assume that this garbage is in 2 rows, that should be enough.
