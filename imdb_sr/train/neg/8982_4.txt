My nose is slightly bent as I write this. A few weeks ago, I sent a previous comment on this film that has not yet appeared, so I guess it was rejected, although it has met all the usual guidelines. I find this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordi Molla, a veteran actor who appeared in major productions like "Blov" and "Alamo". Leonor Watling is also pretty good. Unfortunately, all over time it falls under the weight of a really terrible, melodramatic scenario. There is also an abundance of free nudity that does nothing to improve the narration, or even gives an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise beautifully filmed artwork. \ T be much less painful than you will have to meet again with these fictional characters anywhere, anytime.
