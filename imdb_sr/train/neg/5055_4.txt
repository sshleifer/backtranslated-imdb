Two years ago at Sundance I loved the direct debut Haus tunnel Josh Kornbluth. So I rejoiced in his brother (and frequent associate), Jacob, the best thief in the world. This is a drama about a seemingly good kid who grew up in a lower class in New York. The film is not without touching moments. But sometimes it's like Kornbluth doing too hard to make it obvious: for some people, life can be very difficult. And life is not fair. More subtle, and even more important, is our understanding that in spite of all these somewhat disgusting cultural backgrounds and anti-social behavior that may arise, these characters do not have the lack of goodness and humanity. We can get back to their language and their living conditions, but we can not reject their intention. In fact, their struggle to maintain a family under such troubles has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this region, and his compassion for people is obvious in everything. Having said all this, the best thief in the world suffers from many painful disadvantages (including the title). Characters are not very convincing. Writing is uneven. A dash is barely visible. And for many it is most disturbing that Kornbluth uses two young blacks that mimic the gangsta rap between the scenes. To each one: But until I question the possible realism of this phenomenon, it hurts me to see 5-year-olds talking about sex with women. This is an unnecessary shock value and is a forced part of the borrowed interest.
