Yes, I was fortunate to see the long-lived original production of Michael Bennett's musical. It was an incredible experience and I paid to watch the movie when it hit the theater in 1985. That's terrible. Almost everything fails. First, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right material) is a sad choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was engaged to win ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - cutting the songs and CASTING !!! They are terrible - the power of the performances were these dancers - these hungry, talented artists just wanted to show what they can do and when they get their chance - you could not take their eyes off them. But this movie gets only dance, it does a nice "nice" singing at work, but none of them does not even run. Actually, look for the IMDb roles - none of them really did anything. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzki - sheesh). So, this film malfunction did not capture magic, desperation, passion of the theater musical for a second. Total ejection! (But although they try to squeeze music - great music sometimes rises and reminds people that it's a great result).
