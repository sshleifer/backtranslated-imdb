It just makes no sense to try to glorify any part of this movie. It was the right garbage. At the very beginning, you may think that you are a visually stunning piece of cinema ... and then soon after you hit the big bag (sack) FAIL! Fight is barely a martial art, acting is on the edge of a pair, and music is not worth the description. There is only one story that created an excuse for this film. Decisions made by the characters and the way they deal with the situations are weak, and they did not disturb me. I think that the only reason this film originated was to act like a little fan using Iumiko Shaku.
