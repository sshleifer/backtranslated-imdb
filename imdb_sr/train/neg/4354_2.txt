this performance is terrible. no comedy, no stories, no good characters. America is blind to give reward to real shows. I hate this show along with 30 rock. I'm really glad that they canceled this show. thank you CBS. hold two and a half men, hold Christine, adhere to the rules of engagement to meet your mother who is not really funny, but much more fun than this. this performance is disgusting with friends. with the same director, so that's fine. but keep this show and never return it. Never before. The only reason I did not give a grade 1 is because my buddy is holding her instead of sleeping. These are types of movies or TV shows that I give once. The only reason I was awake was because of the laughter of the audience and I rejoiced at the next show. I really want this show to be funny, but my opinion is stupid. stupid. I do not see why everyone likes it. my opinion again. but I also think that the great scratch theory is stupid. my poor smart guy. I'm in a class with goodbye, now I have a smile and it's not from watching your show.
