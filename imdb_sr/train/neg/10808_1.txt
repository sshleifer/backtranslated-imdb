I got a book version of Kazaami for my 8th birthday, and people always say that the versions of books are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least with the movie it's almost over. The act in this is terrible, what I expected of a movie with Shak that plays the magic tail ghost that comes out of the old ghetto blaster (which there was probably a good reason for being captured there.) The kid in the movie who plays Max is a cowardly and horrible actor. Maltretching by the children from the neighborhood, which I do not blame them because he is a small sack. The story is simply stupid and extreme clich√© About the boy whose father always works and never does not find a new friend who improves his life and helps him to reconnect with his father. Even and for eight years, I thought it was a stupid idea. It's a surprise that any of the people who worked on this movie had a career after the department because it was shameful and never should have been made. I could talk more about how This movie is crap, but you just need to know it just by reading the action.
