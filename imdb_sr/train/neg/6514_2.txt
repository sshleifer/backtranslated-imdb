The film is trying to be documentary - recorded in documentary form, but with many apparently scripted parts - but fails to provide the audience with any characters with which it would create an illusion of mockumentaries. Also, the film aims to find true love in Los Angeles, but it is nothing but an uninteresting look at the amateur director who is trying to make his first "big movie".
