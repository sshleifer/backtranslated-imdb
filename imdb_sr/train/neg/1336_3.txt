This film was definitely not the best Mari-Kate and Ashlei film. I really did not like it, and I was kind of disappointed in that movie. For some reason, it seemed to be a movie they made very fast. In some parts, it became so boring that I had to speed it up. He did not have bloopers or any exciting parts like their other films.
