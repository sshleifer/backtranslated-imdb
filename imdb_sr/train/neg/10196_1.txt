As a poker enthusiast, I was looking forward to watching this movie - Especially because Scotti Niugen had him. Basically, Scotti Niugens short videos in this movie are all for that. > The characters are unsuitable and boring, the sound record is terrible and complicated, well, it's gone. I honestly got a headache and found out that I read the number of barcodes on a DVD box after twenty minutes I was bored. It's his fact that Niugen was in this movie because otherwise I would not have spent $ 16 on buying Ebai. Take It From Me - AVOID AS 7 2 offsuit !!! Dire. :(
