In the first turn, we meet with the world in which the inmates exist and are somewhat organized. The action in that movie made sense; The TV reporter is investigating this and trying to discover the truth. She must eventually kill many of them, including her boyfriend who becomes one. Then it shows the world to exist by transforming itself into TV. Special effects were just ridiculous in the first movie and did not get anything better in this movie. Whether it's about transformations or about bad puppets or about complicated computer graphics that show super powers. The plot line is not so bad; For some reason they have to kill the leader of the insects. This will not destroy all the insects and really does not end the threat from the insects as it is ... they just want to kill her. I think there was some blurred reason for it, but it's really lost in the movie. After the film "Finish" we have a 10-minute editing film that we watched, and every other scene where the leader of a wolf-taker unbuttoned her top by exposing her big breasts, while some Devo-eskuire band plays a bunch of insects. The only thing that makes this movie even visible is Christopher Lee.
