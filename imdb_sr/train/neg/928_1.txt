This movie is so horrible, it's hard to find the right words to describe it! At first, the story is so funny. Actors are boring and untalented, maybe they were forced to play in this movie. Admissions National Forests are the only good in this film. I should feel ashamed because I paid this bad picture. I hope that no one makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a bad story :-)
