9, a movie that I enjoyed for months ... was a bit more than disappointing. I was deeply surprised by the lack of stories and the development of a strange character. All the great action sequences in the world do not compensate for any inconclusive character. Strange, almost thrown into the occult sequences were not only unreasonable, but were also furious. The story is about robots and scientists ... why suddenly turns into a non-horror horror that changes with mystical symbols and green magic spiritual lines, instead of giving answers to what could have been a great scary story? How, what, when, why .... issues that only concern you if you care and it is less likely to do it while you are moving away from the theater. This film frustrates the lack of depth .... I would watch this film in the shape of a crayon if the story was good. However, filmmakers relied on CGI sorceress and Tim Burton's name to attract the attention of the audience. What ... attracted me, but I did not manage to get my respect. 9 it could have been awesome ... with a few more rewriting and a little more respect from its creators.
