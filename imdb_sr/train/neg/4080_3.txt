This seems to me to be one of those films that we think we should like, but I did not. There seemed to be too much effort to be "artistic". All flash, no content. There are some beautiful scenes, and either of them is good to watch, but all of them are getting together and it's becoming a difficult task just to sit through it. I rented this because of the great comments on the video card and the fact that I am a great fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I found it somewhat pretentious and, sometimes, boring.
