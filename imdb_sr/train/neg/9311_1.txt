The cover on the DVD and the disc is incredible, you would think they shot a movie about a sweet tooth from a twisted metal black that is still a great idea, but the actors of this movie are the worst of Ben's performances in the pearl port, the porn are of better quality and better actors . I wanted to buy a DVD, but I luckily rent it first, the plot and the script are also horrible, it seems that nothing goes together, so the movie really does not make sense. Poor attempts to scare you with the help of flashback scenes are worse than those used in sitcom broadcasts from the 80's and will ultimately leave you wanting to hit your wall against the wall of your house.
