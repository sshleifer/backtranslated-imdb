I am a big fan of Porsche, and the car was the best star in this movie. Haim, now dried-up star of a child who abused drugs in the 1980s, is common, and comments on the back of smaller characters / actors would be pointless; Needless to say, they were all very average. It's a cool movie as a journey through the memory of the 80s - with some strange suit, some good wallpapers from Colorado background and very harmless, albeit with a stunning situation. All in all, please, do not waste time watching this unless you love 80s movies, Corei Haim, or like me, you love the old Porsche school (this looks great) because Life is too short to watch shitty movies.
