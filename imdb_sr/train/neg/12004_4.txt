"Salaam-e-Ishk" is pretty, but a superficial comic soap opera from India that loves us with six interwoven stories of romantic love (which is at least four stories in my estimate.) Recorded as a cross between the MTV music video and the commercial for beer Super Bowl, The film is a huge mix of exotic settings, luminous colors, sexy entertainers, high-stepped songs and dancing. Numbers, dream dreams and fantasies, wild characters, frenzied dialogue and exaggerated comic appearances - this is a standard release when it comes to the bollywood events of these a. This is an exhausting task just trying to keep all the characters straight while dancing, penny and dashed through the incomprehensible story. All the beautiful women - but he will need the patience of Job to bring it to an end.
