I saw this film in 1979, when I was 17 or 18 years old. The theater may have been 1/4 when the film started. Ten minutes in the movie, I and a friend who went with me to watch the movie were the only two people in the theater. The film was really weird and did not have any complications or reasons for the script and people were looking for their money back. We decided to stay for the whole movie ... why to endure such torture ... here's why. We wanted to be true film critics ... that we have the standard to base all the other films on the fact that it's hard to justify the claim that you've seen the best movie (10) that always finds something better. But, it's easy to be able to base all the other films on the worst film ever made (and that's ... at best). Perhaps there are other movies that really qualify as 1, but I have not seen them yet. Now I'm basing all the movies I see on the scale that is based on this worst .... I WANT THE FILM CRITICS ... he is.
