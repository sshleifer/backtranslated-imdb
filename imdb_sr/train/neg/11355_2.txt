"Nat" (which was expressed by Trevor Gagnon), together with his brother's friend "IK" (pronounced by Philip Bolden) and always hungry "scooter" (David Gore) are children with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in the universe. And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the Moon, Apollo 11, waiting for its historic trip on a launch ramp near the place where the three are together. The first thing you notice is movie animation. I found that it was done very well. The landscape had depth, because things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scene. I did not see a movie in 3-D format because it was broadcast on HBO. However, I could see that there really are no scenes that have used 3-D effects except for the battle between the characters at the end. I was also not impressed with the design of the characters. They did not look like something that looked like flies, especially in colors. The flies were unusually blue-gray, which gave me some attention. Performances from the acting team were not bad, but it was not any good either. Many times I focused more on the computer than on the story. Writing is certainly written for the younger audience, with comical moments that will make younger children laugh. I did not see anything for adults, like jokes that would get punchline for adults to understand the meaning. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, because the main focus was flush. I also hated when a famous astronaut jumped on the screen and explained that the story of frogs in the movie was a fiction act, and that the frogs were not at Apollo 11. I like how he thanked men and women who sacrificed their life to explore the universe. If you are grown up, it is not for you. Not for the whole family. This is only for children. But, save this for a rainy day.
