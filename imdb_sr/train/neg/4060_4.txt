The CAT O'NINE TAILS Image ratio: 2.35: 1 (chromosome) Sound format: Mono 35mm and 70mm prints ) A blind former journalist (Karl Malden) is hearing a blackmail action outside a genetic research lab and later joins with fellow reporter James Franciscus to investigate a series of murders in the lab, unconsciously putting his loved ones at grace and disgrace to a psychopathic killer. In the production after the unexpected world success of his directing debut BIRD WITH CRYSTAL WATER (1969), Dario Argento created THE O'NINE TAILS as a giallo-thriller in the same spirit as his predecessor, who celebrated Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his performance in PATTON (1969) - and the upward star Franciscus (DOLINI GVANGI). Unfortunately, the resulting film - for which they said that the commercials' nine times more tension than the 'Birds' - is a disappointing tracking, flawlessly photographed and elegantly derived, but too noisy and devoid of general consumption. Malden and Franciscus are prominent in cute roles, and the cameraman Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses a wide frame of Cromoscope to convey the hi-tech world in which Argento's dark script develops, but a subplot that includes Euro Starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus's romantic interest represents more than unnecessary padding. The most important events include an unforgettable meeting with a black glove killer at a crowded train station (edited by a smooth belief of cult film Franz Fraticelli), as well as a night episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important trail in the tomb and fall to the prey of the killer unusual machinations. But in spite of these brilliant glamor, the film wanders from one scene to another, flickering slowly, without boiling. It's no surprise that "Cat" failed to mimic the escaped success of "Bird" when it was released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
