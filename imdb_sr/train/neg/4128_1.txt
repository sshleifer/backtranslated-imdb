This movie is one of the most horrible I've ever seen. Not only is the dialogue horrible, it never stops. You think it's gonna end, but it's not. How long, 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know I will never watch again. It's as if somebody took a romantic comedy, took out a comedy, and then decided to diminish the romance, leaving us with a bunch of shit that managed to get to the screen. But do not tell me about it, find out how this movie is horrible.
