The average quality of the movie television is a full story of the formula of religious fanatics (Ron Perlman, who gives good "I am not only the president" Psychosomes, but I'm also a client. ") Who gets control of the biochemical virus (I think the virus from the movie" The Rock "). It is a pity for him who got stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and government agents trying to stop him (led by impressive physical, slightly entertaining Wolf Larson, supported by Fred Drier) along with the standard" in the wrong place in the wrong time "Brave woman" (always a slight Erika Eleniak) and "lived like a weakling, but he died a hero at the last moment," a man (Brandon Karrer). It has a standard background story that gives sympathy to a religious fanatic (a woman and son killed in a police raid several years earlier). Basically decent movie about the rainy day. The beloved line, pronounced by Ron Perlman after finding the virus bottle hidden in the décolleté Erika Eleniak: "Woman and her mystery." It is worth renting.
