Coaches for Wood Palm trees try to take it as some kind of fairy tale allegory with the right meaning, and then immediately start to rebel about animation. I should have known what that meant. The main character, Palme, is a good example of the whole film problem. One minute, Palme is a modest hero looking for himself, the next violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on the girl he used to lead. Like all characters in the movie, Palme is poorly defined. You do not connect with the characters at all, though Shatta has got a couple of cheerleaders. It seems that the writer was more interested in filling all the drama and complexity in this film than to explore the motives and personality of his characters. New, useless stories have been introduced in the last fifteen years. minutes of the movie. The writer seriously had to perfect his story. Maybe he was trying to be epic, but that was simply too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I can not help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would be more suitable for a TV series or graphic novel. In the last five minutes of the film, I simply could no longer tolerate the lack of quality and began to laugh at how the characters, connections and the whole action were invented. I touched my companion and he started to shoot, like the young man who was sitting behind us. We tried so hard to control ourselves, but we simply could not take the horrible quality of this film. With a brighter side, the animation is amazing and the viewers will admire the lush origin and the charming character. design. The animation takes you almost; When you do not care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.
