The only way to get something from this movie is to approach it as a comedy. Viewed in this light, he brings it. If you are looking for a serious movie, look somewhere else. This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than lethal and one-dimensional examination of the "problem" without any insights. Make a film about stereotypes and then make every character in the movie a stereotype It's an extremely bad strategy - especially when these same characters just break their looted molds in a predictable, stereotypical way. Busta Rhimes and Ice Cube make the movie almost visible, and Michael Rappaport turns into a good performance, but the script is so awesome and the social commentary is so banal that it's hard to find something that could be used.
