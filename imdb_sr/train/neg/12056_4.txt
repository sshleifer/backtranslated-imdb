This movie is a good example of how through media manipulation you can sell a movie that is nothing more than a very ungrateful TV sitcom. In Puerto Rico, daily newspapers with the widest circulation continually write about the wonders of this film, almost silencing all the others. Accidental newspapers with the second largest circulation belong to the same owners. CLARID weekly is the only newspaper on the island that analyzed the shape and content of the film and pointed to all its flaws, clich√©s and bad writing. Just because the film makes a part of the audience laughs with light and obvious jokes, and because actors and landscapes are recognized, it does not make it an acceptable film.
