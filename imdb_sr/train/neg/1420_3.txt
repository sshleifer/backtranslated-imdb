[I've seen this movie late at a public TV station, so I do not know if it's on the video or not.] This is one of the "baby burlesque" (sic) that the Shirlei Temple began in the 1930s, them. It's hard to believe that someone would allow his daughter to be in this little movie that can be considered today as a "child pornography". They are all in diapers and are in a milk-serving salon instead of alcohol. "Money" is in the form of lollipops. Shirley plays "femme fatale" to the bar and talks to soldiers who give suggestive comments about her (!). But Shirley does not really need their lollipops / cache because her bag is full of those of other "men". br /> What a weird movie. . . babies who use diamond dialogue in an adult role in the salon. Who came up with these things?
