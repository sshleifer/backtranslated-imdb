First, I must admit that this is not a good movie. And, I would never watch this movie if Pacino was not in it. The film is about a weird publicist for 24 hours. It's really boring, after 20 minutes you can fall asleep. And I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this horrible movie. > Since I'm a passionate fan of Pacin, I bought this 2002 movie People I Know.
