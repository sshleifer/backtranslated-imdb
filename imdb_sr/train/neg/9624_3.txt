Considering the potential that this move had, the reality was disappointing. Although it's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in the movie, she can not even turn around. Most of the actions were predictable. Jokes were flat to slightly fun. And the characters were not interesting. I wanted to love this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was hilarious in the movie "There Something About Mari". Looks like he's just going through the movements. If they have to raise dots from the "Friend", they should know that something is wrong. Toiletry humor should remain in the closet :-).
