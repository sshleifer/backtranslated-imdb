I recently saw it on the cable and somehow I enjoyed it. I've read the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the other half more than the first half. I personally enjoyed the first story (damage that has not been extended). And that's "California Dreaming," if I hear it again ... Chungking Ekpress is fine, but it's not something that the mainstream audience will catch to see, like "Crouching Tiger."
