This movie starts very slowly, but when the action finally starts, it has to be monitored a little. I could not understand why some events took place, and many events happened before they were explained to them, making them somehow confusing. The only thing that really does have is the huge amount of blood / blood it has, although in most cases special effects are missing. The blood looks like a red Kool-Aid. The skin that cleaves sounds like someone climbs on a bunch of sticks. Again, the story has some kind of amateur feelings towards her, as the writer did not have to take time to perfect it. I feel like it could be a much better movie to have the effects done better and more time taken from the scenarios. I sincerely wish that I did not look, not because of the upside, but because I feel that I lost 90 minutes of my life. If you love extreme movies, this is for you, if not, go away.
