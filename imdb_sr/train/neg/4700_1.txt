I totally hated the movie. It was so retarded. They need to get some lessons for acting ... no, wait, it will not help because people from Gola brothers are retarded. You know why I'm here, even though I hated a group of naked brothers? To warn people before they see a stupid movie, so NBB does not get any money from him, then they can no longer make amateur silly songs that are so retarded that any old man can write them in 10 seconds. Not only are song lyrics slow, they sing poorly. Okay, somehow I got out of the movie ... ... anyway, it was boring and they behaved terribly. It was not funny at all, even though they really tried to make it. I suppose they deserve credit for that ... well, the film is not worth your time. Just look at her rating. The film (and series) is very painful for watching anyone with even half a brain. Seriously, if you liked it, you have to go to watch movies where actors really act, not blossoming their lines in a monotone. I'm at a drama club at my school and some people are actually BETTER than those Nat and Alek guys. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece. I do not even know why I even walked half the film. I do not think it deserves to be called a movie ...
