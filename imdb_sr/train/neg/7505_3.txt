This long film turns out to be less about Berkowitz and its effect on New York, but more about painting a cartoon of a certain group of Americans of Italian nationality, known locally as "Guidos". The problem is that "Guidos" is uninteresting, regardless of the type of story or environment in which they are immersed. They are already living caricatures, so Lee just intensifies them, instead of simply displaying them. When someone has a caricature of themselves, they do not go home and say, "Hey, let's make ears and nose even bigger!" That's what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting characters in the movie are two (Adrian Brodi and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape the "Guido" way of life. Make it an unforgettable story for characters, especially for John Leguizama, and you get a good movie to fall asleep. Especially having in mind that it is a long time. Another blow against him: In order for someone to declare the fans of Iankees and grow up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to play Phil Rizzuto, which is wrongly written in the final credits.
