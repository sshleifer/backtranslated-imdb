I never like to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to bad movie, I have to make a big deal. Speaking of Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjati, seems to have lost him completely. After the success of Huma Aapke Hain Kauna, he thought he could make money with sweeping videos. Vivah is so poor that Badjatias left Johars and Chopras behind him. There was not a single moment during the movie where I could say 'Oh! at least this is good. " Aloknath for the clichÃ© in the role of the girl's father, Shahid kapoor looks thick, and Shahrukhed, Amrita, was another disaster in the face of ugly looks, bad bones, torn stories, monstrous stepmakers, actors who are trying to act, cacophonic music /> Now, the spoiler, I warn you about how this is happening in all of his other films, after the film about the accident ends with a happy note.
