Let me admit it. I found this video and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in the underwear on the jacket. But there was another story inside. In addition to the fact that the movie was essentially a parody of "invisible man" genre of special effects (high-visibility wires and other such necessities), the script did not lose any chance-in fact, it came out of the way-offended all non-VASP races and real- imaginary homosexuals. Every insult aimed at the person in the script was homophobic or racist or both. It begins to rub on your nerves, along with a hissing sound, an open style photo and a melodramatic story. However, the end is somewhat surprising. But when you get there, you hardly care less. Too bad, that could be a pretty good movie.
