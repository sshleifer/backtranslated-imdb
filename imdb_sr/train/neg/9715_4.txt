This program is really overestimated. A detective like Danny Pino's stupid figure would have been transferred to a "rubber detachment" a few years ago. The entire squad is made up of devoted egoists who estimate people whose works are returned for decades by the standards of 2007. Every Vietnam veteran veteran who ever had them proved to be a killer unless he was another veteran of Vietnam. He was only one black killer, and he was subjected to his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a "racing traitor" who killed another Hispanic man in order to draw a Spanish kid on the street for a crime that was (naturally) committed by two rich white children. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey, scriptwriters: minorities and the poor committed murder. Only in this show are most killers of higher layers of whites. Moreover, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No DA in real life will advocate murder because that means the state will be stuck with its huge medical bills until it finally gets kicked. The state would do a favor to its families and insurance companies. The prosecutor will only declare whether it is an involuntary killing and will not serve the day. The only really old criminals who go to jail are either organized crime figures or former Nazis, whose reputable conviction encouraged DA's career.
