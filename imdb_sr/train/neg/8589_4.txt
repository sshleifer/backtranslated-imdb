First let me say that I am a fan of original Star Wars movies ... I do not read books, I do not play games, wear underwear or eat cereals (if any). I'm just a movie fan. When it says this, I'm struggling to see how people give such high praise to this movie. Taking this film by itself, and not comparing it with terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say this is an incredible movie. For all the terrible shortcomings in the script - sirens of dialogue, fictional scenes (eg R2 is suddenly bad, and long CGI intense scene scenes that have little human touch), HORRIBLE acting, and recorded holes ... how is this good? Inside Anakin there was no real internal dilemma; it looked like the switch was turned and he was suddenly an evil one. The film did not interest me until the last 20 minutes (which by the way destroyed "NOOOOOO!" Scene Frankenstein). When you bombard the screen with intense CGI effects and fill the gaps with absolutely horrible single-liners when it could be more and should say, this is NOT a GREAT FILM. For a film with such a "dark" tone, there was too much curiosity in the speech of ALL characters. I closed the question: from the beginning to the end of the movie, was there really any sense of urgency and significance for what would actually happen?
