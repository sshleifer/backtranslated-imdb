VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be a great disappointment! Although Sam Peckinpah had a role in the script, along with Robert Tovna, he still appears as a lead-written film that was dictated by an uninvited Buzz Kulik. First, the top charged Iul Brinner as Pancho Villa was wrong for the role! It's not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His only note is the fire and pleasure that Anthony Kuinn or Gilbert Roland could bring to the role. Brinner just looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed as a Mexican bandit who is in the midst of a Mexican revolution instead of the Russian. Also, Robert Mitchum is completely lost in the picture! His role as airplanes flying on airplanes, throwing bombs from home into the air for the cause of the revolution, is a poorly written scarce role that any smaller star could play. Mitch did not have a decent line in the whole film and he thought of his second Mexican revolution that shows far superior Bandido (1956), which, unfortunately, no one is interested in publishing on DVD. Apart from the lack of any style, "Villa Rides" also suffers without the presence of a female star! There is starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum a nice eye, but her throwing is just superficial. Someone like Claudius Cardinale or Jean-Peter Piters may have added some of the much-needed recesses to the straight line of the story. it's not a movie performance and not quite perfect Panavision picture quality plus excessive melody Maurice Jarre does not help. As Paramount does not have, there are no accessories - not even trailers! Yes, a disappointing movie and a DVD presentation that could and should have been much better.
