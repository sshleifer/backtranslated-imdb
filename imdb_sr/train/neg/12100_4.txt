Do not get me wrong. If you need an overview of everything that was wrong in the history of human civilization, as well as a flawless path to a brighter future for mankind, to whom should you turn better than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture? If you need a healthy dose of all solid, healthy reasons why religion has survived its usefulness, then turn to Sagan or Davkins, not BILL MAHER for God (?) Sake! This is in itself a good point. Maher rejects our religious past as a neurological disorder that conveniently ignores his whole society, art, and science rooted in him. to show his thought while trying to appear erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect is not up to the goal. Maher makes us laugh, but obviously not the brightest bulb in the box. As an example, he responds to the respondent (and I use the term freely, since all the "ambushees" are obviously) that the existence of Jesus is a historical fact with the dead spot "No, not" followed by a long look that meant convey contempt for the naivety of the subject painfully overused in this film). The problem is that this person was right and Maher made a mistake in his claim that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be historically suspicious gospels. I suppose that Mr. Maher never read the contemporary historian Josephus. But masses will gather in this pseudo-documentary while doing fictitious works by other intellectual giants such as Michael Moore, and they will loudly suffer. However, it is doubly said that the most loudest and most agreeable collision occurred during the 70% of the time the film dedicated to this movie. anti-Christian tirade, while the audience was completely absent during this symbol, 10% dedicated to criticizing the self-defined Religion of Peace. Hmmm. Or the critique of Islam is limited to the hip and the liberal target audience or were just afraid to laugh. Anyway.
