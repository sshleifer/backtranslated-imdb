Please! Do not spend money on this movie. It really is nothing more than a boring German Blair Vitch ripoff made by some high school students. I could not finish watching, and I usually like to watch all kinds of B-movies. How could, for God's sakes, find a distributor for it? !!! It's funny though: Check Wikipedia for the "dark area". The guy who wrote the attachment must be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got a lot of money from the manufacturer. Money to spend on actors, cameras and editing. Even that would not help, because there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this movie. Unfortunately, the "dark area" has already attracted too much attention. Please, the director, producer and author of this film, STOP to record such films ... do not do yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this movie.
