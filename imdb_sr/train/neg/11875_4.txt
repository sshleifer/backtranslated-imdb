Mmm, is not a big bunch of pancakes good? The syrup of the maple and fruit is kept at the top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. The second. The second. EAT. EAT, you !!! Keep pushing down your throat until your face turns green from nausea. You've just had Allie McBeal's experience. I ran into this show in the winter of '98. Like this pile of pancakes, I got into it. But the enjoyment soon vanished, because the character of Allie McBeal (whom we see at first glance is cute and sweet) soon became the most unpleasant, insecure, squeaky applause you've ever encountered. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer that my female lead has a spine.) Gags and tricks of the show also become hacked, the music of Vonda Shepherd (which is really pushed in your face) becomes a grid, and the constant character of change and rewriting make the show in the damn soap opera. My advice is to take this performance in small doses and to give up as soon as it becomes disturbing (and will). I got through the 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment completely abated. It was good while it lasted, but like a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend, it became ugly after she had been welcomed. Next time you go to IHOP, skip pancakes. Order something healthy as a fruit cup. Sit with you a lot better.
