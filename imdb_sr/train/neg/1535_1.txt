I do not think you can be much worse than this. Compose bad actors, fake limbs and three stupid stories and what do you get? This brutal excuse for B film for the movie. The first story immediately shows the poor quality of the video, and the acting is really pathetic, especially when you bring a 25-year-old who presents himself as a grandmother with usually Granny bunny over his ears a little. Plus, the man is OK, but the wife is pretty ugly. "You look great!" NOT! The waswolf in this was the best of all three, I would say, but it's still not impressive because it was all a bad costume. The face of a woman was later sufficiently decent for Halloween, but not for a film of insects. The more the story goes, it's even worse. There are two lesbians in this next, which are completely retarded. The whole "I want to be a werewolf" "How could you do that to me!" It was stupid to say. You've been looking for him now! The insect does not even talk about ... his rat! The third does not make any sense ... almost forty-five minutes of running and boring narratives make this story and the whole thing. it was still not interesting. Boring! Music, yes, bad ... who could not even hear some parts was stupid. Animal effects were either a rat or a pig that was stupid. They could not use the lion's sounds? I suppose they do not use good movies. Well, if you enjoy B-stops, that's good for you. I got this movie because I'm a fan of a hardcore insect and I'll buy a movie from any of the insects and watch it more than once, but it's just me. If you prefer good things, do not spend money. I beg you!
