Jason Lee is back! If that's what you are looking for, do not look for further. If not, you better go further ... But about the movie. Cliffs in abundance, some badly recorded, but somehow exotic fighting scenes (used by JKD) and a lot of bad effects and cheap effects. Poor Lee seems to be in pain throughout the film, and no wonder. Not a pleasant return. Film does not even record it as a B-movie - I'm sure there was a German faded blonde Rutger-vannabe bad guy, but without a free sex scene or even one boots shots. No one. Zip. Hope. Even in Starship Troopers 2 they had common sense to include mandatory offerings (as well as the rest of my comments on this excellent classic excellence, please look at our upcoming review of this fantastic sequel ...). I had the feeling that the writer would be refreshing to someone with this - so I would not enter the "plot" of the movie or almost everything else. In addition to having some non-heterosexual features, Nuff said. However, this movie has one thing to do - no Jean-Claude :)
