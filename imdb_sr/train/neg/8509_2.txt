I saw this film for several reasons, and the main one was Mira Sorvino. With her on the recording, it could not have been so bad. She even seemed to have some mysteries and that Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time and was pretty good at 'Unfaithful'. The story is set in Spain, so it could be an exotic funny movie with one of my favorite actresses. If you are thinking about the same thing, let me warn you: this is a really terrible, uninteresting, boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic. The story is fictitious with sub-folders that do not add anything to narration. They are trying to make a sniper / thriller overlooking fascism in Spain, but they do not run awfully. Craftsmen have no credibility and so-called investigation does not lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> Characters are thin! I do not care about anyone. More than that, they are irritating and quite husky people. Playing is terrible. Mira what's wrong with you? Why Mira? You're the Oscar winner! Keep a little dignity! Her character was weak, but that's not an excuse for such a horrible show. It seems to be long in the moon. When I think about it, I actually think I saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes. I thought this woman was sexy. Well, she's not here. If you want to look at some skin try Roma and Michelle, because there is nothing to see here. And that emphasis? My God ... Olivier Martinez is even the worst. It's too painful to remember his performance to describe him here. I'm sorry, but I can not. I've sufficiently suffered with this trash. Whole this movie is depressing! It's so bad in every way, it's amazing how it was made at all. A bad team that makes a bad script and earns something over the actor's name. Do not fall for it. Avoid It! <br /> <br />
