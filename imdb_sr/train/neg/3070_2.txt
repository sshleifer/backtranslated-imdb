Oh, my dear ... they've turned out what was a pretty provocative movie in an incredible testosterone fest. He was the man who tried to drive from Denver to San Francisco to get a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life because of the price of a handful of tops? We're not very sure. We had several flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenalin drug addict, and he probably led his entire life trying to reach the point of disappearing. The point you see in the distance where the left and right shoulder joints connect, and the path disappears. He lives only to be free and does not mean anything to anyone. We saw several times when an accident occurred and stopped to make sure that the other driver was fine before going any further, even the policemen who had persecuted him. rather than being arrested and living in captivity. He died as if he were living, running wide open. In remake Kovalsky has a whole history (including the name, even.) Attempts to reach a hospital where his wife suffers from complications of pregnancy. He is a loyal husband and excited expecting his father. He comes to a decision to take his life after hearing that his wife died at birth, but even leaves it in question when he suggests he may have jumped out of the car before he hits the bulldozers. They even gave a part of the "super soul", a blind DJ (who brilliantly presented Clevon Little in the original) JASON PRIESTLI?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a break.
