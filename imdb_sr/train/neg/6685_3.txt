Although the film takes place at College Ivi League, it was shot entirely in North Arizona, mainly at the University of North Arizona in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. in the film were then members of the theater department. There is an absolutely absurd scene in this movie (if you know your geography in Arizona) that shows several actors who ride bicycles from college to stream. We NAU'ers know that the campus and said stream (Actualli Oak Creek Canion) is about 35 miles away, and while the journey is all the downhill, it would be literally impossible to drive the bike back the same way!
