I live in Salt Lake Citia and I'm not a mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Because I live in Utah and I thought it would be nice to see the locations I know in the movie. I really knew that I would go in that I would not get jokes in the interior so I was not surprised when I was sitting with a deer in the foreground of the headlights. What surprised me was the ant-mormon action set in this movie. a typical stereotype of people who are not of their own faith. Every non-Mormon, who was not much, drank, smoked and had a stunning selfish attitude, why? It really marked me about this movie, they made Mormons so clean, but the rest I suppose the state of Utah is filled with punk psychos only because they do not follow the verses of the LDS Church. I understand that plots are roving around all members of the LDS, but you think Salt Lake Citi was 100% Mormon, which is not nearly as accurate. And as I said, the non-mormons in the movie are shown as drunken jerks, please! I guess I do not understand it because I do not belong to their faith and I suppose I will never.
