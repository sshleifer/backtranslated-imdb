The animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds, and looks more like caricatures than characters. I was a fan of Scooby Doo since the series was premiered in 1969. Of these, it was pretty cool, and I like most people to think that Scrappi Doo is irritating, but this series is clean garbage. As soon as I saw the animation and heard the characters, (and I use that term freely) I speak, I squeezed myself. Also, Mysteries Inc. it was a team, and without the whole team to be complimented, it seems that opening a box of chocolates to find someone eating is the best, and the rest are only those that nobody wants. The new Scooby Doo was better than this. If you have a series of Scooby Doo TVs, include the elements that made the series so long. A whole range of characters and quality animation. They have to return this back beneath the stone from where it came from.
