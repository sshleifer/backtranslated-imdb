After Zebbedi Colt (The Night-Valker) raped Harri Reems's teenager, Reems became desperate and comforted with having sex with some lesbians. In the meantime, Colt, who wears a stick and dresses as a magician, raves another woman. In the end, Reems decides to find him and end up with crime. Despite being shot on the film and slightly nasty, it looks like some other porn from the '70s and is miserably performed. Scenes of rape / abuse are surprisingly abstained and an attempt to cash in on Death Vish is ridiculous. R. Bolla ("Cannibal Holocaust") plays a cop. Colt, who is usually at the top, is fighting in several scenes, but he's doing too well for my money. This rough could be a lot of rough.
