I love animated shows. I enjoy Nick's transportation, including Hey, Arnold. But moving a TV show on the Big Screen is not easy and it just is not big enough. It was more like a long episode of the show, and it just did not move so well. Judging by the behavior of children we had with us, they were not good either.
