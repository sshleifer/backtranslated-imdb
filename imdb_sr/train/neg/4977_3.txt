This is a fictitious TV show and a fairly unnecessary rendering of the science fiction channel Beowulf's story, especially after the recent Beovulf and Grendel 2005 film. This film does not enter the Beovulf story, but it only leads us through his battle against a hungry beast known as Grendel because he leaves the kingdom in absolute fear and restlessness, while powerful Viking warrior Beovulf is called to free them from the monster's rampage. If this is successfully accomplished, the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it in the open. After several unsuccessful attempts, the creature was killed, but it is an angry and vindictive mother who attacks quickly, leaving Beovulf, again, to lay down her mighty acts of courage and strength to defeat her. "Grendel" looks like it was shot at a tiny budget, and the effects of CG are terrible. As I said, this film is absolutely unnecessary.
