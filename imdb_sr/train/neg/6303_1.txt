I had great hopes for this film. I thought the premise was interesting. I went through it, even though I found the acting, except Helena Bonham Carter, without exception. I kept hoping that my time I spent would pay off, but in the end I was left to wonder why they even tried to make this thing. Perhaps in the version of George Orwell there is a message that is worth transmitting. If this film did something, I was inspired to read Orwell's classic. It's hard for me to believe that his story could be disappointing as this adaptation. If the manufacturer's message "earthly life is worth living", then they succeeded. I would not recommend this film to anyone; It's 101 minutes of my life.
