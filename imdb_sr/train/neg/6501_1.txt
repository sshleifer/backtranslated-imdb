This film is one more, one of those films that someone thinks or is trying to make others think they understand it. Anyone who's trying to make sense is MORON! My advice would be to take TWO not one, but TWA hits very strong acids and at least get a visual excitement! Although you can eventually kill yourself due to acid loss !!!! Since this comment requires 10 lines of information, let me write something for those of you who will try to defend the film. Unintelligble. Garbage. Schitzoid. Talent scattering. The film is ice, with paper at the destination with ring-shaped clouds, on a sunny dive in the puddle .... It sounds like a lion in a red light with visible hair. Now explain this to me !!!!
