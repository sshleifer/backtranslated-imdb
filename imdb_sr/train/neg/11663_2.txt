VHITE CHICKS Hold on to why they could not dress like Black Chicks, oh, yeah, they would not look different at all. Can somebody give me one Vaians movie in which they did not dress like ladies? There is no danger of counting, Jack Vhite and Michael Costanza Ghost wrote that (other members of the Norton Trio were acting directors). In the Chicks Chase, in fact, there was never a joke. Only Vaians behaves like girls for 2 hours. No settings, no punchlines and no laughter. It's a lot "I think I'm going to play some time crisis 3." At least for me it was (5 times more accurate). Someone has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Sean, Damien (the only talented), Kim, Rakeesha, George V. , and Osama Bin Vaians to stop making films. It just hurts the O-Zone layer. VERDICT 1/2 * outside ****
