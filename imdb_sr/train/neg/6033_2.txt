The guys who have ever thought of watching this movie already have some disruption that passes through their heads .. This film has nothing to do with Jack Trbosek (what you thought) to his other B, I mean the E-Grade movie that consists of a crowd of rosy teenagers in certain scenes of sex that are looked at just before their spleen sprinkles on a nearby tree. It's not scary, fun, or fun. If you really feel like bloody things without complications, then watch Cabin Fever, at least the director did not fall asleep halfway through the directing of this shit. Just watch this if you do not have absolutely nothing in life and the only thing on TV is that Oprah Vinfrei cries on the TV.
