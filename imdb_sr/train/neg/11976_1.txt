This show comes with interesting locations as fast as a travel channel. It is charged as a reality, but in reality it is pure soap opera. He tries to use exotic locations as a facade to bring people into a fake competition, and then continues to attract spectators to the competition's opera opera. Sat - making up the situation for their candidates to try and overcome. Then he rewards the winner. If they can spice them with a little interaction between characters, even better. While the format of the game is slower than Beat The Clock - the real success of this series is to avoid reality. This show has elements of several types of successful past programs. Realize television, barely, but if you get into competitors, outlets or competitions, this is your cup of tea. If not, this whole series is like I said. This is another exhibition that hides behind the label of reality, which is a trend that began in 2000. It is smooth and well-manufactured, so it can take some time. After all, they do it and reprise Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies and The Bradi Bunch. This just does not hire professional actors. The level of intelligence is about the same.
