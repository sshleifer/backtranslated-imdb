Growing up, Joe Strummer was my hero, but I even stay cool from this movie. For better and worse, Buducnost is unwritten is not a documentary "Behind Music". Instead, it is a biographical artistic film, full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly meaningless animated sketches lifted with "Animal Farms". The film is coherent, but exceeded in about half an hour. The form of campfire, while touching thoughts, is actually quite dull in execution. First, without title, it's hard to even know who is half the respondents. Second, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Kusak's mouth lying to hosanna about a man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life, and their opinions do not give anything to his story. This picture is at best when Strummer, through recorded interviews and conversations, touches upon the aspects of her life that most people did not know. o: the suicide of his elder brother, who reconciled himself to the deaths of his parents, the joy of paternity. For me, this was the most compelling since Joe Strummer showed not as a punk icon that we all knew and loved, but as a normal human being who had to face the joys and sorrows of life that we all have to face. There were better, clearer documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (Vestvai, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Loder, the MTV documentary from the early 90's came to mind.) Joe Strummer: The future is unwritten only for diehards.
