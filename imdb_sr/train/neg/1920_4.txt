I'm not saying Night of the Tvisters was terrible, but it was far from big. Indirect in absolute best. It seems to me, however, that every time a film type is published, the second one must be at about the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's climax) The Twist Night is actually just a Twister except for the worse and with everyday special effects. they were not great, it was a film itself, directing, special effects, the whole story was too strange to interpret. A series of tornadoes hit the city, and the film is actually about people who are trying to find family and friends and to cope with the damage. I do not really know why duplicate disaster films seem to have been released almost synchronized, but this would be better with Bill Pacton and Helen Hunt.
