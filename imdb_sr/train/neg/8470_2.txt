I watch lots of scary movies (or at least try to be) and this must be the worst, if not the worst movie I ever had to make to try to pass. I never knew the depth of massacre until I rented this piece of canvas cheese covered with a latex contraceptive. I'm a fan of Julian Sansa, but this is worse than I would have hoped for him. On the other hand, the story promised and I was intrigued ... the first minute and they were rolling on the loan and I just had to see what kind of pain it looked like first hand. There may be some viewers who have enjoyed this and can direct me in the right direction, but then I know those viewers who understand me, if not me, especially when we had to turn off the video, and this is simply not done with our watching (obviously have to make one exception). If it's for remake, I would give her a chance for as long as they had a maximum of 1% of the original built into it. That is all.
