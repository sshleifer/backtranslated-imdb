Let me tell you that I watched this video watching Sav and after Bleed, Sav looked like the strongest horror movie, although I thought it was pretty good. Bleeding is pretty bad. The best part is watching a female actor. The blood is very fake and exaggerated. It has funny parts, but it is extremely predictable and I did not want to stay to see the horrible end. If I could, I would forbid these actors and actresses, the only reason Debbie Rochon (Maddi) was in more than a hundred other videos, and I also saw two other actors in the same or worse movie. They should not continue this madness.
