I never found Charlee Chase very funny, even though his character on the screen sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, who I think is VERO funny. (Charlie Ces also reminds me of Henry Henne's "Sunday Mail" comic book in Scotland.) In Chase's best films, I'm inclined to admire his professionalism, not to laugh at him. I will give Chase a loan that his best films - such as 'Mighty Like a Moose' and 'His Voodden Vedding' - have inspired a freak that is fiercely loyal ... but I am sure that even the hardest fan of Chase will be agree that very early and very rough 'Married to Order' is simply not funny. Chase - eager, awkward, gormless, naff - is a young slut who hopes to judge the Rose Fair. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this film as her father, who despises Chase as 'mollicoddle'. Leo White, who has done a more noticeable work as a foil for Caplin in Escape, is like a rival. There is some action that includes an Ingersoll watch. I was intrigued that the brand name was mentioned in the titles of the dialogue: is this an early example of placement of products? Unfortunately, the main disadvantage in 'Married to Order' is Casting Rosemary Thebi as Rose: she is meant to be a standard ingenue, but Thebi - flat-chested, falconry - - is physically wrong for the role. Thebe (wife Harry Miers) had a successful career as a film actress, but she was never convincing innocence. The film's historian Villiam K Everson dealt with her very repulsively in one of her film books. I will evaluate 'Married to order' only 3 out of 10, and I am charity ... I constantly doubt that Charlee Chase has something that everyone else gets, but I'm constantly losing.
