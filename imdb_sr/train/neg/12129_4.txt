Before this film, I saw only two films by director Andrea Bianchi: Trashi zombie film Le Notti del Terrore (1981), known among horror fans for his unforgettable performance by man-child Peter Bark, and pleasantly giallo Strip Nude For Iour Killer. None of the films was a particularly spectacular movie, but both were fun in their own special way (and the fact that they had much worse and the nudity did not hurt). The massacre, however, is boring, dull, boring, despite a fairly small spatter and a strange place of needless goof meat. The story of a series of murders in a hotel where actors and the crew of a horror movie that appear during the shooting is confusing and oh boring: when the blood is not running and the skin is not displayed, the film is a real struggle to pass (I need four attempts with endless scenes of unusual characters who argue with each other and make very few remarks. The only interesting point in the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of his death scenes to plant him mega-mountain movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've already seen this movie, nda there is little reason to bother with the massacre.
