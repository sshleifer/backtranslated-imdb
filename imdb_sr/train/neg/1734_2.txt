I am a big fan of the old Westerna and I do not believe Hollywood is capable of catching up with its old glory. But even Ronda Fleming and Steven Granger can not help this 1957 film that carries almost all the banal characteristics of a Westernized reformer who has become a good guy. a fallen but strong woman, intolerant citizens who have to turn to a revolver for salvation, etc. I can not help but notice the surname of the writer and the young "actor" played by Granger's son. Is there nepotism there? I saw better acting in high school. Chill Vills plays Chill Vills caricature. Did I get up to 1000 words?
