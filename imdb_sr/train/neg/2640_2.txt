Trying to think of something as useless as THE SENTINEL would be quite difficult. There are many problems. The result is terrible and filled with cavities. Michael Douglas starring Pete Garrison, an agent of the secret service who "took" for Reagan during his life's attempt. Years later, we find that Pete was assigned to the Withehouse family, mostly as the guard of the first lady (Kim Basinger, L. A. CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise when we see Pete's close co-operation with the first lady and a sudden threat to the president himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete misses a polygraph test, he is singled out as an unhappy agent by researcher David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series). As the presidential plan of murder takes place, Pete is on the run from his own people. His only confidant is the first lady, and she does not want to tell anyone about her feelings for each other (why Pete did not even get it on the polygraph at all). But is Pete really innocent? Or simply trying to buy time until he kills the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the attempted assassination while running away from the Secret Service? One big, huge problem with this film is that there is no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. Is not that what the film should be about? One would think! But the audience never gives up why the killer wants to kill Prez. Hmm. Somebody forgot to put it somewhere in the script? What about the new partner David Breckinridge (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S VAI)? It looks like it was put in a movie exclusively as a piece of sweets. What was its purpose? Did she do anything but look nice in tight pants and blouses with a low cut? There are so many problems with the basic assumption that Sentinel is ridiculous. The action was too easy to stop "What ...?" The answers will surely be pronounced by those who are unhappy to watch the movie.
