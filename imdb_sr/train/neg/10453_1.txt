This movie deserves more than 1. But I give it one because so fan fans gave 10, which resulted in getting a rating that will take it to the top 100 list. Seriously, it's not that great it's not that bad. It's a stupid cult classic with so many fanatic fans that's funny. These are the guys who are probably still laughing at Shock Norris and still say: "I'm Rick James B! TCH" No matter how old or boring. I'm afraid to hear "I'm tired of MFn snakes on this MFn plane" from now on the idiots trying to be ridiculous. His shit shop with crap, and so on. It's okay to love a bad movie, but you still have to admit it's a bad movie.
