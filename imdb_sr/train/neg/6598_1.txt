This "film" is a travesty. No, wait - horror. NO, THANKS - this is no doubt the absolute BEST movie ever made with beloved characters created and established by other actors. he was ridiculous and holy, but even dare to "process" Stan Lorel and Oliver Hardy is a dark and exhausting money. G. G. G. Lorel and Mr. Hardy are dead, that is, from 1957 and 1965. Why would anyone think that the appropriate updates for L & H would be in the person of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain outside of me. I totally expected that I would be horrified and confused and I was certainly not disappointed. Anyone involved in this pathetic, moronic, shameful, should be fulfilled from everything and everything connected with Hollywood and film creation. AVOID THIS FILM ON ALL COSTS - WERE WARNING.
