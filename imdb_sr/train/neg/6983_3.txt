The revolution is a horrible movie, I do not care if you are a history teacher, a news writer, Al Pacino fan, there is no way that this movie can make a legitimate '10'. The key indicates that Tom Dobb (Al) tried to get money from the remark he received for the radical patriots who took his ship. Everything is about the note. Tom's son joins the army to make up for a remark, and Tom joined the army, go on an adventure trying to get out of the army, years later the war is over and finally they can turn the wallets for their ship. The end. He had several battle scenes, and they were at best central. Transitions between scenes are used "five months later" and magically put characters in a known historical battle. A lovely story is a joke, and the movie as a whole is difficult to follow. So keep your "Notes" and watch the Patriot.
