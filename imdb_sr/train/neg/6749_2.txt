This confusion is so bad that it does not even qualify as a horror. Talent Debbie Rochon is completely lost in this film. She's not even a bad guy. The rest of the actors look like porn vannabes, and the plot is so lame that I will not even mention it. Make yourself a service and skip credits to hear the upcoming band TvoMarlove performance "Better Than Sek" that's a total of 80-odd Disco candies. Nice tempo song about Gambleing & Sec. Much more fun than "Bleed". This way, when you have the equipment for copying videos, but you just decide to record a song at the end of the movie, you have a really "bad" movie.
