A cowboy who is sympathetic to the suffering of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly charged with rape and murder of his daughter's daughters, which has led to a lot of hatred and violence. This brilliant nudist feature is fun to watch, completely impossible to defend on any artistic level. Terrible costumes and the fact that all Indians are obviously white, make this look more like a live cartoon than a serious production for which the printed materials are pretending to be. In short, abundant nausea (the real reason for watching this) is good. Everything else is not. Definitely better examples of both genres. Interestingly, Ramrodder was shot on the famous Spahn film ranch and has not one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobbi Beausoleil. He was probably already in the can of a murder when it was this hit the sophisticated Pussicat Theater!
