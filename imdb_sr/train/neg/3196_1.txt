The only words that need fear more than Joe Don Baker if you're thinking about watching a movie is Greidon Clark, and if they're both there, they run for their lives. However, this is a very funny movie, because they take it seriously! It starts badly and from there it goes downhill, recurring scenes, Good Bad and Ugly like a shooting will roll on the floor with a laugh. just as he can. He says his rules, doing things in his own way, as long as he wears cowboy boots and cowboy style. You want to see a bad but funny movie? Go ahead, your move!
