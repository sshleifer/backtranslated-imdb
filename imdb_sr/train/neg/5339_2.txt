Okay, I'm like most people, give me free tickets, and I'll go and see most of the things, now that the multiplexes are so good (I remember old cinemas with "fleas" and I'm a healthy side of 40). In England, this film is published as "Liar", it's a dog. It's a total loss of a good celluloid. 4/10 for photo and setup only.
