A Brief Summary: This film humiliates anyone he touches. That means you are. First, let me say I'm not a purist, and that may have been funny for a few minutes. Imitations are not bad. But overall, it's just boring and unusually funny. A few simple jokes are repeated over and over again. It is clear that these films exist only to expel the last few dollars from the now-protected Laurel and Hardy. Producers can not have any real respect for their place in film history, nor for their talents. That's what offended me the most. Of course, my daughter liked it, so I also failed as a parent;)
