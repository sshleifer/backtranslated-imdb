I rated Basic Instinct 2 tall, but this film got less than 4 ratings. This film got only 4 of me, but there are 7.3 out of over 600 people. I can not see why this movie loves it so much. This film is boring, because it hardly leaves those rooms in that broken big house. There are only 5 people in this movie. It's almost two hours long, which is completely unnecessary. Many dialogues are slow and meaningless. The movie tone is also dark blue, which is depressing to watch. The film can be shortened to a few sentences. This film reminds me of "Three Times" directed by Hou Hsiao Hsien, that it is equally boring, the dialogues are equally boring. It also has a high rating! I had to stop watching the one after the first story. This film has no passion or excitement.
