This is the biggest flop in 2008. I do not know what the Director is his mind in creating such a huge catastrophe. The songs are added without situations, the story is stretched to fill the void of 3 hours, and most strikingly the action cascades played by actors is like all of them have super powers that can run between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person who does fighting with 100 people. Only the best performance was Anil Kapoor, a man who, during his time, best acted as a villain in a comedy act that speaks Hinglish ... Akki also did a good job .... But the filmmaker simply forgets.
