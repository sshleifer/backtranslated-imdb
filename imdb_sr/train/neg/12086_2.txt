... this Verson does not change Bard so badly. It's still a terrible minimalist production, Hamlet's Dutch uncle is unexplainedly named by Spin (whether it's Ricardo Montalban or not debated), and Maximilian Shell exaggerates as never before. Most of the dialogs are unharmed, and the fact that the MST3K version feels compelled to repeatedly stress that the talk is long * does not seem incredibly funny to me. It's mostly just bad behavior.
