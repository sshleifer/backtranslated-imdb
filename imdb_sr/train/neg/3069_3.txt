Iuck! And again I say ... JAK! The original version of this film was a well-targeted story about a man who was already dead and drove through a purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and did not get out of it to say it. And he had a naked fish on a motorcycle. This version seems to me as something that the manufacturer bought the rights to, and then abandoned by disinterest. It seems that a group of individuals deliberately decided to adapt to the nineties and changed their ethnicity and gender just to be sweet. The film does not refer to combating suicide in the last act of defiance. It's about a man trying to come to the hospital to see his wife. There was no reason for this film to be made except to anger me ...
