Once I included 700 clubs and I only agreed to some of the statements - I am one of the many believers that most Christians consider liberal and most non-Christians conservatives. I vote for my mind, and this is usually not a tail. or dem. - I do not believe that the 700 club tells people what to believe, but that he represents many of the elderly Christians who grew up in a very conservative environment. I think that many people misunderstood what is said at the club 700. It makes me wonder how the name is called any direction. I think 700 people in the club really love Jesus, but they are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they forgot to show love to certain people and promote peace as Jesus did. Please do not judge Jesus on the basis of the ignorant individuals who believe in Him and do not be so ignorant of our comments on them. Why are people so evil towards each other?
