This film should be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! Apart from a few smiles and one or two scenes up, this movie is a total waste of time. Calling "Campi", she does not even shave her. "Campi" means the fun that this movie was not. You spent the first half of the film thinking "It must be better, is not it?". Rightly, at the very end, when he finally explained who the "brother / sister" team and what they want, until then, you no longer worry because you spent the whole other half of the film wondering exactly. Onorati and Ms. Pacula have made someone get away from this bad guy to get stuck in such an awful movie. <br /> <br />
