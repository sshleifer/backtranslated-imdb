The last of Tarzan's films shot by Johnny Veissmuller is also a good thing, as it is the worst of the 12 films he filmed for 16 years. No siren appears here as a beautiful island woman trying to escape the clutches of her people, who worship the god and try to force her to be his bride. Finds Tarzan and Jane, who are trying to protect it. George Zucco is present as a potential villager of a great priest, but he is not fully used. Also, at the reach of your hand is a very boring guitarist / singer who often sings in a song. Even the "great" Robert Florei can not help this. 1/2 (out of four)
