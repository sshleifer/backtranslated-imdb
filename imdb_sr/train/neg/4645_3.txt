Belmondo is a tough cop. He goes for the big time drug dealer (played by Henri Silva, a great villain - see "Shark's machine", but here it is clearly called, and for this reason he misses his usual charisma). He goes to the most intricate places in Paris and Marseilles, searches for some names, fights some people, gets names, goes to more scouting places, searches for more names, wins more people, etc. after punch. It seems that the people who made it did not have other ambitions than to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who has been here for 50 years, initially performs some good acrobatics; Apart from these, "Le Marginal" is a violent, episodic, banal, shallow and unforgettable police movie. (* 1/2)
