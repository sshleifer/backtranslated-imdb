First of all, if you are a comic book lovers, well, you will be very disappointed to be sure! Lov budget movie !!! Largo should be Serbian in a coma, now suddenly becomes Croatian, pfff! chicken producers, gave the spice and courage to a comedian (by the way, in his film his father speaks Serbian and speaks Croatian ... Lol). A striking building called N.I. Vinch becomes a common small-yacht in H.K. Nice looks Largo becomes an unshaven Tzigan / Turkish figure. Freddy, the cool 'chicken' pilot becomes some fat, out of shape, sad, average guy. Simon, Largov a good friend, does not exist at all !? He gave some pepper! Largo does not throw knives at all, but only some snake views ... The whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious TV movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, ability, or technology to fit in with comics, please keep up with some of the romances made in Paris. Very bad movie, the good thing I just rent, do not count on me to watch the sequel (if there is one!).
