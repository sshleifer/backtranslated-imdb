First To Die 2003 First I will admit my mistake: I did not realize that this was made for a TV movie. I was "rejected" by the "R" certificate. The action is strong, but the film is too long for about 40 minutes. The direction and continuity were excellent. By and large the actors were remarkable and did a good job with their characters. The bottom side of the film is that it definitely belongs to the genre "chick flick". Although there are some violent scenes, no violence should require a "R" rating. No nudity or free sex scenes. In fact, there are no sex scenes. She Grauer (which is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonia Salomaa and Glinis Davies were guests on the SG-1 series, but this film did not do anything to make a career progress, since they were all used as low-supporting actresses. Robert Patrick was fantastic, as usual and Mitch Pileggi made me think of the modern day of Lee Marvin. A very talented Megan Gallagher, whom I respected as an actor during the Millennium Series, did not get anything challenging to show her range of abilities. The biggest disappointment with the acting was Traci Pollan. Except the actress is below the average and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely boring. I found myself turning off the TV during its dialogue. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys TV shows. I would not recommend you pay money to see this movie. Given that I did not find anything that would cause censorship, this is a movie that is worth watching only on television, because nothing will be cut. As a TV movie, I estimate that it is 5 out of 10. As a feature film with a "R" certificate and as a strong cast, I estimate it as 2 out of ten.
