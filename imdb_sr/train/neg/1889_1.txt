This film is not in any way a fun, but more a look at the depths of the darkest side of human behavior. He lows half a dozen stories of the worst kind of corruption, sex drive, greed, violence and intolerance. All actions take place during several hot and sticky days in Vienna, and the heat may be responsible for some of the fury and hatred of the film. For me, the treatment of retarded girls by the security equipment vendor was about the worst episode, closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the slave house. You will be captured and I hope this movie will be horrified. I hated him, but I felt compelled to see it. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 for showing 'man' as it is sometimes.
