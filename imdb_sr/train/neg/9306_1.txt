This movie is the worst excuse for a movie I've ever seen. To begin with, I would like to say that the front page of this film is certainly deceptive, if you think that you will see a really terrifying horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong. In fact, the killers do not even match the front cover, it's just the image they found on Google and they think it looks cool. Talking about the things they found and thought it looked cool, there's a scene in which some of the gangs are searching for friends in the old forest, and then suddenly the screen is cut to the scene where the mother of a deer nursing in the bright sun ... I mean seriously VTF ??? How is it relevant to the dark forests they are wandering about? I bought this movie from a man on the market, hoping it would be fun, if there was no horror, then at least it would be ridiculous, would not it? VRONG! The next day, I gave it to my colleague who got rid of the plague named S.C.K. Basically is: Do not watch this movie!
