I went to watch this movie knowing it would not be great. but what I saw was horrible to say. I do not want to be sharp, only the movie was horrible. everything was bad, I mean AVFUL special effects, the acting was not bad, but it was not good either, and I was a guest myself ... in my opinion, the best movie from Skazkuatch is Harry and Hendersons. not violent or horrible, but it has the best view of the sasquatch. at least it's a suit, not some semi-cgi rik-off. you will see this movie only if you are desperate or really appreciate anybody in the movie. or see the saints of the Holy War, it's much better.
