After listening and enjoying the commentary by Omen II Harvey Bernhard, I was shocked to find that he was behind this absolute piece of garbage. It's like a really bad TV movie that you can watch in the middle of the day when you have a flu and you're too sick to get to the remote. I think that for the moment when Michael Lerner faces what I can only describe as Les Miserables' high school, my mouth has opened in disbelief. And then my mouth went up and down, because I laughed so much. Dire. I do not know why I have to write at least ten lines, I put my point briefly, there's nothing smart about it.
