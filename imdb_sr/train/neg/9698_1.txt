Now there are many talented filmmakers / actors in Germany. None of them are connected to this "movie". Why do manufacturers actually invest money in something like this? You could make 10 good films with the budget of this garbage! It's not fun to have seven adult men running around like dwarfs, pretending to be ridiculous. Interestingly, however, the filmmaker (who is the oldest type of group) plays the youngest dwarf. It was supposed to laugh now! "It's hard to believe that this shit should be a comedy. Many people got up and left the movie for 30 minutes in the movie. I should have done the same instead of wasting time ... Bol!
