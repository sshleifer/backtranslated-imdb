This must be some of the worst directions I've ever seen. A large plan can be very powerful, but when each scene consists only of close-ups, it loses its influence. Tony Scott has some very beautiful landscapes with which he can work, the background of Mexico, the canteen, the beautiful estate in which Antun Quinn lives, and the dusty cities through which the Traveler passes on the avenue of vengeance. Unfortunately, we just catch quick views of these sites before the camera cuts a picture of a great, giant head. Even the transition scenes where Costner drove only through Mexico quickly moved to a close-up plan. The result is too dramatic and intrusive, dictating any emotions we need to feel. The story itself should have been resolved much better. Among other things, too many people appear out of nowhere to help Costner - it's just bad writing. It is a typical thriller story, but many others took the same premise and made extraordinary things with it. Costner's No Vai Out had a similar story, but it was a much better movie. The ending was completely antichlimatic and he suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film. This film will never be great, but if we saw more of Mexico and less gigantic heads, this movie could have been visible.
