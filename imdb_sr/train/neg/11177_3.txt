In what seemed to me the longest one hour I had to endure for a long time, Al Pacino gives the right performance to make sure. Not the usual guy, which was nice. But his character was really pathetic. Somebody to drink while stumbling about forgetting meetings while we realize that Hollywood social life has exhausted him from his life energy. But in this film, we needed someone who liked it. And for some reason, every character in the picture said: "I do not know why I like you, Eli", and Al Pacino's character and I could not even like him. other actors played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established personality developed on television or in earlier films. Kim Basinger was not even in the movie long enough to present any performance. The film's story had no momentum. Most scenes never trigger a story, but only collect facts about characters that later came to play in an anti-climatic ending. He had the potential, in addition to their unwillingness to relate to the story. What is the purpose of the film? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would like to believe: "When Hollivood has you, you can not get out." Yeah, right! And that's why so many people are fired at Hollivood.
