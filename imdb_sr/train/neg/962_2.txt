The chances are that if I looked at this again, I could be physically ill, the film is so boring ... ... unless you believe in psychics, reincarnation, and other hocuses that promote this greatly. "Re-circulation of the soul," they call it here. Puh-leeze. This story has already been done several times with movies such as "Heaven Can Vait". It's also done much better. It is a shame that they had to spend the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cibill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Marie Stuart Masterson. It's about the only quality of this movie.
