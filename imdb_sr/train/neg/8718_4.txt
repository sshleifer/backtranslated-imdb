The third continuation of the trilogy "Carnosaur" contains a bunch of military commandos from Keystone Kops who are trying to kill two Velociraptors and T-Reka. I give her 4 out of pure sympathy and affinity for dinosaurs. The film is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it can not be taken seriously. More importantly, however, watching this film I can not but notice some interesting parallels between the trilogy "Carnosaur" and "Kstro". The first sequel to both franchises is a dark, disturbing movie that has become a cult classic, the second is "Alien" ripoff, and the third is a tongue-in-the-face, almost a slapstick (whether intentional or not) a movie that you smile on the floor. Also, like the "Kstro" franchise, all "Carnosaur" films are totally unrelated. They only carry the franchise name to be interested in "sequels", I suppose. It is obvious that "Carnosaur" and "Kstro" have two different production groups at work here, but if you have seen all three films from both franchises, you are going to move between them.
