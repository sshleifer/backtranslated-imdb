Here's one of those films that broke the insistence of studying at a happy ending. The conflicts that have stagnated for years are resolved in a matter of minutes. It would be much more interesting to introduce a tone of ambiguity. Talented Barbara Stanvick was abolished by a sudden metamorphosis from an independent and persistent woman to a disadvantaged woman of the kind she left her whole life. Brent, as usual, exceeds his head, and then it's a funny situation when Gig Ioung is playing a character named Gig Ioung. Somebody mentions "Gig Young" and then who appears, but Gig Ioung, an actor! Worth to see, though far below what could have been.
