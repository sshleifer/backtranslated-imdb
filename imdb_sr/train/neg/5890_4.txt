This romantic comedy is not bad. There are some funny things that happen here and there, and there are some pretty memorable characters. While some scenes are fun, others are simply unpleasant. I especially thought that the "romantic" part of the story was bad. All in all, it may be worth seeing if you love football and romantic comedies. It's not really a bad movie, and the end was good. Just do not expect anything from the ordinary. Fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
