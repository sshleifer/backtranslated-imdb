It's like a bad TV show from the '80s, it's lost and tried to become a soft-core porn movie. Oh my God, it was bad. The records of each character were irrelevant. The plot itself had nothing to say. Something about a stalker, I suppose. In the end, shooting? It's not clear, but somehow a volleyball game is involved. And the main hero (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it, and in the end they wanted to cross over to scenes with him in him, which were barely visible. Thank God I did not spend any money on it, but I want that watch of my life.
