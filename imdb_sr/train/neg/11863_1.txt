I thought these films were desperate, I expected it to be much better than it was. I'm so glad I did not pay to see this movie and I did not sit in the cinema for this. From where to start with this movie, the acting in this movie was average, humor was horrible and only the overall story of this film was not special. I thought this film should be great, but it was no more than a raw waste of time. I think the acting in this movie was terrible, none of the actors in this movie had any chemistry, it simply was not. I think it might be better if we played a different actress Kirk than Jai Baruchel, maybe it would be better, but all the time I watched this movie it looked high and I did not have the feeling that it was not playing in this movie. Now, Alice Eve has done a great job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jaia. All the actors in this film did not have names and had very little influence in this film. Humor in this film was not ridiculous at all, there were a few lines in this movie that were fine, but nothing worth telling your friends that they will understand. I think Jim Field Smith had problems with this because he could not decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. I honestly think that it needs to keep advertising for Burger King. I think this movie could be better if the writers went to another director. The story of this movie is just like any other pretty girl who is just OK, a love story boring I think it would be better if she had more originality, but that does not mean anything. Frankly, I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie. I think you would have more fun with the dentist than in this movie. So save your agony and you just can not see it.
