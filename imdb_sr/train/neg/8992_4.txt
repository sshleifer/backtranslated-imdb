This is a decent undertaking, but the guy who wrote the script seems to be a bit in the dark about what exactly makes the zombie movie cool. No, these are not CGI errors and software companies. In fact, I'm not sure whether it was a software company - I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what they were talking about. In any case, my point was - instead of wasting time animating a stupid bug, why not throw more zombies and more action. 2/3 of 20 minutes consist of newsletters, bugs, some guys shouting about something. And in order to make matters worse (boring), most deaths occur outside of the screen. I realized that this was all usual for films without budget, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, somehow) that led me to wonder why the director (or scriptwriter, anything) decided to focus on the beginning - That It's short, nobody will care.
