I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in film material can turn into a ho-hum event. Vm C Kuantrill was barely represented in the film, probably the most intriguing figure of that period. Frank James never mentioned, Cole Iounger, the same, and Bloodi Bill Anderson, who would cry for his murdered sister every time he entered the battle, he was completely absent in the script. Instead, we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we care about. how sad. However, costumes were wonderful, as well as recording locations in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will make another movie from that period and try again, or another director will look at the enormous wealth of writing materials on the screen.
