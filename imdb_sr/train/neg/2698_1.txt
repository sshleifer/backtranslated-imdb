This film shows how racist John Singleton is. He displays white and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system. How quickly he forgets that this same educational system did what it did and failed. The image of a glacial cube is a symbol of a stimulating black man who was responsible for most of the violence in this movie. Singleton barely touched the relationship between white and black characters who were trying to reach each other. When Omar Epps says "I have to be with my people," this racist remark was spoken. And John, do not even think for a moment that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the staircase on the tower did not attract my attention. Good addition!
