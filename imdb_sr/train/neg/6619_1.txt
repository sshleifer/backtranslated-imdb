This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in the movie !! I can not wait to finish it. To make things worse, you get a 12A certificate so that you do not see anyone being shot, only the bodies collapsed to the ground, even Babban was killed he was cut! Too many scenes were cut out to bring younger viewers, because I think the creators knew it would happen catastrophically !! Amitabh's acting was great, but that 'Basanti' vannabe and the other idiot who plays Devgan's friend can not even act. Devgan was futile! I would not look at it again for free and I would like to advise everyone who reads this to do the same thing that you have been WARNED !!
