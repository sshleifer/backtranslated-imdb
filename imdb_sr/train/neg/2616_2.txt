Remember the name of Kevin Lima - and please, please do not let it go again. Time, rhythm, editing: everything is hopelessly wrong. Three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, go with the set) can not do anything to save movie amateurs like Alice Evans, and types of production standards what would you expect from children's shows on British TV? The greatest mystery: music. The result is so incompetent, inappropriate and unsuitable for the tone of the film that is seriously wondering if this is the case with sabotage. Add an acoustics that seem obviously uninhronized from a single microphone, and a director who only occasionally remembers the addition of a non-screened audio action, and we have what must be at the highest rate of money in the last years.
