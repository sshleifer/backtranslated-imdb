Well, at least my theater group did it, lol. Of course, I remember seeing Grease since I was small, although it was never my favorite music or story, it still has a special place in my heart because it's still very fun to watch. I heard horrible things about Grease 2 and that's why I decided to never watch it, but my boyfriend said it was not that bad and my friend agreed, so I decided to shoot him, but I called them and just laughed . First, the plot was completely stolen from the first one and it was not very smart, not to mention that they only used the same characters, but with different names and actors. Tell me, how did the Pink ladies and T-birds continue to last for years after the former gangs left? Not to mention the creator who faces the motorcycle enemy, Gee, what a stunning similarity to the guys in the first movie, as with these T-Birds, were just stupid and funny. music and dance did not stop. But when the new student Sandi cousin comes on stage, he is the love that a pink lady hit, Stephanie. But she has to stick to the code where only Pink Ladies have to stick to the T-Bird, so the new student decides to practice as a T-Bird to win her heart. So he dresses as a rebel motorcycle bandit who can ride well and defeat evil bikers by lightly hitting t-birds. But will Stephanie say who he really is or will find out by himself? Well, discover for yourself. Mast 2 is like a kind of stupid TV show that did not work. The band did not click the same way as the first Grease, not to mention the French return was a bit silly and incredible, because I thought she graduated from Ridell, but obviously she did not. The songs were not so attractive; I'm glad Michelle managed to get back so fast, but that's probably because she was the only talented in this stupid sequel, I would not really recommend this movie unless you're curious but I warned you, this is just pathetic Try to get more money from a famous musical. 2/10
