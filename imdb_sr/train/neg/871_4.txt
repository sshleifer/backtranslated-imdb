Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local town of Reverand, married to Marta (Alli Sheedi), but is also a regular woman and decides to lie down to escape with his current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovic). However, he gets an attack of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Salli Kirkland is also at your fingertips like a crazy old doll who fears for the good Reverand in the "Mouse" shades. It's sad to see pretty good thrown like this one. At least John John was in the role of a horrible forgetful private investigator. In a film written as a "black comedy", both elements must be included in this film. Although this brings the former into a dash, it unfortunately does not contain any other. In addition, you can not emphasize with any of the characters and as such, you have absolutely no interest in them. Technically, not a complete bad movie, only one extremely forgetful. Eie Candi: Dara Tomanovich gets toples; Salli Kirkland also shows some skin My rating: C- Where I saw it: Shovtime Shovcase
