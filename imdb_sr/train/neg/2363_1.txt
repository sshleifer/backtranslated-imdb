This film was just terrible, the first movie was not so good that I think it's funny stupid if they did not have enough from the first 5 movies that you had to add again, why not just turn this into a series like James Bond, I'll say you are exactly why, because the films about connections are actually very good and these movies just stink, I do not understand, whether this should have been a cross between genres like horror and comedy for goodness, my old 1 year old nephew would not be scared of such a funny attempts of horror, spitting in the face of people who at least want something at a certain moment to intimidate the so-called horror film. Please do not make more of these films.
