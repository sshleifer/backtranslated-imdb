This film comes directly from the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the nineties by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror films. The most famous catastrophes in their nature are "subspecies", "villagers" and "tranches". None of them are recommended, nor is Dr. Mordridge actually. The hyperactive director Charles Band came to the right company for his film. Dr. Mordree is incredibly stupid and stupid and almost completely without sense of humor. I saw it just because it played Jeffrey Combus. I learned that this may have several drawbacks if you are his fan. For every good movie, he seems to have made five inferior ones. In any case, the story is about a battle between two ancient wizards. One good man here 150 years to protect people (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and one evil Kabbalah. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason I've already forgotten. Combs gets instructions from a mentor. This "type" exists only in pairs of eyes in the universe. Very strong, that is! A flashing light flash appears on the screen, but this is the only form of special effects that this movie has. The whole thing is just a piece of sneaking and complaining, and when two wizards finally face each other, it's almost before you know that ... I would expect the evil sorcerer to return a bit, but not ... In some scenes, you can really discover some originality and creativity (for example Jeffrey's lecture on the influence of the Moon on criminals) and if you really pay attention, you may find some very small, but nice aspects (like raven). which is called Edgar Allen), but in general, it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he's a superhero in my eyes ... but he certainly does not have to put a stupid maillot on it.
