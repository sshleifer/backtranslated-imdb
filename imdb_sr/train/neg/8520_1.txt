When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was broadcast in the United States, I was thrilled. Then I had an accident to watch the damn thing. I love the book M. C. Beaton about the wonderful Scottish cop. The characters in the book are fun and very well written. The forces responsible for this mish-mash obviously never read one of the Beaten's books. The name itself "Hamish Macbeth" has anything to do with the series. In addition to the lack of well-known characters, I consider the entire performance offensive to the loud. The actors seem to feel they have to shout and yell at each other. If you love M. C. Beaton, the divine Hamish Macbeth does not waste time on this garbage.
