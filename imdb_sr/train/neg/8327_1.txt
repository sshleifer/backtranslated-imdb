OK. So, it's a low-budget "movie" (I used quotes because it was shot on a Hi-8 video). The act is universally terrible, make-up is ridiculous (the blood seems to have come from Shervin-Villiams and I saw more convincing bruises made from a halloween ghoul set), and the lighting generally looks like they used someone borrowed Toiotin truck headlights on the actors. Perhaps I could forgive these low-budget features if there is some real content if the movie tried to tell the story. But this collection of videos can not boast of any seizure, no real characters, no swing. It's a self-disturbing mess. Do not worry - there is no spoiler here, because there is absolutely nothing to ruin.
