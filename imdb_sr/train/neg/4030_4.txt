I remember seeing the Lost Missile (in fact, throwing away while my brother and several cousins ​​in whose home I was overnight agreed to see him with me - I was, from time to time, Eric Kartman from the sixties - I'm sorry, guys ) and a bit confused when a heat wave of one million degrees appeared as a planning device - even as a second class I knew that a simple rocket simply could not carry energy for so much heat or destruction over the duration and limited radius of nuclear detonation. My application of this purple love to relatives was a self-punishable crime. The production values ​​of the film were very good. The acting is not bad (except for the Shatnerism actor who played the governor's assistant who mentioned here somebody else). But the idea of ​​a rocket that is easily baked on the surface of the Earth by the heat of its exhaust gases ... no. How did people in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" miss the Lost Missile anyway? It's a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch it if you want something to drink beer until the weekend.
