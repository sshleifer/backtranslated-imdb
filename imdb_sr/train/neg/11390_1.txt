This is not a movie. It's a collection of unconnected, poorly designed and badly compiled scenes that look like raw results of a 10-year-old mini-mini-DV camera. In fact, I have the theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the driving corridor - she with a greasy hair, a morgue, an iPod and a nervous tick - probably herself recorded in the creative phase. If you succeed in the further ten minutes I have, do not bother to fit into what you have seen in the context of the European artistic mentality that is praised above. This is a true and complete waste of time, money and a movie that would make Villiam One-Shot Beaudine rough. The unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuumed signs are representative for now for most of mankind. What's next? Six filmmakers are recording a social relationship at the Val-Mart dinner table?
