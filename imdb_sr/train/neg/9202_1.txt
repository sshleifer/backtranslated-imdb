I'm the owner of this movie. Not by choice. I was bored the other day and the box was intrigued. So I put it in an old video and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying "why God why?" The story line was not as bad as a player I could appreciate the parts. I think that if you are in super geeki-cheese-romantic scenes, you will enjoy this movie. "I've always thought of myself as a volcano you know as Dr.Spock ... incapable of loving." There are very few good things to say about this movie, it's really terrible. But, if you are to a really bad movie, this is for you !!! The real story is however much more interesting.) If I had to summarize this film in one word, it would be: LAME
