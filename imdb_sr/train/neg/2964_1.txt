She laughed a lot - because she is so incredibly bad - I'm sorry, but definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen ... I know it's a small budget, but the actors act like playing with soap, absolutely shit and the last The time when I saw such strange pictures was in trash niteu at some video festival of young people ten years ago. I really appreciate the fact that people gather and record cheap movies, but at least a certain amount of quality needs to be achieved. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were interesting and they looked okay - and the result is really worth listening. The DVD cover has promised a lot, but it's by far the best movie that this movie can offer ...
