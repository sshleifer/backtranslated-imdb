A confusing melodrama taken from the story of Villy Gibson, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincent Minnelli! Richard Vidmark is struggling against gentle, rural, nervous asylum, where his free wife struggles with self-proclaimed Queen Lillian Gish, and Vidmark gets a turn for newer Lauren Bacall, who returns his life after the death of her husband and child. Random and confused, set in a non-selective time and place, and with the love story "David and Lisa" hidden in a swampy swamp. Vidmark and Bacall have some good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to upgrade. In an hour, most of the dialogues are about what to do with the curtains that are in the library (this thread is not used as symbolism, but as a red herring in a non-mystery!). The picture hopes to show the wrath that comes from different people when working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately the worst way Minnelli reveals this goulash is neither informative, nor enlightening nor fun. ** from the ****
