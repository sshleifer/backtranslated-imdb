Based on one of Gabriel Markuez's books and maybe it's great literature, this cinematographic adaptation is really shit because it's more like combating sleep than enjoying some cinematic delicacies. The story is about an old couple whose son died and a living life dominated by poverty, and the main character is a dick who hopes to bring some money for the upcoming fight one day. I'm not in the mood to spill more words about this useless pretentious piece, just to see Salma Hayek here, but sit 90 minutes in front of the screen just for that? No thanks.....
