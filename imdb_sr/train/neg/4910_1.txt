The word "1." the title has more malicious significance for the viewers of this film than for the victims of the crime. At least they do not have to stay and watch this endless film reach its own death. The first relates to: 1. draft scenario; The first one is used in every performance in the final movie; 1. editing in post-production; Same film, etc. The movie does not cast too badly, except that everything about the movie turns out to be worse than the third rate, from a stupid scenario, to a wooden performance. And while you are suffering through this stone film, the 2-hour mark you want to throw out of your misery. With 160 minutes it was obvious that it was supposed to be arranged less than 2 hours. Entry into details about the lame letter and the acting serves little purpose. Even in the equally terrible, Lake Placid, at least the performances of Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda made from an extremely poor scenario were sufficiently shaded to make you smile. In 1st to Die, one ends grief only because of the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the introductory scene of preparing a female leader's suicide. The ordering is so bad that it is never introduced by one of the main characters, which I think were never quite sure that YES She only appears in one scene in the middle of the conversation. It is obvious that the scene on which he is familiar with the viewer is dropped on the floor of the editor. And nobody realized that the character that appeared out of nowhere was an unusual movie venture. In a word, do not waste time with this. My wife and I would love not to. But at least we have created our own diversions by commenting on the various places in the film as if it were the Mystery Science Theater. "In the meantime, in Cleveland ..." !!!!
