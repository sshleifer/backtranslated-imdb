I did not think this film was worth some bad scenario, a bad act, except Janine Turner, without fantasy, stupid plot, stupid husband, and dishonest items for divorce. If you've never seen this movie before, do not worry about it at all. The only thing that was good about it was that Janine Turner did a good job. Terry's husband is a stuck lawyer who has won many cases and even killed murderers. He thinks he's so smart, but he's really just crazy. Her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. Pretty girl. Yes, it's a real peach, no. She is not a day at the beach.
