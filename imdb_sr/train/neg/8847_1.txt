This American soap opera, Knots Landing, has all the fun of being trapped in the elevator. Each episode contained stories such as rape, murder, abductions and drug smuggling, which do not differ much from the complication of other dramatic performances of that period. As for the actors, I saw better actors on a cereal box. From mid to late 90s, repetitions of 'Knots' stunk up U.K-Gold as a mountain of mildewing diapers. I'm sorry to say that I had to endure this because my mother was a big fan of the show and would look religious. Although from that time on, the break is a bit and far (hopefully it will remain so). The only positive thing that can be said about 'Knots' is a striking melody for the signature of a saxophone, later used as the title music for comedy I.T.V. It's a great legacy, eh?
