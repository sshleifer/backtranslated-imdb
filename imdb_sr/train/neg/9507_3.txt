I'm always frustrated by movies that are obviously written by one sex. Especially when they obviously do not do enough research to discover when something not only does not sound true, but the ring is brilliant. his football teammates that Diane is pregnant. In no way, shape or form, a guy would never cheer on another guy who gets a pregnant girl in high school. They could cheer for a guy who sex with a hot cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the first football team did not hear about the urinal. It was obvious that this film did not realize myself so seriously, and it was not terribly bad, but come on!
