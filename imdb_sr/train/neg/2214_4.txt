this film was not absolutely cruel, but it was pretty bad. The acting was pretty good! Jeffrey's combs did a pretty good job like a crazy scientist, which is his specialty if you do not know such things: D. Bill forsithe .. well, I'm not exactly sure why he was in this movie. He is too good for this kind of thing, and his role was not very demanding. I rented these two tracks on the basis of strength, and I was not really disappointed. I mean, this is about half a man / half a shark. These are not Shakespeare's people. Except for the complicated, hollowed-out, and bad dialogue, I would like to mention that the cinema has left many things in store. there were shots when they tried to look "cool", but ultimately hiding the scene or simply breaking up. they also sprinkled many times when they had a decent dialogue and were prematurely separated before the person could even deliver the line. It was pretty bad. but if you're a Jeffrey comb, this is worth checking out. he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character. Also, forsithe is not bad, or it is a female lead. heck if I can remember her name though. in the end, otherwise I would not waste my time.
