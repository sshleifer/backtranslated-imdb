LOL! Not a bad way to start. I thought this was the original, but then I discovered that it was a clone of KING Rim in 1976. I've never seen KING KONG until my 15th year. I saw this movie when I was nine years old. Not to mention the theme song of the film by the Ietian. These are the worst effects of the creature I've ever seen. At the same time, this film remains the holy grail of B-movies. Unforgettable quotes: "Take a tranquilizer and go to bed." "Put Yeti in your tank and have the power of Yeti." I remember seeing this film on Macrabe, hosted by Elvira. There is one scene in which it was like KING KONG in the reverse direction! In KING KONG, she grabbed a girl and climbed the building, but in this movie she climbed the building and grabbed a girl (who was falling)! Also around that year there was another KONG clone MIGHTI PEKING MAN (1977), which came from Hong Kong. There are many traveling matted scenes and motorized parts of the body. This movie will leave you to laugh. As I said, just another clone of KING KONG. Evaluated PG for violence, language, thematic elements and some scary scenes.
