The worst mistake in my life. I picked up this movie in Target for $ 5 because I realized, "Hey, Sandler I can get some cheap laughter". I'm wrong, totally wrong. In the middle of the film, all three of my friends were sleeping and I was still suffering. Worst plot, Worst scenario, Worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted to hit my wall for an hour, and then I would stop, and you know why? Because it was damn good. After I hit my head, I stuck this damn movie in the microwave and watched him burn ... and it felt better than anything I had ever done. The American psychopath, the Army of Darkness and Kill Bill should have just crossed that shit. I hate walking for the real way through this and demolishing the whole day of my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
