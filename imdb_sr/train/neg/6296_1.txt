The film looked interesting; I read the book a few years ago and informed me that this feature was quite firmly followed by a drawing of drawings. I began to observe it and almost from the very beginning did not meet expectations. In fact, I did not get tired of watching the whole thing ... the ultimate hacking - bad performances, bad acting and currently unpleasant characters - that was the point of the movie, I guess. Watching this movie left a bad taste in my mouth and put me down to the end of my weekend. Do not bother with this feature.
