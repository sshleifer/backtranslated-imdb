In 1985, I caught this thing (I can not even call a movie) on a cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones fled outside control. Early I realized this was hopeless. A stupid scenario (a bunch of old guys who hire some young guys to show them how to deal with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. A rich naked woman kept my friend happy for some time - but even he was bored with it after 30 minutes. Remember - this was a CHILDREN'S STUDENTS! This came back before the nudity was so easy to get to the Internet and the like. We kept looking at hoping for something interesting or fun, but that never happened. The funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign where the studio admitted that this film is bullshit! (One poster had a fictional review that said: "This is the best movie I've ever seen this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer was the leader of any talent and actually continued his career in the business. No budget and boring t & a. Skip.
