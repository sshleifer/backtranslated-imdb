She's a little excited about "Dana in real life". First, the entire installation is incredibly invented. Did you really believe that during this very long conversation at the restaurant, Marie would not tell Dan where to go? And since Dan had spoken all this during this conversation, why would she so much appeal to him? In that sense, I never understood why Marie was so attracted to Dan during the entire film. He is very narcissistic and does not make us feel enough to convince us that he is a really good guy (for example, lying Mari in a bookstore, ridiculing his brother about his past friends and trying to make Marie jealous with a 'blind date'). There are other things like this funny scene in a bowl where Dan and Marie are caught up in the making by the whole family. Yes, it really could have happened. Day in real life is slow, fast and manipulative. Even chicks like The Jane Austen Book Club get more ratings than this predictable "tearjerker".
