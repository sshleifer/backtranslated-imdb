I think Micheal Ironsides's acting career must be over, if he has to act in such a shame. He must have been better than wasting time in that garbage. This movie could be far better if you had a good budget, but it's repeating through the movie. There's one scene in the office, which looks like it's in front of the train station, and I bet it is. There is one scene that gave this film 3, and it shows a spacecraft that land and fly over the lake, surrounded by forests. This is done well, but the rest of the movie is forgotten. There is another scene that looks like an engineering factory that I bet and does not look like a spatial station as Lick says it is. This movie is stupid, has a serious little budget, no sense, and God helps Micheal Ironsides.
