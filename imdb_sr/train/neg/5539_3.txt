Vimpi plump shirt Armand Loukue (played by actor veteran Dean Jagger on rare roles) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret of creating zombies. Armand falls in love with Claire Duval (Blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses mealtime juice to marry Armand's fellow Clifford Grayson (hopelessly wooden Robert Noland). Worried about Claire's use and rejection, Armand uses his knowledge of the voodoo to revenge. Sounds exciting? Well, it certainly is not. To begin with, the static (un) direction of Victor Halperin makes it possible to wrinkle and an inconvenient story of conversations moves along and slowly slowly. Even worse, Halperin fails to bring any tension, atmosphere, and momentum into terribly difficult ways. Most of the blacks, which act from fairly pale voting, do not help things; only George Cleveland as cordial General Duval and E. Alin Varren, as a drunken dr. Trevisant manages to bring things back to life with his welcome and refreshing hamburger hall. A note about the movie about rough films, painfully apparent scenographic sets and rough cinema are pretty bad and unpleasant. In fact, this weak excuse for the terrible phenomenon is so frustrating that even the ever-sharply looking eyes of the great White Lugos can not alleviate the boring boredom. Dismalli dull dud.
