Haunted Boat is sold as 'Fog' and 'Open Water'. In many ways this is true. There are fears and strange people who are interested in you. However, the ability of acting is at best bad. It shows clear signs that this is just a bunch of friends who make a horror movie. Which in all this they do the best I can. When you accept a small budget, it is very difficult for special effects, while ghosts look like men with rubber masks. Many aspects of the film are creepy and weird. But she suffers from too many turns and turns in a short period of time, which only makes you bored and confused. In terms of maintaining alertness, this works very well. Ignoring irrelevant twist every 5 seconds at the end, you actually want to know what's going on. And they are ready to wait 1h 35 minutes for the peak. This is not a Ghost Ship, but it will definitely do for the evening before T.V.
