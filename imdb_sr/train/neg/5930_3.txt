Hey, If you're going to make a documentary about Leonardo Cohen, try to make it about Leonardo Cohen! This is filled with just enough Leonard to anger the viewer who will remain questioned why they listen to all those other singers (some of them are questionable) who talk about themselves. Puleeze ... sounds like they are re-living their diaries in secondary schools - who cares about you, what about Leonardo? Guess which people, if you do something decent, maybe somebody will make a documentary about you. I especially insult the parade of U2 members as if it would add credibility to this film - NO. Leonardo does not need Bono or Edge who talk about his spirituality. It would be nice for filmmakers to present some of his spirituality to the film. God, what a concept! I will give props to Rufus Vainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their covers of Cohen's melodies - other performances were boring, and some were unbearable. you!
