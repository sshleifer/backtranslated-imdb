I could not watch for more than 14 minutes. It's an EXCELLENT combination of really bad acting and really bad directing. The recordings are disgusting, they were constantly breaking 180 degrees. My head hurts, trying to look at it "you know what". Dirt on the window of the "mysterious machine" makes you see the light from the windows on the windows ... boring. What else ... is so badly framed all the time that you just want to scream at that lady. I have only directed short films, but I am pretty sure that I would be much better than the one who directs the feature film .... the story is amazing, only a long French stage of kissing at first tells you it will be pretty awful. Too many, try to avoid really bad films at all costs, it will save you $ 5 or so for rent, and this 1h30 of your life will never come back ...
