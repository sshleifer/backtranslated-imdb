It was disgusting and painful. What a waste! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed twice in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not even rent it. Zeta Jones was too big to be persuasive. Just OK. I was sorry about him (actor) in case people remember this mess. Roberts was the same as ever. Charming and sweet, but for no purpose. The "Romance" with John was absolutely incredible.
