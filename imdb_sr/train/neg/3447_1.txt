It's just one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. This is not a scary or any other thing proposed in the plot plot. This film is agony slow and I was bored for almost 98 minutes. Although acting is at best central, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and boring without the right direction. Occasionally, a moody mood is placed only to be broken by a useless line or event. It's not surprising that the entire acting team was sick and vomited between the shots, but they still had to try to digest the horrible scenario. As a great admirer of good horror films, it always irritates me that something is so bad. Save yourself 98 minutes and you will never return.
