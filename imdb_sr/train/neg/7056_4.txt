This film is an excellent example of how even some very funny jokes can be terribly wrong. I really did expect at least something from this movie after I saw the add-on that was ridiculous, but the movie was not half good. The odd part is that jokes are actually funny, and a fake smoking ban, Jo Bole ... etc. are really good jokes, but I do not know who to blame for this movie. The main candidates can be: - 1) Hammers (actors)) and hammeresses (even actresses) 2) Director 3) The guy who played the actors and / or directors In any case, if you really get bored and I really think to see this movie, or else get a copy of every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh at your rhythm because they will be far more fun than film. ps The only rescue grace of this movie is mahesh lesser and funny chappu bhai
