Yes, this is one of those films, so terrible, so insensitive, so riddled, that you will not be able to stop laughing. I watched comedies, good comedies and laughed less than my wife and laughed at this movie. Other comments give the idea well enough. The characters are so embarrassing that you roar the rats, the effects are so badly made to wonder whose elementary school the art class was in charge of, the acting - about acting - the story of tired dialogue and unpleasant breaks. But rats, yes, big rats. Why could not we see the rat until the end surprised me. Often, the "big" is not shown to the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew so much money. I suppose, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden to the end, because the directors were ashamed that it was best that they had a guy running around dressed like a woodpecker with third world dental practice. The brightest part of the entire movie is the elevator scene. After realizing that rats can not stand the noise (a migraine of bad behavior?), The Main man raises a fire alarm to send rats into madness. If you ever wanted to see a couple of rats that are waltzers while the blood from their heads squeezes like a geyser, this movie is for you. Really, you need to rent it and get it yourself. But no more than 99 Â¢, OK?
