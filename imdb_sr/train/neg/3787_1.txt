I must be that guy in America who did not like this movie. I suppose this was not my style or something, I just do not see what's so fascinating, it was barely fun, let alone one of the greatest achievements in the history of the film. It's about a guy who came from nothing, and continues to become the master of the drug. A fairly simple way to describe the entire movie, which is exactly my feeling for the whole movie. In spite of what many people think, just because a film about mafia / drug trafficking / criminal groups does not automatically make it a great movie, do not forget the good storytelling.
