I stole this movie when I was a college freshman. I tried to watch it three times, the other two because my friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny, it must be funny." Wrong! I can not force myself to watch this bunch of shit after a boxer sword / insurrection sword, where the burning of a guy with a good zinger causes physical pain against his opponent. You would think it's a horrible comedy that hurts you funny, but after watching this, you will know its truth. This film is not worth the price I paid. I watched many Steven movies, so I even watched Crossroads twice ... but I still could not watch this.
