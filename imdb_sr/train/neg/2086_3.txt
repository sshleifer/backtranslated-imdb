Ivan Reitman is something like a rescuer. The worst murders (Ghostbusters, Evolution) are revived in his skillful hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) show signs of life and humor that make it worth watching. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not take a pretty original story (a man postponed superheroes, the superhero gets a revenge from super power) and shapes it into something nice. "Girl" is an exercise in senselessness. The unique pony is long in the teeth after the first 20 minutes. The film can not decide whether it will be a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. The result is film flip-flops between both, with no aspect being very good. Uma Thurman is at the top, as usual, and Luke Wilson is also withdrawing his role, although his lenar lustori are quickly tired. What is even more disturbing is that in certain scenes (such as when the Harm strikes the Uma striking the head above the wall), you feel a witty, noisy Reitman's work that almost screams to get out. But, a few seconds later, magic is lost, as fast as the superheroine whose films disappoint almost in every way.
