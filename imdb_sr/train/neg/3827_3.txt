Stereotyped, derivative, non-genuine and boring western. Two popular stars (Charlton Haston and James Coburn) both give performances that are far from their best, and justified; both have superficial roles and character traits that are mostly expressed by dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "loved the world better than before," and Coburn is a rebel who "owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt." In addition, Heston is so old that he has problems riding a horse, and Coburn is a mean and hard but not so cold-blooded killer as some of the minors. Obviously, the filmmakers could not come up with even one original idea of ​​how this movie might be noticed. (* 1/2)
