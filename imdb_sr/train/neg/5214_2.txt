METAMORPHOSIS I'm doing my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie in the set. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS looks like a remake of "The Atom Age Vampire", in which he was also a scientist striving for similar results. In modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my type of horror movie. The university researcher works on breaking the human genome to create a serum that would prevent aging. Under the pressure of the administration to publish its documents; And, produce some results (or risk losing funds), a scientist decides to use it as a guinea pig! At first thinking that he did not have any side effects, eventually reveals that the serum really changed him in the most unexpected way! The act is stiff; and performances left me with much less interest in the film. The result is bad. And the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only wrong; it's absurd; that's funny ?? In best case. As others have noticed, the end turns into a 30-minute gag, which is seemingly endless. Without giving too much, I would call this, "Dr. Jeckill and Mr. Hide Meet the Creator from the Black Lagoon encounter Home Alone."
