This is a bad movie. Not one of the strange bad guys. This is bad bad. It was really painful to watch. The direction was terrible, with many jumping around, and the green and yellow shades used in the movie make the characters look sick. Keira Knightley was not at all convincing as a solid fish, and I can not believe that Lucie Liu and Mickey Rourke have applied for this crime cellulose waste. The scenario was terrible and the acting was like nails across the board. If you did not see him, do not. You do not miss anything and you'll only lose two hours of your life watching this mess. I saw bad films and even enjoyed them because of their mistakes. This is just a waste of time.
