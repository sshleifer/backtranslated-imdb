With such a title, it is beyond and beyond my understanding that this film just did not like me. However, there are several decent moments and a bit worse, but the way the film was filmed and the whole story has impressed me as idiotic and lazy attempt at an abundant "shock" tactic ... The inconsistent plot starts with the guy who raped and killed a woman stranded along the road . He and his brother in captivity are imprisoned until the brother comes out and agrees to meet his girlfriend in the forest. In the end, he is forced to enter the house where the screw is, and he later shows her a collection of abducted men in the basement. The heavily drugged prisoners consist of her old boy who raped her, "grabbing" her neighbor and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he will kill them all. She finished and killed HIM, and then she focused on men (or pigs) that tortures and kills, ... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with feeding and destroying genitals - everything is far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a graphic broom with a masturbation accompanied by painful rape ... Surely, "I spit on your body, IP! On your grave" is conceived as an unofficial sequel "Spit on your grave" - ​​based on, mostly, the title and references gives the main character - suggesting that her mother was Camille Keaton. Personally, I consider it a wild, blasphemous claim! This film is a boring, amateurish mess that tends to be shocked, but it managed to cope ...
