Resnais, wow! The genius that brought us to Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a French musical from the 1930s in vivid colors. Opening the voice with old, decorated inter-titles was a nice touch. Then the opening of the camera (like the old handles) on the black and white board opens. The camera is reflected (or rather, above), it suddenly shows us the surprisingly great colors of an elegant tea table. It's all in the first 60 seconds. Then the music starts. Pretty banal and unforgettable diddy with an incredible chorus of 3 girls who play some nonsense that has nothing to do with the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can not blame them for the subtitles). These characters sneak through the door and are replaced by more people falling into an even bigger song. Then they leave, and eventually Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first significant dialogue of 15 minutes in the film. I'm not sure what Resnais intended to start with such a wasteful waste of time and musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to get you to throw the blobs on the screen and exit. I held it. It was not much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no knowledge of any character. We do not see their faces even half the time (because Resnais seems too intentional to show a daring scene to take care of the real people in front of the camera). People wander on the stage like moths around the lamp, and the audience is not able to focus on a particular person or action. It's like you're going to take every Brady Bunch episode into a 2-hour movie. With bad songs. The only thing that kept me while I was watching (1 hour) was to watch camera techniques, lighting and landscape that everyone, I admit, are excellent. But is that enough to keep your attention 2 hours? Not me. Maybe I'll try to watch the end tomorrow. Av, I'm kidding. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you too. Skip.
