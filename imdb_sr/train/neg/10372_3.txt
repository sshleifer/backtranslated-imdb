I enjoyed the first reviewer's comment much more than I did when I saw him at another theater in the early 80's. Then I was impressed by the care of making bones on the model of Tenniel's drawings. But for me, the actors were largely scattered, their faces dull with masks, while the direction I consider unusually static, and the photo is murky. Evaluation at that time was nothing, which means "it's not worth it to pass once." Still, I would also jump on the opportunity to look the other way.
