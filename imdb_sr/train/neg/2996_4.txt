Born again is a substandard episode from the first season. She deals with the theme of reincarnation and just does not fly. I've never been great at reincarnation and it could be part of my apathy for this episode. This applies to the Tooms case, which is a nice sequel from the previous episode. But positive results are ending. Which is unfortunate because it happens at the beginning of the episode. I think it's absurd for a dead man to choose to reincarnate into the body of a completely unrelated girl. And waiting until the girl turns eight and starts to get better. There is even a serious lack of witty dialogue between Mulder and Scully to keep the episode on the surface. If you are in a reincarnation, maybe this episode is in your alley. If you are not, then at least you can find out what bradycardia is.
