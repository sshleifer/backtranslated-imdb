Jenni Neumann (from MISTRESS OF THE APES, an American slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who plays a leading role in Australian stage production. She is a virgin because as a girl she saw mom in sex and then accidentally caused her car accident that killed her. In the meantime, a killer in a black glove strolls around the theater breaking people's remains of glass. *** BIG SPOJLER *** The killer is obviously Helen (she speaks in the voice of her dead mother, she washes the blood from her hands after the murder and sees her killing the juvenile with a broken bottle like a girl!), but this has a devoid of POV camera and hides the identity of the killer to the very end, as if it should be a great surprise. The whole act seems obsessed with a story, possession or attempt of sex, and, in one case, even blackmails their way into getting laid. There are plenty of nudity and blood, but there is no point in continuity, the picture is blurry and editing (Colin Eggleston, who also wrote and produced) is terrible. The theater setting for a slasher film before the Soavy movie of the same name and Argentine OPERA (both are better than this) in five years, and Neumann is pretty hot.
