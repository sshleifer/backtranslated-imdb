This film is a travesty, and it is not appropriate to keep the company with a superior original. The action is an absolute mess, and the movie is too long. Each time they fight, they desperately insert a sentimental reminder from the first film. "Grgur's Girl" is one of the top ten British films of all time, this is horrible.
