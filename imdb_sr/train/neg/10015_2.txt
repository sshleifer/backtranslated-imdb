Ghost of Dragstrip Holl is a typical teenager from the 1950s in a restless film. It's not a horror movie or a science fiction movie. The plot refers to a group of teenagers who are preparing to be expelled from the hot rod club because they can not satisfy the rent. Once thrown out, they decide to try with the old Haunted House. The only saving grace for the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the She She Creature) turns out that the movie is a lonely actor Blaisdell.
