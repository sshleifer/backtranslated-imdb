I thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful. She was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but there is one song in the end that is just a guy who shouts "Iaovvvv!" while someone accidentally touches a wooden object. In view of this, there are some beautiful songs, but it's not worth watching the movie. Go to itunes (they have an album), browse it and select good ones. Half the movie is a guy who makes tea. Well, that's a little exaggeration. But you'll see what I'm saying if you see it. It says: DO NOT SEE!
