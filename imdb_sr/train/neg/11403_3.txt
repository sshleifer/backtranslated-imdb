I love horror films, low budget, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s ... but how can anyone think this is a very good horror movie? Let's compare it with titles in similar home movies. persecution, change, shine. or for similar technology based on the horror film that was FAAAR better, (though still far from the big one) Demon Seed. OK, I'll be fair ... let's compare it to horror movies! Do not go to bed. It's terribly better and better. Salem's party, night stalker, night gallery, even not going to the basement or farm crows were far better. * SPOILERS * First of all, for such a good scene as the bloody scene of the shower, you have a scene like the opening scene .. oh boi! The garden hose is reviving to let some of the naughty teenagers down! TERRIBLE. also, just what we understand about the house ... obviously should use its video cameras to see what's going on, and it's a very emotional house. not a ghost, or a demon, or an entity, it is a house that is "obsessed", but why? Does it lead us to believe that inanimate things have learned to love tears / margarita, our protagonist? Now that I'm on the topic of tears, another scene that totally upset me, this poor old crazy lady comes to you, she says she was your nurse, pours her heart, falls into the boiling pool, fights in agony for 45 seconds, and What is Margaret doing? Does he risk her hands burning to save this poor old woman who came there to warn her about life? No, she's standing there looking up! acting in most cases was better than the average for a horror movie, but that's where the positives end. at least for an even more interesting and entertaining horror movie about an inanimate object that kills people watching the death bed: a bed that eats. I have the feeling that people who rated this so high or did not watch it because they were originally broadcast, or they remembered to scare them like children. this film is less deserving.
