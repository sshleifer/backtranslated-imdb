Koen Vouters is a Flemish singer and leader. In the early nineties he tried with movies. But this incredible piece of garbage ended his acting career once and for all. The acting actress of the Dutch actress Nade van Nie also ended, who continued to be a football supporter TV host and programmer. I actually saw this in (almost empty) theater because I used to be a fan of Koen Vouters band, Clouseau. I'm so sorry I spend money on it. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story and it's done badly in every possible way. Some people think it's so bad it's ridiculous. I'm not one of them. I just found an incredible waste of time and money.
