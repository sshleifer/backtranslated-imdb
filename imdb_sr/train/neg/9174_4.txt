I usually love zombie movies, but this was just bad. Good parts: A girl swimming in toples with the lower part of the tange, Sonia Salomaa in Toples, and She Grauer in the chest while running. Bad part: too many videos, too much Matrix slow motion (pulls action), insufficient blood and intestines, bad acting and no story. The only other person in the theater was smart and went straight after swimming in Toples. Total loss of $ 6 and time. I give him 2 out of 10.
