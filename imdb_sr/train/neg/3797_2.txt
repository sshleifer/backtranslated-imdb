The years have passed since Alek Rain (starring Olivier Gruner in the first movie) encountered a terrible plot that involved the replacement of people with machines, but since then there has been a war between cyborgs and humans, and we have lost, now some kind of superhero which is the daughter of Olivier Gruner (she also inherits only half of her minimal acting ability), which I think is a minimal link with the first one, but when the superhero is created, she is hiding in 1980, while a hunter from the future is hunting in the valley this confusing scientific- fantastic clunker. Nemesis has become a cult hit, to see why people like it, even though I was not a fan of this movie. Nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas, develop a nice look and secure a ton of action, he almost succeeded. Nemesis 2 does not even have that ambition, it's a cheap tear off of The Terminator with a muscular woman that is so weak in the acting ability to make Olivier Gruner look like the main actor, and the action sequences lack the explosive range that was the main selling place of the original. I will admit that I was not a fan of the original, but I deserved better tracking. The original actor also appeared a good actor such as Tim Thomerson, Cari Hiroiuki Tagava, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and Jackie Earle Halei, and this time it's just a dumb film with a pretentious atmosphere. In fact, after I saw it, I inspired to add half the star to the original. <br /> * From 4- (bad)
