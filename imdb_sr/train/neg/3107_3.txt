Voody Allen made "September", proving that even a genius can fuck. This is "September" by Mela Brooke. Monumentally stupid, boring and immature, I have to admit that I have not looked at him completely. Flick ranks among dishonest people (eg "The Monei Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") who either sleep or compel me to come to the "revind" button. And I say this, unfortunately, as a dedicated fan of Mel Brooks. Should be direct direct comedy and leave a social commentary alone. How the same guy who made the "Young Frankenstein" and "Space balls" could throw a dog like this, is beyond me. Should be avoided at all costs.
