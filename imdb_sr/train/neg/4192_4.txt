In this short time, an urban man and his wife have their strange lives placed under pressure when a man goes to wear an old suit of his mother's red trousers. I constantly watched how I hoped I could see why it was made, or why other reviewers considered it to be ridiculous. It was a total waste of time for me. Not all tastes are the same, but it was obviously not mine.
