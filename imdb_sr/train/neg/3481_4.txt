Can contain spoilers. I say this, but anyone who is smart enough to read this, is likely to discover every plot from the beginning. This is not a movie that I liked. I did not hate him in some way of movies that insult your intelligence, but it all seemed too predictable on his move to the necessary happy ending. There were funny parts to make sure, but there were few genuine ones. At least it did not go to the gutter. Christina Applegate looks fresh, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are actually the only redemption function. All other cardboard cutouts, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who did it as a favor to someone. All in all, it's harmless, but not inspirational, 90 minutes.
