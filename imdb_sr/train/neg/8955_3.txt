As far as the film is concerned, it's OK a movie of science fiction. It has lots of interesting things and some quality scenes. Still, it's not that good, and some of the things are pretty far-fetched ... As for calling this second cube, the movie is complete and complete. This is the very definition of music, a great and inventive original movie ... A whole feeling can be translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people / android as part of the "team" behind the cube itself. I gradually grew a little ... <br /> <br /> I gave this 3 *** for the backstabbing of the original. This should have been sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no room or time to mention them all ... Watch for those who have not seen Cube & Hipercube but are not recommended for fans of the series ...
