Yes, the first "Hovling" was a classic. A fairly good waswolf film I recognized slowly started, but got a momentum on the road to have a pretty good ending, and then the leader turned into a sweet-willed beard just to be shot on the camera. Yes, it was for an entertaining horror movie to be sure ... forget about everything because this film has nothing to do with the film. Oh, of course, somehow they say that an anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something wants to find out what and why things go down like them, but they leave a little comfortable vacation from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere where they have to fight evil magicians or something like that. I often wonder what Christopher Lee was doing in this movie, but I read triviality here where he says he has never been in a wolf-gun movie before, but he still reads the script before taking over the role. Perhaps you could have entered hell "American Werewolf in London" that could have been possible. After all, it was set up in London. Hell, the invertebrators do not look much in this movie, except for a fairly bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact, for me the most striking death in this film was when a girl started to loudly speak and that the ear of this man began to bleed.
