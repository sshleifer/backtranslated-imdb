I watched this movie last night and I was a bit disappointed. Many "weather facts" are excluded. At the beginning of the film, grandfather made a comment to this granddaughter and his friends about how they felt when he hit 9-11. This film was supposed to be held in 1994. Also, one of the grandson's friends was wearing Eagles Donald McNabb. It has not been compiled yet. The story was good, but the facts and actuality of the time frame were so far from the base that the film looked like a cheese. My boyfriend is a passionate reader of books and souvenirs from the Second World War. I rented this film in the hope that it would be good. The acting was so-so. The dog was cute. But the way this film was made, it made me glad that I paid only 4 dollars to rent it, unlike 50 how much I should watch it in the theater. I hope that whoever reads it, understands that I do not think of dissatisfaction with those who fought in the war, but the facts and timing needed a little more to follow.
