If you love movies that roam with a small exposition of spicy sex, this movie is for you. On the plus side, the main actor / actress (a novice transsexual) has an interesting presence on the screen, but it is not enough to add much more than a mildly interesting movie - if so. Basically this film is about 3 social exiles (transsexual prostitute, male customers and Russian, gay immigrant) who somehow developed a relationship. Why it's not clear. We are expected to accept these unfavorable essential basic honest people who have the ability to love while they put their bodies on the street. Right!! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her ninety-something sugar dad! The author of the film shows the sophisticated, uncomfortable side of life, while we want to believe that all these seriously injured people are really quite normal in the way they have their three who help them through life. Quite fantasy, but unfortunately here it is shown as the actual appearance of life on wildlife. All in all, there is no complication, there is no truth, and there is no real reason to spend a lot of time here. Unless, of course, you do not like to enjoy the kink !!!
