I did not feel like I was raped like it was the case with MAGIC CHRIST, but BELLE'S MAGIC WORLD is still an anthems of beauty and sound. Like Christmas, BMV hates its audience, though not to such a large extent. It's ugly, non-Chinese, idiotic, and writing is terribly bad. None of the stories work. These are not the characters we liked from the BATB, they are a crowd of people. I wanted to cut it, but after a few minutes I gave up, because no one in a healthy mind would seriously grasp this bench. There are three stories here. "The Perfect Word" is a sharp, difficult study of forgiveness. "Fifi's craziness" works only if you can accept that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that she is the James Bond locker and that Lumiere is an idiot for women. Broken Ving (or "Broken Vind", as I like to call it) is probably the worst of the crowd. The beast hates birds? Since when? Do not watch this shit - every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTI AND THE BEAST is still a movie classic, a transcendent celebration of love, art, intelligence and the human soul.
