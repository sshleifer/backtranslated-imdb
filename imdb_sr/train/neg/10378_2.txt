While the premise behind the house where Evil Dvells can be intriguing, execution is extremely pathetic. I'm not even sure where to begin, because I have so many problems with this movie. I guess I'll just quote a few of them: 1. Acting ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure, and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, you know that you are in trouble? It's not that much meaning to me, but it's barely an A-List name. Susan George may have been in several films I enjoy, but I never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this movie, her acting is unpleasant. As for the other two, the smaller the better. 2. The Ghosts ?? Ghosts or ghosts or whatever you want to call them reminded me of a lot of ghosts in a villa. And they are terrifying. And why did they have to be so obvious? Subtlety is not a characteristic of a house where evil dwellings are. 3. Complication ?? How predictable is a movie? The outcome of this movie is painfully obvious when you meet three main characters. If you could not see where this movie is moving after 15 minutes, you need to see more movies. 4. The Convenient Priest ?? What are the chances that the house that you are possessing is going to be accidentally across the group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your home and comes, knocks on the door and asks if you need help in removing evil spirits. Apsurd is a word that comes to your mind. 5. Everything else ?? It's very difficult for me to think of any positive things I would write about. I guess I'll give him a point for the introductory scene and a point for the architecture of the house. Is this a sure sign of a winner? Knowing architecture as the climax of any film does not speak much about a real movie. I will cease. You should get an idea from what I already mentioned. And I did not even mention a boring girl or a crab invasion or many other problems. Be warned, this thing is terrible.
