Honoring Paul Muni, who spent every day spending hours and hours in a make-up room to look at a piece of Zola. Muni was one of the greatest stars of the thirties and I wonder how many people today - except for classic film lovers - know anything about it. He was a giant in business for at least a decade. He could have won an Oscar for this show, which would give him two consecutive times, as he won it for playing Louis Pasteur a year earlier. My opinion is that, although he was prone to excessive exaggeration, I still think he was one of the great actors of the "Golden Age". Whatever part he played; You were pinned to the screen that watched him. Unlike Pasteur's role, I thought this story was a little overwhelmed by what we saw over the past 60 years: we have overestimated the Liberal hero. Not even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress scandal over the police or the army, which meant it was told that they were "corrupt" by those organizations. Film makers simply like it when the authority is challenged and defeated. In this sense, this film is far ahead of its day since we saw this great time since the sixties. However, it must be noted that the facts support this story. In no way does it diminish Zolin's achievements as a social reformer, releasing certain grievances. Good for him! I wish they spent more time pointing to that, than concentrating on one trial.
