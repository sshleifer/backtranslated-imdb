I looked through our DVD tower last night to watch something. We were between NetFlik mailing and it was a quiet Saturday night. I pulled one of which I had never heard before and realized that it was borrowed from a friend. From the jacket, it sounded like "The Big Chill," but with the acting star, she thought it might be worth watching. I made a guy !!! Not only was it like "The Great Cold," but it was a character. The character of Bill Pacton was a copy of Villyama Hurth ("where you were all this time") - a warning to hunters - and, behold, he remains concerned about the old place (cabin / camp). Kimberly Villiams = Meg Tilly; jerk female wives Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I found myself wondering why I even looked at these people. There was not enough character development to find any interest in them. How did "Unca Lou" even find these characters after 20 years? Besides, it was not even funny, except when Perkins fell, "wrong" came out of bed the first morning, it was a sign and I missed it. After finishing it, I asked my wife: "Were there any films in this movie? ... are you sleeping there?" She replied, "No, I'm still thinking ... No, no one can remember."
