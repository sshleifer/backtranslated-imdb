Should each good story be "enhanced" with an additional funny Broadway music? Obviously, those who can not come to their own complications think that classical literature is just for robbery. I admit that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, because it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that left you in the head, and that was a great example of exactly that ... So, of course, take this serious story and add torment music and imagine it with every character of prancing boys orphans to grinding bobbies and suddenly it is lifted? Argh. Bring me a washbasin. Four stars in my rating come from casting, which I could compare with that of my righteous ladies. Each of these films had an actor to whom the toy version could be proud, but then they must go and sing (see appeal above). Unlike my righteous lady, those who are singing here could do it and graciously spared Oliver Reed's singing voice (forgive me if I'm wrong, it's been a while). already stated. Why does anyone, apart from a truly shameless, embarrassing putting funny songs into a perfectly good story? It's rarely done in a good way. Generally, it destroys the story. And with this. The jury is still questioning whether this story is worth saving, but with all that gading, it's impossible to say.
