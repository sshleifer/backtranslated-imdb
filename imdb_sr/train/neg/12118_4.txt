In 1972, after his wife left her own way, Elvis Presley began to see Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, benevolent, long hair, lovely, queen of beauty, is painted to fill the void in Elvis's life. When Elvis' divorce became final, Linda was already in the place of the legendary live and friend until 1976. This is a striking look at their love affair and socializing. Linda strives for the needs and desires of her lover. Even when she overcomes the swallowing of medicines by her hand and is introduced into her love affair with the valium. Sometimes the film is sharp and dark; very unattractive look at the 'king' and his queen. Don Johnson is absolutely horrible as Elvis. It is not attractive by its action on the handle. Stephanie Zimbalist has no class of Linde, but she does a good job. Supported actors include: John Cravford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. Watching this twice is more than enough for me, but do not let this review prevent you from checking it. For most Elvis fans I have talked with, this is not a favorite presentation.
