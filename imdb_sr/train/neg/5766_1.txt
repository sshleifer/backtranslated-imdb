It was considered to be the leading open source community, something that would stand and scream the world's media to notice that we are not stuck in a marketing trap with our ability to produce fine work with open source tools. After the basic version was downloaded (hard hard fan here on the dial-up modem) eventually arrived here I hit my first catch. Media Plaier, Mplaier Classic & vinamp did not manage to open it to my Kp's bot, and then Totem, China & Coffeine did not manage to open it on my dice server. Mplaier managed to run it impeccably. It will be difficult to expand the word about if normal users can not even open ... Film. Beautiful sound surface, superb lighting, master work with camera and flawless texture. Everything looked real. And then the two main characters moved ... and spoke ... And the movie died for me. All but the synchronization of lips and real animation of the two main characters (except for Progo in the dance scene) seemed fluid and completely alive. The two main characters were so badly animated that they sometimes wondered if there are currently some cut-scene games that involve less realism than this. Any frame in the movie is fantastic .. as a frame, and the thing is great if no actor is moving. I'm glad I did not recommend it to anyone. I would ruin my reputation. Oh, and the final fantasy had more traceable and cunningly complicated complications. This film would get 10 stars so there was no tragedy on the screen.
