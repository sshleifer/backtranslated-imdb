A hopelessly incapable and boring film in which characters stand in rooms or a rocket boat and talk endlessly. You might think that things would be cheerful when you explored Mars, but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red / orange filter, which makes it all very blurry. The Mars landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings and monsters are completely unconvincing. There are eyebrows of 'Bridesmaids' when a hero carefully turns the octopus like a tap of a plant that runs around it before it gets crushed, and the difference is that Ed Vood is a hundred times more entertaining. It's better to wear earplugs when watching, otherwise your musical music, which repeats itself infinitely, will lead you into madness. If you can not sleep one night, just insert this into the VCR and your insomnia will be cured for a short time.
