It's hard to believe that people actually love this duck! I think children can enjoy it, but for me it's a movie that parents can not stand to sit. Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and probably the worst child actor of all time. I will give the director part of the responsibility for the child, but she was really sick to watch. Now I'm embarrassed because people know it was her. When I sang "Stars of the Stars" I had to turn off the sound - then I came here and discovered that they did it because it won the Star Search. I always felt that Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade the name of his wonderful, sadly missed brother, and that shit shows why. Zero stars.
