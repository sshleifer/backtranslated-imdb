Vic (Richard Dreifuss) is a mafia boss who leaves the mental institution back to his gangster world. How can the director play with Richard Dreifuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very beautiful), Gabriel Birne, Gregory Hines, Killa MacLachlan, Burt Reinolds, Billy Idol and such a waste of time? This film is a comedy that is not funny, it has a constellation in acting. My voice is four. Title (Brazil): 'Prazer em Matar-te!' ('Enjoying the killing!') <Br />
