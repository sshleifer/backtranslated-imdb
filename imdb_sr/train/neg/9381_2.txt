Mona Tramp lives on the edges of a French society, in life without meaning, purpose, or direction. I watched it for all the star reviews, but I'm afraid I missed something. Mike Monique has little or no personality as he moves through life, rude to people, becomes high and does not contribute to anyone's life. It's not interesting or exciting. She's just useless. I saw and knew enough people like: there is no secret meaning for what they do. They're just lazy bumps. I would not want Mona to be close to me, as he strives to steal everything that is not tied up and leave his friends down. She is sure she is enigmatic - because she has nothing. Many drug addicts, vines and booms I've seen are mysterious; I would not even like to watch a movie about them. There may be something that I completely missed. Otherwise, I assume that all comments are from people who assume that the French director has done something of great art.
