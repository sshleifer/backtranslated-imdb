I'm a little tired of people who misuse the name of God to obscure their own view of the world. So I do not reject the idea of ​​the Armageddon, or the coming of anti-Christ, I reject the idea that only certain people who live truly good lives (It seems that they are mostly white Christian children) will go to heaven, the rest of us must suffer through the ages of Hell on Earth, just because we were not good enough. God can be a judge, but I do not think He will measure every level of goodness. Give the Creator a little credit.
