I'm expecting the same excitement as I SPIT ON IOUR GRAVE, but I was dropped by just a trash can you even call this movie (its kind of mini porn). It made me angry when a guy was forced to eat his job. There is not a story that is quickly recorded from every murder. If you like to see women naked or even men, then there's room in the movie and there's even a place for masturbation in a movie that makes it a porn movie, not a movie. I've seen some stupid movies in my day, but this is number one. I want to look at it again. The actors even looked bored during the film, so they probably needed money to make this movie.
