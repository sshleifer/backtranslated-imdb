THHE2 is funny that you will laugh a lot and kick and you will probably say "oh sh * t!" and "pull your face out of the damn hole that you stupid ** you" or things in that direction, but I do not know if it's really worth watching - I was very angry with the terrible military characters that do not seem to know the first thing about the fight . Yes, there were more violence, bloody and more bodies than the first, but I'm still discussing whether it cancels my feelings during the whole movie about how ridiculous it is (and not a good smile as it is dead alive or holiday). My time would be better spent watching Aina remake for the fifth time. So go for a laugh, or go for a little bit up, but do not go in the hope that you will get out of it satisfied.
