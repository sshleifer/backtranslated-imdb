I saw this movie in the cinema many years ago, and one thing made me so surprised that I did not see any virtues in the movies: Dennis Kuaid was a policeman who never smiles or smiles, and his smile and smile are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was thrown like a bad guy, but - again - most imagination of viewers could not go far enough to believe in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not convinced as a former medical student. There was no tension, because the killer was known very early. Finale, again, was neither dramatic nor tense: no one around me was worried about what would happen again. All we could wait is the end of the movie. All in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.
