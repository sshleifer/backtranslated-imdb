:: POTENTIAL SPOILERS :: Man, this film was horrible. A catholic / superstitious / uncertain thriller that has already expanded from previous films. Spiritual priest. Sex and clergy. Politics and religion. Church hypocrisy. A conspiracy involving the church. The dawn of the new evil age. All kinds of magic voodoo battles between good and evil. Pretty stupid and lame with a bad story. The story revolves around two notions: Absolution, more commonly known as the sacrament of the anointing of the sick - the last rights that a person can ask to purify his sins while on the verge of death; And the statement, the act of cutting off a person from the Church. Basically, an outsider can not get Absolution. So it comes to the Eating of Sorrow, and I will leave it on it. Include all the things I've already mentioned and have a "Red". Sexual scene with the priest was found intertwined with the pictures of the Virgin Mary, and insults to Catholics. Heath Ledger, who says (I paraphrase), "I am the Redeemer and the curse of sin, I live without love blah blah blah" / hint is walking in a dark alley with a long coat of alla "Matrix". > <br /> I gave this film not only because it was shy and irrational, but also because it succeeded in offending the entire faith in the process. If you want to see something better, I suggest the "Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
