This film certainly proves that good Americans can do horribly good propaganda. There are no questions, no comments about abuse of power or police terror, when James Stewart, solid and convincing as ever, solves all stories from Dillinger to the 5th column more or less individually. June Allison as a regular love interest retains family values ​​and E.J. Hoover is an executive producer. Both children or innocent passers-in are never hurt when professionals do it. Not to talk about civil rights, which have never been interrupted or homes, which never get intertwined. And if the FBI service would not be enough, Stewart gives the life of his son to the ground in World War II. Perfectly done, if you do not know better.
