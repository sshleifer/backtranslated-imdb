I have a terrible videotape "Bum!", And I want to see it in its wide size. That's why I voted "1" and I hope you will. Together we can pull this film into cinematic slime pits, and we hope that somebody will see the opportunity for BIG MONEY in the publication "Boom!" in his director Cut Ektended Version. The movie is one of my favorite favorites - just look at the people involved, the directors, the actors, the cameramen, and you say to yourself: "Yes, I assume you can fool some people a lot of time." Producers with regard to DVD edition "Boom!" It should be noted that wherever it is shown, there were any bubbles sold in theaters. But he has not yet reached Frostbite Falls.
