What a joke. I'm watching it on Channel 1 and I think that watching a dry color is much more fun. What happened to Caspar Van Dienne who pulled him into this nightmare. A terrible acting, a very boring act and a terrific direction. It's so terrible, funny. I guess it's full of uncertainty, but it's more comedy. If you want to see a terrible acting, funny script writing and sub-plot, check this movie. If I was Van Dien, I would not just ask for my 10% of my agent, but I would fired the bastard in that process. What a party. It's not even appropriate to be on MST 3K !! It would be a good movie to cure you insomnia. I especially like the part in which Van Dien throws over the deck, and then returns in just a few minutes! I can only imagine that it was written by writers who are not members of the trade unions and who used the strike of the writer. What a horrible movie !!!
