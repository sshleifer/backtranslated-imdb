Christopher Lambert is boring and disappointing in his portrayal as GIDEON. This movie could have been a classic when Lambert performed like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raimond Babbitt in RAIN MAN, or Sean Penn as Sam Davson in I AM SAM. because the story makes sense to us in life, the performances of Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Vinters were excellent. 3 of 10
