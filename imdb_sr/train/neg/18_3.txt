This is an artistic film that was shot in 1969 or 1972 (National Film Preservation Foundation says in 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely seems very indicative for this general period of time - with some work with cameras and pop art styles that were cleaned in the late 1960s and early 70s. The film consists of three simple pictures that are distorted using different weird tricks of the camera. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or complication. This was obviously conceived as almost as a form of performance, and like most performance arts, it is initially interesting, but quickly becomes tiring. The film, more crudely speaking, was a total boredom and would not suit anyone, but perhaps those who made the movie, their families and friends, and perhaps a few people who are too hip-hop and "with him" to understand us mortals.
