When I first joined the morning news, I thought, "Wow, finally, some fun." It was a little fun in a week or so ... But we have to deal with it, these journalists (if they can even call them) have VERY MUCH "playing" time. At first, I thought Jillian was breathing fresh air. But seriously, this woman does not have the least journalist in it. She is very unprofessional. He continues to interrupt Steve when he begins to notify viewers about a particular report. It really got bored to the point that I can not watch it anymore. Jillian is NOT a good reporter. Hell, she's more a celebrity who likes to be a celebrity. So, she is currently turning into a celebrity personality about celebrities who should be interviewing. She is not very professional and probably believes that her relationship with celebrities is more important than being a really insatiable journalist - and that's all I can say about her. the necessary press reports about the world, the government, the US, or something that will use and / or serve public interest. They are too focused on sensationalism that everything they talk about is a commercial product. On the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly tolerable ... I believe "Good Dai LA" is intended for young teenagers and celebrities, and it is definitely not for people who really care about the news. (I'd rather watch KTLA, but they sometimes make so much effort to be fun, but they're a bit boring though. Oh well, I'll stick to NBC "Today is ABC" Good Morning America "is also fine ... as long as Diana Savier does not become too serious.)
