Wow, this is bad. Twice I watched an old episode of Star Trek - it was the one in which everyone was infected with the cosmic disease, and then a little sickened - and there was also Stevart Moss, known as the "incredible" hero "The Lives at Night! is the first infected crew member who is dying from terminal depression, and I only thought that he had watched his film too many times, it caused depression.This movie is full of really inaccessible people.In the film there is no redeeming figure, not one.It is very difficult to feel bad because Dr. Beck turns into a bat (or whatever it actually has turned into) because you just do not like him, and you do not like his penetrating, bony woman, or the nasty spleen Sgt Vard, or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why would you invest time or energy into this movie? Where there is no empathy with the characters, not to mention the horrible cinema that made it look like filming in the urine, and the special effects of five cents, many of which looked like pieces of paper that were thrown into the fan to simulate the hordes of a bat who fly. Not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but down there in the bottom line, definitely.
