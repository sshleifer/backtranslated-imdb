Nevertheless, the treatment, regardless of other criticisms, was done extremely well. Brad Pitt pretty well manages the role of a boring, hated Austrian climber. Other procedures are fine. The story could be a rivet, but somehow it's missing - they never understand or care about the characters shown, so the story, which could have been pretty dramatic, fails to attract this audience. > Wonderful landscapes and cinemas, an incredibly dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world we live in - but I could not, trying to do what I could to get involved in this story. As a tireless fan of Brad Pitt (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of my generation), I expected * to love this film - and yet he left me cold. failure, but I'm inclined to show the creative end of this film - direction, script writing, production, assembly - somehow I was lost. It's embarrassing, because it could have been wonderful. Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully captured - it should have been magnificent. It was not. It's probably worth watching, only to think about it yourself - but do not expect too much, and you may not be as disappointed as me. I was basically bored.
