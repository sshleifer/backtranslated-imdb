Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic excuse for losing a movie that should be recycled as toilet paper, has recently destroyed my confidence in film art. First of all, it was made. Second, people went to see him. Thirdly, some people voted for the best movie they ever saw. If a monkey can make a movie, I'm 100% sure it will be a billion times better. Most of the shitty movies have their moments, (even Godzilla had several cool special effects), the moment of this film was when I left the theater painfully. The only thing that could have made this movie would be even worse if Jerry Springer would have been a star. If I want to look at shit for an hour and a half, I'll take a dump in a can. If someone did not completely disdain this movie, I'm sorry for you, your children, and your children's children; However, contrary to Springer's convictions, I obviously do not forgive those who have sex.
