That this bad excuse for an amateur clock exposed at Sundance is a great example of what's wrong with the majority of indie filmmakers these days. First of all, there is something like the art of cinema. . Just taking a 16mm camera and pointing to anyone with a line does not make a real movie. I guess we have to consider ourselves lucky that the director has not picked up someone's camcorder ... Secondly, indie movies should be about real people. There is nothing real in this movie. None of the characters encountered that even he was not a man. What they come up with like a fairy tale are the ideas of a writer who tries to impress their friends by showing them how cool and tiring they are. I'm sorry, but this not good writing, or good direction. What's left is a shell of a bad movie that somehow managed to get to Sundance. It's hard to believe that this was one of the best movies ... In any case, I lost what I had left out of respect for the Sundance brand.
