And Oscar for the most popular classic actor is going to - Dvight Frie. Seriously, his name should be mentioned with the same awe as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this film proves it. His character Herman was one of two reasons why I can watch this movie. Dvight brought a little more than a slightly disturbed unadjusted cute, but dreadful behavior that led you to the hope that the whole movie will play a bigger role. Another reason is comic relief M. Eburnea. Given that I am in the medical profession, I must give honor to the expert effect of hypochondria self-pity. Although other "medical mistakes" gave a short shot, especially when a good doctor took medication from his fellow doctor ... "Well, continue to give it" Unfortunately, these two great performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts to get through through this unbearable word movie. The plot is predictable with only a few smaller plants. Recording, while withdrawing a legitimate atmosphere was slyly more productive, made me yawn - that you could use too many shadows. My recommendation - watch this once to see Frie and Eburne - but only when you are awake and with lots of caffeine.
