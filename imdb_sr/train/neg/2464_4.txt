He liked the first part, an impossible planet, but he hoped what a disappointment was in the second part of 'Satan's Cave'. The clan of something obviously rising from the pit is - nothing has come out of the pit. Then they spent the years crawling around the air holes to tell the story, the Beast, the noisy thing of empty intelligence, so I did not expect the confrontation of the Doctor / villain. TARDIS is somehow inside the cave, despite the fact that the pit is not open long after TARDIS fell through the corners of the planet. And in the end, yet another solution that was there for no logical reason - I mean, why not enter the "Open" as soon as the cave opened? Why do not you dive into it all that year, instead of closing it. Why not - I could go on, but I lost interest ...
