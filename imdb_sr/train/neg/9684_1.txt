Stubbornly stagnant, odd and opaque, if visually striking ... vannabe-erotic fantasy. A really boring, too male nudity (including father-son incest), and just some kind of shameless nonsense. I will admit, however, that certain passages of dialogue, taken under their own conditions, have lulling, haunting quality.
