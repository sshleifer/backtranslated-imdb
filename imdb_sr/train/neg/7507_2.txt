This film is a bad news and I am really surprised by the level of talent of a great name that would ever agree to appear in such a piece of garbage as this one. I suppose there were a few strangled agents stretched across the Hollivood Blvd. as a result of this fiasco. What really matters to you is that it could have been good. The director's star is attracting attention and the theme was enough to boost interest and sell tickets, but this is a failure. Multiple stories turn from bad to stupid to the end of the picture, and in the end you feel like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that has broken down. What Spike can do is reprimand against any Italians who may have beaten him when he was a kid or insulted him because the film has a large number of extensions of obsolete and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee movie, there are some really provocative and magical cameras. He has a gift to grab your psyche and transfer you into your vision, even for a few unforgettable scenes. But the question remains ... can you withstand the remaining 2 hours of scratching your head and watching your watch while you are wondering and waiting for the end that must be there somewhere.
