Otto Preminger directs this light as a story about a feather. Bohemian Jean Seberg and her equally bohemian widowed father David Niven are resting in the south of France with crazy Milena Demongeot. Things are ok until Deborah Kerr's family friend appears. Niven, a degenerate woman, believes that Kerr's overthrow is too difficult to resist. This is fine with Seberg, as long as Niven likes and leaves (as he did with all the women in the past ... including Demongeot). When it turns out to be the second banana in Niven's life, Seberg refreshes Kerr. Preminger recounts the story in memory from the perspective of Seberg and cleverly combines black and white with sunny color scenes. Georges Perinal's camera is astounding. The film contains some of Preminger's most difficult directions, although rarely allows any major plans, making it difficult to understand what actors really feel. Arthur Laurents wrote a script and was full of sophisticated dialogue and funny scenes (mainly about the demongeote). Seberg is very good at hand, but Niven is at least attractive ... and he does not show chemistry either to Seber and to Carmo. Preminger was really mistaken with that casting. It's a role that seems to be tailor-made for someone closer to Charles Boier. With Geoffrey Horne as Seberg's candidate and Marty Hunt as his mother. Juliette Greco, playing herself, sings the title song at a nightclub in Paris. The big titles are the prime minister's regular Saul Bass.
