If you hate accusations redneck, you hate this movie. And to be even worse, you see Patrick Swayze, who is trying to be a redhead. I really can not stand accents. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. What's his name, Lonnie Earl? How much longer can you get this movie? The story was stupid. I did not usually condemn movies, but I could not stand this movie. If you want a good movie about Billy Bob Thornton, go to Slingblade. My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 in Val Mart ... figures ... I think I'll wrap it up and give it to my grandma for Christmas. It is possible that I can not stand the usual accents or I can not stand Patrick Svaize. Maybe Patrick Svaize was not in it. I did not laugh once in the movie. I usually laugh at something stupid. If they showed that some of the fingers were broken, I might have laughed. Human fingers are broken by chance and they always laugh at me.
