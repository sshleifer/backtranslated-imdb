Or maybe it looks like that. In any case, "The Bat People" is roughly flat as carpet, bland like sackcloth and exciting as stone ... and intelligent as all three combinations. Okay, get tricked up briefly (switch bowl, yes ...): Doctor (Moss) bites the bat while inspecting the cave with his wife (McAndrev) and then turns into a bat - well, not a bat, but a bat-like creature that looks more like a wolf who kills his victims in the perspective of a camera from the first person .... But there is also the job of the Sheriff (Pataki), which is the worst sort of Sheriff : type of peasant. He tortures people, writes about married women, steals handkerchiefs (FIEND!), Smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and speaks at the same time, making him look so sound like Buford T. Justice in "Smokey and the Bandit" and (this is the worst part) ... THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTER IN THE FULL FILM! The whole film is, however, only a film TV movie crapola (guano, in this case). It's AIP, for loud crying! What were you expecting about the Oscars caliber? And what else can you say about a movie that MST3K can not preserve? How about ... there is no star for "Bat Bat People, Full Version or MST3K version!" By the way, if ever there is a continuation for this movie, I bury my TV.
