STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning McBain (Game Garry Busei, before the name became synonymous with character in Simpsons) is a (typically) unusual policeman who gets results but throws his superiors into something corrupt. By avoiding the clich√© of his partner who was killed at the beginning of the film, the plot instead has a different reversal and sees that he was assigned to travel to Mexico, where the secret super tank with incredible firepower and shooting capabilities was smuggled, to be taken hostage, together with a team , by a gang of terrorists. This inexpensive layout (even by the standards of the '80s), a boring little action movie was a bizarre move for a career for Garry Busey after he left the impression as a flame with a villain, Mr. Gos. Joshua in the Deadly Weapon. He only goes through movements with his carbon character, nervous and unbridled as always (with 'butthorn' is his trademark left for bad guys), but without the material to support him. Henri Silva is present as a perpetrator on the screen, but he is completely wrong here as an Arab leader (in a red beret!) And the terrible script gives him some really insane lines of boring dialogue that make his performance funny. He is just one of the many actors of the action movie, including L.K. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who appear, but do not add anything to mik. After the boring first half without a lot of exciting action, things are a little raised in the end, but it's too late and none of it fails to satisfy any kind of entertainment. *
