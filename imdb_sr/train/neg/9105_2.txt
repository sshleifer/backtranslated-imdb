What can I say about cruel intentions 2? Well, I can say honestly, I will just watch this movie again if I'm attached to a chair and as my eyes open in an hour-orange style. Film 'starring' Robin Dunne (No, I have not heard of him), whose horrible impression of Ryan Phillipe made me bend. In the case of a terrible throw, Dunn tries (and does not succeed) to play the game of a handsome charismatic, charmer. Since the actor is not handsome, neither charismatic nor charming, the character remains completely incredible. Amy Adams, (once in a fairy tale episode), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar stood and bring Katherine's life to life ... However, Adams is not such a good actress and her performance was flat and the lack of any real emotion , it often looked like it was only reading cards from the camera. However, in the film were two good actors, Barrie Flatman (Sav 2 & Sav 3) and Mimi Rogers (Ms. Kensington from Austin Povers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why the film itself rated as 2, and not as 1. Sam movie is a bad version of the original, with such low levels as examples of dialogue and mimicking scenes that lack the originality of the previous film. I think this, as a TV show, may have succeeded, but it has been rearranged with people who could act in the mainstream.
