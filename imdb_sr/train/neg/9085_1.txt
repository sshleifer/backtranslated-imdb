One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was terrible, both for children and for adults. There was not much for all the characters, little or no emotions. The lighting was terrible, and there was too much disorder at the time the film was filmed (on the river scene where they only destroyed their boat, there are 4 shots, the sheriff and dad on the evening on their boat, Jillian and Molly swimming in the evening, the rest of the children in during the day * when it was supposed to be in the evening * on the river bank, and doctor, Beatrice and Simonton at night, but not in the evening, coming out of the boat.) The best actress in the film was probably from the sheriff, Cappi , there is a sign that the pulse detector * Whatever it is when people die, a beacon * indicates that Cappi died, he goes away It goes as long as the nurse manually checks his pulse, then shows the pulse again, and then he finally dies.) I suppose it will not be perfect, because it's an independent film, but it can still be better. It's not worth watching, honestly, even for children. Perhaps you are looking at something good, like the Lion King or Toy Story, if you see something you will remember.
