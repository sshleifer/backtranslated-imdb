If you read my review of SiFi's "Dinoshark", you know that I can appreciate the low-budget shield that these films can provide. They're stupid ... they're silly ... but they're still pretty fun in "so bad, good" way. And so, still crushing guilt for the love (and recommendation) of the undoubtedly hockey "Dinoshark", I sat down to watch "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", SiFi Original Half-Man movie, a half-hammer monster that terrorizes people on the island. With the secure recipe of SiFi Channel to create the features of B-movie and acting, which includes Villiam Forsithe and Hunter Tilo, how can this go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it actually misses the sign ... not much, but enough not to recommend it. Why? Well, above all, his titular monster, a chronic human hybrid with a hammer, occupies the back seat for a bunch of fake military silos who really become the main loser of the film. Although the hammer in the head increases the number of bodies, he (or the way you call it) comes only before someone gets stuck and left behind immediately. The rest of the film is filling our heroes against those soldiers. This, for me, is simply not as tempting as watching the walking of a hammer that eats people!
