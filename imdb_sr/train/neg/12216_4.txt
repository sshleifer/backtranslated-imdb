Do not misunderstand me - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series as well as movies, but enough: Death On The Nile. Everyone has done this! We know who dies. We know why they're dying. We know who the killer is. We know how it's done. So I already said enough! Mr. Suchet could use this awesome talent in yet another novel by Agatha Christie. I'll say that the acting of all the actors was great. The sets were great and very real. I especially liked David Soul, but I was surprised how terribly he looked. I hope it does not look so in a 'real' life! I honestly can not remember from other films whether the end itself was the same. Somehow I do not think so. I thought it was a pretty brilliant touch if Christie wrote it that way. I'd rather end up in that prison!
