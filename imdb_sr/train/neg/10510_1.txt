Oh God, where do you start ... you play badly ... characters you just do not care about ... are Americans or Britons ... it seems they think they are in America, because where's the other huge forest in the central part of the country ... One big mistake ... they drive all night through these forests ... unless they go around and around, to be in Scotland until morning .. when the one that is angry hits poor wandering woman ... And those cell phones do not work ... so what they do ... they are separating, of course, easier to pick up ... so three go in search of a home that could to be there in the middle of nothing, while the others remain to "care" for the unconscious woman ... so what they do, instead of being comfortable, softens her head, covers her, or even moves from the bloody road, just leave her lying on a difficult path until they go and burn the fire for 100 years ... and all the time they have a camper put it in ... And on the angry angels, who are assumed to have so much wanted a human kind, that they were thrown out of heaven to live among us ... so what are they doing? engage in sexual intercourse with any of the men they encounter? ......... I do not bite big chunks of them and scratch their heads ... I think they miss a point ... These are not beautiful sexually deprived ex-angels, they're cannabis vampires. ... and as far as the bubbles are talking about how exciting and beautiful ... well, that girl has good bodies, but nothing special in her face. The main role was much better than these so-called irresistible sirens ... Waste from a Â£ 2.30 waste film from my local library ...
