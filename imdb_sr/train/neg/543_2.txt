good good One cant b loses time just cause big star-cast .. I think all I could see is a bunch of talents losing their time on the big screen with some pathetic humor that will be like I do not know who? Some pathetic songs that will hear who? Some pathetic hurry turn justified by whom? a race against time? u means waste against time? OK so first you spoil your child, then teach him a lesson that we are so ignorant of in this fact whoever said that his brilliant new concept is probably some other kind of human being in the right, let me comment as people have a good movie message should be given, but it could have been given by an unknown person sitting next to you on the bus, not going to such a disgusting movie to learn it Hindi movies have already shown it, and also I can not waste time writing about waste In any case !
