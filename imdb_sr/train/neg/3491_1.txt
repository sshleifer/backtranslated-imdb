Apparently, the people who wrote on the back of the box did not try to watch this so-called "movie". They described the "brilliant choreography of intrigue and violence." I did not see any "intrigue". Instead, I saw a poor attempt at dialogue in the alleged kung fu movie. I did not see "violence". At least I have not seen anything that could force me to stop the disbelief of what could hurt a man with "impermeable" skin - but here I may discover too many "complications". In addition, as a spectator of many and varied films (some of which include occasional kung fu films), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is elusive. Whatever you choose, I will always stay True, Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> I was not blinded by choreography.
