When I saw this "documentary," I was disappointed to see the Serbian propaganda again. Although Serbia and its nationalist policy are the main reason for the break-up of Yugoslavia, it is not mentioned in this "documentary", which Bogdanovic made whose name says he is Serbian, and his film is far from objectivity. This is one in a series of lies that are undermining the Milosevic regime. All the others were guilty; only the Serbs were right and the victims, although most war criminals in The Hague were Serbs, although Serbs committed genocide against Bosniaks and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia all independent states that recognized the UN.Baccup of Yugoslavia could not to avoid, because the Serbs did not want to free the grief that their nationalism put on the Yugoslav government, so SLovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests. they are interested in the objective documentary about the breakup of Yugoslavia, and the documentary is not about it. You should watch "Yugoslavia: Death of the nation", which was recorded by Discoveri Channel and the BBC.
