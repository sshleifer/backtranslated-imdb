SPLIT OTHERS might have been a good movie. The story of the "rage on the road" killing, has a very young Clive Owen that gives pretty good performance; OR ... or .... Unfortunately, the filmmakers have undermined their movie with an idiot camera and a really terrible montage. The camera jumps throughout the creation in an unsuccessful attempt (I suppose) to reflect Owen's stress from work, family, and traffic. What it does in fact is to give the viewer a headache. Since filmmakers did not care about making a good movie, but just to impress with their idiotic photography, you do not have to waste time on this travesty.
