Writing on the screen is so stupid that it bother me that I lost 2 hours of my life, I will never return (where I already heard it). The acting is so-so. Things are often changing to watch you and wait for something terrible to happen. However, there is not one original thing in this movie. While the first cube was a nerd film of horror, which in the end did not make much sense, the cube zero moved and tried to tell the same story again, except this time makes it an unpleasant point of attempt to explain every detail that the first film did not answer. The comic thing is that the director recycles the correct scenes of the first movie that were a bit strange and trying to explain them. But the scenes are only copied, there is no coherence. This script is sooo meaningless. I can imagine that he wrote a half-smart 15-year-old with a baseball cap and a glass of beer for a class project. The best part is, in the end, they get rid of a 'good' guy from the vunderkind, and he becomes a retarded guy in the first movie, and you see him when he finds him ('this room is green') in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, clap your hands twisting. First of all, if you have not seen the first, this makes no sense that you are a stupid director. Oh, another great idea: instead of the numbers to identify k, and, from the room coordinate (cube 1997), this time it's 3 letters, each of which gives one of the 26 possible coordinate values. Ghost. Except that now the permutations no longer make sense ... so that it allows the letters to disappear before anyone can use them. I want my money back. I guess I had to write this because there are only so many bad, inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this movie. Directors / writers should be required to possess some talent.
