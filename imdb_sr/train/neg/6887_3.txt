Another "son who will not grow up" and only the other new ones. Heather in another bad wool, channeling Napoleon for the third time? Anna Faris is forgetful, as always; Jeff Daniels called this at a bar from another country; and Diane Keaton ... how did this get late in a career? Do not bother. Nothing is said here that is not covered more than once. I'll say this; it's a hundred times better than "Failed Start". There are very few fun parts in the movie, unless you think the curse of Eli Vals is ridiculous. Ha-ha! He's old and he drops a f-bomb! Tee, hee, hee. Pitiful!
