However, I think Al Pacino is a pleasure. He was a good actor all the way to Scent of a Voman, where he obviously overdone himself irreparably. I was hoping this film, for which I heard that almost nothing had grown up, would be a precious gem. A cautious, intelligent and attractive city-political thriller. That's not. The City Hall is a movie that captivates its plot with so many characters, names and "realistic" city issues that for some time it thinks it's a plot in the range so wide and implying that once you find out the truth it will you blow your mind. True, however, these sub-captions and digressions result in extremely pitiful and well-known trademarks in a city story, such as Corruption of Power, Dual Politicians, Police with Mafia, etc. fear that none of the characters is safe and that anything can happen! But again, it really does not. Unfortunately, the only things that are happening are quite predictable, and we are left with a few "recognitions" of monologues, which are conceived as a whole to form modern ones, for example, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society . But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and networks of spiders, lies and concealment, the audience is usually treated as a satisfactory discovery. I do not think that left us in the City Hall, and although it's a full movie, I do not consider it to be completely rich.
