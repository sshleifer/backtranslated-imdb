Many brides were mysteriously killed while on the altar, and later their bodies were stolen on the way to the morgue. Patricia Hunter, a writer, decides to investigate these mysterious murders. It reveals that before each ceremony, the bride received a rare orchid (supposedly from a groom) that contained a powerful drug that succumbed to them. Patricia was told that Orchid was first raised by Dr. Lorenz, who lives in a hideaway estate, with his wife. In reality, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, putting the brides in a suspended condition and using his gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenzo on the medical mystery surrounding his wife), tries to force Dr. Lorenz's hand by setting up a fake wedding, which ultimately brings Patricia to a crazy doctor. This film had a very good introductory tape, but basically it ended with too much set footage and other bad scenes. Actors are decent, Valters and Coffin deserve better, but that's life. Russell steals the show (even when he suffocates Lugosia - who does not give one of his unforgettable performances, even if he takes into account his Monograms) because Countess Lorenz played a role with the qualities of many stereotypical characteristics of many of today's Hollywood primadones. Poor and fanciful ending. 4. Score, based on films B, 4. \ t
