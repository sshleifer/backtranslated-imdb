The box "To Die For" brought me to the line - without a shirt and promises of some laughter and sex. There was a lot of Thomas Arkley (Simon), who was light on his eyes, but without laughter and little sexiness. The pair, Mark and Simon, allegedly were together for several years, but not one character is interesting enough to worry, so it's hard to imagine that they care for each other. It seems that the error lies in the script, not in the performance; both actors are doing the best they can with what they have been given. The end is gloomy and does not affect it (well, it does not affect me completely; I have felt the relief that's over). If you are looking for a film about gay relationships and AIDS, it's ridiculous, "Separation of the view" is far better.
