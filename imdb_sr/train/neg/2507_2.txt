This is not a good movie. It's unconnected, all acting is bad, and it has a lame story that you've seen a thousand times much better than other places. Not to mention that you can see each point of the plot that comes from a mile away. Worst of all, nobody tried to tell Lonette McKee that he could not sing. But who cares, she's sooooo damn good looks. But I turn around, nothing new here. The bottom line, a group of hot girls has been exploited, someone is getting used to drugs, somebody gets tired of someone, someone gets out, and then happens terribly. Surprise, surprise. Welcome to music business. I can not believe that so many people think this is a good movie. It seems that many of you want to use a slide scale when it comes to evaluating black films. I do not play it! If you want to support these movies by seeing them - great! If you enjoyed it - great! Everybody. But do not try to tell me it's good. Pleeeease! I wish that colored people would not deal with these films just because they have black actors. You want to see a good Afro-American movie? See Love Jones. Air. Or The Color Purple. It would be brilliant movies regardless of the color of the actor's skin. Why? Because they have told fantastic tales with great acting, which made you feel long after you left the theater. Just because our experience does not make it automatically a good movie. It's good only when it's good. Period.
