As much as I do not like to say "and I" in response to other comments - it's quite true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing to do with an endless dish that consists of the next 90's. Be banned somewhere does not make the movie visible. Just because it does not look like a Hollywood product, it does not make it credible. Even worse, except that there are no noticeable plots (in addition to many muddy places in Russia and many people, even very old people, drink lots of vodka), many visual images are so unnecessarily troublesome that I am in the second pack of Roland. As for the spoiler - well, the film is so devoid of narrative thread I could not write if I try. Do not waste your time and money, and do not mix it with a good Russian movie.
