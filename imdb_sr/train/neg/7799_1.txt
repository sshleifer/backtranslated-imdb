What happened, in the name of God, here? How to create what is practically a cheap venture of Redneck Zombies? Was Zombie '90 ever to entertain someone ... anybody, or to make a profit from the dollar? But mostly, what happened here? Zombie '90 Ectreme Pestilence was directed by a craze named Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in films that have destroyed Earth, such as Goblet of Gore and Anthropophagus 2000, and some of them contain curses in titles. In the upgrade, this is not much different than the others. Although, the degree of incompetence ... well, earthquake. Zombie '90 Ectreme Pestilence is as bad as dead Peter Jackson is bloody, think about it. Too specific with the story would be a waste of time. An accident involving chemicals causes the dead to return and eat alive. The concept has never been treated in such a way. The effects above are completely new. Only nightmares of the Z-class. I can not say if this was originally intended to be ridiculous, somehow, I doubt that English synchronization was very faithful to the original scenario, but strange things happened. The whole thing reminds me of the introduction to the video of the film Trom, except that it takes much longer. I saw only one movie that was worse than this, The Chooper. To prove that Andreas Schnaas is the real director, I would recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you do not have standards in what you are looking for in a bad movie, try Ectreme Pestilence, but you were warned. They need steel nerves to break through completely. But if everything is up for what you are here, then you could try this. In addition, there is no atmosphere, no, and I mean no budget, no fun value, but mostly there is no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 Updated 7/5/09: After a few more reviews of Zombie '90, I had a heart change, or I guess I got it now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so do not ever say harsh words, although extreme plague still deserves only one star.
