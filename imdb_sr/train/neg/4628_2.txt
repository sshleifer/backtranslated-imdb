Misti Aiers had a smoking body, and that's all about it. Pure explosion. I began to play with myself, counting how many times they were fond of stocking orchestral music. And of course, music is completely unrelated to scenes. The correct case: leisurely entering the room and pronouncing "Hello" was recorded with the earliest music from the Roman epic. I would like to know why this film was sitting on the shelf 11 years before it was released. What I learned from this film: that women's low trousers existed in 1954. I'm talking about the Sigourney Veaver in original aliens movies. At least 20 out of the first 30 minutes, Misti took her casually and put her clothes (except for a bra and panties, unfortunately). It also involves terrible dubbing, which leads to "Watch! Godzirra!" effect.
