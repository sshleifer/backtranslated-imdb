All the elements for bad night in the movies are in place: a dialogue with the biological techno-rumors, chintzi sets, balsa-woody acting, terrible Casio in the late 1980s, and an overall look that suggests anything on the Sci-Fi Fi Channel schedule, around 1993. Although "Metamorphosis" begins with many promises, the film is revealed in mild idiocy and MST3K cheese like Clark Kent vannabe 'Doctor' Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is pressed to publish information about his secret projects. But when testing his vague experiment on himself, he turns into an unclearly defined creature (which carries more than a passing similarity to Dr. Freudstein from the "House at the cemetery"). FKS work is pretty good for such an obviously low-budget production (although I doubt that most are kept in the shadows for some reason), but all in all, "Metamorphosis" leaves a bad retro retro-cot in your intestines, despite hopes. to make us different. I can not but agree with the final remark of one character: "(It was) Nightmare ... from the past!"
