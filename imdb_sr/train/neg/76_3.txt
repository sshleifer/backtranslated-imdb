I saw it at the premiere in Melbourne It's shallow, two-dimensional, without impact, and it's hard to believe considering the topic boring. Actors are passable, but they did not have much to do with a very boring and impassioned scenario. For those who could worry that Ned Kelly would be overly intellectualized, you can be comforted by the fact that this story is completely without any literary depth, uttered entirely on the surface and a lot of central standards. However, it does not function as a popcorn movie either. Its speed is too sharp and negligible to be satisfied even at the level of the moneylenders. I very much suspected that Gregor Jordan could lean over and say to himself: "This is the best I could do with the material." Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and it is equally a national response to him. Perhaps a national genius, perhaps a class warrior, probably a psychopath and possibly all these things, he dominates the true mythology in Australia for more than 120 years. Once again, his story miserably erred on the big screen. Such is life.
