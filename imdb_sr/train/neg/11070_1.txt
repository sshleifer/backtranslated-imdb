This is a really bad movie. The character "Cole", played by Michael Moriarti, was the main reason why this flop fell, the actor felt that creating an incredibly unpleasant southern drawing would have made this character more evil, he did not. After about 20 minutes, I wanted to make some logoped look, it would add some sincerity. - 1) badly behaved - 2) insensitive person - 3) brute plot plot /> <br /> Iuck! <br /> <br />
