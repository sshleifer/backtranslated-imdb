Missed train. Wrong phone number. An extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly harmless decision? Most people do not think about it while it is absorbed in their thoughts and actions. The "Case" speaks of mutual relations and cause-and-effect relationship with the earth as it relates to a group of normal Parisian people. It has all the components of what goes on for a contemporary theater, with full acting dysfunctional and disappointed. There is a cheating husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic sloth, a pocket money, a crazy grandmother, a boring girl, a selfish roommate and a homeless man. Audrey Tautou serves as a former protagonist (in the sense that she is on the camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the movie) and a normal girl who just can not find the right rhythm in her life. At the beginning of her day, she learns from a stranger on the train what her horoscope holds. What is happening to her during the day is told through different characters. Is prediction accomplished? The concept is good, but narration is bad. Connections from one event to another are poor. There is better storytelling within 15 seconds of the Liberty Mutual Insurance advertisement where one person sees a good deed and transmits it to another than in two hours of Happenstance. If you enjoy Audrey Tautou, then you can certainly sacrifice time for this movie, but you will end up dissatisfied and wonder what the same story could be if it was led by a better producer and director.
