This film can be judged from three points of view: history, as an Amina profile, as a fiction thriller. It fails as history, mentions the passing of the coup that threw out Obote, expulsion of the Asians, and has the Entebbe hi-jack as a background, but not in any chronologically consistent time frame. As a profile of Amina, it might have been interesting, because Forest Vhitaker was incredibly good, and if it were a better movie, I would have won an Oscar. (He got it - proving that Oscar voters do not watch the films they vote on.) He ignores the relevant historical episodes in the novel, watching Amin and Uganda's history from a doctor's point of view. Instead, he talks about the fictitious story of a Scottish doctor and his impossible love life from Amina's point of view. But the story is an incident in which Amin was probably innocent. As a fictional thriller, there is no complication to keep it together. The beginning is tense - in the novel, film freedom is taken, but sets the story. The character of the doctor is well defined, but it is lost in the second half of the film that results in the result. Why did the doctor decide to stay in Kampala is poorly explained - misled by the power? Why no one's freaks are strange. The friend's friend in the novel is lost because Scott has an affair instead of a black doctor-a ridiculous intolerance that does not seem to be a little convincing, but allows filmmakers to show Amina's hardness near. . A man called Horse is ultimately dangerous. Finally, in 1971, Uganda drove left, not right; the number plate was three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the Ekuator towers?! In short - if you have never heard of Amin, you may want to spend two hours watching this movie to appreciate the Forest Vhitaker's acting, but the last hour will bring you confusion. If you know Uganda or have read the book - you do not see a movie - it will only depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so unscrupulous - not.
