I'm not sure it was a language or a bad act, but everything about this movie is felt and looks cheap and fake. After I saw Der Untergang, this is a great disappointment. There is no connection between the different scenes, and the acting is so incredibly bad that I could not even believe that people could make such a mess in something that has great potential. First of all, everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound to it, and especially Hitler sounds like Hitler when he speaks / shouts German. the characters were empty and the film seemed to be a collection of random events that could have happened. Whether it's about English or the fact that I've already seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and funny.
