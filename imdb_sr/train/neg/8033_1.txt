In the student's home a man kills someone with a hair. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) reveals him and tries to commit suicide. She's institutionalized. A year later he goes out, has a new boy named Hank (Joseph Lavrence) and will just spend Spring Break with Hank and four other senseless friends in BIG, a beautiful apartment in Florida. Of course, the killer appears (for no reason) and begins to kill again. Bad Thriller Thriller - an example of a school textbook that DO NOT NEED to do low-budget horror. To begin with, the vast parts of this film are WOULD a filling of these six idiots who record themselves, entertain themselves (more fun than the audience), drink, act stupid, etc. I'm not saying that the horror movie should be naked, but anything that could help. None of the deaths is actually shown (you hear), they are just a little bloody and no worse. There is one really terrible - but that's not the end. With a few exceptions, acting is bullshit. Dorie Barton is terrible as the main woman and Tom Jai Jones is as bad as Oz. Chad Allen appears as Brad and he's terrible. Lawrence is actually very good - handsome and dirty and gives all this shit. And Jeff Conavai appeared in a minor role, doing a pretty good job. Baston's reaction to the killing of a friend is ridiculous and what happens to Lavrence? His character disappears without a trace in the end! Tupa, stupid, no worse, no nudity - skip this.
