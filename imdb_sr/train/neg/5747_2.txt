I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur productions. And Meat Market 2 really begins to promise with a nice admiration of Fulci's Classic "Zombie". So I leaned back and waited to be impressed. All right, some of the makeups are great for such a film without a budget, and some actors (vampirelady and cook) really stand out, but otherwise there is nothing. I did not expect a new Romero here, but there is not one sequence in the whole movie that has even a little tension or shock. The director knows how to draw out rips and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to find out more. insufficient - excuse me. ** From *****
