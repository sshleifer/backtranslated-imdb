I bought this $ 5 movie in a discount bookshop, Adam Sandler was a great actor and I thought it would be a good movie, well, he did not. There were absolutely no stories, bad jokes, and the other comedian said "The F-Vord", every other word he said, cursing I do not usually bother, but this was over the top. Even worse than missing a story, parts were when Sandler began to talk in camera with accidental parts of the film, reminded me of Dora Explorer, when they turned around and looked at the screen and asked you questions. And the last of all is when you would randomly put bikini shots of girls randomly in the movie. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, it's a waste of money
