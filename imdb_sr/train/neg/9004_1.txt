Nothing could save this movie, not even Superman. Ten years ago special effects would be incredible. Better direction may have got even more feelings and better performances than actors. But nothing but the feeding of the script to the dragon could have been corrected. Hole for plots, bad lines, awesome tempo, endless repetition of the same CGI images of the dragon that runs through the corridors ... no. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
