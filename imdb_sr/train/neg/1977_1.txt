Wait, do not tell me ... they kicked the movie and held it. You know, this movie could have been filmed in the alley in New York. "Gangster Bangster" I guess. Gangster Rap, designer gangster clothing, including a scarf that somehow moved out of the door to protect it from dust to the head. I suppose it was the protection of the head from the filtering of heat through the K-Mart hats. "Budget rent-a-horsie" seems to have provided horses. Scene with one bedroom where the girl was talking, and the guy said her words. You know, watching this movie just confirms this, it's not about acting ... about the look and money. There could not be too much about this movie. Well, all in all, I think this film will fall like the worst movie ever made. Just one more thing, where was Ice T? Did he finally go to Oprah?
