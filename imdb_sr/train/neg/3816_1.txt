He has very bad acting. Poor stories. Bad signs. You should never see this show. Turn it off. Or rush for the next 30 minutes. It should never have been broadcast. It's not great. You should never see him. NEVER EVER NEVER. Now, if you ever want to watch this show, please do not. Turn to CV CV for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Vizards of Vaverley Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, These are much better family shows. So believe me in this, but I've watched it. And honestly, I say honestly, the worst performance I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of TVs. Do me a favor, and never watch this show.
