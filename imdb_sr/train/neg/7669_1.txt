This movie is one of the most unique movies you've ever seen. However, this stems from the fact that you can not make heads or tails of this confusion. It seems like a set of challenges that are set to determine whether you are willing to quit the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you do not want to feel insulted, you will go through this horrible movie and develop the real feeling of pity for the actors involved, everyone has seen better days, but then realize that they really got a lot of money to do that and you'll lose pity for them as you have already done for the movie. I can not talk enough about this terrible film, his almost anything Ed Vood would have done, and in that case he would certainly be his masterpiece. For starters, you are forced to sit through the opening dialogue that you have never seen / heard, this thing has to be five minutes long. In addition, she is told, as if suggesting that the viewer can not read. Then we will meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines is in progress, it's like he works solely to get lines on the line of tag posters of the movie. Soon we meet with Stephen Dorff, who I usually enjoy) and he tries to not drown in it, but in the end he does. Then comes the final insult, Tara Reid plays an intelligent role, oh, help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she is constantly getting roles in the movies, in my opinion, although she should hold American-type pies movies. All in all, you may want to see this for yourself when it happens on the video, I know that I got out of it, I think we all need to be honest here, sometimes it's comforting to enjoy the shortcomings of others.
