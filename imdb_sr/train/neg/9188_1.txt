This is the only movie I've seen Uwe Boll, I knew he was the worst director who always made movies based on video games and that "House of the Dead" was one of the IMDb 100. I still wanted it to be I'm watching because I'm a big fan of the game and I wanted to see what a movie in a movie that makes it so bad. After watching, I agree that it was shit, the film had no story. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but toplex teenagers with no brains moving (I wondered for a moment whether the zombies were dead or they were girls?) And then at night the zombies emerged from nowhere and began to attack the people of a later woman she started firing them, I think you take one place, then another every 5 minutes. Should this be a comedy? Or a horror? or both? Before I realized it, I fell asleep in the second half and woke up during the final credits so I could not watch it all, which is a good thing! Movie is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll, do not make any more movies. Thank you!
