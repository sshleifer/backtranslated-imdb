Leslie Sands performs as "Deadlock" and becomes a poor vehicle for Bette Davis and Garry Merrill, right after their joint success in "All About Eve." After killing his wife, the visiting woman visits the best friend of her husband, who turns out to be her husband when others start to stop at home. Irving Rapper, one of Betty's best-selling directors, is unfortunately unable to pick up this ridiculous material, in which Davis is unbelievably restrained and restrained by the incredible finale (where she gratefully pulled out all the breaks). Production and foundation made strictly secondary; just for correspondents Bette Davis. * 1/2 of ****
