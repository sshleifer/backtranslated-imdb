I suppose it's beautiful and modern to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a movie like this one. With the sometimes meaningless excesses of many Hollywood films, we can relax and enjoy the scene of devoid of explosions, ugly tongues, and dirty one-way liners. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective when used properly. However, this film is not one of those cases. Take the long scenes without dialogue and gloomy, scarce landscapes. I am sure that they must have some great meaning and insight, because the implied message is embedded in confusion. The acting is poor ... rude and pedestrian ... and it has one of the worst scenes in history (at the end of the movie, if you can sit all the way). The landscape is a gray, and funny long line of girls walking through a barren park is just as pleasant as drawing teeth. I would call this anti-climateist, but as the film was not built in any way, even in "erotic" scenes ... it would be untrue. I'm sure the script was engaged during the shooting, but with the amount of dialogue, I think it may have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this film does not offer anything interesting or amazing ... there is no great story, no stunning insights, no visual drama, no excitement. Except for two or three fun moments, this film is a loss of two hours. Tragically boring and sad movie.
