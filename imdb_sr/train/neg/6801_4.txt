First, I will not tell you why I rented this movie, because I'm still confused ... Air rage is similar to every movie I saw when the plane was abducted. There is, of course, an important person on the plane and a hijacker seeking revenge. The sad thing is that some of the ways to stop hijackers are already used in other films. Do we really become so non-original so fast? Although the Ice-T (which for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at ACTING until it gets busy by placing "c" in front of the tail) that is glorified on the cover, the movie actually plays less than the amazing Kim Oja as a stewardess who is "surprising" OVERLOOKED by five hijackers, which naturally returns to haunt them. As for the rest of the acting team, the only person I managed to recognize is Steve Hitner, better known as Kenni Bania of Seinfeld. I can not forget to leave out your favorite part of the movie, when the abductor used the PLASTIC PLATE to blow up the door ... BRILLIANT. The plot was unnaturally predictable. Script - horrible. He came to the point where I could say something, which I considered a stupid comment, and that would be the next line in the film. Regarding special effects ... the only thing that is special about this movie is that I spent the electricity to work TV and VCR in 100 minutes. The title - DID film takes place in Air. But because of less than star performances, the only rage in the movie was that viewer. So, if you're in a mood to even sing a movie, just because it's bad. SAVE IOURSELF, do not choose this.
