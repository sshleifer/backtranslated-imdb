It's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this movie. But the problem is that it's not very good. There was nothing original in the film, and while the action was well presented, the main heroes were a little shallow, and for none of them you were not tired. Poor photography leaves little to wish, but I suppose you can not expect much from people who are just doing a low-budget movie for him. It is unfair to watch a movie and compare it with other high budget films. But, unfortunately, this is what needs to be done. By itself, it's not very good. Compared with others, it's still not good. But it's not without good sides! I liked the plot. It was built quite nicely and well connected at the end. Sometimes in really dark scenes, he managed to build a terrible feeling. However, in the end, the movie fails to impress. The characters are rather non-existent and we do not care for any of them. Each of them could die, but it is possible to determine the final "survivors" from the very beginning.
