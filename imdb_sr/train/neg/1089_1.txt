What about Robert "Pretentious" Altman? Did he save on lighting? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was funny. I mean, have you ever seen a law office where everyone works with candlelight? Do not waste your time. In fact, do not waste time with what Altman says: it's all pretentious scattering of the movie.
