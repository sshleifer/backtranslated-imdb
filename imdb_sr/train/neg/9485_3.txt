Since others have tried to summarize the plot, I would like to mention a few things about this film. There may be spoilers here; I do not care enough to exclude them. - Given the small budget of the film, the design of the creature was pretty good. It's actually nice to see a horror movie that is transmitted directly to a video that is not covered by a terrible CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of digital films is grain in some places, and is most pronounced in well illuminated white ash halls. time flow. I understand that the director may have been trying to simulate dementia, but to make it effective, it is necessary to establish a time flow. As it is, it looks just amateur. - Pletters were numerous, but consistently predictable. I did not even doubt the identity of the educated cultists, nor the fact that some kind of poor evil trumpets would eventually appear - a good development. - This can look like the characters in this film are not reliably embarking on any common sense. First of all, the regulatory commissions would be in the mental health center that unilaterally declared all deaths of patients and employees caused by heart failure. Why would the chief psychiatrist also be able to perform autopsies? Why is not this drawing an impression of these impressive qualifications, nor is it an introduction to his strange choice of religion? What's the background? What should worry about someone in this? And more importantly, who in the right mind would go through the introduction to that place, see everything that was so terrifying wrong, and then conclude that it is still a nice place to live? This film did not even respect enough of its characters to benefit their intelligence from doubt. Bottom line: Instead, look at Vicker Man.
