I thought he was confused by the "Johnny Cash" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life), and that I changed "Cook" with "Test". Actually, I was not right, he did not change anything, one day, while I watched the TV, I heard that Cartoon Network would be released. What was the action of this show, so I myself began to watch it, and here's my answer: "I want to be I'm back "(because I watched this shit and" My partner in the gym is a monkey.

Do not look at it, make it more productive in half an hour than watch this shit.
