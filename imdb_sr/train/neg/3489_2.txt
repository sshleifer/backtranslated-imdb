This was my first, and probably the last Angelopoulos movie. I was eager to get into it, because on it was Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors, and it was a film Theo, which I heard a lot about. The opening promises, he fired long over a jeep of soldiers across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. Nothing left. The film had great holes and I do not know what to say. The main story of the story is revealed by the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15 minute monologue, killing action and patience of viewers, nothing happens on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, except this old lady telling the story. All that is supposed to be shown through action, the old lady simply said the camera. For a moment, the TV set off towards the bar. Turn for the corner and immediately starts winter! Probably, shot in different days, continuity leaked. Many problems with storytelling, ranging from absurd to irrational, never got stylish, so the viewer asked questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroianni, who got a role that did not have the integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks or Albanians or Balkan people agreed, the films have shown many historical, ethnic or political inaccuracies, only to film the film about "humanity" as red in the second review. Much more to say, but there is no time for losing a poor film, which was not a movie at all, but the folly of the person impressed with the film and paid with state money.
