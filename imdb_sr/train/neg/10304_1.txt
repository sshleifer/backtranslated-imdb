Here, let me wipe my hands over the keyboard, I'll tell you what kind of salad they will order. over and over, works like a charm: he is so genius, how does he do it? my detective shit, freaks if I even go through this show when scanning channels, I have to be very careful (these days it's too often useful, so I do not need to break into such idiotic shit ... cautiously with that remote!) . should this be some kind of fascist propaganda that would force people to believe in some invisible field of ubermanial control and mastery? or what? why does it exist? This is the brightest performance, completely incredible and fanciful, and I can not understand why it's still on the air. so that the geeks can show so much the harder time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give this meaningless omission. shows Firefly (if any) after the season, but mindless things like this, which makes a zero logical sense, just keeps marching. ieccch.
