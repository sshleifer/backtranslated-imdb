This film is a long chic after another. First of all, although they had their share, there is an unjustified drug scene in which Ivan sniffed as an idiot. Wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the old cartoons of Beatle. John is a nasty, envious, homosexual, slave Joki, portrayed as a discredited book by Alberto Goldman. They even hold the title of the song in a regular conversation "there were always just two of us"! Neither would John be so bad about his fans. It's as if our death showed us that it was too good if anything. One funny scene is where stupid fan of Beatle only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Todai. Worthy John says something like that: "Of course, while I'm baking, why do not you go down to your knees, put your wife on the wig, and you lick my lungs." It made me smile for days. Indeed, this film is ridiculous in how seriously it is trying to be while it's ridiculous. John and Paul did not sit on a pontiff all day, they were funny guys with a bright heart, who even broke up during Beatles where there are many more personalities here. Forget.
