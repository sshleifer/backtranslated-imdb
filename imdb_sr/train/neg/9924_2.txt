"Dutch Schultz", also known as Arthur Fleggenheimer, was the right person and his rather nasty life was pretty well documented. This film, which wants to show his life, should have used a fictitious figure, because excessively dramatic events are too great a departure from facts and chronology. And not only that, it neglects some interesting details that included other versions, such as the public relations fiasco in the new state N. and his religious conversion. It is true that Luciano, Lanski, et. al. but it's far away. The scene of an exploding plate representing Luciana who performs Ex Boucing Bo Veinberg in his house, with the help of his mother, is ridiculous. Also, there is a scene in which the Dutch approaches his mother to protect Legs Diamond. It just does not work. And Mrs. Fleggenheimer's face does not work. This film does not require a Jewish mother to comically make relief. The bold introduction of the Legs Diamond was witty enough. I'm sure a man turns into a grave. And by the way, the Dutch actually killed people personally, but he was not Rambo or 007. The scene where the brewery is being wiped out is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it should be a comedy and I did not understand it.
