It was disappointing to see this DVD after so many years. For me the main problem is an uneven script. While some of them are funny and hip, much of it is boring, immature, and lifeless. Many rubbers just sit there without spark and energy. From the actors, Mae West and Rachel Velch are coming well. Roger Herren is in the role of Rusty Shine (it's a shame that he did not shoot more films). But for my money, there are too many John Huston, and the poor Rex Reed is hard to give a chance to fight. His character seems to have been pronounced to move aside, wondering what he is doing in this movie. Vidal's original has provided a lot of potential that is quite futile. Not even "classic" movie clips have done much. All in all, it's a pretty under-effort, and it's not likely that it will be much better over time.
