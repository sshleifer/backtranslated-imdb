I do not know why I took the time to watch this film about the loss of time. If you keep that long enough in the hope of getting a satisfactory conclusion? good, bad or surprising ?? do not. Finally, it arises after a rigid, formative, predictable dialogue and acting. Closed scenes are so brightly lit that you think the camera is zoomed out a millimeter away to see the lights on the clasp. Costumes, hairstyles and sets are sharpened, pressed and impeccable. Should we imagine that ordinary people really lived so early in the 20th century in Arizona? Other comparisons with Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: at least that director ruined his violence in the context of chaos and disorder. HARD MEN is a worthless exploding cookie from wooden imitations of bad guys with manicured nails. Huh?!? I can believe that Heston thought he might have done something worth the film. (Creates a pistol in cold fingers.) But Coburn? I will never guess why he applied for this travesty. Would you like to see the film about the end of the West as we knew it, the end of the West as we knew them? Look again at SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN. LAST NIGHT is a whipping a westerner's necrologist.
