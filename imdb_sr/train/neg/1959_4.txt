Tooth Fairi is about the spirit of an old deformed witch who takes children to her house to receive a reward for their loose tooth, and then takes their life away. In the first few minutes he introduces you to the beginning of the legend about the tooth of a tooth from 1949, and then goes on to this day. The exhausted action of the horror is largely saved from a solid acting. They could have been without Hammond Brothers and several other scenes, but overall, the scenes were bloody, but quickly they had the effect of minimizing. Colored candy is pretty good for both sexes. Working with cameras is good. The dialogue is just but rude. I expected the movie to be bare bones, low budget, slasher with very few factors that they are buying. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
