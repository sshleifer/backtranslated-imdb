This film is a traditional Bollywood offering, as for the stars, sentimentality and love triangles of emotions. What really disturbed me in this movie was the absurd notion of a surrogate mother. A blather that imagines a child with someone after having sex with a man (a family who wants a child) is not a surrogate mother. Neither is a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I've seen Indian films and television shows that have been dealing with this issue more intelligently between 10 and 15 years ago. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and absolutely incredible. I realize that most Bollywood films are not meant to be acceptable, but they do not pretend they are. This film wants to broadcast emotions together with characters, but this can not be done with such a ridiculous, fictional conflict. I would expect better than Abbas and Mustang.
