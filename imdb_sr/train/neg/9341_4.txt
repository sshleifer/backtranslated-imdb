This short comedy, Hal Roach, A Tough Vinter, is ninety-nine in the series "Our Gang / Little Bandits" and the eleventh talkie. Just like a showcase for the black strip Stepin Fetchit, who gets a special account here, we see him go to his barrack where the gang stops. Farina returns a love letter from him, and Stepin tells him to read him because he can not read it during the day while going to the NIGHT school. It happens that from his soul in Tennessee, now Farina must have his ears filled with cotton, because it's too hot to hear him! In another room, Veezer transmits instructions to Marie Ann to make a radio radio, but because she keeps running back and forth in the kitchen, she misses the lady's item of the lady's spiker to rice pudding and Spanish tamale puzzling Marie Ann with additions to Tabasco and Luke! After the fabrication has been completed, Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with a terrible tasting, but very sticky substance, as the result is all stuck on the walls. While everyone is trying to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement of various pipes and electrical outlets that interfere with the functions of various devices such as the vacuuming phone, the ringing ring and the refrigerator that plays music! The end. What I just described, points to the winding nature of this short film, "Our Band", which served as a pilot for the short series of films, Stepin Fetchit. It's also so good that it never happened, because Fetchit's characterization of lazy black was fun only in small doses and today would be considered very offensive. Many of the scenes I just described are good for some laugh, although the final sequence was so confusing that the results were too blah for me. So, briefly, Heavy winter is a curiosity worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
