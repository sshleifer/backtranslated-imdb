OK, showing stereotyped 'Indians' in this story is simply FAIL. I agree that Elvis looks pretty good here, but yes, his skin color seems to change during the film. I was thinking, OK, ... he was never in real life. It's one of the most obvious brown 'Indian' makeup I've ever seen. They are as bad as the 'Indians' at 'F-Troop' and the old Hollywood Westerns played by Jewish and Italian American actors, not real Indians! stories and central songs, as in all Elvis's later films. He just did them because Colonel Parker linked him to long-term film contacts to push as much money out of Elvis! I'm constantly thinking "thank God" that Elvis stopped filming forever shortly after this film came out. Cool to see actors Joan Blondella, Kati Jurado, L.K. Jones, Henri Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie. The 'Indian' Burgess Meredith is absolutely AVFUL. That's the worst of the crowd for sure. What did the film authors mean? Did Mr. Meredith do this for money or just what? Still I love some Elvis movies. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. I can even watch his film with future television actors Marie Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, 'Change Of Habit' in which Elvis plays an internal city doctor. Oh well, at least Elvis Several good films have been made, but central and bad people overwhelm decent and good ones. I always will love ELVIS! Thank you, thank you very much!
