Disney did not yet know a movie that could not make at least two sequels. And this was no exception for people in Disney to give a bad story to get a quick reward. Somehow, although I did not pay to look at it, I feel cheap looking at him. Ariel was now grown up and had a daughter. However, she does not allow her daughter to go to the sea because of some sloppy threat of the sister of the deceased witches. Here we are again. The daughter is cheated (of course) and helps the witch. After a not-so-famous battle, it is defeated, and sirens and people live in harmony. Iavn. There is nothing to look at here. Go back to your life. "D-"
