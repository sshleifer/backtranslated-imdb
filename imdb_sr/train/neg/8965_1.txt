This is a rather low budget, made for TV, a type of film that wants to take advantage of the success of the original. I am a fan of b-films, and this may have been good not to add the name "Cube" because, as the director and plot of the originals were better, this film only destroyed my taste for the whole series. The characters are boring and clich√©s, there are problems with continuity, and several direct productions. The story hardly gets a chance to develop due to excessive dialogue and suffer from it. They more or less use the same horror tricks over and over the film, and since the former was so good, it simply turned out to be a disappointment. If this was a standalone movie, I probably would have given it about four. The "1" rating I gave was a pretty big statement about how it completely faded into the effects and intelligence compared to the first.
