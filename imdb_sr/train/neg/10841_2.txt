It was all that was not: it had a pace, pop, and actors who were not afraid to chew a scene. He had a decent script. This guy scratched my head. If Farrah is not really "serious" about his career, why does he have a manager (and why he's wasting time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists", why are they applying for "The Mothers of All Jokes" (such as "Brady Bunch" where Robert Reed wants to work on Shakespeare, just to be on BB)? They were not industrial names, but they were not even hungry. And while they got the right to a story (the poster was released before Farrah got the show), Silverman dropped a piece for "The Most Entertaining Home Videos" and "American Idol", and Spelling promising to his girlfriend Tori someday, he will obviously make it the show did not happen. What bothered me was that Spelling's role was distorted. He is portrayed as a runner and creator when he was not one of them. And how he "came" with the "idea" for CA was ridiculous! How were Spelling and Goldberg allowed to implement Farrah's oral contract when others signed it? And why did Farrah and Bernstein not tell them to leave because they did not reveal their Inner Div, but because the Majors wanted it? Therefore, when she tries to create conflict and tension by placing Farrah as a "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), that does not work because the foundation has never passed - that's where the "Three Companies" delivered the picture.
