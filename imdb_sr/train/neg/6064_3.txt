Good good good. As good as John Carpenter season 1 in "Masters of Horror" was, it's a complete contradiction. He certainly showed that he is still a master of horror with "cigarette burns", but "Pro-Life" is perhaps the worst I've ever seen from him. It's stupid, completely devoid of dreadful atmosphere and tension and it stops being welcomed, despite less than an hour of running. The scenario is nonsense, the characters are irritable and uncomfortable, and the conclusion is beyond the absurdity. And for those who actually bought a DVD (one of them I myself); Did you see how Carpenter describes a movie? He is proud of it and talks about it as his best work for a long time, and praises the script. And on the commentary, where he noticed the apparent confusion that came to the final cut, he merely says he did not think it necessary to correct the mistake and he just let it be there. I'm afraid the old master completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope that I turned out to be wrong. I want to leave a positive note and note that the effects of the creatures are terrible. Technically speaking, this film is top-notch, with effective lighting schemes and compensation effects.
