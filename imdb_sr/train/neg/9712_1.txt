This film is one of the fiercest distorted histories of history. Terribly inaccurate, this film does nothing to honor hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American, and autochthonous poisoned workers who were killed by Sadistic Japanese and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built "through the body of a white man," as the chief Japanese engineer said. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors that Japanese jailers made the source of the film, where the bridge is, are not even close to precision to the bridge itself. The bridge itself is made of steel and concrete, not wood. What about survivors who are still alive? He hates a movie and everything he's supposed to present. Their friends hungered, tortured and killed cruel sadists. Those who have not died of dizziness, starvation or illness are deeply hurt by a film that creates such a light of their dark times.
