I was very excited about this film when I first saw the shows. I usually see that this review is good and I buy a movie completely. Something told me to ... first look. Nice to meet you. Keira Knightlei destroyed all future films with this role. In the 2nd Pirate movie, when I left, I went to see him. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more because of that. I think it had to do with her hair and it should have been shortened for Domino. Domino Who? Who's Domino Harvei? I still do not even care. I do not know who she was in real life or who she was in this movie. I did not care about her character, and even Keira, who won a special goal, was not worth the movie. The course was definitely missing. Writing was rough and shallow. Editing was terrible. I do not mind the style as bad as it is. There's room for it. Good examples of excited, MTV-style, colorful editing (not sure if there's an official name) would be the Club of Fighters; I'm just at the top of my head. Even the enemy of the state had a somewhat similar style of editing. It was used deliciously and was not used as a crutches. I mean, it's the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Toni Scott, please, give me back my time. I understand that there are many people who liked this movie. I suppose the idea that you will either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair estimate. Honestly, I hate it.
