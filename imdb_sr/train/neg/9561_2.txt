Like many others who commented here, I must say that this film is bad, but not the worst I've ever seen. There will be no direct references to the film scenes or sequences in this comment, because I hate the spoiler. I have the feeling that I watched an episode of a TV show or something, where they kept some extra $$$ to spend on CGI (I saw it worse than that) ... All in all, it's pretty insult to the viewer, at least if you have ANY knowledge of computers and / or technology in general. There are too many moments of insult to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself just asking that everything be done - quickly - halfway. In addition, there are countless "simple outputs" of scenarios, which are also an insult to your intelligence as a human being thinking ... This movie absolutely fades with the old "Vargames", and I think it's the damage that even calls him a sequel. Two stars from me, just for one thing and one thing: acting performances are not half-bad, given the exhausted shit of the scenarios with which they had to work. However, they should never have applied for this film. Not a career, but I guess we all have billing accounts. For those of you who have given this best movie ... you have to be on the studio payroll or something, that's my only explanation. Everyone who did not see this: be sure to look and invent your mind. But lower your expectations to the floor (and then some).
