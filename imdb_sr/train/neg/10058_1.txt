I was fascinated by the fact that this film is really bad. Did the viewer need to learn something or think about something? What about the pumpkins? Should I be impressed with motel recordings? Is it important that there is a waste bag on the roof across the hotel? Why is the storyteller unsuccessful in hurting people interviewed (it is so obvious that he edited really informative parts of his interviews to make a mistake). The best part of the film was an interview with a film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be before it is over. I'm really amazed. I believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or trying to impress the intellectual community.
