The old axiom that boring people are boring people is well represented in "Women in Love." Scenario taken from novel D. H. Lavrence, contains the infinite flow of concepts that are, at best, Sovereign. What is the damage that has put so much effort into such an empty exercise; what kind of empty character column gives such attention. Despite high productive values, this film appears as boring as its staff. The review in 2001 only confirms the impression of juvenile minds in adult bodies from 1969, the lack of tolerance anywhere, and the loading of every step of the way.
