This film was so bad that I could not sit through it without doing something else. It was not complicated and it does not make sense. I was thoroughly annoying for a film about a stand up comedian, I could not remember any jokes or ridiculous lines of valuable descriptions. Politicians without technical jargon who do not speak charisma can not be less fun. So how is it made? Does the film have no quality control? Watching girls in bikinis was the only disadvantage during this terrible experience. It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who became popular and appeared in fine comedies, managed to survive after this type of exposure. In this film he was not at all ridiculous, and this proves that writing is so important in effective comedy.
