I love Seth Green. His performances in the show THAT 70s' is always worth watching, but last night I felt the need for overhaul. Four young lads inherit an apartment in New York for which most of us would die. Grandma must have been an heir who had such a place at all. So I felt the need for realism. In any case, the plot of the four best friends who got this apartment was not convincing. I would be thrilled if they had to relocate to one of their parents, which would provide great humor and dysfunctionality regarding the setting of the show. It does not appear to be much humor in him. I'm watching it just because it falls before My name Earl is on Thursday night's win. I think they should return, to wipe this series and start over. We need more family series. How would Set and his friends move with his wandering parents into the suburbs after the fire burns them up? They could play Dabnea Coleman with her father and Christine Estabrook, to play mother and dysfunctional siblings. A list of options with someone like Seth Green is endless and the network is letting it go.
