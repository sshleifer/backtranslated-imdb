Warning: Avoid this awesome stupid movie ... if you watched it, you were disappointed with SOOOOOOOOO. Trying SO HARD to be young innocent and sexy, I just do not WORK ALL. Pam and Denise are so terrible in this movie. Plus The script is absolutely cruel, I can not believe that someone could come up with such shitty ideas. With the development of the film industry, film lovers are not as easy to satisfy as in the last century. I bet that those who watch movies from the last century will hate this too. Get out of it. I think I'm looking at the "Vhite Chicks" from 2004. It's much better that this ... not be mistaken at the time, I thought it was the worst movie I ever saw.
