This film was so funny that I never finished watching it, actually I thought someone made his own version and called it to a DVD from the movie store. This movie tortured me not because it was bloody, but because I spent 50 on it! It seems that my brother and I went to the house and made a movie and arranged snapshots in the slaughterhouses! So I'm typed, even BTK Killer deserves more credit than it does not even accurately think that the cow's head is obviously made from a toy test or BUBBLE GUM OMG can not even say everything to explain it DO NOT VATCH THIS MOVIE !!! !!!!
