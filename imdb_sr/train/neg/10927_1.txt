Reviews for this film were at least hot, while expectations were high: a big budget, a ton of popular faces, a pretty funny idea and the main actress that everyone likes. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblai's supposedly funny journey in the fantasy world fails in every way to entertain her audience (I have not heard a single laugh during the entire presentation), passing through that page a thin story and one-dimensional characters without one spark, not a sign of the magic he desired. 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction, and some good actors tend to be professionals in features that definitely can not look like such a good idea on the set, let alone on paper. 'L'Odissee d'Alice Tremblai' is a comic comic comedy connected with a (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoidance or boredom will persecute you.
