I saw this film in my international class and I was pile up. This film is nothing but a scene of shining shocking value after the next. She meets a woman named Christine when she lectures at a local book club and decides to stay with her only when she finds out how much her boyfriend is attractive. To be clearer, Reve loves the Dutch sausage. So, Reve invents a plan to seduce Kristina's boyfriend to end up having sex with him. But later she discovered that Christine had 3 previous husbands, who killed her all. Now Reve and Christine's boy can be "the 4th man." The story makes sense without a cavity. Editing and everything else that is technically about this movie is perfectly fine. The film is just rude and I felt the need for vomiting in some parts. Basically, this is not my cup of tea. The film opens when Reve comes out of bed only the T-shirt. So at the very beginning you can see Reve's beautiful dick walking around while walking around his cramped apartment in a hangover state. Later he dreamed that his dick cut off the scissors, and they show it along with the blood fountain that follows. Reve caresses the statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in the mausoleum. Plus, a lot of blood. More blood than all Freddy Krueger films combined. It's not that I have nothing against "shocking" scenes, but this film is so obvious when it comes to shocking. The whole film revolves around the value of shock. So, if any of this is your glass, take a look at this movie. Otherwise, stay away from this one. My mind is still a scar.
