This sweet connection of the new age of the Age of Age and the strange bad creation of the movie may not "open you", borrow one of the favorite movie verbs, but this can leave your fork loosened, and the stomach is sick of laughter or vomiting. Based on James Redfield's best-selling book, the first (only) published in 1993, this horn of kitschy abundance follows the spiritual awakening of the American history teacher (Matthews Settle) who, traveling in the deepest, darkest, most beautiful Peru and sniffing air or something else illegal. Namely, what he discovered is that Shangri La is inhabited by smiling zombies that may be crazy or just medicated, perhaps because they are often accompanied by blossoming panpipes and occasional yelling from heavenly chorus. Although much talked about "energy", this quality is explicitly lacking in the bouquet of numbers including Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnov, who are now firmly located in the camp. For those who care, the plot includes the army, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni has provided an unsuitable route while g. Redfield, Barnet Bain, and Dan Gordon wrote a scenario gun. In short, it's easily the worst movie seen in 40 years of watching movies.
