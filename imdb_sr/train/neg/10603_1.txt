I tried to watch this movie twice, and I did not manage to come to the end twice. For the first time I managed to sit through the first fight and lost interest. The second time I managed to force myself to save more than an hour of worthwhile acting, lame SFKS, and extremely bad directions. Pales compared to the original. Has anyone heard of the old ET Atari 2600 Fiasco? For those who did not let me fill you. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest boxers of all time ... Atari decides to publish a movie game on its 2600 home console system. In order to shorten the long and financially painful story, the game collapsed and resulted in thousands and thousands of Atari 2600 ET games that would be thrown to landfills because they could not even give them, let alone sell them. What is a universal soldier: The return has to do with this story? See the rating 3.2 and understand yourself. Terrible movie ... IMDb made me give him 1 out of 10 because their rating systems do not go as low as 0, let alone in negatives.
