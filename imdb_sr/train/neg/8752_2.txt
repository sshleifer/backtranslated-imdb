I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's too late then I'm pretty much forgiving movies. Although I tried, I could not stand this movie at all, it worsened and worsened as the film continued. Although I know it should be a comedy, but it was not very funny to me. It was also a particularly unrealistic and exhaustive presentation of rural life. In case that is what one of you thinks is life in the country, it definitely is not. I must agree that some of the actors were sweet, but the French guy was really a fake. I have to agree that he tried to have a good lesson in the story, but generally my recommendation is that nobody is looking for more than 8 years, it's just too boring.
