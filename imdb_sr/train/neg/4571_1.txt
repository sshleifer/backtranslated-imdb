What we know is bleep is a misleading and random view of the mysteries of the universe. It is a parade of obvious experts (none of whom is nominated) who preach and pontificize in a totally unscientific way. Their interviews are chopped into aggravating small segments and dispersed by some humorous cgi and banal mini-plots. , and then somehow extracts several prose and absurd conclusions. We believe that quantum physics tells us about the purpose of our existence, and any other difficultly responsible question that the authors of the film would like to point to with their fingers. non-sequitures. How did we begin with quantum mechanics and ended with this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying "two plus two equal four, so that they can move objects with their minds." In this film there is nothing original and almost nothing that is true. Any discriminating viewer will be disturbed by rude editing, intrusive and meaningless special effects, and general lack of content. Educated viewers will be frustrated with tears over the violence done to science and every other object that this film is touching.
