Doris Dai never let her down. Even in the most difficult circumstances, Dan gives 100% and usually goes unharmed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by the actual blackout in New York from 1965, but actually adapted from the French drama Claude Magnier from the late '50s, gives Doris a little bit to do, but she bumped her good image in the second half, be comedy Sedated (which is fun because of the day on which the pivot is given to the situation). There are several funny lines here, but the stagnation of the material is obviously transferred from the play ... and instead of imagining some fun incidents in the Big Apple, we are stuck in the suburbs. Doris' co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terri-Thomas) are not very suitable for her, and not the formless hairstyle they wear. However, this is not terrible, there are several big laughs, and for daytime lovers it is an inevitable place. ** from the ****
