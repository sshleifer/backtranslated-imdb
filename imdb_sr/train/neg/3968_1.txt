If you've ever seen a Brian Avenet-Bradley movie and compare it with the feedback it gets on the IMDb, you know that most of the comments and voices are fake. HAPPY ME: you will be bored! People of the production team write their own feedback (sometimes they even recognize it). But that's not enough: and they constantly click "no" whenever there is a negative comment on the movie. That's why negative critics are always behind the cramped. The film itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad ending. Trust me now! If not, you will trust me later! Brian Avenet-Bradley could be a good business man. Otherwise, it can not be explained that he finds people who still finance his films. (Ok, they're cheap, but still.) But as a creative person, he's a complete failure.
