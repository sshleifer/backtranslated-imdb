I rented this on a DVD without previous knowledge. I was suspicious when I saw Michael Madsen who appeared in a movie I never heard, but it was a freebie, so why not look at it. Forget that he has ever participated in such a shame film. Obviously, if your scenario and dialogues are terrible, even good actors can not save the day. Not to mention amateur actors who flood this movie. Too many speakers who do not belong to the English language play parts of original English speakers, reading lines from a script that should have been rejected and not recorded in a movie. It's amazing how all the lines in the movie are incredible. The music is terrible and completely inaccurate, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a bad school game. I recommend that you watch it only to appreciate other, better, movies. That's why I gave 3 instead of 1 who deserves it.
