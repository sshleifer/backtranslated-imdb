I really have no idea why some people consider a TV show of powerful rangers even interesting at all. The costumes are completely funny and the people playing in them look totally stupid at the same time. It was absolutely interesting for the powerful. This is just a television commercial with higher prices designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to children no doubt around the world. From the notes I see that it is banned in the land of New Zealand and from what I have seen, I can agree with their decision. Avoid this show at any cost, it's horrible and funny.
