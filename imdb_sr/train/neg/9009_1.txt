What a horrible movie! For some reason, scientific laboratories and offices always have the staff of dirty, dirty, subdued, misanthropic people living inside. These people who probably work together on complicated scientific projects can not agree on how to survive the death of the CGI Dragon. Spoilers: An extra-nasty scientist whose main acting skill is "leering" and "evil vision" was cloned by the Dragon. While the lab was supposed to work on such things, other scientists were shocked because they were obviously far behind in their experiments and were caught with lowered pants. The rest of the story is like a thing, or ten little Indians, where staff are hunted and killed while trying to formulate a way to escape and / or win the "dragon". The CGI Dragon creature is dark gray, which looks like a popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. It hardly looks better than a cartoon, and dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the Dragon. It looks like a gray stain. The acting is less than terrible. These scientists behave like a bunch of children who can not agree on anything, and it makes it easy for the Dragon to kill them in various attempts to escape, hide, and so on. This movie. It looks like it descends to the level of its support. This film is really, really horrible. The acting is bad. The story is stupid. CGI is very cheap and amateur. There is nothing praiseworthy in this movie, it's not even a good killer of time to watch while doing housework or other jobs.
