I really did not like this movie. The action was very predictable. A typical American plot, I'm sorry. In the end, the girl gets a girlfriend. And London has Monorail? Bank of London ??? Bank of England is what really is! - I still liked the look of Traci Island and Thunderbird. And the British were bad? (except Parker and Lady Penelope) What was that? Oh and they continued to say things like "Here's Thunderbirds" - but it was never known as "Thunderbirds" in the series, why not? I'd like to repeat this in 20 years with more British actors. I loved the original series more. Sorry!
