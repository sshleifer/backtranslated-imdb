The film had a lot of potential, unfortunately, broke down due to a bad / incredible story, misrepresentation and a general lack of content / content. One of the obvious drawbacks was the fact that Sean Conneri, who played Arabian, did not know how to utter his own Arabic name! This may look like a tiny drawback, but it indicates a lack of effort to pay attention to detail. The quality of the operation was just as far below the average. Film lonely rescue grace was a plant at the very end; and the French song (I do not remember the title). All in all, it was a pretty bad movie in which Sean Conneri was visibly wrong.
