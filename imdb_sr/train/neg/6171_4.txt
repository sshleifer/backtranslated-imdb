Okay. This was not a surprise. Many will tell you this is bloody. but they all say "shizz", this film is very slow. Begins with some guy who makes a fiction that he does not feel the pain he calls "my son" has some bloody scenes, but I found them as weak. you can skip the 40 minute film and get to the scene of the eyeball, which was surprisingly impressive and painful. there are some really stupid scenes in this. and skip the hits and shamars with the stupid false sound that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. Keep watching hounds. Take a look at this if you want a similar 20-10 minute scene that is still not amazing and has a random scene of a guy trying to rape his mom .. that's weird.
