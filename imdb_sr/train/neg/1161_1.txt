As a member of the acting team, I was a member of the band in all basketball matches, I would like the world to know after it was in the film, that we are not allowed to see it because it is banned in Oregon. This was because the producers and director violated a contract with the University of Oregon where it was filmed. The symbol U of O appears to be displayed. While shooting, we were allowed to eat several meals with actors and production staff. Mr. Nicholson was quite memorable by being one of the most unpleasant men I've ever met. Pretty time for young people of 20 years. It is certainly not what life in the campus was like in the late 60s and early 70s, despite Hollivood perhaps thinking. Trombonist from Oregon
