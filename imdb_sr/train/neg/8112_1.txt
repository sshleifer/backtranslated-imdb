Hanna-Barbera sucks out life from other famous property. Violence is diluted, stories are formal, animation is bad, music is disgusting and repetitive, and frankly speaking, the show is not funny. At the time, HB its series through the same clich√© situation, whether they fit into the cartel world or not. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear in a segment that repeats itself as cave people ("Hei! Popeie is popular, and Flintstones are popular. Put them together, and you can not miss it!"). Likewise, in the obvious ripou of "private Benjamin", Olive Oil and Goon have a regular segment that characterizes them as new soldiers. Seriously! Why? Adding harassment factors is public notifications in each episode (standard cartoon practice, but still boring). Popeie surrenders to his nephews on the safe crossing of the street, recycling, and - are you ready for this? - Dangers of Smoking! (I swear I'm not making it up.) The only remaining charm from original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, Popeye's voice from the early days, continues this role. It's important to check it only once to get a new estimate for old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
