All you need to know about this movie is going on in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack that reflects the period of the late 60's, and all of its characters are, apart from a few characters, unacceptable. When you receive this message, you can also switch to another movie. Davies's protagonist ignores his beautiful girl, one of the few people in her life who cares about him. Then, by the time she is advised to join her in the real world - instead of living a fantasy film about whom he is imagined director - he does it by pushing aside and matching with the actress who idealizes for reasonable reasons. A couple of laughter and an imaginary artistic direction are the only things worth seeing here. The film is also interesting as the documentation of the fall of Jason Schwarzman from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwarzman's boring play is something to be overcome, but here is just his character. Schwarzman's family ties clearly brought him into this role; I hope that his elections will improve.
