The intention of Beattia's director to convert Chester Gould's famous comic strip into a live action cartoon (with Beatty's actor as a square-jet detective) had sweet announcements of innocent nostalgia-quite unusual and intriguing by Warren Beattie. Unfortunately, painting is a necessary ham, fun for a while, but ultimately tired. Dick Tracy tries to overthrow the Big Boi Caprice mobster, with the help of Tess Trueheart's love, but he stumbled across the evil breath of Mahonea. The first half an hour of orchestral directing and set designs are wonderful for absorbing, but as the action of the cross is predictable (without the right stitch in writing), things begin to harden. Al Pacino was surprised Supporting Oscar nomination as Bad Boy Caprice, and Madonna (mostly used as a decorative advertisement) singing Stephena Sondheim "Sooner or Later (I Alvais Get Mi Man)", which awarded the Best Original Song. A lot of hearts, thanks to Beattie - who was devoted to his vision - but the picture is too cold and calculated. He misses his heat. * 1/2 of ****
