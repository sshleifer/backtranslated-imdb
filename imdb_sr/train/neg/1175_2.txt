Much has been done from Rohmer's use of digital technology to "fill" the background. Sometimes it's good, the scene in which Grace and her maid is distant from the king's execution is particularly striking. On other occasions, the movie gives an unusual amateur look, similar to a home video. However, the main flaw is that the ordinary art of the table of one scene creates a retaliatory effect in the viewer. We know that what we're watching is not real, so how can we feel for the characters? To be honest, I did not care what happened to the Lady or the Duke. Another big flaw, I'm sorry I have to say, is the performance of Luke Russell in the leading role. It is practically in every scene, and the success or film of the film rests on her performance. OK speaks foreign language, but is not able to express real emotions. Her emotions in the scene where her friend Mme de Meiler persuaded her (a great debut feature by Helena Dubiel), looking at her head on the pillar, caused unpleasant laughter in the audience. Also, watch her hands expressing emotions! All in all, a very disappointing film, especially given the positive reviews on this site.
