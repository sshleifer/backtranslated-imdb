This film is known for three reasons. First, apparently capitalizing the success of the two "Superman" series, this low-budget feature was created and published in theaters, marking George Reeves and Phillis Coates. Initial performances like Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. The opening part is reused in the series. Beyond the city of Silba, a deep oil well of six mile long penetrates the 'Hollow Earth' allowing 'Mole-Men' to come to the surface. Forget other holes (those in a plot). Second, unlike most films from the SF invasion in the 1950s, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) power in preaching and applying tolerance and accepting diversity. against a bunch of segregation vigilants. There is no "mild journalist" here! Clark Kent, a connoisseur and self-confidence, keeps checking the situation all the time ("I'll take care of this!"), Even helping in a hospital dress to remove a bullet from Mole Man! As Superman, he is climbed more than Clark to lively Lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he fights against a vigilant as "Nazi soldiers". Thirdly, you will notice that moving from a cartoon about Fleisher, who flew Superman in two series, to 'live action' flying to 'Adventures of Superman' has not yet been made.
