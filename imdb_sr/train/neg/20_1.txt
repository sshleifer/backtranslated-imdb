This film was terrible. At first I only read the summary of the action and it looked OK, so I looked at it. The acting was TERRIBLE. It was as though the actor was almost shy. everything seemed fake. I feel bad about Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago .. I watched him at least 20 times .... The plot was also shit. writers were probably sleeping deprived when they reached the lines. On the plus side, it's a good kind of bad movie. the one you are constantly watching just to see how much it will be the worst, so you can later tell other people that you can not believe that the movie was horrible. I think everyone should watch this, so that we can then appreciate better other, REAL, movies.
