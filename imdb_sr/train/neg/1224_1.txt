Who in his healthy mind does something as stupid as this movie? Accidental killer guards ... characters that are so two-dimensional that the two-year-old could draw ... better ... Red box with death tools? Please ... Hypothermic weak dumbbells ... Working from hell ... Stylishly this movie moves between teen comedy , trilera, voyeurism and ... a woman ... (uhm) Rambo? It's incredible and it's an insult to any thinking person. Do not look, go away, it's more terrible than you can imagine ... And, above all, everything is trying to be hip by being too graphic in your violence ... <br /> < Ms. Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and fun, this is just pathetic and horrible. Good luck next time. :-(
