In a way, the concept of a story was a rather interesting combination of several typical types of films in an interesting combination. However, no sense in this film was so obvious that it did not deserve long-lasting close-ups. I felt like I was beaten on my head by the so-called mysterious explanation for killing the disease. It seems that the writer simply raised clich√©s from other films as a substitute for custom lines of writing to actual characters. The actors did not help important. No chemistry. I suppose they should have developed some sort of attraction, even if only because it is an essential element of these stories. However, the writers did not much work on the development of chemistry. Of course, both are attractive, but whether they are appealing to each other, it seems to be an open question. The trust of Turner's character in Sabato is developing too fast and without special reason. Sabat's character should be a discredited doctor who simply can not play by rules. Imagine the character of Jeff Goldblum in the "Independence Day". Usually, such a figure should show some kind of talent or gloss. Sabath's character is not. He is Cassandra with just crazy and all the prophetic skills of the magic eight. It seems to be a random case. The death scenes are comic. Every actor really tried more than a little to show the agony that was inflicted on them. Symptoms looked like a bad climate, somehow like that 80s video, Peter Gabriel, I think.
