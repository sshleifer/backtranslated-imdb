Maybe I saw the movies above this, but if I have them, I do not remember. Or maybe they blocked them. Who knows, if I undergo hypnotherapy, I might remember them, together, perhaps with the kidnapping of aliens as a child or other trauma. If so, I would love to exchange those memories for those I have to watch this movie. I should give the movie a little credit: it produced an emotional response. In fact, I began to be angry at the scenes that were cheating on other films and TV shows, that this travesty was being followed by association. I'm afraid I might not be able to watch movies like Dr Strangelove again, and this film does not go through my mind.
