Has anyone edited this movie? Or was it just a DVD release that had a huge thirty seconds of space between the scenes? It's OK, but I fell asleep looking at him for the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The plot is not really the worst I've ever seen, but it's close. The acting is not the worst I've seen ... but it's close. Production .... well, I can honestly say that it was the worst I've ever seen in my life! Not trying to be defiant, but Unhinged could use another production. Please, do not think I hate movies horror, or even I have not enjoyed this movie. I felt much more than laughing at the film than I felt along with him. The angry moments were not too badly made, but they could have been better made even with a small budget. I would recommend that this film is not used. 1/10
