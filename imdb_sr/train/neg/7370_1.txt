I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and although most are not great, or even good, this full bunch has dropped a bar for bad movies. Zaplet: nije sigurno. Something about drugs that makes you crazy and strong or something like that. Who are the good guys and the bad guys? It's hard to say. Most of the film is a crop of scenes that take place between people in darkly lit rooms complaining of a good sign of the Seagals "Mashall". ,,,,,, What about the horrible voice that is covered?! Did they find someone who sounded less like Seagal? Cheech or Chong could have made voices, maybe at least fun then. This film is boring and totally stupid. Avoid it at any cost !!!!
