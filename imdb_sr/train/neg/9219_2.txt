I did not even know that it was originally made a television movie when I saw it, but I assumed it was time. It has the same exhausted colors, mild characters and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the '80s, plus a "social platform" practically screaming "Afterschool special". Anihoo. Rona Jaffe (Thanks) Mazes and Monsters were made at the peak of Dungeons & Dragons, a pencil and paper RPG that took the hearts of millions of nerds across America. I consider myself one of the said geeks, I have never played D & D, I have especially dealt with one of his brothers. M & M was also made at the height of D & D's biggest controversy-that it was so amazing that people could lose touch with reality, worshiping Satan without knowledge, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at some point, if it is extremely rare - but this film appears in a terrible way. a little further from worldly life. Except the M & M presentation is more boring than their earthly lives. None of the game's attractiveness was presented here - and Jai Jai's request that M & M be transferred to the 'real world' is coming from nowhere. It's just an excuse to get one of the characters out of nothing, although we do not care at that moment. Jai Jai, Robbie, Kate and Daniel should be different - but all are rich VASPi complaints that have problems that nobody actually has. But things are only continuing, they are deteriorating in many ways. . Low budget is terribly clear, (I love sign 'Entry' and cutout of cartons in prohibited caves). hilarious. Tom Hanks "Jai Jai, what am I doing here?" I laughed a few minutes. Definitely the lowest point in his career. Do not look at it like on convincing satire, just to the funny piece of television garbage from the 80's, and you'll still have a good time. That is, if you can stay awake. Most are boring, but all pay off for the breakdown of Pardua at the end. At least, Tom Hanks got better. Not that he could go much worse than here.
