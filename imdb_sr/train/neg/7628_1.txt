Black and white film. Good photo. Believable characters. Just terrible. I spent another perfect evening watching a movie that was rated by others as "worthy" and "very good". There is good behavior here, and the background to the plot is good (it was necessary to do more), but it is very slow to grow and never develop. It is a complete basis for sex without much romance with much needed nudity. More could be done with the main characters. If you're looking for something you could watch with your family, this is not in the movie, and if not, you will have difficulty navigating through it. Although this film is only about 1 inch long!
