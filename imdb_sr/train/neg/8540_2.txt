As someone else has mentioned, it begins with a bizarre prologue about the little blue girl who kills a cat. Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) accidentally meet and travel to the mountains. First spend the night in a restaurant where Gafari is delighted with increasing public irritation. Once in the mountains, they again seek shelter and are invited by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?). t. Now, I love Eurohorror, and it would be better if Artigot (writer and director) made an attempt to logically tell stories. Background (Pyrenees?) It makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult phenomena. Green peaks could easily conceal supernatural powers and those who command them. The photo is good. I just want everything to make sense. You can watch the movie on archive.org.
