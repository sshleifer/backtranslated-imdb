Somewhere I read that Hollivood should focus on transforming bad films and leaving the classics alone. We can only hope. Although this remake was not a total loss, I would still like to have $ 6 to go back to DVD originals. A lot of violence and one of the worst endings I've ever seen. This version does not add anything new. She only repeats why Hollivood should leave good things alone.
