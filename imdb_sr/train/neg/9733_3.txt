A fairly poor Firestarter clone that looks more like a bad TV movie than a bad feature film. How disappointing is it that he came from Hooper and Dourif! State performers are doing a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. A boy born in a pair of experiments is constantly having a fever of 100 degrees, and when it's age-old, people in his life begin spontaneous combustion. She's trying to find out why. People who are fully ignited have done well, but when they come to the point that they are well-made in another sense, they have obviously been changed into dolls. When the fires of fire emerge from the hands of characters, it looks stupid, not alarming as it should be. Also funny is the fire that obviously travels by phone lines and explodes in huge nozzles from the handset's headphones. How is that supposed to happen, right? Something else that seemed to me stupid in the movie is when the character has the visions of his late parents. Later we see the same recordings from these visions in home movies.
