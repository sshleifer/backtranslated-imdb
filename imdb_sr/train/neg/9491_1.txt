This movie makes you really appreciate finding a fast-forward button on the remote control. It's an extraordinary boredom on beautiful pictures. Once Hamilton goes relatively easily to shots with a soft focus. However, what I hardly understood about the film was that even though Anji Schute was 19 years old when she was filmed, the girls were shown as much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing, especially as far as the older man is concerned, leaves me quite uncomfortable. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area to look even younger than her. Come on, sex is a beautiful past time - between getting adults. Another thing I discovered is that Beart and Schute do not have a naked scene in the movie, so, at least not right.
