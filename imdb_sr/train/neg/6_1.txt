From the very beginning of the film, it gives the feeling that the director is trying to show something, which I want to say that instead of a story that dictates the style in which the movie should be made, he went in the opposite way, the type of movement he wanted to make, and wrote the story to set it up. And he failed in that. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. I think this film is a total loss of time and effort. As a merit of the director, he knows the media he works with, what I'm trying to say is that I've seen the worst movies of this. Here at least the director knows how to maintain continuity in the film. And the actors also gave decent performance.
