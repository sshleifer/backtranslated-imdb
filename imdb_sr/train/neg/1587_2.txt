Perhaps one day TV will be brutal. Maybe Big Brother was just the first step in the direction of Stephen Richard Bachman King who described the end. But enough of it. If I think too much about the serious background of this film, I'm doing exactly what the producers hoped to choose from this material. It's the same with the 6th day. No matter how trivial the movie is, it raises a discussion of its theme, which serves producers as publicity. We will not be captured by it. The social critique suggested by this summary of the action is merely an alibi to enable the production of a speculative, violent film, more for video sales than for a movie. I did not read the book. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King without reading it, but when I saw a movie, I thought I could not make such a horrible movie out of a good book: in the typical eighties, music and several smaller actors, Arnold Schvarzenegger was a policeman who escapes the killers in a cruel TV show. The audience is a cheerleader. Together with the Predator, this is definitely Schwarzenegger's dumbest movie. 2 stars from 10.
