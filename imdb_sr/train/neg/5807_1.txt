Do not even get tired of this movie, it's bad when judged on your own merits, but compared to the original from 1972 (which is a classic) that's bad. And BTV, someone commented that the 1972 movie was bad compared to the book. This is stupid, movies should never be judged by the books from which they were downloaded. These are two completely different art forms (as if it is necessary to emphasize it, but it is obvious that yes). If you would use these criteria for all the films, then "2001" would suck, and so would "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
