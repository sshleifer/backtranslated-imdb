So the usual horror story about a luxury building in Brooklyn that hides the gates in hell. She remembers Polanski's "The Tenant" (published a year before "The sentinel"), but it's too far from the Polish filmmaker's film in any possible aspect. "Stanar" was so disturbing, while "the guard" was not at all. What is surprising about this movie is the acting composition: full of big names of American films (Burguess, Gardner), Vallach), veteran actors are acting for food (I suppose). Judgment: barely fun. My rate: 4/10
