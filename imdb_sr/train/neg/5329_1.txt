As a true fan of Elvis, this film is a total disgrace and the scenario is a disaster. The film opens with a beautiful son, "Stay on," and the landscape of the Grand Canyon gives the viewer hope in something special. Elvis gets in the picture and his talent is futile, especially on the other presented songs. Twice I went through this movie to make sure it's a piece of garbage !!! 1 of 10 !!!
