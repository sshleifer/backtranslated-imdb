OK, do not let my summary deceive you. This film is SUCKS HARD. But the worst movie ever? This film was horrifying in a way that people should not have the brain to describe it. But it is by no means worse than Manos: the hands of destiny, the hobgoblin, the horror of the spiders, or a small number of films. As a preview of the movie's bullshit, it's terrible. Do not see it without MST or you can develop health problems. But there is a worse film.
