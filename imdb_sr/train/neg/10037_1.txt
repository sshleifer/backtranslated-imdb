I never thought that the standard of the Shared movies would ever be degraded to such a degree! The film has a pointless story that is not interested. Saif has exaggerated. Kareena has improved her figure, but she is not a good actress anyway. Akshai is good. Anil is also good. Can I say that the role was not good. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Big part of the cheapness is fulfilled. Just because the last few movies were flops that means that Iashraj movies should make this kind of garbage? He has a history of so many good films. All in all, I was completely disappointed with the film.
