This TV movie shows that there are bad films. The only reason I saw it was that it was covered on KTMA MST3K. Super Bowl at the Superdome at Nev Orleans. However, no football is played and we see that there are basically nothing behind the scenes. With many stars in this film, there was no difference. I really do not know why I was watching this.
