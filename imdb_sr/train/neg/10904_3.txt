I hired this movie with a few laughs, I hope enough to entertain me, but I was very wrong. This film has shown very minimal moments of humor and pathetic jokes have criticized me for shame because I have ever hired them ... Focused on the age group of 10 to 15 years, this film will surely leave viewers beyond those boundaries feeling very unhappy. It's worth no more than 3 votes very undesirable for anyone who does not want to spend 2 hours of his life.
