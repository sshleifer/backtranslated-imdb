It seems that Maria Bello does not care what people think about her choices in film roles. Again she chose a very difficult and unpopular movie in which she could play. Perhaps she needs these movies, to take off from sugar (known as "Hollivood") those who work there and there (Coiote Ugli and of course Mom 3). Although I do not think I can achieve what she wants (I will not spoil it), Maria Bello is as big as in her other independent / small films in which she plays. Movie. This, combined with a strange topic, has almost done a trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to overlook some shortcomings, such as bad rhythm and dramaturgy), the film is still too long
