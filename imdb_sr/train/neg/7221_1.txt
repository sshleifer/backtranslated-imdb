.... CAUSE IT'S CRAP! A movie that makes you want to go and hit the movie creator and say "WHY?" Terrible work with the camera ... the number of times when the camera tries to stay stable on one person and can not. The dialogue is ridiculous. The acting is comical. They seem to have taken the city-spirit to the west to see if they could film the film at the smallest possible amount of money. I would put $ 10 to use home video cameras to do this. Or that, or most cameramen were drunk. Indeed, the trailers are more fun than the movie. If you ever want to host the "Vorst Movie Parti", bring this. You want more fun ... stare at the wall.
