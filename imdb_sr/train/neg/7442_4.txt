I'm sorry that this film did not scare me. It was so frustrating when I saw the potential and that, all this, fell aside. The children! Father! Specter! He had so much potential and zilt! Zero, hope! I've already heard it all. Scari! Not! I can be scared myself, here where I sit, but in the movie. Are there people who write this figure that women should be so boring? Huh? This film was pretty atmospheric. Or at least it could have been that the director / writer tried to do it. We could have some good music that would add tension if someone tried. What I really want to know is why they get the money? Just give it to me and save all that hassle. Abandoned? ... No, we betrayed us
