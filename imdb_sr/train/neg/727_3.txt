I'm really shocked that a big director like Chuck Jones began to make some of the most amazing boring caricatures I've ever seen. I did not laugh once during this short, and it's a cartoon Bugs Bunny, for God's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoon movies are always fun, not boring! Unfortunately, this short outburst is Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunni. The first warning sign for a boring cartoon is always without payment. Good night, Elmer was bored because he always dragged the same two geezers with predictable payments. This caricature, on the other hand, is affected by another warning sign for a boring cartoon: it has too many dialogues. This caricature has more than two sleeves in the sleeve, but most of them look longer than they are thanks to the vast basis of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer ends up with dinner and comments: "It was very good for good rumors", probably as the most comprehensive dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters read the text accenting in later cartoons of Voodie DetliÄ‡) does not count in my book). Although this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it seems like 20 thanks to a redundant dialogue like this one. Elmer's rabbit pet for me was not a fun cartoon movie, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are not able to admit that he directed a few nonsense during his career, you might enjoy it.
