This is not a horror movie, it's a boring sex movie. A very bad movie, to be avoided by serious horror fans. No complication, terrible acting and boring music. If you're just watching a trailer, you'll know enough ... It's a pity that such a thing is available on VHS or video while so many good movies are unavailable. If you love vampires, try Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic by Maria Bava and Antonio Margheriti. These are the masterpieces of work if you compare this with this waste. Score = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with this opinion.
