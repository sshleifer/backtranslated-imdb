I'm used to this movie because it's a remake of the 1970s Escape in Night TV series which, although chaotic and casual, was definitely strange, fascinating and disturbing. The play in Paperhouse is a wooden, unintended joke. Overdubs did not add the tension they just strengthened to have been sitting watching the botch. Casting has upset the gloomy dialogue that has resulted in relationships that lack warmth, chemistry, or beliefs. Like most missing films, there are several good supporting acts, and people need to be comforted, comforted and convinced that they will not be responsible. Of all the possible endings, the most anticipated ... lamer was chosen than I could have dreamed of. "Escaping the Night" deserves the true remake, written by someone with a life experience and directed by a subtle mind.
