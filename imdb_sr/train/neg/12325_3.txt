I remember those performances. I still remember those fun songs "The Smooth Men in America". To be honest, it was supposed to be called an American chrome or an unruly or disgusting people. Dave could not keep this show, and neither Bob Saget nor alternate hosts for AFV could come later. Jackalope's segments were hilarious and that Dave could have made some good voice fences that were better than Bob's. But this show went to hell because of the lousy videos that people had sent. It also developed as a bit of a variant with poor visiting stars, including Olson Twins. Plus, AFV was at its best before they started picking a pink spitting baby as a winner. Did I mention that the videos are disgusting and lame? But it's still the theme of the song!
