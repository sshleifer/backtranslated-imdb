As others have pointed out, this film is a handful of pretentious insanity for mindless or masochist. We all know after we've seen the trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without good humor or persistent realism, movies like this do not work. And more importantly, without a decent script, the film will not work and there's nothing new, inspiring, or thinking about the script for this movie. The fact that this film has won several Bafta shows shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the film industry in Aussie is pretty bad at the moment, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. This film is so bad that I would not even try to rent it out of the Sundays section. > Make yourself a service and give this movie a broad bond.
