I decided to watch this because this year I was nominated for an Oscar. I guess I've wanted so many people here to love this movie, but I ended up bored and disappointed. The first scene was fine, but the whole rest of the movie in the "shake-up" camera mode is really boring. I assume that the main reason for making such a film and nominating for the Oscars is this: The American "military machine" (people who earn a war) urgently need an excuse or justification for the war in Iraq by doing something ( somehow) patriotic. The "heroic" efforts of the director and the protagonist to inspire the audience with the idea of ​​"love-like-drug"? Oh, please, come on! kakva dosada! Take this to get an idea of ​​how low a film academy could fall ...
