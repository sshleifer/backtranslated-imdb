I expected the movie to be completely stupid. With such low expectations, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. Soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but the fun of the nonsense going on in the girls' departments was also fun. It was said, there were many things about The Singles Vard that were totally unpleasant. The whole movie was poorly mapped and looked at the mouth while listening to their voices very irritatingly. This lack of professionalism is outdone only by Mormon celebrities who have no business. This film will go well in Mormondo, especially in college communities where there are individual departments. However, the conclusion will not provide hope for the poor losers who are in a marriage. (Only beautiful girls in Singles Vard are married, fat, ugly not, but all the ugly men do it) Finally, we realize that the entire movie commercial for LDSSingles.com
