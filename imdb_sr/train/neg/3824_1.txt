I do not think the film has historically shown Smith. The aim of this film was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be "pleasant" to the leaders of the LDS Church, it seems that historical precision seems a little worrying. The film is designed to be an experience of "promoting the faith," rather than a balanced view of Smith "as a man." I took it upon myself to study Smith's life and I read LDS works and no LDS was working. The film, like most LDS projects, was beautifully shot and well-played. However, this was not a realistic view of the onset of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. Significant time period was given to reinstating the accident that Smith had when he was seven years old. Although this event was no doubt important in shaping his mental view, it seems that the main reason for his involvement in the film is to help establish a nice view of Joseph Smith. One more thing is that he showed Smith's teenage years, while the film does not talk about the involvement of the Smith family in magic practices during the 1820s. The other problem is that the film shows that Joseph Smith enters the wrestling competition, but does not show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent. This film was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictitious film about man. I would not recommend watching this movie for any other purpose other than for fun.
