I picked this up in the video because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you do not like this, go f & ^% yourself!") On the box ... it looked like a bell approval ... I expected something a bit more like "Evidence about death "... there is not much actual violence in this, or a complication, character or dialogue. See the poster. It's all there. Stunts and rock. It goes back and forth. A week in the life of a LA group that makes a shy magic show at a level you might see in one of the smaller casinos from Strip, and a new Aussie stuntman in a city that found legs ... They work, meet girls, They're having fun. End of story. The band obviously needed all these things because they are honestly second-class, and play the style already dated in 1978. It must be said that the stunt-holders in the movie are truly spinetingling - that Aussie's colleague is really something, and the movie looks mostly motivated by love and respect for "art." I hanged him to see what crazy things to do next. I just want him to find a better vehicle.
