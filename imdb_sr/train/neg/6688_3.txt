This film is pretty awesome, but I have some interesting information about it: It was filmed in 1976 at the University of North Arizona in Flagstaff, AZ, as well as in Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. A good part of the stats in the film are then NAU students. That year I was a fresher there, I was in the theater, but for some reason I was not involved in the production. However, I knew several people who did this and can give this rather unusual fact: There is a scene in this film in which the two principals, as part of their rituals, have to run naked in voods. They are seen from the background in the film, doing exactly that. The thing is, they are not actors, but only two types in the theater. The identity of these "stuntmen" will remain anonymous, at least on this website, unless they decide to "discover" themselves!
