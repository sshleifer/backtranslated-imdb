The film is probably inspired by Godard's Maskulin, and I invite you to look at it instead. undeservedly good, photography. In addition, what is most affecting me is the infinite stream of nonsense. Lena Niman must be the most boring actress in the world. She's acting so stupid and with all her nudity in this movie ... she's unattractive. Compared to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced by stupidity. Without prejudicing this topic, I would say that this stems from the difference in the ideals between French and Swedish society. Film of his time and place. 2/10.
