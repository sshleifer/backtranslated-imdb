- Bad Stuff: This movie is really shit. Bad cascades for one thing, they looked so fake that I thought it was "Twilight Zone". Flashback is pretty useless. One part of the film he thinks anger on the window made his life better. I want to know the casting director and whether it was high because the acting, even the adults, was terrible. The kissing scenes in this movie were even exhausted. This movie killed a book. The book was great. I do not recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. - Good thing: I do not know what I can say. There are some parts of the tension that trigger you, but they are quickly overturned due to poor performance and acting. - My verdict: Do not look.
