I think if they made ANYONE MONEY make a complete turd bomb like this one. I have to go to the film industry. I wiped my ass into a piece of toilet paper and once I made a better scenario. Watch when the guy runs through the tunnel, they used the same 30-foot tunnel OVER and OVER and again and never even changed the location of the stupid lights that are clinging. I think that if I get THRILL to meet with the director of this GEM film, I think I will fight it and start it by reducing my LOAFERS number. <br /> <br /> <br /> < > I think I have to vomit now
