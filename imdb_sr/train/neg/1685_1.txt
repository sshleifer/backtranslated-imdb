All children aged 14-16 want to see this movie (although you are allowed only 18). They heard it was a very scary movie and they felt so cool when they watched it. I feel that sad children can not see what a good movie is, and what a bad movie is. This was one of the worst movies I saw in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. And the end? It's an open end ... why? Because it's impossible to think of a decent one for such a stupid story. This movie is made to scare you, and if you're a little smart and know about music, you know exactly when you will be scared. When the film was over and turned to my friend and told him (a bit loud) that this was a total loss of money, some stupid kid seemed strange to me. This day I could create an Oscar with a home video of my goldfish, just to use real marketing.
