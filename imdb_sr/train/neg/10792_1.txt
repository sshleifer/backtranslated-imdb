this film offers just the stupidest conversations. In fact, I probably could not even imagine how the movie was meaningless, how many synthetic dialogues can be up to an hour ago, but again I saw this video. in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script, it's expected to see at least good acting and tasty conversations, and maybe some humor, but this movie is missing everything. You heard me that there was not everything. There is not a single point I like in this movie, nothing. I hate that. I'm sure that anyone will do it. the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and similar things, but it does not succeed even on nudity. I do not know how, but I should be watching this thing for an hour or so, and I definitely recommend not to do it. the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. If someone offers you to watch it, the rue waits for you to meet your personal and family
