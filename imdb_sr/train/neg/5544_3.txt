Although this film certainly has the stink of bad film, it is surprising to see it on several levels. First, for fans of old movies, it is interesting to see the main role played by Dean Jagger (not related to Mike). While Jagger later had a very respectable role as a minor actor (he even won an Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), his performance here is really unique because he actually has full hair (I've never seen him) and because he was by far the worst actor in the film. This film only shows that if an actor can not act in his earlier films does not mean that he can eventually learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Nevman, whose first film (SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the fifties. Another reason for watching a movie is frozen. all. Writing is bad, acting is bad, and special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and unnamed Cambodians walk through the water, it's obvious that they really just walk in place and the background is poorly projected behind them. In addition, when they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry! A terrifying continuity and a foolish bad dialogue abounds in the film - so much so it's hard to imagine why they did not ask White Lugosi or George Zucco to play in the movie - since they both feature in many horror films of the class-z. In many ways, this would be a perfect example of film lessons on how to not make a movie. So, while giving it 3 is probably a bit overly generous, it's fun to laugh and short so it's worth watching the bad movie fans.
