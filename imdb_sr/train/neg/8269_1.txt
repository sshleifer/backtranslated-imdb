This prominent production has its fans. But to paraphrase a classical poor review of "Mari Reilly", Mobi Dick is just like a painting, only slower. It is because the philosophical foundations for film "production" are never a big movie rather than a lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case, for transferring books to a movie) with a list of hopelessly atomized, non-dynamic, but luminous ideas in an attempt to refer the viewers to thinking that they have seen the size. As spectators and critics tend to fall to this, the Oscar follows, feeding the whole stupid equation. Mobi Dick is incredibly rude. The actors obediently recite essays on Jonah, Mobi Dick, the ocean, Mobi Dick, Mobi Dick ... all the things that I can not answer, and none of them is absorbed by the least. It's dramatically inert. It's not built. In narrative terms, Mobi Dick (as a movie) is just something that has been made in advance in the quest for a real story. After half an hour I mumbled "Oh, great ... another oath ... another 4-minute monologue!" In an unsuccessful attempt to include you, it's a pretty camping exhibition. There are many gray hair here. Starbuck should be a golden god. (!) One knows how to watch a great director when he makes his medium instead of trying to replicate the feeling of someone else's paintings and pallets, or to honestly balm the classic like Huston works here. Images and books are nice, but they are different media. Such a film fails to realize that sincere enjoyment in the village (The Village of the Damned) is better in most aspects of the intolerable part of the culture. This is the School of Film Creation to eat your vegetables. We appreciate the work that had to be done to make the film, but not the narrative. Only a few segments that reflect maritime research are interesting; shooting barracks as a means of structuring work and various marine efforts; and whaling technology. And that does not require a movie of two hours.
