It is accidentally caught on the so-called. showed - and they hardly could have believed that the whole experience was. Compared to that, the original "Man called Horse" was a compelling spell because he had an interest in the whole. But this stupidity - my words fail. It was bad enough to have some kind of "story" that was shown with all the effects of wet bread, but that mistake worsened and the obvious absence of the title whenever the so-called "Siouk" spoke. For the sake of God, did not the filmmakers be able to find enough North American Indians who were also actors and actors who acted as "Indians" in this farrago, instead of the imposters they actually used? Also, it was quite embarrassing for me to watch Richard Harris catching around the village in the apparent order of the director behind the camera, telling him to run and jump from pointless point A to pointless point B to record movie footage and minutes. Absolutely terrible in every way!
