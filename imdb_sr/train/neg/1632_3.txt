The obvious vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), As a hottie by Charles Bronson who wiped out the "scum" that robbed her parents, grandparents or something, and impressed young chicks with their karate skills. In the key scene, she intervenes to stop rape, and a moron cop thrown HER into a prison, so that after a couple of cool cool showers and some unsuccessful seduction in prison, she must take the law into her blah blah blah. I suppose there were a lot of such films? The scenario is stupid than otherwise if you can believe it. Mani is exactly the type of business show that co-produces his major role in Death Visha, and I think that this type is sporadically expensive, but the film is an unhealthy device. Competent actors would in vain be spent on the role of the breeder here, and would actively undermine the fantastic prosecutor incapable of grinding and the judge who must be the uncle's producer.
