The action was quite interesting, with the background of the Russian Revolution. I also enjoyed watching Budapest while the movie was partially recorded there. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry between the two main characters, so it was hard to believe in a love story among them. Love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirckland was really stiff, almost ice-free. Rob Stevart was quite charming and boyish, so she looked like his older sister, not his girlfriend. The end, when we finally realized who was behind them, was rather weak and did not make any sense at all. I think I would enjoy this film much better that the relationship between the two actors was a bit more credible.
