Post the repeat of the doctor I missed, and the desperate housewives (new ones) to watch this. I do not know exactly what this film is all about. I never thought I would say this, but I want 15 minutes of glory. Script, Direction, I can not say. I recognized the actor's stool (the usual suspects), but I thought that Herbert Marshall was an addition to the class and sat down for a good candy. Boy, am I wrong? Dullsville. My favorite parts: where the "girl from the office" works with 029 keipunch and puts cards in 087 sorter. LOL @ "computer". I'd like someone to identify the next device - 477? That was even until the time of this dinosaur. And we dinosaurs do not have so much time for losing.
