"Shinobi" is one of those films that think that the act of killing a character automatically brings a sense of gravity or emotions in the story. Unfortunately, for an audience that actually worries about dying people, you need to develop characters, otherwise everything you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially emphasized when you have TON characters, all of which are dying. Make the reasons why they're dying probably, do not you? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninjas clan, and neither side really knows why they are fighting each other. They kill each other, because the car says. Still, even after it becomes apparent that the car wants them all dead, they continue to refuse to leave their meaningless missions. It's not stubborn ... it's just stupid. Good, good! There is no character development, and the plot does not provide reasonable reasons for the fight. At least they die fighting in cool actions, right? Again, NO! In fact, many struggles are not fighting at all: the super ninja that the movie has spent so much time and effort to suddenly die (and it's bad, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like: "Lalala, I walk and I ... * The neck breaks down." PLACE for this character. Not even halfway through the film, I frowned into the futility of it.
