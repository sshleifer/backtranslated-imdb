Dialogue: stiff, clich√©; Feature: hammi, cliched; Plot: predictable, cliche. Just because Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski works in this "B" trash? Plummer was well established for decades before this film was filmed, Kinski had masterpieces such as "Tess" and "Cat People" behind her ... They must have been desperate. Bad guys have bad accents - * Bad accents! (Especially Plumer, where did he * learn to work 'German?') And most of them have a bad cry. Innocent passers-bys are exaggerated in panic to make you laugh. A good guy survives, among other things: * A 5-meter knife buried deep into his shoulder - just pulls him out and seconds later uses his hand without any difficulty; somebody calls on .50) in the leg that he singles out by tying the curls around his trouser leg and after that hardly has it capped; * several fights in the poet in which he holds multiple strokes on his face, as well as to run the skull - first into the neck, - fall, backward, from what looks like the third floor, to the pavement, without any sign of twisted ankle or any other such inconvenient disadvantages. The weather is all that boring and boring. Okay, not everything is bad, Plummer brings a certain class to his role, and undoubtedly is the best actor in this movie. Much, but he can make the insensitive criminal without resorting to the techniques of ham that most villains use here, his "Ve haff vais and meance" type line with some threat, but you are always aware that you are watching Christopher Plummer playing the bad guy. This film is truly a terrible waste of time. The acting, as it is, is a series of 70 films from the 1970s, the timber delivery line meets Bruce Lee's very obviously fake fighting scene, but it's not nearly as good as Roger Moore 007 or Bruce Lee movie. Do not bother.
