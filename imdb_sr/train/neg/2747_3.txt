I knew it would be, but I gave him a rent for laughter and perhaps some kind of fun. Anyone who reads a few of my reviews can see that I am pretty easy to satisfy. I really did not think that I would eventually feel this negative about it. The action is about an ancient dragon army led by a huge snake that will destroy the world, unless some selected heroes inherited inherited it. responsibility can? became one vith ?? a good dragon? or something ?? I do not know. It was so stupid, I did not try to put much effort into keeping it. It has a very stupid story full of funny moments and stupid concepts. Many events were completely accidental and sudden. I guess there were distractions in the studio or something like that, because the biggest problem I have with the film is the fact that the story seems to be trying to be so big and epic, but everything happens so fast and passes so fast. I feel like I'm hit with a million points and action sequences in one big ball. The film is like a blow to the face. They do not need much time to establish characters or drama. Imagine the Trilogy of Lord of the Rings in 90 minutes? You could have most epic battles, but there would be absolutely no accumulation and you would have been hard to care about the outcome of these battles. That was the case with Dragon Vars ?? I do not give bullshit for 90 minutes, waiting for it to end. Fantastic CGI with some good directing, but terrible acting, fast pace, and stupid story have made it very difficult to enjoy on any basis. I would probably love it when I was 6 years old.
