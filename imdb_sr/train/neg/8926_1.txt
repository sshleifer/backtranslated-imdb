It was not "smart" or "trendy", it was rough and messy. All the actors were deaf and the director did not have the least idea of ​​what he was doing. Kasting Mae West was one of the worst elections in film history. As one reviewer said, her role had nothing to do with a movie or a book. Her character in the book was sexually beaten by a young student, which would never have made her the legendary Mrs. West. Oh, no, the plot is changing so that he sexually defeats HIM, very persuasive of the 77-year-old woman watching every day of her day. I could continue, but why? It was a horrible movie. Bluto
