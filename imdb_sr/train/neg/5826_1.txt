Spores and beautiful images have changed, sometimes boring music (you know Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the movie. If you did not have enough sleep, that's the right time. But in the last 20% of film directors, they decide to bring the idea of ​​re-birth, re-incarnation or some other, through S & M paintings: "spiritual lovers" cutting each other's bodies with knives. For me it was very disturbing and actually changed the general impression of the connection between the abstract art and the images of modern Japanese mystery. The operator and the director are great, but weird. Has not enjoyed it at all.
