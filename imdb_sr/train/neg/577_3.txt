First, Jon Bon Jovi seems not to be in a vampire movie. Together with other, not very interesting characters and a bad story, the whole movie is becoming predictable. If you have that in mind, and if you are a complete fan of the vampire, you can have a little fun with several scenes. Do not expect a single chapter in the style of Tarantino, nor a story about Anna Rice. (I expect to forget the whole movie tomorrow;)
