I saw it on a DVD (known as CORRUPT in this format), and advertising on the case led Harvey Keitel Frank as much as the one who played BAD LIEUTENANT in "This Great and Powerful Police Thriller." What he did not mention is that this is an old Italian movie. How old is Theo? So when the character plays music that does not put on a CD player, he pulls out a big plastic pancake, puts it on some kind of swivel board, where some kind of mechanical hand touches the thing pancakes, which makes the music sound. See my point that this is an old movie? The DVD case did not show that this movie was made 20 years ago. It is also a film with poor production values ​​like many other Italian films that are portrayed as American. With the exception of Keithel, the actors are horrible, although the performance of Johnny Rotten is bizarre, and not terrible, cinema is static with the quality of image and sound that leaves the impression that I watched a pirated copy of the fourth generation (I do not know if it's up to the dodgy DVD- or if it's a very bad film press), and the worst is the result of Ennio Morricone. It's impossible to believe that the man who made the irritating, intrusive random music for CORRUPT is the one who made music for Westerners Clint Eastwood. All of this is a disadvantage, because CORRUPT has its moments. This is by no means the greatest psycho-thriller ever designed, but it has kept my interest and as Keitel always puts in a good performance as a violent cop. Too bad the rest of the film did not match its high standards
