I stayed in one night, and I was very bored around 14:00, so I turned off drastically through the channels and it happened after H.B.O. where he played this "classic". In the beginning I was happy to catch something at the beginning, but my luck faded about two minutes into the movie. The entire film was focused on an unattractive man who had the fear of females, four beautiful but empty women who worked as waitresses in his uncle's restaurant, and his huge fat and extremely poor cousin who also works in the restaurant. There are a few strange turns in this movie that make it a little interesting, but definitely not worth watching. Basically, if you do not have anything to do some nights or you just can not sleep, drugs work much better. However, the guys have a lot of skin so it can be fine to watch without sound, but even it can be irritating
