I hate this program: not only is the concept itself meaningless, it is trying to be feasible (something that is omitted from similar programs "I admit" such as, Muder: She wrote). Sigh. Why can not writers ever be intelligent enough in this program to come up with evidence that would stick to and make decisions in court? Come on: after the KS-year period, the cases are unresolved, why EVERY SUSPECT, EVERYONE EYPES * SOMETHING * (curse!) for the murder that would otherwise remain unresolved? , shucks, cop, you're great - I think if you've discovered enough that I have convinced myself that I did it, I can admit it and make it easier for you to go to court. A fair cop. "Absolute dog with ** t and insult for those of us with enough brain to even hear about IK
