This is the worst movie I've ever remembered. Everything was incredibly clich√© and retarded. And the acting was terrible. Working with cameras was not bad, but he could not use it anymore. The writer / director of this film must suffer from the shooting syndrome, if he believes this film will help his career. I want an hour and a half of my life back to lose by watching this shit. I'd rather watch a video about the grass growing than this. I can not believe IMDb makes me write 10 lines to publish it, but I think this film is so bad that I have to keep alerting others about it. The reason I came for this film is that my girlfriend asked this from a local library thinking that it was Chris Christopherson's film that ended up under the title "Nestants". I do not know whose fault is for this garbage that ended up in my DVD player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / writer of this film is better hoping that I will ever recognize him on the street.
