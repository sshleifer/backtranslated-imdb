So far, this has been the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen some really bad films. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looked like it might be a decent movie about horror. I almost knew that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to begin? The movie was scattered and boring. At one point there is one minute scene no one talks, just driving a car to a ranch in a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole film is boring, with boring, incredible dialogue and basically no complication to speak. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it could be a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run it.
