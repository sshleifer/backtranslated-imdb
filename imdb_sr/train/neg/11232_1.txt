It's so sad. Although this was filmed, I think it smells just a bit more than shifts like Blood Lake, there's nothing there. The music they play is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I love brother and sister in this movie. They do not try to sound sarcastically when they say things like "My friends will be so jealous!" Hey, what about the killer just wearing his mask at the beginning? Thats retarded! I practically ignored the other half of this. My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer uses the ax. Same exact sound for every shredding!
