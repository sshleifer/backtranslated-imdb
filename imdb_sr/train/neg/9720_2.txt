This movie is just boring. Trying to copy some of the effects lured by a creative director such as Jeunet in "Amelie Poulain", but that's too much. Dialogues are pretty bad, some of the worst I've ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I almost never convinced him), his father in the movie plays very badly, the story is stupid, his ending is stupid. I do not think I love a movie so much of Christophe Gans's "le pacte des loups" (and I watch / see about 80-100 films a year), but at least that movie had some action and many good actors. I never commented (rated only), and when I saw ratings and comments, I thought I had to write. I guess we will not have a problem with the sale of the DVD that we have Offered: not a bad movie in our (big) collection! I'm open (I'm watching SF, Western, drama, comedy, silence, horror, fantasy ... movies!), but this film was so boring that I felt like I lost my watch and as per.
