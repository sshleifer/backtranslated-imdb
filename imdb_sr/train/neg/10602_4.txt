This film is mostly shit and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because Jean-Claude Damme plays in this movie. The acting in this movie is such a bad and worst act I've ever seen and two actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai Vhite can not play on ALL. Claud Dammes the worst movies he has ever done and if you watch him in one of his great movies, you should watch Blood sport, KickBoker or Sudden Death. the score is 4 out of 10.
