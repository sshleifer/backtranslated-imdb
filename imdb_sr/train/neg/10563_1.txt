Time spent watching this movie is a lost time. I do not like science fiction. I do not reject any genre per se, because good work can be done in any genre. This film, however, is not a good deal. I can not blame images (when they do not include alien make-ups), and special effects are impressive. The story was not uncommonly bad for a Trekish comic. But fk visuals were obviously where all the interests / attention / money of the producers went. The direction shifted between the throbbing and the confusion (it was not quite certain who did what and with whom and at least at one crucial moment). "Acting" was mostly very bad. There was no basis for reading most of the lines next to the note: "It was so on the page and the director told me that I should be crazy / sad / scared / anything. correct dampening in areas when it should be considered essential for a dramatic medium. I am an astonished pilot who sold the series or is the money also in the hands of technicians?
