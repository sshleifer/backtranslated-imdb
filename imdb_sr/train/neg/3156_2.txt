I just want one thing to be clear to me. I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really drops it. His acting is still wonderful, he is still charming as always, and still looks great. But the film itself is the burden of trash! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry I have to say that, it comes a bit over ... you are constantly waiting for her to escape with her best friend, whose sub-story is a bit strange. Me and my family (who sat with me and watched the movie) were also delayed by the sound of film; Sometimes music simply did not fit with what happened in the scenes. However, even this was not the worst aspect of what I found as a very disappointing movie. I could forgive the main female butch ness, I could forgive the strange characters thrown into the mix, and I could forgive the bad choice of musical accompaniment, but whose choice was to cut the entire middle part of the film and skip right to the end ?? ? The ending was obviously planned from the beginning, but as it comes there, it remains unknowingly. If you're a fan of Michael Vartan, skip this movie: buy yourself a poster.
