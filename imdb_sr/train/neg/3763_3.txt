A group of foresters and scientists are entering the forest to find fossils. In the end, they encounter a cemetery in Bigfoot (he did not notice it in the dark), the CGI Bigfoot scene is terrible, but better than endless conversation scenes that they rarely punctuate. I used to think I could be a good Bigfoot movie. But now after so many sad sad movies about the legend, I have serious doubts. To pour in the wound by watching this movie, A single handsome girl does not settle down once. And although this may be better than "Boggi Creek 2" (there is no feat), it's still sad that the best non-documentary Bigfoot movie remains "Harry and Henriksons" My Rating: D
