If you want to have fun, do not watch this movie. If you love seeing the heroic war, do not watch this movie. If you want to see a good acting and great script, do not watch this movie. If you like typical Hollywood warfare that ends right on time to politely address the public about the size and celebrate the war, GO SEE THIS FILM. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I am always interested in war films, because I think that if they are well done, they can teach us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of the war. This film shows a bunch of guys running around the village, pronouncing unconnected clich√©s, working out the most obvious things, and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality that was given to the oppressed. This film is embarrassing for the film and for the United States! Can you imagine that you are a person from Europe or Africa, or any other country, and you are looking at it, that it was said that the Americans are really such? No wonder that everyone hates us! Please, please, do not waste time on this piece of garbage; if you need to, wait and rent it. 4/10
