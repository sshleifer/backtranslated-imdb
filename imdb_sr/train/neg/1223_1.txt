What a weekend. Two days ago I watched the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "While Outside". I'm trying to make a decision that was worse in terms of pain in my head as I watched. I guess, "While out there" it was worse. Everything has already been said in other comments: Unreal, illogical, and so on. - The only thing I really need to add is that at some point I started to feel more for the evil guys than for a woman, because I would recommend it for Darwin's award if she really died (just watching the first half, so I do not know). Soon I was on two Darwin Awards (if at all possible) because of her huge nonsense. I, hey: Produced by Kim Basinger? So, she did not only know the script, she was also responsible for bringing this loss of money to us, people? I consider that people who spend a considerable amount of money to be evil because they could use money to feed and dress a few people instead of hurting 80% of those who saw him in the cinema and giving 20%, who are idiots, a good opportunity to show how much are idiots.
