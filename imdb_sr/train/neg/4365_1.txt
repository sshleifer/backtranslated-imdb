Ariauna Albright is a really good actress, but why she took part in this chromatic written tragedy is a mystery. What could have been fun as if it was a classic boredom. The unique thing about Ariaun is that she can act and look really sexy, unlike her partner Lilith Stabs who looks good, but it's obvious that she spent money on school acting in spa or beauticians. It was a production that shouted for some T & A and a fictional screenwriter who could do it during the course. However, Ariauna does what it can and in some circumstances save some of its reputation. The company Tempe should be aware that when watching two attractive women into small fetish uniforms of police officers, spectators will expect a fetish show & T & A. Nough.
