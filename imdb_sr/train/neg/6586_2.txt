If you value the Renaissance in Asian horror, do not bother with Gavi. The movie hardly deserves to be talking about two sisters, medication and junior (or even good material, such as an eye or an inner feeling) in addition to working with the A-list of meaning and Ring. These films are framed by subtlety, unexpected images, rich characters, and decisively non-Western takeover of what is terrifying. Gavi is bound together with the rest of the limbs and organs of everything that has done American horror for twenty-five years. bad fit. One aesthetics must suffocate the other; guess what? They do not have their own stories to tell Ring Ring's robbery for an evil-child substation, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, stupid characters, mindless plot, stupid spirit, ho hum.
