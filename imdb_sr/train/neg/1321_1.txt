Richard Dreifus is not a star here. It's about three and a half seconds and what does Gene Gene do in this movie? I have no idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that makes no sense. An incompetent writer / director (same guy) killed all the talents with his terrible work. I got a DVD for a penny so I can not complain! But it's weird and it seems you feel weird and it's not a good way. This was seventies and it looks like the director was on a badly acidic way and wanted everyone to experience how it would be in his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but as if scratched record, it quickly plays a foul. He has that "Manson family on acid" vibration. I do not know how the other reviewer got everything he did from this movie? Maybe they worked there when? In any case, be prepared to lose 80+ minutes of your life, you will never return. Yes, it's so horrible!
