I do not know what Oscar voters saw in this film, but they had to see some pretty hard things to see in him so that they could reward him with the best Oscar. All I know is that luck was Gene Kelly to play in it or it would be twice as bad as I think. First of all, I think Leslie Caron was not able to play such a role. She's not so talented, she's not a great dancer, and she does not look right at all. It's a pity that an actor or actress can ruin a movie just as he plays in it because if Leslie Caron was not in this, he might have made a great movie. The story was intelligent, the direction was not bad, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not talking about Leslie Caron just to criticize him, I'm just saying that because I think it's the worst part of the movie. She's probably a good actress, but I can not say, because I did not see her in anything else, but I think she was pretty bad at the "American in Paris". So if you want to see it, just go ahead, but I tell you, it's better to watch "Singing in the Rain."
