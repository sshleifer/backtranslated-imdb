This movie is funny. Everyone who says that the acting is excellent and that casting is excellent, they have never even seen a central cinema. The acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you encounter. Lame. I feel that all other "huge" comments are made by people who are connected with film makers. I was not very impressed with the story, but I just wanted to see some beautiful landscape of Oregon, and there were decent cinemas - but the casting was all but inspired. I think this film also ridicules a generally noble suggestion that something deep in American culture is ignored and maybe lost and that revival is valuable and possible. It puts jokes on the wrong and too obvious places and makes me think it was written by the State Department or something like that. Back to the drawing board. He even suggests that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity of classics as Harold and Maude is absolutely retarded, and on the same line of begging and pretensions and "jokes", as in this film is noisy.
