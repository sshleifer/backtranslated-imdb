I am the admirer of Matthew Modin, but this film - which I encountered on the cable - is absolutely foolish. I see that the screenwriter and the director were one and the same, so there was nobody to check her worst instincts. No surprises, no original lines, or original characters. The goldfish was essentially the most sensitive figure. What a loss of this acting talent. Given how busy these days are to record in New York, I have to wonder how this has been done. And if you are wondering why I watched it at all, it was created after a movie I liked on the cable and I left it while I worked for my computer. It's not a very demanding picture!
