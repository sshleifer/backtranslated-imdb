someone who has to pay for a car ... this is really terrible ... it makes Jean Cicero's cyborg look like he's gone with the wind ... this is a clock I would like to sue to go back ... luckily, it caused severe drowsiness ... from which I fell asleep. how do actors of this caliber can create this dog? I'd rather spend time watching the alga grow on the aquarium side rather than taking part in this terrible fabrication of several genres. Now I use the DVD as a pad on the coffee table. $ 5.99 on Valmart is too much to spend on this movie ... if you really need to have it, wait until they get kicked out after spending a few years in inventory and frustrated that they will not sell. please for God's love let this film die from obscurity.
