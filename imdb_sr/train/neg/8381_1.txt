There are some very talented black directors, Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and many others who bring credit to the film industry. Then there are Vaians brothers, who at one time (15 years ago) had an extremely funny television show "In Living Color" that started Jim Carrie's career among others. Now we have a nonsense that replaces humor and rough jokes (VC humor) as a standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as those shown in 'The Little Man', and they could not be. A baby with full teeth and tattoo is accepted as just a month? The baby comes with a shade of five hours to wipe off. It is assumed that the baby has sex with her foster parent behind her husbands, Darryl, back. Oh, yes, it's just hilarious. As the main criminal 'The Little Man' is the stupidest on planet Earth. He hides a stolen rock that is huge in a woman's purse and then has to persecute her. Co-star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz, offers the best line: "I'm surrounded by morons." Based on no credit, on the cartoon by Chuck Jones, Babi Buggi Bunny. This is too stupid to be fun. The appearance of this film, Damon Vaians, was bad, appeared on Jai Leno, before he received the BAT awards and did not even mention this terrible film. When Hollivood will stop the garbage of green lighting from the Vaians brothers. When he overcomes his white man, the guilt is in all likelihood.
