If you want to comment on the movies to which the script comes in half of the movie, then this is one. Setting and acting like in a Pornographic movie, but nothing happens only through some kind of flipping and touching a third kind. What actually gets very boring after 45 minutes of delicate, but no action. A couple of actors I watched in real films and their acting there was much better then. All the special effects are performed by the big "Rondo" whom the spell is hearing. A cult film is written on the box. Does this mean that this movie should not be looked at at all? Take a shower with some friends and watch this movie for the new year, thanks to giving.
