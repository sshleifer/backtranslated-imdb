I think that the biggest disappointment in this film was that I, ultimately, expected actor actors to break in and apologize for how bad the act was. When you consider powerful subjects, brilliant scenes and efforts to create a beautiful set and spectacular images, it's a shame that little attention is dedicated to acting. <br /> <br />
