I do not care how much the nomination for this garbage got the best for this, and this, this movie is stunned. I did not know whether to shut down the set, or file a lawsuit with lawyer O.J. because of improper damage to my mental health. I was rarely bored; call this fertilizer fun with a scam in the face of every movie singer across the globe. The whole story was stupid, acting was not inspirational, "drama" was without emotion. I am grateful that I did not have to pay for this unsatisfactory experience.
