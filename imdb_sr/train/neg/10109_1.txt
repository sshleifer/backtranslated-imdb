BTK Killer, Killer Green River, Zodiac Killer; A man continues to put absolute trash and is ironically fond of his shit. I never saw Ulla Lommel film, but I was so stunned as everyone thinks his thing is so terrible. Like the movies I said at the beginning, not even at odds with six when it comes together! After reading the comments, I was curious to see how much this guy is really bad. He's the worst out there. Credits would not end until the pathetic film began and I quickly noticed that the sound was incredibly badly called. The acting was incredibly terrible and the same for camera shots. Editing is simply the worst. This film made no sense and I could not bear it unbearably because it would not end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie. I can not take it any more. I spent 45 minutes of my life. DO NOT WANT THIS KAPU!
