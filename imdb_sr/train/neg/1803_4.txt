Here's one of those short educational films that are made to teach unknown people about the facts of life. This time the target audience is the girls of prevention, the fact of life is a period. This animated film, created by Valt Disnei Pictures, apparently with some sponsors from the Library. It begins with explaining how hormones grow and develop. Using animation and a female narrator shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, the uterus and the vagina, work and why it all leads to menstruation. It's almost unbelievable, becoming a comic book here, to avoid the subject of sex. Even the word is never mentioned, although the "curse" will pass once. I do not know why I saw it, but since this is one of those rare short films that can leave the impression of innocent times, you may want to try it.
