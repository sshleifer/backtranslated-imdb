There is terribly much wrong with this image, starting with a script that is both obvious and redundant. Kortney Cox plays a comic artist fleeing into a small desert city after being raped twice in a large city. She was immediately persecuted by a local person who looked rather upset (Craig Sheffer), who seemed to be trying to imitate Mickey Rourke's third degree. D.B. He is a local policeman, who is allegedly there to protect and serve. In the meantime, the script manipulates the audience, and who is really good? Logic passes through the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than it should be. If you think "The Blue Desert" could save the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. His part is insignificant, just like the whole movie. - MERK
