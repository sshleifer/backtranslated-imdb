I was glad to watch this movie for free while working in the hotel industry and this film has recently come to our library of films. Nothing against low-budget films, but this movie has a terrible acting and directing. How can a movie be made? The director should be on the black list, and for all the poor actors it's certainly not a jumping career in career. Please, make sure you do not watch this movie, the acting is chromatic, the camera and the director scary. There are only a few movies that deserve to be called "LOV 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make this film should give it for charity, so at least it serves for good reason. In this case, I would watch him another 10 (or at least once).
