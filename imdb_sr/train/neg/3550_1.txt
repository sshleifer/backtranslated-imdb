I led the group to stop the exploitation of the comedian and I just spent the last 2 months listening to the horror stories of comedians who tried to audition for "Last Comic Standing". If they do not have a GOOD agent, then they do not even have a chance to audition, so that more than 80% of comedians who appear are denied before they show anyone that they have talent! If they succeed in audition, they are told that they are "pre-determined" if they get a second chance. So, what the TV audience is watching is NOT THE best comic strip in the US. If the comic arrives to the show, most of them do not get IMDb loans. I know this because I've been dealing with all 6 seasons of "Last Comic Standing" and I do not get paid for the job of a producer. It's really embarrassing. A month ago, I asked "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook why Producers did not give IMDb loans and I was banned on their Facebook page !!! I am not a comedian, so I do not have a personal interest in this. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like to see ANIONE how they are exploited and that's why I help the comedians. Comedians are exploited on HBO, BET, TVs and other cable networks, but NBC is a GREAT THREE network so that those in charge need to be ashamed of allowing this exploitation to happen. comedian who was a victim: http: //vv.ioutube.com/vatch? v = RMb4-hiet_I
