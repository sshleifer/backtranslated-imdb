If this could be rated at 0, it would be. From terrible wooden behavior to boring pace, childish exploitation angle and sophomoric pseudolesbian titulation added purely for sad viewers, this is a catastrophe of the film. The action is predictable, because from the beginning it is absolutely certain what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will start. From a boring, unusual beginning to a pathetic and gloomy ending, each individual presence in this film is lost, and every skinny piece of talent dug for this party is scattered. If you want to look something like an irresistibly gloomy with many of the same childrens titles, watch one of Ilsa's movies. At least they are irresistible and up-front about what they are trying to do. As something terribly bad has ever been rated above 5, it's a wonder that people who do not have taste or prudent standards can sometimes merged into the most suspect. It's not scary, it's not interesting, and above all, it's not exciting in any sense. This, in my opinion, is a crime; The crime is that such a terribly offensive and incompetent garbage has ever been conceived and given them the resources to appear, and even more tragedy that it is still being defended by some sad viewers. Even Elvir's cheerful personality and humorous ways could not alleviate the blow that this horrible tragedy of the film. Avoid it at all costs.
