The only reason I looked at this was that I found it in my local library (and I will ruthlessly mourn them because I spent public funds on it), and despite the abundance of suckling and asses, I did not need long to realize that the quick button Moving forward was my friend. Terrible direction, work with a walking camera, sporadically bad to almost passable acting, effects, and one of the worst scenarios I've had discontent with watching the animated (as it was, terribly crippled and crippled) For a long time. The best laugh actually comes from the "Making of ..." feature, in which the poor juices involved in this HDV fail to try to justify their chromatic efforts as if they were working on something special, instead of something that would not be completely forgotten next week. Wait! In addition to the fact that someone somehow lured the Tipi "Birds" Hedren, from all people, in a little bit of participation, along with Kane "Friday 13." Hoder! How this happened, I will never know, and honestly, I do not care. Look at your own risk and do not say that you were not warned. This is film making in its pretentious, crazy worst. It only gets 2 of me because I had some pretty naked women, and even then, barely.
