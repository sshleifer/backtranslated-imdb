Just to avoid creating such a film in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment, but it does not tell any convincing story. Man can feel honest because he sits over him because he touches so many important issues, but he does so without any obvious motive. The spectator comes out without new perspectives (unless someone appears as one wakes his mind, as it will always do during this pointless film). Someone could better spend time looking through the window tree grows. <br /> <br />
