STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning James Dial (Veseli Snipes) is hiding at his ranch in Montana after he did not manage to catch the infamous terrorist. Then he again contacted the agency to travel to London to go once more. His target is captured and under strong police protection - but they do not want him to just catch their man - they want to carry him. Everything goes well, but then the mission becomes unsuccessful, and when the senior police chief, Charles Dance, is killed, the blame falls on Dial's legs. She hunts as an animal, finds shelter in a nearby house and gets acquainted with a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who deals with her own problems and becomes his unconscious assistant while going to clear her name and discover who gave it. Br /> This latest Snipes straight to the DVD's is coming out of nowhere, with minimal publicity even for so little time (I do not recall that I have ever seen any commercials or trailers for it). Even after Snipes's history of duff DVDs, this could look like what Snoop Davg told you to drop out as if it was hot. But I still felt compelled to start it. It does not count among its worst, but it does not reach even more than the standards of some of its best (Detonator, 7 seconds, it all shows, indeed), too. This is, at best, mildly uncertain, with minimal action, all the way to the cool dialogue and Snipes is not very good at the main role. Also, in the main supporting role, it is quite clear that Dance also appeared on a canvas check, which is usually one that none of the actors will shout on the hills of any of their biographies. Many say that the end is the only 'contract' that keeps you in the interest when Snipes completes Sonny and completes any additional DVDs with it. **
