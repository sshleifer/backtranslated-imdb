This film is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and that's a shame because the 1954 version, in my opinion, is much better. I do not deny the talent of Barbre Streisand. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I'm not familiar with Chris Christopherson's other work and therefore I can not make a ruling on that. However, this film leaves much to be desired. It goes slowly, it has free nakedness and ugly tongue, and it can be very difficult to pass. However, I am not a great fan of rock music, so it's natural that I would love the version of Judy Garland better. Check out the 1976 film with Barbara and Chris, and evaluate yourself.
