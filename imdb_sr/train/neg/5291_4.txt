STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Rai (Rai Vinstone) has a criminal past, had problems with alcohol and now forms a drug habit that makes him a paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife, Kathi Burke, who tries to keep the family together, but ultimately comes as a mats. In the meantime, her mother, Janet (Laila Morse), is familiar with Rai's son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles), and his escalating habit of sending drugs from the rails. The film follows these reluctant characters while rubbing together with their lives. They say that the British enjoy the fact that they are poor, which includes watching movies that entertain them in this way. Films such as Nil Bi Mouth highlight this. It's a story of a broken family, torn by crime, poverty, alcohol and drugs, as Jeremy Kile would jump out as a meal of three dishes. This is essentially the story of self-destructive men, the three generations each copying, dividing the family, and women trying to hold it together, although they are not strong enough. If you pick up a little bit of what's off-set, you can see that it does not promise that it will be cheerful to watch from the beginning and that certainly does not disappoint. The truth is what everyone said about the performances, and the leading stars, Vinston and Burke, bring some great acting. We see that Vinstone lost his wife, having beaten up without any cocaine paranoia, breaking up during a telephone conversation with her and releasing a typical arsenal f and c when he refuses to let him see his child. Likewise, at a private moment, we see that Burke skillfully lost his stamina on the staircase, full of night's influence before he hit it. This is another of those films where there is no 'plot' to track as such, just the life experience of these hopeless lives that take place from day to day. Many praised him (including Baftas!), But for me it was too cruel and gloomy. I have no right to criticize him for this, knowing what I knew about it from the off-set, but unfortunately this is how I found it. **
