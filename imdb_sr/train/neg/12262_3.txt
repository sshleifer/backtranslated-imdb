Lots of movie creators have to endure many terrible movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins a list of stupid, redundant titles of horror about funny big animals who want to reverse the food chain. Crocodiles are particularly successful, because we already had to fight through a sinless Crocodile (directed by disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is as bad as these other movies and ?? on top of that ?? He likes to exaggerate. Crocodile sea water is allegedly 90 years old, 30 feet long (!) And kills it from fun! During the film, she entertains by devouring a bunch of extremely stupid surfer-dudes and dudettes who have come to seek new pleasures surfing in an overburdened area. The only nice aspect of this movie is the tropical location. Although this is a completely inappropriate ambiance for such a film, lagoons and nature look beautiful. Every other aspect is simply catastrophic. It's a lot worse, but everything looks fake and funny. Dialogues are quite ill for listening! You will not believe in some of the words that your actors have to say! I know that surfers should be a mentally undeveloped group, but I hope it's not that stupid! Early in the film, one of the characters calls Javs a "mechanical toy," but the crocodile looks at least ten times less real than Spielberg's big white shark. Visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateur, and the massacres do not impress. I will not talk too much about acting because it is secondary in such shifts. Girls look sexy in wet jackets and their tits are happy to refuse while fleeing the beast. You've guessed: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. It's so bad getting fun again. But 'funny' for a completely different reason than James Hicks was intent on.
