The first thing should be that I have read the MANGU and HIS MY ARGUMENT on the topic of the difference. This anime made me very disappointed because she removed comedy and high quality manga and OVA. What left behind was just a shell of what could have been. Many characters lacked the depth seen in the manga. Alucard is not a sympathetic character that secretly wants death. Walter's story is missing a betrayal. And the Nazi guerrillas who wound the world in the war are completely absent. Instead, the anime gives the bad guy to Gary Stu in Incognito, who is defeated by what appears to be all the chances. My main remark is not that anime breaks out of Manga, but to do such a bad job.
