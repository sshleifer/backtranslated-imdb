I'll give the writer / director William Gove a merit of finding someone to fund this poorly designed "triller". A good argument for the unnecessary spending of subscription money on HBO, let alone the purchase of DVDs based on wrap and blurbs. The pedestrian Dennis Hopper and the game Richard Grieco do not add anything significant to their biographies, although the art direction is not half bad. Dialogue will leave you a grimace with a miracle in his preoccupation; This is a narrative in the worst case. No tension, no tension, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no nothing. A few attractive and often naked women spice boredom, but this is definitely the movie that is best seen as a trailer. I'm sorry the guy who reviled this thing. Good for night vision only. You are warned.
