I was not terribly impressed by the offer of Dante's first season in Homecoming, it was not a terrible story, but a smart political statement with the undead. The Screwfly situation is a story of a virus released in the world that causes sexual instincts of men to replace murderous tendencies towards women. This episode begins with a short film that explains the way scientists killed a screw. Then, there is a short scenario in which a man was arrested when the bodies of women were discovered in his home. I suppose this should show the onset of the epidemic, but it is unclear because it never repeats itself. This episode continues to appear for some time while introducing characters blah blah blah. It looks cool and mysterious, but the star's episode gets worse and worse as it moves forward to its sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode. Well, apart from chocolate.
