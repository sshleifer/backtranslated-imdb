I love John Saxon in everything he's in. Once he takes over the camera, although he directs a movie that should be appropriately titled "Please do not watch this movie called: Zombie House of Death". A 1000-dollar shock shock is the way Fred Olen Rai has done to spend $ 14 on a landfill that was produced by a big legend of cheese. Rai was a frontman in RetroMedia. Ray has somehow made Charles Band look warmer than the ceilings on Ford Falcon. Now it's just bad, both - and boring. It's great that Rai is digging up these old things, and in some cases it's a public domain like the rest of the dollar videos, but in the Zombie Death House case (the word "Zombie" is unreasonably linked to the addition of ownership and interest in the ZA ZA) ONE WAY WORK OF SERVICES THIS TRIPE IS LONGER ON THE DOLLAR MARKET FOR CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND FANS SACSON !!! If you want to see the real Saxon, pick up Black Christmas, Nightmaid on Easter Street or Glove.
