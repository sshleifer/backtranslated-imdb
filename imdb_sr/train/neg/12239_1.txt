Since I was eight years old, I was a great fan of wrestling. It did not matter what I saw in the federation. VVE, VCV, USVA. For me, that's all I've been looking at. May 23, 1999 It was my 19th birthday. I ordered Over The Edge and I just expected another pay per view. But this time. I was wrong. Instead, it was the night when one of the best wrestlers came out of Canada. You can not do much to change the situation. But what happened after the death of the Ovens has made me very angry. Instead of ending paying for watching and doing the right thing as human beings, VVE decided to protect what is in the first place and it was money keeping by paying to watch as if Lord's death never happened. I need to tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in his life, but that was by far the dumbest decision he ever made. And this shit with the claim that Owen wanted to look at the salary is continued. Give me a break. When someone dies on the billboards, he sees his sense of stopping him. It's like a policeman who shoots a robber or a robber, and then leaves a man to die so that he can go home and call it a day as if men's life was never important. what happens. Owen will miss and thank you for the memories for all the time you gave us.
