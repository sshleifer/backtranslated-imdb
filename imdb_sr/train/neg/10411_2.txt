That's funny. I saw a bunch of Fassbinder movies and I found that some were extremely creative and interesting, while others were repulsive and self-indulgent - like this movie. For me it moves from big to shit - without much in the middle. I know that there are many fans among "sophisticated", but I can not help but think that his appeal is pure. From my point of view (and I know that I will get a lot of negative ratings for this), he made too many movies too fast and was too confident. His gaios or gender-folding films (like this one) tend to be really bad - untidily made, sometimes quite boring (like KUERELLE and CLEAN WRITTEN PETER VON KANT), and sometimes just rough (like this movie) . Was not his message of accepting a person's confused confusion might have been better than showing him that he had slapped or watched the cows slaughterfully slaughtered? Show some sensitivity to the subject and make your characters become more human and compassionate - then, perhaps, I'm worried about movies. To be honest, at the time I watched this movie, I might not be bothered with more Fassbinder's films - it seems to be a bad balance.
