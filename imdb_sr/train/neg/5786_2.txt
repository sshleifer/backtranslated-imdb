When you look at this now and you hear the whole language here, it's amazing that this is rated "PG", but it's a rating system from the 1970s. Peter Falk throws out the Lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes I'm in this movie! However, few people consider this to be offensive, and especially to those who make films, or people who "judge" them. , Allen Garfield, Varren Oates, Gena Rovlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly actors that you would not find in "The Sound Of Music". I love movies about robberies, and lots of films by director William Friedkin, but this scenario does not deliver and only has too much "Sleazi" in the 70's, visually and audibly. For those who liked Falk in Columbo's television, it must be a shock when they hear him using so many curses as in movies. This is far from the only case.
