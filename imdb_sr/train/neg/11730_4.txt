Investigative journalist Darren McGavin (like Carl Kolchak) returned; this time, he is for the "Nightingale". Once again, police officers and fellow journalists do not believe, or want to hide the supernatural angle. Producer-director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as the previous "Night", with an understandably minor success. <br /> Mr. Curtis gathers fun, including the alumni of "Dark Shadovs" George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (like Louise Harper) plays a sexy collection of belly dancers. And, although I have never seen it, it must be Roger Davis as a guest Mr. McGavin in the early stage, playing an incredulity in the existence of a vampire! **** The Night Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Valli Cock
