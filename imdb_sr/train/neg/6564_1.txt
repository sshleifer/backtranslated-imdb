This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, the best part of which was Christian J. Meoli "Leonard" who tried to jump up and down outside the bar, as I wanted to do on DVD, to spare the rest of mankind is the agony of watching this shitty movie. He plays a great role by continuing to watch while waiting to be good, I mean Sean Astin's "Andrew" (he perfectly played his role, he did a great job, it was bad in this movie), Kira Sedgvick "Bevan" Ron Livingston "Chad" , Renee Zellveger "Poet" (they put her name on the cover has a total of 1 row and less than 4 seconds in the entire movie ... If the actor had any dignity, they would go out and buy everything copies of this film and burned them together with writer / director George Hicklenoper and writer John Enbo.
