Oh, dear, Jerry can be the undeniable king of conversation, but the movies are completely different, and he is out of his league. The script for this film is so poor that he must see that he is believed and it's sad to see so vaguely known actors as Michael Dudikoff (action of the 80s B'movie king), Michael Jai Wyte. 'Spavn'), as well as Surviving the Games' Villiam MacNamara (involved in just half of the funny situation in the whole movie!) He went down on it low for a job. If you are a fan of Jerry then you are holding his TV shows because it's a total loss of an hour and a half. After I went through this, I managed to catch the last half an hour of Rocky 5 on TV, which looked like a film masterpiece in comparison, I think it's more than enough! <br /> <br />
