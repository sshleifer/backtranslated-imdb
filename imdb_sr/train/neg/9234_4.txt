Remade today, this movie would be a very frustrating, very disturbing dark comedy. The seizure, obsessions, and networks of lies and manipulations give the glitter from 1948, and not-they-sweet innocence. Drake plays the stalker, the disobedient human user, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant plays the victim of learning, alternately angry and unconscious. Since then, I have not been able to look at classical novels with the same suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br />
