I can not say that Aag is the worst Bollywood movie ever made, because I did not see every Bollywood movie, but my imagination tells me it could be. This film looks like an attempt at artistic creation. suicide on behalf of the director, and I believe that he was successful in his mission. No actor from the A-list outside this film would risk taking the same charge as he did for all the humiliation that this film brings with him. But, we do not only allow the director to blame here, there is a cameraman, who seems to be trying out for the amateur domestic film directing of the year. There is a dramatic result that is hoping to take you to the next scene. The illuminating man, who in one hand held a cigarette in one hand and a lamp on the pillar, hoping that the flame burning from the cigarette would increase the necessary light in every scene. And, of course, actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, otherwise everyone could be forgiven here. The ensemble of the Aaga actors has been composed to promote the new beginning and dimension of the re-made of the favorite film in India of all time, 'Sholai'. We must not forget that these actors were not forced to this film, they are A-lists and willing participants in something that we are going to face so that we certainly have great and eager expectations of the public ??? So, the question arises, Amitabh aside (for now), did other actors really believe that their performances even tried to improve the original? Has Amitab Bachchan read the script and believed that people will remember his dialogue in this farsighted horror movie? Do not be stupid, of course not, this was a public demonstration of how much money conversations can make actors walk. I sincerely hope that all the participants are satisfied with what is really a vulgar attempt to transform the classic movie, which only manages to pollute everyone's mind when looking at the original.
