I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a young child. In the morning I sneaked down, I started watching HBO, and Splav (segment 2) terrorized me. This time I still enjoyed Split, although I did not know if it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a short one. The other two segments were complete garbage. I can not believe that the producer paid for this garbage somewhere. All I've achieved by looking at this is to destroy another childhood memory. Creepshov 2 will now join Radu among my list of infected classics from childhood. 4/10
