Recapitulation: Dr. Markov developed a new theory of how to produce energy, knowledge that could disbalance the world. He keeps his knowledge coded and secretly and desperately wants to leave the Soviet Union. On the other hand, the KGB desperately wants new technology. So, they run the scheme. During an attempt to save Markov's release, the KGB enters Markov's secret location and tries to reveal his secret by saying that they are in Sweden and working for the UN. KGB, as an aid, kidnapped Markov's alienated daughter. The CIA is now sending its best agents, a team of (Swedish?) Ninja to prevent the KGB and rescue Marco and his daughter. The film is quite ambitious, but missing in many areas. The first is that it's very dark, it's likely to hide locations and bad effects, that some scenes are difficult to grasp. You can not see what's happening. The other thing she misses is martial arts, although it's ninja-movie. Certainly there are some, rather poor quality, but mostly ninjas fired automatic rifles or sets of explosions. Automatic weapons are also a problem, as they seem to have endless ammunition supplies. And ninjas look almost immune to bullets, while Soviet guards die as flies. What then has to do with it? Idea and ambition first and foremost. Some actually, and especially for Swedish films, are competent action scenes, but not martial arts. Some nice scenes of slow-motion shooting and plenty of blood and blood. And some very interesting new weapon technologies that make the victims explode the heart or brain. Mostly all the parts you are looking for in the B-movie. Because it is definitely a B-movie, no error can be made there. But if you expect it and watch it as a B-movie, it's fun. But do not forget, it's not just the B-movie set in the eighties. Some girls, for example, in addition to wearing ... say "interesting" clothes, have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup. All in all, look at the cult status and ambition. Enjoy and forget. 4/10
