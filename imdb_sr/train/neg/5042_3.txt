The main objection to this film is the fact that it CAN NOT tell who is who. No racism was intended, but these Asians look the same! I can say something about this story, but it's about as far away. Human identities are not a mystery, if they were a mystery, I would worry about them. Instead, I was not on the ASAP screen. Tones of wide shots and quiet faces with no emotions occupy this movie. Damnation is boring, not only do not I know these people, but they just sit there. Production is typical of Chinese John Voo, a horrible video from the blotched scene. This looks just a little better than Andy Lau's "Fulltime Killer" (which was a great movie). You would think of a decent budget to at least look like Hollywood in the '90s. I did not know that the Chinese had these art-house beat men.
