Oh, man, how low serial publications fell in 1952! This boring thing is exactly the series that annoyed Annie Vilkes (from Misery). Not only do the heroes escape from the traps by adding scenes that were not in the previous chapter (and which could not be there - tell me that when the criminals blew the plain in episode 7 to 8, they would not see a jump of characters), but I think this series has a world record of recordings. I mean, most of the shots! And not only from other series (obviously all flying sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and the cool "melted walls" of scene 2 to 3 are from the adventure of Captain Marvel), but from yourself! The whole sequence of the "journey to the Moon" (which is probably the shortest ever, it's 30 seconds long and the characters never leave the Earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 is repeated in Episode 8! And Episode 10 is ALL scenes from the previous episodes! (Have you ever wondered why the MST3K never did episodes 10, 11 and 12? Well, they had to stop after 9, so they did not have to do it all again!). he started with a scientific factor. Prepare to see the sunniest Moon ever! And people from the Moon who can not breathe in their world? What did they smoke? And if it's not enough, it's too loud and stunts (usually the best thing in the series) is a little and far. Visually, am I the only one who thinks that the bullet-shaped helmet (or in the form of lemon) is totally ridiculous? Rocketeer was much colder, no matter how bad the movie (and the man, it was terrible). A vehicle similar to a tank is not much better, it looks like a bunch of kids made for Halloween. The only positive thing to remember is that the actor who plays the hero is crossed in place of the usual muscular piece (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But then he is so unattractive ... /> Not worth it watch for nostalgia. You see Captain Marvel instead. 2/10. <br /> (BTV, see section Memorable quotes for real female Lib Beams).
