Rather a stupid attempt by Hitchcock's mysterious thriller, an incredible exchange of espionage for archeology and based on the novel Robin Cook; By the way, I recently received another adaptation of his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of the late Richard Vidmark. For the record, the director Schaffner has just made THE BOIS FROM BRAZIL (1978) - a similar imaginative but much more exciting suspension and, unfortunately, SPHINKS was a fake step from which his impressive career will not recover. Despite its scope and reasonably decent play, this has proven to be a critical and commercial failure - mostly because narration is not really exciting: in fact, it's pretty tricky (weak scare attempts - an archeologist hero regardless of having to face Lesley Anne-Dovn is a lovely lead lady who is stumbling over lost goods - actually hidden by the local sect to prevent him from falling into the hands of foreigners who have appropriated most of the country (under the pretext of culture)) too long. Sir John Gielgud appeared at an ungrateful early stage as an antique dealer who puts Dovn on the path of booty, and pays for this "act of betrayal" with his life. Typically, this is happening. that some characters are opposed to those they claim to be - so obvious allies (such as Maurice Ronet) are ultimately exposed as criminals, while an unclear figure (Frank Langella, whom I saw in London at the beginning of 2007 in the West End version "Frost / Nikon", now transformed into a movie, is going from Dawson's antagonist to her lover and back, as he decides that the wealth belonging to the Egyptian high priest Menephti will be a national treasure.
