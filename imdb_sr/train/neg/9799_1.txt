Pover Rangers, a wholly ugly children's show of the nineties, continues to harass young children with their full cheerfulness and terrible environments. children fight each other to resolve their differences. Toys were an additional demonstration of how to promote violent television shows and the like. I have never been able to understand what the purpose of this completely funny performance ever has been. As such, remains one of the worst children's shows ever made.
