The episodic version of Starship Trooper Robert Heinlein plays deadly slowly, after Johnny Rico left his parents, (not very attractive) the girl he wanted, and joined the mobile infantry. Aliens in the show are nothing like barbaric mistakes from the film, but monsters like squid that lasers throw out from the mouth. During watching this version, I was constantly wondering how fruity they managed to do the whole thing. The emission mainly deals with the relationship between the recruits, and the painful, long-lasting views that they give to each other through their battle armored visors, with the singer pop of the 80s who sometimes arrive * during the scanty sequences of battles that finally emerge in the last couple of episodes. As for building, he owes Top Gun, dividing much in terms of tempo and content (and all that implies).
