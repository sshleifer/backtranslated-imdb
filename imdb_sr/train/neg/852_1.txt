This "adaptation" of the beautiful book King is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans on this site, and as a result, this film mysteriously finds its way into the top-250. Jack Nicholson is as funny as Torrance, as well as Shelley Duvall. The story, which has nothing to do with the book, is an incoherent confusion and the characters of Jack and Vendy Torrance. are complete jokes. My advice to everyone who did not read the book and want to understand the characters of this story: hold TV series ... Oh, and people who say that Kubrik had every right to destroy the king's story, for the king is ... not a good writer should be kept under review "masterpieces" such as "wide-eyed eyes".
