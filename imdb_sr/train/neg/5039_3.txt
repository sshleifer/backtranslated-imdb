Rek Reed once told the movie ("Julia and Julia" to be specific) that it seemed like it was shot through the juice of the nara. I remembered it while I was hurling through Purple Butterfly. It seemed that this shot through the gauze. The story was boring and did not help her that for large sections of actor facial faces literally were not in focus or would come into focus only after a long period of time. Also, they all looked likewise difficult to distinguish characters. I call it Syndrome "The Society of Dead Poets". There was no one to care for, no one was interested in dramatically, and the film did not give any historical light at a very interesting time period and set of circumstances. Full disappointment.
