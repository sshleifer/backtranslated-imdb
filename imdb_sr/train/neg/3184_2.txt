I was never impressed with JD, and the Final Justice (which I did not see before broadcasting MST3k) was no exception. It's not that the character is less attractive than Mitchell: only less than that Geronimo ("Call me" Heronimo) does not like it. In fact, one of them doubted that Mitchell and Final Justice were all Joe Don's schemes seeking retribution trying to kill the "star" causing a heart attack. Joe Don must have found a new agent, now graduating from a "comic relief" in the films of James Bond, the problem is that it's hard to say the difference between his characters in comedy and his "serious" characters in action movies like this. <b /> As for the plots .. They repeat the same set of pieces so that you will again think that you watched the Day of Rising 2. It is assumed that the fact that they continue to use the same scene that Geronimo came out of jail should be comical Ummm, ieah, ani. On the plus side, the Malta scene is pretty marvelous, so I kicked her up to 2 for me. Littering Maltese tourism for several decades.
