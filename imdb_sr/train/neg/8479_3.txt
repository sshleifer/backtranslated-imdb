Okay, when I came to the board for this movie, I really expected people to mock it. I was surprised when I liked people older than 7 years old. I enjoyed the movie ... but only b / c I and my younger sister (who, in fact, only 10) mocked the whole thing. I'm sorry, Jordan, but the acting was horrible. You know that the film is heading towards the toilet when the lead can not work. And he did not even have a good script or plot to buy it. I also thought that the character of Pamela was very lame ... pathetic at the border. Even with those words, I thought there were several good actors, such as Spencer, Hollivood, and Ronnie. Still, it's not enough to buy a movie. Two things about this movie that I can not overcome: 1.) To Spencer's been for her. Okay, eve. I looked at the dates and, while in reality, he was just about four years older than her, the difference in the "Go Figure" looked much larger. Jordan is a very pretty girl, but in GF, she looked like 10 or 12 ... she seemed like a little child! Jake Abel (Spencer) looked like a student. 2.). There is a way for Kristi Iamaguchi to come just to skate for one girl. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it seemed almost unlikely that Christie would go to boarding school that did not even have slip fellowships, or that the school would have such a connection with such connections. . It's all said ... it was not the worst movie ever known, but it was not very good even under DCOM standards, which I consider quite low.
