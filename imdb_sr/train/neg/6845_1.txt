"I went to the movies, to see" Beat Street "/ it was not bad, it was kinda" neat / "Krush Groove" was a movie, which I did not mind / but when it came to "Rappin," I pulled the line. "Tell your mother. Want to quit? It's just a small-style rhyming-style style" that is exposed in this waste film and location permits. Mario Van Peebles is one of the main actors, and as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is an inferior bodybuilder. Each movie that calls itself "Rappin" better delivered it to the highest standard of that genre of that time. Why were the 6-year-olds rolling on the passage even on days when the standards were so high up to their knees - "Webster"? Because this rap is weak. It's so weak that even B.E.T. or Comedi Central will touch it with a gold chain of 10 feet. Blondie's "Rapture" is poetic poetry next to this doctor Suess in the hood. So do not be a fool, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
