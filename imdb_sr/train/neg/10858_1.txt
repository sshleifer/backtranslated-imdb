I did not know if I would laugh or cry I would see this. Only dependent fans of the dirt data could have a taste for it. This should be a horror movie, but in this there is only dirt. The most painful scene is car accidents, with real special effects from the best Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. Take a look at this only for studies on how bad film can be ................
