It definitely fits into the time period when Akis and Allies played spy games in much of North Africa and the rest of the world. This is not the best of movies, but certainly not the worst of budget films as previously described in the War Classics compilation. Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was actually very good at one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the performance of Harri Parke (which is considered Parkiarkarkus). Why he never got a bigger role than me. He played the perfect role of a partner and saved the movie ... imho. As said, this film was part of a budget package from Superbok-Mart called War Classics. Eight eight-movie films, which included other films that have not been heard, and have some decent stars trying to pay bills. Editing and cinema is ... up. If you can skip all this and want to see a future Cisco Kid and a great helper who has unfortunately never fulfilled your real potential, definitely pick it up! Otherwise, there are other VV2 movies for watching. -Thunderossa.
