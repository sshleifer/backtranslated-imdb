It was really so bad. At the same level with (gracious!) Short-lived TV series "Dirty Dozen" played by Ben Murphy and filmed at the same time (also in cheap Yugoslavia). I was uncomfortable for the actors of this film - and especially for Telli Savalas. He was too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Taley's Greco in this and John Vaine in "The Green Berets" pretty much sums up. > Other reviewers have pointed out to some of the many funny chickens that contain this crime against celluloid, so I will not repeat them here. But I'll add that I'm amazed that no one has ever mentioned the ridiculously tiny helmet Savalas wears on his big, overwhelming head. I am also amazed that this automobile ship on IMDb got a grade of 4.7. As far as I'm concerned, it's "1" right across the road. "If you want a good example of why franchising to death is a really bad idea (especially 20 years or more after the original) - do not look farther than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission". <Br /> <br /> Terrible - Avoid !!!!
