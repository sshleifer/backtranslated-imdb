A stupid, often funny bang that involves landing a spaceship and the resulting devastation caused by this on Jeff Daniels and people in his orbit. He showed such a depth and promise from 1983 as "Enchantment Conditions", such as Shirley MacLaine's son-in-law. As the years passed, Daniels was not able to grasp good, fleshy roles. Instead, he is in pointless comedies such as "Dumb and Dumber." As for this picture, it collapses on the subject. At least the television show has led to a variety of situations. In the film we have a constant slapstick and people who turn into monsters because the government is condemned to capture Martian-Martin. Part of Mrs. Brovn is a perfect example of a film failure. On television, Pamela Britton introduced the ditsy individual caught in situations in which Martian left her confused. In the film version, a blue bomb like Brovn tries to make romantic complications. Television star Rai Valston has a small role of a government agent, or is he really the one? <br /> <br> It's a very big disappointment for those who enjoyed so much on a television show.
