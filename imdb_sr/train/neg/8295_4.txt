I'm inclined to love movie-oriented films. I also think Hope Davis turns into a consistently good job, so I hoped for this film. These hopes soon disappeared. The main disadvantage in this film is the direction. There are many scenes that are dreamers. The film often uses Denis Leary's character as the alter ego character of Campbella Scotta. It does not even work for me. It would work better like a piece of film. Also, there are problems with complication. It is important that the characters in the movie go on the road and end up in a place that is different from the place they started. I did not feel that the characters grew in the experiences shown in the film. Finally, editing was also not good. In the middle of the film there was a very great relaxation that was extremely boring. Besides the acting, which I felt consistently strong, this film has collapsed in almost all aspects of the film.
