If I knew this film was shot in an upsetting Dogme 95 style, I would never rent it. Still, I took a dramatic drama for marine illness and gave it a chance. I spent very, very, very long forty minutes before I gave up. It's just a boring, pretentious task. The last French film I saw was "Romantic" and it was also pretty sad, but at least the camera was stable and does not breathe a series of characters time. I am confused about the constant popularity of Dogme 95 abroad - in America it will catch at about the same time as the next big appearance of wrinkles. (It's called Dogme 95 because it's the average number of times the actors are in the eye). <br /> <br />
