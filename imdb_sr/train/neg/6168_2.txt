Hmm, IMDb rating of 7.5, good comments, blah, blah ... okay, two of my friends and myself, we ordered Pico, sat down and wanted to see something as cool as Ichi or at least something smart, but funny like Versus. But Naked Blood was sucked. It's a complete waste. Ok, the scene with a woman who likes to eat is extraordinary. But that's it. Nothing more. I will not wander the plot, other people have already done this, I just wanted to stop the hyper. But be careful and evaluate for yourself. Maybe we can push the rating where it should be. Another thing that comes to my mind: soundtrack is worse than Carpenter has ever been - okay, John's cool ... :)
