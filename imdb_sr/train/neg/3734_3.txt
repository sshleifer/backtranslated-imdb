A truly confused, incomprehensible mess. Most of the things in the movie look more or less like in 1987, but then there are futuristic things that have just been inserted, like a police air pistol. And that car! The director seemed to be in love with colored lights. The only impressive performance was the girl who played Valeri, but since there was no acting list, I do not know who the actress is. This is missing. Grade: F
