Dil was an unforgettable movie that brought Celuloid to a great director like Indra Kumar. The film came after Beta, Ishk, Raja and Fat were all superb. But then every successful director gives a couple of horrific films along with some hits. Piare Mohan is one of such films. Although comedies are well-told, then the viewers are not able to laugh. Compared to the types of comedy they are making today, this is stupid. If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please, do not look at this. Because that pathetic comedy just cries. In short, the movie is worth the miss.
