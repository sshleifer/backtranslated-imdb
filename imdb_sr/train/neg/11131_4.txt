First, I agree with a fairly small selection from Mr. Chomsky's mouth. His unusual delivery of an interesting counterpoint is what makes a man a hit in the university campus circus. He came across a cute, modest, pragmatic one. He does not satisfy the current political style (disgusting bipartisanism) and sets his views to the far left and the far right, punishing both of them for good reason. Unfortunately, the film itself is messy. In fact, I would not call it a documentary, but a collection of speeches. Watching "Rebel Vithout a Pause" does not differ from watching the speakers in a segment recorded in 3 hours on CSPAN. No camera movement, no editing, no styling touch. No story, no story. Technically speaking, production is strictly amateur. Audio is horrible and inconsistent; sometimes we do not hear Noam talking, for the second time we can not hear the questions posed by those who attend. When Noam speaks rarely, we are allowed to see the audience's reactions except when he gave us a quick shot of his wife who obviously attends each of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie and I would say that it is better to check his tapes on a tape or a CD to listen to them in the car. 4 out of 10 stars ... and today I am generously moody.
