I just finished the marathon of this series, and it became painful to watch it progress. From the fiction of historical elements to O'Herley's terrible accent in later episodes, the show is just going to go as far as it goes. If you are looking for some kind of low-quality production of a generalized wave of VV2, then I could recommend Season 1, but avoid nothing after that, degenerate a step from the soap, with ever-worse stories and sensibility. Old black film is by far the best of any type of fun with Colditz's name, and even that's not what we can hope for.
