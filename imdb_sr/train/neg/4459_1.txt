I'm not saying this because the production values ​​were so low, but because it was terribly recorded. That clip of a girl who wash her hair in a stream? Did we really have to sit and watch how it works for 5 minutes in the same place? It was terrible, the lighting was simply bad. You could barely see something and when the characters talked, you hardly heard what they were saying. Have I watched the whole movie? Of course, I did not skip most of this, and I do not want to hear someone say that I have to watch first, in order to judge everything. This film was so badly made and performed that even by independent and low-budget standards it's simply horrible. A terrible film ... do not waste time on it, unless you want to make a good laugh, but even then it's not because of the "funny" roles of the actors, but because the production is bad.
