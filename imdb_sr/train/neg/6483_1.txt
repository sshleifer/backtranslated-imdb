It was not good. The characters were underdeveloped and the only person was from the memory I had about the previous film that was in contrast to the 'new' person (or their lack). I seriously thought that Ariel's nightmare was a nightmare because it was absurd. It was serious. It only reminded me of all the boring characters on the Disney Channel - everyone is hyperactive, and the story goes from action to unpleasant scene without any connection. \ T, not surprising. In the original, Ariel had an incredible and powerful voice and all the songs were attractive and fun. Remember them and want to sing them. But the songs in this movie were at least not creative; it's as if they speak in the boring voice of singing - quite weak, disappointing. I do not have that feeling that you would want to sing, which you usually get from Disney's movie. As if nobody wanted to do this film, so they barely tried. . . this film should be a new line of stories, new impressive songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the boring "look at me! Look at me! I'm so boring!" the mentality of this generation Disney. : '(
