I wanted Drawing Blood to give priority to initial suspicion. The initial moments, with a naked woman expelled and a painter, Diana, who will paint her, and then suck her blood to exhaust it in order to use it for her art, leaves the impression that this could be a scaried vampire flick. It turns out that this initial impression turns out to be false. Oh, Troma, a sign of some kind of lack of quality: it will sometimes offer something that is garbage, but funny and with at least some competence for craft food (or, sometimes not). This is a case in which it's not even fun to watch since the humor attempt (ie, the protagonist's father is the old Vaudevilian who Jimmy Durante impresses?) Bad at best, and any unintentional laugh is undermined by Sergio Lapel's And it's not without his Attempt, oh, My Lord. Trying a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for the lights, but the way they were used in the film made me, a former student and film director, came to my place: if I saw it at the theater, I would have to be blind in many cases, and he would ask if his DP really understood the basic setting of lighting at three points. While this, along with a very poor sound design (or just random loud buzzing as the scene of an art gallery) should not be something that attracts attention during the release of Trom, it should be something basic * that a filmmaker can catch himself in even if the script is not so funny or scary (and not) or if Lapel makes a strange mix of songs set at bizarre moments. It's not a good movie, and maybe even if you're a vampire stubborn (or just a vampire period) may have some attraction as a cheap alternative to a cheap medium near the Dark, or as a little improvement over, say, Bloody a freak from 1972. You have better ways to waste time, total.
