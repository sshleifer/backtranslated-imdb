Imagine that you are a high school student, in a dark, dark theater with his girlfriend. How much film should be bad, so you feel compelled to leave the theater and go home before it's over? This film is so bad. Really. Movies often become so bad that they are good; this film is out of that bad phase. It's painful, it's bad. Terrible, terrible, a crime against humanity is bad.
