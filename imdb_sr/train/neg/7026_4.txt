On his birthday, little boys tell their mother that she is not her son, and that she wants to go home to her real mother. In a way, the comedy De L'Innocence feels like it comes from a different one. filming time, perhaps the sixties or seventies. It certainly reminded me of Losei's Secret Ceremony (1968) and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977), dealing with loss, sadness and relationships between parents and 'lost' children. > All three films are filled with insensitive characters that act strangely and unexplainably. All three films have a cool feeling, both emotional and literally. All three films focus on the relationship between mother and child, and finally all three films ask the question - "what is real, what is imagined?" Beautiful, but flawed, does not offer simple answers and leaves much more, inexplicable and strange.
