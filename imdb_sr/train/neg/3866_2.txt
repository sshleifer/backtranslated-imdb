I thought this film had absolutely no morale. I mean, how would you feel your fianc√©e left you on the wedding day for your cousin? I'd be broken! It's classified as a comedy, but it was not funny at all. I thought she mostly found cheap laughs and took them. I usually love movies by Julie Styles, but this is an exception. Jason Lee plays another shameful show, which once again proves that class and decent morality are not relevant in today's society. He had a complete lack of taste and I despise such films. I understand that people will defend this film and its morale, because it is "Just a movie", but I am still standing with my sign that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you are a bad person, because everyone has the right to their own opinions, and the parts of this movie were pleasant, I'm just saying that in real life, people act like the characters in this movie were shameful .
