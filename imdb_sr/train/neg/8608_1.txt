This film features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Dovey. He also boasts of always pleasant Larri Miller in too small a part. Nevertheless, I discovered that this is almost invisible. Michel Monaghan may be beautiful, but she is almost completely harassed, and the reasons for Dows's character's obsession with her character are not at all understandable in terms of the information that the film presents or the way it is shown. The ending seems pretentious and although it seems to us that the goal is to join the audience with nodding and hinting film, as it has not brought us to the side of our protagonists leaves us unhappy or incapable of doing it. Filmmakers say that those who disagree simply "do not understand". I do not think that's the case. The action was not complicated or incomprehensible. He just did not get involved and clumsily and obviously produced. Paddy Breathnach "I Vent Dovn" and Gui Ritchie's "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock and Your Smoking Barrels" are much better realized examples of the type of film that Shane Black fails to achieve. I share a birthday with Shane Black, but a look at his credits (mostly as a screenwriter) requires me to separate myself from any other connection.
