The film did what it wanted: to show how a young girl was born with poverty and grew into maturity. However, for most of us, this topic has been explored in an adequate way and in most cases with more sophistication than it has been done here. The film was fixed on the chest, which soon became annoying and I lost interest. If this was on TV, I would go over to the latest news about the Starr Report. I found this film so boring.
