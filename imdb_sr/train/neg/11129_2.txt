See the 1936 version. As personally unpleasantly finding the voice of Charles Boiere, he is more likely to pay the cosmopolitan, depressing Rudolf - I think Omar Sharif is trying, but not - too cute and lively. Catherine Denueve (sp) except she's too old does not look like Marie - nothing! It seems too sophisticated to even think of dying for love for this man in such a way. The only actor in the whole movie that carries the role that she plays is Ava Gardner whose appearance appears as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is quite short (and look for pictures of the Empress has more than a passing similarity), such as the historical, Empress Elisabeth was not so involved in Rudolf's life.
