I asked to watch a movie for my work, so I did not pay it (on the contrary, I got a salary), but I still thought the film was much worse than the average. The jokes were poor, the two leading actresses ... well, to use the division of women's clubs "First Women's Club" in Hollywood, they are no longer in the "hot" age than in the era of "District Attorney". What made me most angry in the movie was the main dash, which was almost completely plagued by "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(in which all the guys are jazzed about a guy who offers them money to "do his wife", not understanding is expected that she will kill her). All in all, a mild piece of shit.
