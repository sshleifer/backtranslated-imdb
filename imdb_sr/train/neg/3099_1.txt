This film is not only bad, not only rugged, but also repulsive. Something about Daphne, about the damn girl, about the whole damn movie (and I use the word literally) radiates a grotesque that would offend a mistress in a brothel. This film makes my skin crawl, I'm sorry I have reproductive organs, and I feel impure. One of the things most troubling me in this movie is that they used such a good concept. The creature that creates fantasies with catastrophic results, rather than the cliche Vorst Nightmare and overdone Tvisted Vish, is truly a fascinating film idea. Thought: The reason why hobgobline needs to be killed before the day is attracted to them by strong lights. During the day, no strong lights appear, so they can go anywhere. Count on Hobgobline: Four hobgoblins come out of the movie studio, and yet at least nine of the dangerous plush Toys are killed during the movie. Question for discussion: If you had a frigid, demanding, reluctant girl, would you enter combat equipment in a war head garden? Explain.
