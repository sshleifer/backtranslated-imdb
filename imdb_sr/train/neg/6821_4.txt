It was a good story, but not really good. I liked the topics and the main story, which was not as clear as it could have been. Perhaps too much was happening and the lack of ability to launch it all. The acting was fine for the cheese, some were stronger than others, and even the stronger actors had their moments of lower quality. It took me a couple of months to go through the whole movie because it did not keep my attention and the flow was bad. I just finished watching, and I'm glad I did it because the movie is finally moving and has a certain continuity to the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was a couple. I'd recommend it for a story, and maybe a little candy, and I think a bit.
