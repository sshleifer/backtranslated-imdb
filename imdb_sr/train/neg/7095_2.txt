The "Sexual Addiction Diary" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsion. Probably a film scam, this film is a stylish shot with a good acting role and little bit of it. In the end, the "Diary ..." would convince us that our character of sex addicts has the dumbest woman in the world, the barn of those girls who have nothing better than dropping panties for him, and there is no business despite being a caterer. At best, this movie could be a good drama. In the worst case, cheap softcore. "Diary ..." is not even between now and now. This is for the container. (D-)
