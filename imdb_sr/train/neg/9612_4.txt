Until the end, the bad guys have the upper hand - always - which call into question the competence of good guys. Several innocent men accused of a crime are irritating. Some unnecessary dialogue that discusses various boring legal issues. This is only the central stupid western, so what is the nonsense about keeping things "real"? Cagnei's atypical presence in the West is one of the few - if not the only - a fun thing about a movie. Somewhere in the middle is a funny time marriage; in a way like "Where is Kid hidden ?! Where is he ?! ... Oh, and by the way, will you marry me?"
