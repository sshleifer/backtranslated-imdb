This is one of the most honored films I've had to cope with! I should have expected this, after I saw the first two, but they constantly drag me into these types of films with the idea "Maybe they did it this time." No, it's not close. Where can I start? How would it be with special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what is going on for the SFX in this movie, at one point the soldier shoots at "Raptor" as he passes down the hallway. Even with less than a second of the screen, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail that is obviously attached to him running around. Bad bad bad bad. What do you think of the acting? If that's what you can call. There is one character which, I suppose, should be from the south. However, after six years of life in the south, I never heard such a conversation. There may be some strange disability - the inability of a normal conversation. It's fascinating to me that the character does not do anything that requires him to have that emphasis - so there was no reason for the actor to do it. And what about the complication? It's pretty basic - the Raptors have escaped, people with weapons have to hunt them. I'm beginning to wonder why dinosaurs in these films always find themselves in the closest tunnel system ... would not they be left to catch prey? Well, at least they have a good idea to appear very little in the film that is supposedly spinning around them. Other things - Let's say you are in the building and know that there are people who eat raptors running around in it. Would you decide to take the time to discuss who is better - an army or a marine? And then you decide to have a wrestling competition to solve it? What do you say about the idiotic idea that they have to find raptors - split into groups for two. Have they ever seen horror films (Or at least Scooby Doo episode)? In short, this is one of the stupid movies out there. You missed him if you do not want to shake your movie.
