from the beginning of this film, you soon become aware that the name of the movie has nothing to do with the film itself, watching a naked woman being persecuted by people in very stupid masks for servants running in the worst clothes I've ever seen. and all of this in sub-titles makes this kind of film that needs to be considered twice on the look and how the movie slowly moves along you soon realize that the vampire is not a vampire, so you have to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film Pierre and he is the father, but how the film it comes to his really stupid ending, you will have to think why the film is over and that they had a better ending if only the heads of this is not a movie to watch basically
