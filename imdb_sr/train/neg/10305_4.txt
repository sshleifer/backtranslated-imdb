As an engineer, I must say that the first season of this show began very promising. Most of the applied mathematics were somewhat credible, and the relationships shown between Eppes brothers and father showed that the show was interesting. Most of the math and technology used in dealing with crime is now completely meaningless and very funny for all people involved in science and technology in reality. the amount of money continues to go into the production of each episode, but in the end, it is degraded to a very unpleasant delicious dish that is a mixture of Action C and CSI style policemen. You will watch it, you will only go for the first season, and maybe for another. After that I would not waste my time. I showed myself in the middle of season 3. Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars Calculate up to 4 stars. Since Charlie no longer knows his mathematics, I will not bother myself with my correctness.
