This film introduces quite a number of characters and their relationships in the first half hour. None of them creates any interest or positive answer. I waited for the intrigue to begin, hoping that things would get better and finish until the end of the bitter end, but there was no reward for it. Action for me is not worth reading. Not that the story was so bad, I guess I could say that I had some problems with the script - i.e. I thought she was stinking. A look at the points will show you that there is a pretty strong voice here, which is used without success. Most of the old professionals in this film are doing good jobs; from actors that I did not see much before I particularly loved Deborah Kara Unger. That's all I can say about this picture.
