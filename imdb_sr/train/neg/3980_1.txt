No, I'm not kidding. If he ever suggests a film idea, he should be kicked out of the studio. I'm serious. Their films are exactly the same in each of them, and they consist only of traveling to foreign locations, with problems that they easily solve, hoping to be popular, and to get new guys. Think about that. If you've ever seen a movie in which you played them with a different plot, contact me and tell me his name. These "movies" are bad excuses to be on television and go to other countries. There is reason why movies never go to theaters. I'm sure that when they were really young and made some O.K. movies, some bosses have bought all their rights for 15 years or so, so now, when, what, 17, they can film movies in other countries whenever they want to use the money of the studio. Let me advise you, STAY FROM MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY! FOR YOUR YOUR GOOD!
