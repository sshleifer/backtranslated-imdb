... poorly intentionally bad ... This little gem was shot directly on the large MST3k screen. Although it is obvious that the film does not try to seriously understand (I hope that their goal, in any case ...), the film is still bad. To hell, it makes Leprechaun in the universe a big budget ... In short: paint my muscle car drawing!
