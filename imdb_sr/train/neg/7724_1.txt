Seeing all the negative reviews for this movie, I realized that this could have been another comic-remake that should not have been. I watched the first two scenes of the struggle, listening to the generic dialogue that Lungren had told, and all the other thumping Oriental actors, and the movie I found so horrible that it was funny. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the liners begin to fly, the action breaks down, the script writers begin to drink, and the film is a welcome one because it turns into the worst action movie IKADA. Lungren has won his previous efforts in "Punisher" and others, as well as all Van Damme films, Seagal's films and Stallone's non-Rockie films for this special honor. This film has an absolutely worst performance (see Tie Carrera's face when in any scene with Dolph, it's been laughing), with the worst dialogue ever (a commentary by Brandon Lee about Little Dolph is the worst line ever in the movie) and the worst sections in the movie Dolph in a full Japanese suit). Picture "Tango and Cash" with worse acting, meets "Commando", meets "Friday 13." (due to the senseless nudity and Lungren's performance as Jason Voorhees), in an hour and fifteen minutes of jokes of the film. A good (how awkward) play is going to a bad guy (who still seems to be constipated throughout his performance) and Carrera (who somehow says 5 rows without laughing). Brandon Lee is just a Lungren assistant and a terrible job. Grozes, horrible movie. Be afraid of it and avoid it. If you still look at it, ask yourself why underwater photos are twice clearer than most non-underwater images. Speaking of underwater footage, take a look at the scene with a crazy battle of water with the worst end of the fight. This film has every version of a bad combat scene for those who have a short range of attention and fill the flashes of nudity. Bad bad movies !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
