"54" is a film based on the notorious "Studio 54" of the 1970s - a hangout for a social elite and party clubs. In the film, Rian Phillippe is the main character, based on a real employee of the Studio from 1977 to 1982. He tries to be really dirty and studying satire like "Boogie Nights", but ultimately comes as inferior vannabe. Mike Miers gets an ungrateful task of playing the owner of a club that snored cocaine Steve Rubell. It's just a little comedy role, and if it was Majer's best attempt to get into a drama like Lemmon and other comedians in their own time, that's a complete failure. Interesting, but instead, it's just another stupid teenage movie that's not funny or even fun. A look at your own risk.
