Slowly, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder the Veinstein company did not buy this. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming and stop producing. There is no way you can watch it and enjoy it. A preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2-minute movie with this idea which is not a feature. I'm sorry I rented this movie. I will never see anything with the name Spurlock on it. It's totally trash. Such filmmakers should be on iTunes and never get a license to distribute. The film says that American consumers and their buying are guilty of instant depression when they buy and buy products, making money in the system is the basis of a healthy economy.
