Something that does not really go wrong with Al Gore (and his supporters) by theory is the whole thing about "consensus." If there was such a consensus, why are "believers" in an all-powerful global warming feel an unstoppable need to try and abuse anyone who puts them in question. Why is he who do not follow the global warming line to come up with complacent accusations that they are either stupid or on the payroll lists of oil companies (obviously a professional global warming researcher does not mean that you are on someone's payroll in this wondrous world ...) Why is there such a need for everyone says the whole issue is solved, ka For the very idea of ​​answering these questions, read Prei from well-known oil master Michael Crichton ... Wait, he's rich, not on payroll lists of oil companies. He's just he took a huge risk for his career in not leaving the line of Green and other Kyoto believers and told the truth while he was researching. By the way, did you know that adhering to the Kyoto protocol would result in almost no lowering of the temperature, according to its own supporters? Only a few questions that Al Gore wanted to avoid getting every penny of an ecological lobby in case he decides to run again. So, who is the marionette ..?
