Whenever Columbo talks deviate from a known plot (a colorful killer committed a crime, Columbo smokes a killer, Columbo becomes a process in that process), the writers somehow are never able to meet the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode deviates in the extreme, and the result is a big flop. Would you believe: Columbo never confronts the criminal to the very end? !! Honestly, I was tempted to turn it off for about two-thirds. Oh, victims who self-made reviewers give !!!
