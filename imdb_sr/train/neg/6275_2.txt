A very unnecessary movie with characters that behave so immodestly that I did not care who would best feel (or was it the goal of the movie, to show some smooth people talking cold-blooded New York?) And no comedy. The play is a very flat and very predictable plot. What made me most annoying, it was a constant joke with quotes from classic movies. Man, do not you see the more you cite, the less important your film is? Try to be original! Small budget is not an excuse, nor the first time. Brave, shy, shitty. No wonder it cost me only one dollar ...
