As a big fan of gorillas in general, I expected this to be great - as far as the effects of the gorilla were concerned, they were pretty good, however - that's the only thing I can write about this flop. The film claims to be based on a true story, but it is not nearly as close to what actually happened to the "Buddy" - who in real life was the famous Gargantuan, sold to Ringling Bros. in our alleged "heroic" movie. Gertrude Lintz, whom many animal enthusiasts know as a woman who hardly had the best animals in the best interest. As for Buddy's presentation to become aggressive, it was a total fiction and at no time burning, in real life, did not resort to such behavior. The friend, in fact, escaped from his wooden crate (not the caged room's room as shown in the movie) during the storm, in order to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which frightened Gertrude Lintz to sell it. No, Buddi was not released into the gorilla family surrounded by a lush tree in the zoo - he was abandoned in a wooden chest, deep in the back of the garage for some time with only one light for comfort, and then sold a circus - where he actually lived a better life with peanuts dumped on him until he died (historically oldest living gorilla on record, by the way) before performing in Miami. Also notice in the film how Buddi grows, but the chimpanzee never grows old. (Chimpanzees, by the way, have not been raised simultaneously with other animals, including Buddha, as shown in the film)
