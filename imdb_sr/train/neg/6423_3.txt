For the first 30 minutes Tinseltovn lifted my fingers on the remote control, ready to turn to see something else. The presumption of the two writers, who brought them happiness, lived in the "bin" for storage, and it was slightly fun, but painfully insensitive. Introduction to the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - a great film character, living in the park and sleeping in the toilet, offered hope and I decided to give him a few more minutes. And then a few more while Kristi Svansons does not present himself as a film director and a border nymphomaniac, adding a little spice. Her solid acting performance increased her presence above and beyond just a welcome eye. moments. Some of my favorite films of all time were low budget, Vhithnail & I was the one who is dealing with 2 boys with sleep, but for their happiness. However, for my money, actors save Tinseltovn from the archive "horrible movie" and just push it into the archives "maybe it was a cult movie". I laughed loudly on some of the scenes that included the figure of Joe Pantolian. Especially, the last scene in a terrible clich√©, but still a funny house rich, but freaky characters, where the story flashes until the last moments. I see how Tinseltovn was an excellent theater play, and as the filmmakers did their best to translate this into celluloid, it simply did not work and while loudly laughing at some scenes and in a single line, I think it was The first 30 minutes weakened my senses and expectations The degree I would laugh at on anything. Unless you get stuck in a coffee shop, do not take it if you see it in a cheap bucket.
