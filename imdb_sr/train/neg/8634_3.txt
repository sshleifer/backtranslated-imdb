Seeing the photo of a man who was attacked by zombies gave me the hope that Lucio "Zombie" Fulci will be on his old tricks. Unfortunately, in addition to the prominent windows of a rotten corpse, in this story of the murder of a rich man and his daughter's quest to discover who killed him, there is little to be recommended. None of the characters is appealing and when you find out how they did it (at least it was weird), stop worrying. The only good thing I can say is that she made more sense than the Nightmare concert!
