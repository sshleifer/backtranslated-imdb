This is no doubt the absolutely worst film Steven Seagal has ever made. And that's a lot of talk. Do not be fooled by rating, it's too good. This horror was not worthy of even the 0/10 ratings, if such a thing existed. - You absolutely do not have wages - The worst action scene ever, and there are not too many of them. - Seagal does not do anything myself, including fighting, talking (a lot of duplication), and so on. As always. - Seagal is fat, lazy and does not care about this movie. Something that's completely obvious as long as it takes Take all the other DTV movies Seagal made, multiply them by one another, multiply them with thousands of billions, and all that bad thing you got. He even describes 1% of this absolute crapfest.
