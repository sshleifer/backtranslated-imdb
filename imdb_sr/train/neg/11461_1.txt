Please do not spend +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just do not. Especially if someone is happy to retire to you. Damn face if you ask me. I was waiting for something to happen - it was never. I'm not one of those people who stopped watching the movie. I always have to see him all the way. What a big mistake. Do yourself a favor and paint the wall and watch it dry - far more fun. Please do not spend +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just do not.
