It's hard to say almost the hatred I have from this movie. But I will try: Every other word was explosive, the scenes of sex were uncomfortable, the drugs were unbridled and the stereotypes were out of norm, if not offensive to Americans from Italy. I do not say that the acting was terrible, because they are Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brodi, Espisito et. They all showed up well. But ... almost every character in a movie that I despised. Ever since The Bonfire of the Vanities I did not like every character on the screen.
