I'm not sure how to start describing how bad this movie is. I love bad movies because they are often the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music and rude modes. With the exception of music (which was better than I expected), this film had all these qualities. Special effects were incredibly bad. The worst I've seen from Nintendo 64. Some of the scenes to watch include Thunderchild, a woman who is crushed by a mechanical foot, a Big Ben scene, a wreck of a train ... Vov, there are so many bad effects! On the plus side, however, some scenes from aliens are well made. The act was as bad as it could be, because it was based directly on H.G. book. Vellsa. For such a good source material, it's almost as if the actors were trying to be so hot that it would be ridiculous. And there are also mustaches ... the funniest piece of hair on the face I've seen for a long time. Of course, only half the film contains an act. The rest are characters that walk aimlessly and cause bad effects. Say that Timothy Hines is an unsuitable director, would be an injustice to incompetent directors. Using different color filters between images for no special reason, using poorly-derived backgrounds for even the scene, bad green recording, it's amazing how this man ever received permission to direct the movie. I would not even think it would be possible to turn a great book into this bad movie. Goodbye, Mr. Hines. Well done. My advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what I did: have friends who enjoy bad movies, drink, play poker while watching, drinking, and maybe you do it all to the end. It's a great bad movie, so have fun and laugh at yourself with this catastrophe.
