I rent it, then shoot me! The appropriate premise puts otherwise an unfortunate story without the right payment, but at least it's well recorded. Director Jon Keeies takes a simple idea of ​​a fake house with terrible danger. In most cases, this should be dashed, but this little stinker quickly disappears. Cinema is above average and acting is at best central, but storytelling and writing are simply terrible. Slower scenes retreat forever, and fears are too small and far between, without the true climax of the film. A nice mood is set in the beginning, but it loses its glow before any type of horror appears, and I found myself dying to death and making a new sandwich ... The wrap is attractive and I suppose it is worth hiring if you are looking for a foolish budget, but If you enjoy a good story and content ending, reach for something else.
