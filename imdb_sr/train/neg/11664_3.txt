I wanted so much to enjoy this movie. She was moving very slowly and she was just boring. If it was on TV, it could take 15 to 20 minutes. What happened to the story? The big actor and photographer worked on an incorrect basis. If it's loosely based on the director's life, why did not he come across someone to see that the writing was "loose". Then he directed it to the puddle pace that may have been the source of several people who nodded during the film. Music rises, but for a different movie, not for this ... for the soap opera. There were times when the dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuler Stahl spoke. I was not alone because I heard a few words about who told anyone. Why Hollivood can not make better movies? This one had the grunts of great stories, but he was only badly derived.
