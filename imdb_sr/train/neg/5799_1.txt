I hired this film yesterday mostly because of the fine art and the abstract on the back of the jacket. After I dug it into a DVD plaier, I again checked the jacket cover and although I removed the plastic wrapper, I still could not read any production of detailed information about the movie. This movie is titled "Evil on jacket" and you had to find it by going to the Faith Films website to find out any connection with it here on the IMDb. ... THERE, the actor spoke. Oh dear ... reading this actor sounded like some high school jockey with a dull face whose voice managed to change the direction, and no attempt to go beyond reading lines from the script. At first I thought that I had a bad disk from audio synchronization, and then I had to assume it was a foreign movie because I could not read the jacket ... An English dialogue called. If they cast the right person for the dubbing of the dialogue, this film MOÅ½DA was decent. I gave her a chance in about 20 minutes before I dropped it when I found out that the bad line reader would not be killed, but will remain as a constant main role. Yes, that's bad! The jacket cover and art made in the movie are great, giving it one star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for a broken dialogue. I do not recommend this!
