This film should never have been filmed. Frankly, I must admit that before I saw it, I had serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, although she has done many films in the Netherlands, and the young woman who took on the lead is a TV person with a constant smile on her face and a little self-criticism. The actor who played the second major part I recently saw in Bridesmaids and although the film is better, he did not convince me. To begin with the story, I did not read the novel on which it is based, but the scenario that underlines the film is something that may have been done with regard to children who have a birthday party in the rain Sunday afternoon, not one of the same year as the director who loves to watch good movie. Something really disturbing were the covered dialogues, mostly spoken loudly. Say hello to the cameraman, at least he tried to do something. It is a pity that the film was arranged bad, if not, some scenes were certainly more credible.
