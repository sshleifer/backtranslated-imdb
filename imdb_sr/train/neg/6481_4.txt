Since Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was little, I was curious about his sequel. Small siren (one) is a classic animated feature with top quality, great music points and a target for the general audience. On the contrary, Little Mermaid 2 is directed primarily to young children, because it is spontaneous, reflects the child's perspective, music is more reflexive and less dramatic, and the ending feels like a break. The Little Mermaid 2 begins when the baby Melody presents to Ariel's side of the family. Abruptly without any visual signs that would help drama, the giant tentacle catches the baby. I laughed, wait a little, it's not funny, the baby is attacked! Okay, I'll stop laughing. Morgan's crime in the middle of the white day and her spontaneity takes away a potential drama since it happened so quickly. Through the story, Melody looks supernatural, which I defend as most children represent. This quality in Melody's character is clearly shown until the end when it fights with Morgan without any fear of the face. Like the first movie, Melody has many Ariel problems, except for the reverse. It turned out that Queen Ariel, like her father, was limiting her to the ocean, while King Triton limited Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody are rebelling against their parents. Music is moving more emotionally in the first. This sequel has a bunch of songs, but not so much of an orchestral work. It's great for the kids, because the orchestra does not need to impress them. The end of the first movie was strong and exciting. The sequel is finished with a song and everyone plays in the water. It's definitely more focused on children, because instead of finishing serious and leaving you blown away, this ending leaves you in mind: "It's time for a break!" After all, this movie is fun for kids, so they need to have fun.
