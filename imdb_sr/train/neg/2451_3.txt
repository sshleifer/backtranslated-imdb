This film causes more unintentional laughter than anything I've ever seen. Really, if you're a Tolkien fan, you rent it just to laugh with your friends. I do not want to be a millionaire who will tear his flaws ... all I will say is that the film (for me, anyway) has lost the main points for turning my favorite character, Sam, into a silly idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
