I'm a "bad" horror movie, but this was just a bunch of dogs! How anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me. If you like urgent editing to cover special effects, bad acting and bad script then go! There was no suspension, and the burning factor was ridiculous because he was so fake. I'll take a hostel or Volf Creek over this crowd every day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, he knows when he sees it. I, on the other hand, dumbly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it is better. No luck! I did not show him the second Torched movie and I doubt that I will be bothered now.
