With the title such as "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!", Everyone who goes to this thing would expect either a) a bad science fiction movie, or b) a comedy that ridicules bad science fiction films. It should be a mixture of both, with a dose of parody that is sprayed. Unfortunately, it falls very fast. You should never seriously grasp this film, I understand it, but you think it's funny, is not it? I found that only some of the jokes or situations were ridiculous (ie Telephone conversations one beside the other, a Russian Olympic spy eating steroid cereals, a Superman walking with Lois, etc.). "The attack of killer tomatoes" tries to be cult classic, but it fails. A cult classic is a movie that is so different that it is understood only by a selected group of people (or a similar description). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" can be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, so it can not be considered a cult film. There is one good actress in the whole thing: Sharon Tailor as Lois Fairchild. She is a skinny, sarcastic journalist, but she has a precious personality, she likes to exaggerate and is a natural comedian. Unfortunately, it is badly used here. "The attack of killer tomatoes" is not as funny as, say, the "Amazons of the Month" or "Kentucky Fried Fried," but I do not have a few hilarious moments, so I would still recommend seeing it once. Avoid overhead cuts, interruptions of movie producers, and some allegedly "lost" images called in converting the African dialect (it can be found in English on a strip that is no longer printed).
