One scene pretty good shows the mentality of "wife Terminator": Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villagers' camp. Karen runs through an armed guard, who is pointing a gun at her, but after a few seconds he throws him and causes a fight. Karen strikes him in the eggs, takes the gun and escapes! Then again, when the film is directed by a fighter and written / produced by another member of his family, you know that you do not need to be too much to expect. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble get some fun jokes in the early days, and the movie may prove to be better if it focuses more on their relationship of love and hate. But after 20 minutes they are separated, and the film slows down to creep, and even with the occasional fighting scene to revive, there is no excitement. In the Finals, Trimble fights against Kissy in the cave, and Sheperd goes to the bogey against a beautiful Ashley Haiden on a speedboat, but the struggles are intertwined in a way that breaks the flow and reduces their value. On the positive side, praising the costume department for Karen gives a chance to show spectacular d√©colletes throughout the film! (* 1/2)
