A very bad attempt on a young spine. At least the music in the spine was good. This is a really sad case of Hollywood nepotism at the worst. A bunch of Hollywood bosses, bad musicians and producers are creating a "poopie" show so that their children can be at the center of attention. Come on, please !!! The humorous humor was even bad. I hate these things when there are really incredibly talented children (musicians, actors and artists) who break their asss and thrive there. And that shit is coming. Why was not Gene Simmons in it? American taste in the party goes to the toilet.
