By 1941, Columbia was a large studio and could produce a film with the same technical lacquer as MGM, Paramount or Varners. This is the best thing that can be said about "Adam Had Four Sons", a lead sapun opera with almost final mild performances Ingrid Bergman (for the first time in an American film) and Varner Bakter. Bergman plays the French (that was the era in which Hollywood thought that one side was as good as the other), who was hired as a governor for Bacter's four sons and remains (with one break-up caused by the stock market crash of 1907) until the boys Adult men serving in the First World War. Just about everyone in the movie is so good-good that it's a relief when Susan Haivard as a crime enters halfway? she is the only person who can be seen in the film, although she clearly directs Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; it is also the first in a long line of alcoholic roles? but the script remains a saccharin and the place is utterly meaningless. No wonder Bergman rejected the similarly drawn "Valley of Decision" four years later.
