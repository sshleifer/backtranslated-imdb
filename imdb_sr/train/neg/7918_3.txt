I wrote that writing in this movie is absolutely terrible. The only thing that saved this film from me was that 1 out of 10 was performance by Lacy Chabert, which I thought was more personal. For me, she definitely was the highlight of this film. Dina Meier was as beautiful as ever, but I found my role to be beautiful, so I do not think that her acting was brilliant. > As for the male leader, Armand Assante, his interpretation of this role reminded me mainly of doctors in a series of hospitals in the 1980s. With that I could live it all. However, the horrible, terrible, terrible end / solution, the role of the psychic, and even the role of the psychic, were just some of the worst writings I had seen for a long time.
