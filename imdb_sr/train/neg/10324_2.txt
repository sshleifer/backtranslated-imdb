The small mosque is one of the saddest CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have a way to make the easiest comedy they can do for the oldest, lightest offensive viewers who for CBC means 85 years old farmers in Saskatchewan. All jokes are predictable and so deadly that I can not believe it. The performances are very humorous and they behave more, but I do not blame the actors because those types of one-dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the CBC sought and sought. Very lame jokes with bad jokes that they tried to present as "controversial" and less controversial than other annoying CBC comedies such as The Hour has 22 minutes, Roial Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer Report.
