After hearing about how this film is hilarious, I finally rent it in a video and for 75 minutes I may have laughed 3 times. This film, a collection of sketches that mock television, is a messy mess. Jokes are falling, humor deals with problems from the 1970s that are no longer relevant, and jokes go too long (almost like the new SNL skits the last few years). Yes, Chevi Chase is in this but maybe only 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that it was very rude and it was naked, but could not it be funny? Do you offer yourself a service and rent a movie Kentucky Fried which is far superior film made in
