I was awake last night watching this thing. The only thing I can say good about this terrible film is that film schools could use it to show how not to film the movie. There is no proper development of character, wait, I'm not even sure that these were characters. The settings were silly and pointless, and the excessive use of split screens was futile because sometimes they could not be synchronized with alternative footage. If I could give a zero or minus rating I would. Unfortunately, it's not worth the time for a few laughs. It's just a sad example of the money Hollivood spent, and now I'm wasting my time even thinking about it.
