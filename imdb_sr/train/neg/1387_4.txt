It's hard to believe that the "action" Jet Li movie could be so boring, but this was transcendental trash. The action is the amalgam of other Hong Kong chopsocki flickers. Combat skills are all special effects and no human talent. It is a comic story about a group of super-human soldiers who need to be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of them (Li) who holds an incompetent army to save them and renew the life of a pacifist librarian. Rescued killers appear with a quality complication in Austin Povers to take over the world, and Li throws out his new life to save the world. a thin plot and comic comics of 25 cents. But I guess even 8-year-olds who watched Ninja-Turtle could find this juvenile and hollow.
