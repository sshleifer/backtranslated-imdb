I have no idea what this is about ... This is a really bad movie ... it did not do anything to me, the only scene in which everyone is coming down at a party, and a beautiful song is playing, exciting and nice movie clips that make you move. ... it was the best part of the movie ... Otherwise, this film lacks everything that could suck the viewer. There is no story, there is nothing to think about as they say, there is no cohesion between different stories ... it was more an attempt to re-create Anderson's "Magnolia" that was brilliant, but it does not work muddy ... It's okay it's easy and easy to watch, but these are movie clips. Maybe you first write a story before you make a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've ever seen
