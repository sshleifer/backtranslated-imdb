This is a little less than a full flower based on the story of Stephen King. Two journalist from the tabloid, one experienced (Miguel Ferrer) and one not so successful (Julie Entvisle), are beginning to believe that the serial killer (Michael H. Moss) can be a vampire. Strange than unusual is that this modern bloodsucking does not go its own way naturally, but through the black Cessna it searches for its victims. The crowd is really terrible as the movie approaches its stupid finale. Keep in mind that Mr. King had nothing to do with this movie. I admit it's a little awful in the small night hours.
