Some commented here that this is the worst movie about Elvis ever made. Well, they're just partially right. For me, this is THE LARGEST FILM IN ANY TIME! I've never seen anything similar to the raw and abusive, and disgusting, and against human nature like this movie. Real shame for the film industry, this is not so bad, it's good. There is no fun campistic party that would be here as in some other Elvis bad movies like Clambake. This one is so hard to sit through his sick. Pure Garbage. Indians should sue for their bad clich√©s and stereotyped treatment here. In fact, maybe ALL human beings should be sued for a crime and a bad service, this film refers to the species as a whole. Grade: F
