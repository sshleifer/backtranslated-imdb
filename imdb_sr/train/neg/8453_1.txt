This film is a clich√© of clips from a recent cinema. There are some promising ideas there, but while the director clearly intended to end up with an unusually vague movie, what he had done with him was a confusing confusion. The main actor Daniel Vu does a fair job, but without a central theme it seems like there is not much to do with what he could do. Moreover, the film is largely deprived of fear (although, in fairness, there are some dreadful moments in the middle of hard work). MILD SPOILERS * We have the mysterious death of the alienated twin, devil librarians, spooky love interests, confusion of identity, the death of wild monkeys, oedipal clashes, offensive eyebrows, sublimated homosexuality, and ties criminal gangs. It seems that the only real common role of these elements is that they cause the protagonist to express an unclear feeling of confusion and dissatisfaction. Perhaps the biggest disappointing aspect of this movie is that despite the death of a monkey brother who is strongly displayed on DVD, the act itself is never directly displayed. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be a monkey video - not really scary. * END SPOILERS * Avoid this one. For a great psychological, ambiguous story about a horror, look at the Korean film The Two Sisters (2003).
