This series gets two stars just because it puts one of Dickens's "Bleak House" on the film and maybe someone will read the book. Contrary to what she probably received, Diana Rigg was as poor as Ladi Dedlock. She was awkward and wooden. Ladi D. is a reserved character, but not martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr. Jarndice. I will stop and answer all those people who say, "I did not read the book, so I do not have to take the opinion of that guy because he bases his grades on the book." The truth is not true. For the former, Diana Rigg is bad in her role because of bad behavior, whether you read the book or not. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is passing Jarndice (although too old). The series does not collapse because it is unfair to compare it with the book, but because different lines and characters simply do not merge to make a coherent, dramatic, mysterious party. She's dull and straight. If you want to make a likely good house, you have to spend 20 hours of film in 10 episodes of two hours. But I suggest that manufacturers, etc. They leave Dickens themselves (even A Christmas Carol). Television dwarves the genius of Dickens as it manifests itself in his ingenious complications and unforgettable characters.
