Is not it hilarious when an ordinary squid who leads a pathetic life suddenly happens something unusually magical, turning his life upside down and challenging him to learn a few valuable lessons on the road? That formula never grows old, is it? It's such a sure way to make a classic movie! Watch the main hits like Liar Liar and Big! ... This was certainly Rob Schneider's thinking line when he made a semi-successful Deuce Bigalov: A male gigolo and followed him with The Animal. Since I have already followed the operation with a sarcasm, he allows me to be more colorful: Schneider plays a losing officer who is suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved by surgery ... by a rotten veterinarian who inflates him with animal parts, causing him to frown like a horse in unsuitable times, runs like a cheetah, etc. This film is a bit more sympathetic than other Schneider acting films (such as another chromatic sequel to The Hot Chick), but it almost feels like they want the audience to hate it by showing the star to realizing TV as a romantic lead (Colleen Haskell from "Survivor") and insert the Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... just does not exist. I'm sorry - nothing incomparably good except the value of production. I just want to finish this review by saying that small references to other films in the movie can be fine, but when it comes to lines that come in the same way ("You can do it!"), There's a word for that - " husband. " In fact, here's another word - "cheap".
