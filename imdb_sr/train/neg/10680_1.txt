FRONT SPOILER This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's so simple. There is not a single buyable quality in this film. The first 10 minutes are pretty cunning - they actually lead you to believe that this movie will be shocking and that you will have it at the edge of your seat. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes watching stole and badly-made scenes without any organization. The lake was funny, it looked like an aquarium and it had the same plant in different parts of the lake. The characters show their advanced power of teleportation, for example, Alec Thomas who falls into the lake (drunk), and then ends up on his ship in an impossible position. Angie Harmon has shown poor performance as Kate, aggravated by the dialogue that shot from the spatio-temporal continuum that seems to have been written by the fifth grade at the last minute. An example would be if she said: "Flashlight!" in such a stupid way as to show the threshold of how much the human body can clenched before it breaks into half. Finally, editing this movie was far the most brilliant and terrible I've ever seen. It was as if cameras were a bunch of chimps that scientists gave to camcorders. An example would be if we suddenly get close headlights on Alek's car. I could bet that there was little time to edit this movie. The end was absolutely pathetic. The writers obviously tried to create some sort of mysterious line of plot, which the viewer said: "Oh yes!" Instead, we are left to look at some stupid picture of a spider that somehow fits into the story. Unfortunately, there are no prospects in millions who could save this film from rotting parts. I give this .5 out of 10, which is .5 of the fact. that this film was filmed on the film instead of becoming a picture book.
