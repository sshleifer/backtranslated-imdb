There are so many comments on this film, and yet I found them to mislead them. This is a scenario in which the angle is overused, where a normal human being becomes a partner in the crime of someone from the opposite sex for no apparent reason. The boy met the girl. The girl keeps the boy in a ni≈°an for something funny. The guy is intrigued. You know the exercise: the antagonist turns out to be wild, free spirit instead of sociopath ... Insert a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for love. Sheidi is "she's crazy or just need a hug?" The Role from the Breakfast Club simply responds as the main character. And all that's left is a really terrific movie party.
