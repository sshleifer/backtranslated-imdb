It seems that this movie was made by someone with some good ideas, but who had never shot a movie before, nor did he think that the script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Kendy and I guessed it was wrong that it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid story about controlling the mind and so many straight, awkward moments. And, above all, Candi delivered some of the hardest lines I've ever heard before. So, despite the potentially fun show and idea of ​​the story, an amateur and coarse movie remains, which will probably be too stupid for an average adult, although teenagers will probably find a few laughs. It really is a pity - it could have been much better. I mean, with Eugene Levi, Joe Flaherty and John Candi it should have been wonderful.
