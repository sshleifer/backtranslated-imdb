Somebody called Howard Koch, but he wrote a script for Casablanca, did not he? Or not. There may be more than one Koch that sneaks around in Hollywood, and I'm not too much in love with Casablanca anyway. Wait a minute - yes, there's another Haward Koch, who sneaks around Hollywood. It's the one who wrote "Casablanca". Does not matter. In this comment I will take into account how much "Hovard V. Koch" put in this production, which means only a little. Do you know how it sounds? Someone read Cliff's notes on Shakespeare's "King Lir" and decided, as there are no original thoughts on Inbound Inspiration Express, to update it and Hollivoodize with a happy ending. There are differences. Lir decides to divide his huge estate between the three sisters and before he does, he asks them how much he loves him. Two sisters throw their feet under his feet and brown his nose to get the money. The third is a good girl and she refuses to go to the Opera on Lir. But in the show, Lir remains alive to regret her decision to give presents and to take away a fair girl. He wakes up crazy and naked during the storm at the bars, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating. Kids can do it to you. (Take, for example, my child. After all the efforts that I have invested in raising him, does he show interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer?) In the end, everyone in the show dies. In the film, apparently, a good sister is ridiculous and suicidal, but when she tries to tear off, someone jumps out and saves her, so the end is more or less happy. That's the difference between Hollywood and the real tragedy, unless you define Hollywood as a tragedy that's enough to yourself.
