Bah. Another tired, messy piece of copyrighted work has never been designed to be filmed. On the plus side, Tony Collette is as superb as always (as the current actress, you see), and there are also some Easy to handle cutting between the scenes. There are even a few real funny lines, and film work, the result, and the editing are competent, except for bizarre voice interruptions and camera conversations toward completion. But, ah, but. It seems that most actors are on the autopilot, and almost everyone is very old (and in one case too young) for their declared years. Worse yet, they all speak "Austinese," this unusual falsetto, a self-confident singing song that can not be further from the way people talked on Austen's day (I mean Iosemite Sam, I do not kid you). This is especially sad, given that it looks like we finally see the end of the equally fascinating "Fakespearana" that Olivier and his friends loved so much on the top of their lungs. And the worst of all is Gvineth Paltrow. She has only ever played one character in her films, and she remains faithful to forming here, goes through her entire range (smirking to sulking) in the first ten minutes, and then only repeats for the rest of the extended film. There is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her fans, nor any obvious reason why she would be interested in her separation. In a nutshell, there is little reason to watch Emma. Adaptable adaptation is enough, but if you want to pack a movie full of anachronisms (ie a thin lead lead which can not shoot an arch or deal with an accent on a period) then you can do it much better than Clueless.
