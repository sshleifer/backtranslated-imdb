The only quality of this film was that he was bad enough to be comical. Everyone in this movie seems as if the porn industry is giving up. Actually, I've seen better acting in porn movies. Although I actually rented some kind of gay pornography after this classic scene: Jim: Look at your ass Nick: Look at yours (together): I will not leave you behind! It's a terrible production, but it's really fun: Good guys have transformer weapons! In one scene, they all have false HK MP5 machine guns. Next scene, AK-47 replica! And then, to finish it all, they are doing some kind of weapon replacement between the scenes with a few M-16s! I think they had a budget deficit for weapons, not enough to move between good guys and bad guys. The battle scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as hell. You must remove the needle / spoon from the shell to explode itself. You can not fire a rocket of any kind while you're on a helicopter. The weapons you throw do not appear suddenly. When the pistol is thrown out of the bullets, the throw is still quite stupid. Unless you have no idea how to recharge them. The big slow-moving trucks that drive around in the first gear make unpleasant action scenes. I really can not believe that such films are really produced. This film would be hilarious on nitric oxide or maybe just drunk.
