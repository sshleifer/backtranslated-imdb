This film reminds me of A Mari-Kate and Ashlei film - just upstairs. Only rich sisters think that even though Alisons is more actresses, in this film, Amanda was a masturbate sometimes, but Alisons is acting. I think that after the high school musical they had to think of something better and this was definitely not that. The line story was not that big and I think they should have brought two more to play Tailor and Courtnei. I'm not a big fan of Alison Michalka and this movie did not make me better. I think they should definitely sing and watch this movie only if you do not have anything better (which unfortunately I did not)
