Captain Gallagher (Lemmon) and flight attendant Eve Claiton (Vaccaro) are allegedly a hot spot in this death rush; a luxury 747 aircraft that looked like a nightclub hotel? There is even a blind pianist who falls in love. Karen Vallace (Grant) is a hysterical b! $ 3 and will do everything to get the attention of husband Martin (Christopher Lee) and later, other people on board. Unforgettable Moments: Boeing 747 is a belly pain in the Atlantic Ocean, Karen gets her pieces when she goes too far, and furniture (and screaming people) who become 'ball bearings' in the snooze 'flipper'. Action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal, but not many. Hitchcock should have directed this sequel, but I forgot the reason why not? He would do wonders for the original from 1970, on which this sequel is partly inspired ('77 also got inspiration from 'Flight of the Phoenik'). Actors Cotten and de Havilland are gathering again from their days on 'Hush, Hush, Sveet Charlotte' (apparently they do not play hard here, only the lovers of Autumn Iears have gathered again). And is not the actress who plays Emily's companion the same one who played the maid from death to death "What happened to baby Jane?" TV actors include a girl from `Maiberri RFD ', a character's daughter wins the drawing competition, or something like that),' Buck Rogers' Gil Gerard and 'Dinasti's' Pamela Bellvood. <br /> <br />
