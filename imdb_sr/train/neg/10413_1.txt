There is no reason to watch this movie. Did you win and get a tremendous amount of money and spend your time on discovering every enjoyment in life and reach the point where you accidentally came to an end and have time to kill (as it would ever happen) and then take this movie from the video shop (if you can find it and you suffer from an assistant who is laughing at you, then ask for this movie.) But be prepared for you to be attacked by the ultimate wooden actors absolutely everyone (in fact the best acting was Oliver Reed finished his a great career playing a drunken figure, but wait, forget io'm sure there's another reason to watch this film - Claudia Udi shows her breasts!
