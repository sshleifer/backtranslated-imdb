I ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on eBa with very high expectations. I think I paid $ 50 for this movie. As an eternal fan of horror, from American slashers until the 1980s, to European zombie movies, I told myself this would be great! I can not tell you how wrong I was. First, I thought it would be much worse than it actually was. After all I've heard of this movie, I was almost scared to watch it. Murders are boring. Act ... forget it, no acting! The story, even if we do not care, is incredibly bad. They seem to have tried to attract your attention to some strange sexual scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately in this case it does not help the movie. Why? There is no atmosphere, and this is the worst thing in this movie. It's just a bad film making from point A to B. Although it's extremely funny and fun to watch with your friends and a lot of beer, do not try to get it. There are so many movies in this world, do not waste your time watching Necro files!
