I expected something from the K-911, I think it looked like a sweet movie I could get in. I always loved films about comedies. But it seemed that Jame's film should have been, not Jerry Lee. The plot was pretty sloppy and two love interests did not actually have chemistry. Not to mention that James had a total sexist look in the film despite the fact that the writer did not go in that direction. James really screwed me up with more than half the film. The dogs were real stars and it's pretty sad that they were radiating the actors. So, I'm glad that I do not just agree with IMDb that it was a pretty stupid movie. But we hope that James will realize that his brother Jim was talented, without offense, but not everyone can be their ancestor. Do not you want Ashlee Simpson to take the same advice? : D <br /> 3/10
