Dave (Devon Sava) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) have cheated their way through college. When creepy Ethan (Jason Schvartzman) reveal their secret, blackmails them to help him to score with a beautiful, good-natured young student Angela (James King). -Inducing rather than laughing. The film is trying to attract your target audience with their disgusting gags - but not of their work. Moreover, it is full of worthless, unattractive characters - a Schvartzmanov character is so repulsive that big departure. The film even trying to use sekpot / actress 50 e / 60 and Mamie Van Doren in the most extraordinary scene of the film. JAK! <Br /> <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it is his ultimate predictability and loss of talent veteran playwright Joe Flahertija - when will this guy stop accepting any role that comes with doing something All in all, the only thing I liked James (aka Jaime) King, who was very attractive - and deserved better. This can not be more than one in ten of me.
