The film starts with 3 people who meet in the bar. OK. They talk about their fictional lives, lying all the time, for no reason. It's still fine. From time to time, even you smile. Interesting. You really enjoy the first 30 minutes! But then ... things get worse ... Nothing happens ... for a long time ... and then, when something happens, all you can see is the naked old "ladies" that touch themselves! It's not okay. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the top of the movie, but that's all besides! The movie does not make sense, it's boring and sick! The strangest thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) at FEST (film festival) this film was the most popular research, of course, before people watched it! I even thought (before watching): "Hai, this could be interesting, even if it's a Russian movie"! But, God, no !!!!
