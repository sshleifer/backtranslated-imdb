What is possible to say about this film, except "watch the audience". Christmas evil should come with warning signs such as cigarettes, because it was detrimental to my eyes and ears. I rarely have this unhappy "b" horror flick, but this movie could not even scare the five-year-old. The sense of the merciless lunatic who has the thirst for blood in the movie is that it should look almost like a god, as if nothing can stop their maniacal anger, but in this film a resident of the psychopath sticks into a chimney bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow all the way to the popular Santa Claus legend, it's a reminder to the viewer that this man is not in any way dangerous because he is too stupid to be dangerous. All in all, the total loss of the movie.
