If Todd Sheets came out and admitted that this film was intended to bruise the zombie genre, I would change my rating to eight. Try to imagine a movie in which every scene, line, and even each acting tone is designed to be a parody. I could probably get out of the alphabet, rearrange what's left of the letters, and still have a better scenario. Two scenes come to mind in particular when I think about this movie. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mike's dad and other dad are walking, I repeat a walk along the stairs with zombies. This is a small staircase, and although it is shrinking against the undead, nothing is happening to them. When they come to an end, the ex-Marine turns, says, "God, you're an angry bastard," and only one shoots. The other is in the military complex. The girl stabs zombies with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around it about forty seconds, while surrounded by zombies in the distance. Then she almost ran out of the crowd and joined other people. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes must be seen to be believed. Still, I enjoy this movie as any comedy just because it's so damn funny. Good luck to Todd Sheets for getting so many people in the film and the ability to make it, but not for anything else.
