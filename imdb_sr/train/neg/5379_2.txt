Released on DVD in the UK as Ak, Choke is a teenager who fails in every department: the story is almost non-existent, resulting in a movie that consists mainly of people wandering in a dark building; with the exception of two characters (who are quite obviously destined to be a surviving film), they are all undesirable, which means that the viewer does not care when they are slaughtered; fatalities are not sufficiently rigid (unless a short shot of half a kilogram of ground beef covered with false blood does not turn your stomach); and a free sex scene does not contain nudity (an unforgivable mistake in slashing). Thin plots sees members of a punk band locked in the world that looks like the world's largest nightclub (there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen) where they are picked up by an invisible attacker. For low-budget efforts, production values ​​are fine, and actors are all seemingly quite capable actors, but with almost insufficient authentic fears, reluctance to really break down (this is slasher, where is the graphic stain?), Too horrible dialogue (especially not - dead-soon-enough-drummer) and some badly-advised use of sticky video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the film quickly becomes very boring.
