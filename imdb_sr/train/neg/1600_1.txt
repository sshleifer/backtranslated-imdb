National Lampoon's biggest hit remains "Animal House", and that's right. She was funny, noisy and benevolent. Exactly the opposite of all the other National Lampoon films. Including "Class Reunion". PLEASE, do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Fursta ("Flounder") from "Animal House". Or the fact that John Hughes wrote this mess. This gathering is as hilarious as the root canal and twice as painful. One star, and this is generous. Yet again, I always thought that most of my old colleagues were demons, vampires, and serial killers.
