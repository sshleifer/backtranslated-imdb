Wonderful guitar is lost on a worthless letter. Ten adults re-assembled in the summer camp who were seen as minors. Can this ever happen in a million years? It's just fantasy and boring. Become a teenager again? Do you reenact your jokes, games, good times? I can try, but in the end the answer is: No. Is there an intrigue? Any uncertainty? Horror? Comedy? Nothing of the foregoing. How can one be entertained by this colorfulness is beyond me. I wanted to love this movie; I tried to love this movie, but my brain refused.
