When I rented "Unhinged," I expected the movie to go up. The box even claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violence that were cut out of the theater edition (now I have serious doubts about the fact that it was published in the theater). After completing the film, I wondered how I could get a video. The action is as follows: A group of three young women on the road from a car crashes a car into a tree. These women somehow manage to reach the villa, in which there is an extremely sexist woman. Beyond this point, the film is mostly composed of useless scenes designed to make the film long enough for publication. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, seems to be reading his lines of cards. Other actors are bad, but they are not nearly as bad as her. Another thing that makes this movie a bad thing is a camera technique. Many photos were taken with cameras on the ceiling. This becomes very embarrassing as the movie progresses. On top of all this, it has very little upside, which makes the box very wrong. Do not waste your time on this. My Score: 1 out of 10
