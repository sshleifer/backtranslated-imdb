If you liked to watch Mela Gibson at the Million Dollar Hotel, then you could enjoy watching Burt Reinolds in another such a bad movie that can never be distributed. I can only confirm the DVD version, so it may be a VHS version of better quality, but movie nights and dark scenes are so badly made that they are all red. First I thought my DVD players were messing around. It was not. If you insist on watching it, I recommend that you set the color on the TV until it's black and white. If you do not, you will never be able to go through the movie. If you do, it's easy to remind you that poor filmmakers are trying to revise the style of pulp fiction.
