So where do I start? I think it's very offensive to the original Annie with Aileen Kuimnn. I love Annie's film, and I expected it to be a brilliant film, but I was so disappointed! the acting is terrible, the original Annie came out a few years before I was born, I'm 25 now, and Annie is still one of my favorite films, so I was very excited to see Annie 2. The act was terrible is any of the characters original? very poorly written, directed and acting. This is not a movie I want to see again, and any Annie lover recommend that you do not watch this movie because it will only leave you very disappointed. Young girls singing are not bad, but they still can not be compared with the original
