I saw this film accidentally yesterday at the cinema. I had some hope in the movie, because I really like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book on which it is based. The film starts well, because at first glance it looks like a nice thriller. Quickly, although the film becomes a mess with uninteresting drawings, characters that never reveal, and nobody in the audience cares about them (such as the Marjoke) and the terrible installation. The film faded into black parts that are too long, chunky chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just do not add anything to the story and could easily be discarded. After you pass through the story, you will be treated at one of the worst endings I've seen for a long time. It should also be noted that the film has many explicit scenes of sex that you are likely to get accustomed to watching a series of Dutch movies. It's hard to mention some good things about this movie. About a third of the audience already got out of the movie halfway into the movie, and I did not hear a kind word after the film was finished. Avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed every faith I left in the Dutch film industry.
