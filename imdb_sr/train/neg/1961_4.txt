... the children actors were boring. It also seems that the creators of this film struggle to fill 90 minutes. Still, decent scenes of death. If not for the death scenes, this film would have a very Disease feeling. The main protagonist of the child did not seem almost as scared as it should be. If I was in the middle of a forest with a type of killer ghosts of a tooth fairy, you can bet in your ass to not wander around and ride a bike. All in all, I've seen even worse (ie waiting), but it's nothing to watch again, or recommend that someone is struggling with that, unless you are a passionate horror collector.
