Barry, a medical transcriptionist, is tearing his mind out of his job along with memories of abuse in the hands of his stepfather, Barry (original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). The spiral is in a madness and eventually a serial killer. Good (in the form of a gay man) and evil (in the form of bald dumbbells) are struggling to control his soul. This film is canceled by some bad acting and unintentional humor scenes. Not to say that it is terrible or anything else, just to say that this is known only as it is because of the angry fan base of Bruce Kembel (which I am) that will probably see something to some extent involved.
