Oh, if I could just give this garbage less than one star! The whole movie had two mildly fun pieces and that's it! one was where the sorceress sang, and the other was where Roddy fell from the toilet roll and landed with his legs and feet, so everything else that landed on hit him in the groin. It was that there was nothing more fun than that, at least not for me! Doktornappi2 is wrong when he says that "fans of the completely terrible" Shrek "could enjoy, but fans of" Vallace & Gromit "will probably turn ugly. As I loved Shrek 2 and 3, I like Vallace and Gromit. that if the animation is made extremely well then it is definitely worth watching, but it was far from what you can do well! The mistakes in the continuity were too great. Some of them were pointed out by the creators of this site, others are not. others, but here are a few more things to see: When a young daughter rene at the beginning of the film, the catch to the cage door is lowered and the part of the hook that is on the right-hand side is right. It obviously returns around the round button and thus makes sure that Roddy is not able to get out of the game, and yet it makes it simple At some point, rubies fall on Roddie's back and Rita pushes her straight into the air as long as the ship moves forward In the next scene, Roddy caught him again, this is impossible. Seeing how the ship is heading forward only when Ruby was removed from the background of Roddy's shirt, the only place where he could land, was in the water that was not in Roddy's hand. There was a third I wanted to point out, but for now I forgot it. Too many, because of the lack of better words, 'jokes' were repeated in one way or another, there was not enough time to establish any connection with any character, the characters were hollow, shallow and empty, and the whole movie left you want ... wanting to watch another 85 minutes! Drying the color or growing grass are two top options!
