On the surface, the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when the girls are obsessed or devil, it is very effective. But in Omen 4, it's over. Delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child, but that she is a child with problems. Questions that could only help the therapist, not the priest. She does not look scary or devious. Instead, she looks sullen and tired. This film had the potential and if it was made by the same people who made the previous three films, they could work. However, it is truly offensive to make the sequel of one of the most favorite horror trilogy, as a special film for a TV movie. At so many levels it descends. It's a cheap look, acting is a hammock and the effects are typical of TV drama. The characters do not bring any compassion, and you do not direct them. I recently watched him again after someone brought me for Christmas, and that's terrifying. If you are thinking about looking at this, I would suggest that you do not do it. Watch one another, or watch the exorcists, or watch the Good Son. Just do not waste time on this nonsense!
