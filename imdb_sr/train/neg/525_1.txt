I looked at the other comments and I was amused when I discovered that only people who really worked on the film commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, just tone it down a bit. "Revolutionary" is a bit above the top. This is a Boston production college that does not even reach the level of most amateur films in college. That's what you expect from a bunch of kids. Stupid action movie without much creativity. It's pretty funny if you're ready to have fun. Not something you'll ever see if you're not a student at Emerson College.
