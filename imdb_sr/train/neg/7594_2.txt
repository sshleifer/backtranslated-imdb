Considering the history of the film's director, it's hard to believe that it was such a bad movie. I was at the European premiere last night and there was one of the executive producers there. He has not seen a movie yet, and, boy, he was there for a surprise. I did not read the book on which this is based, nor do I know whether it is highly rated or appreciated, but I read "Captain Correlli's Mandolin" and given how badly it is adjusted for the screen and how bad this movie is, I can only Suppose something similar happened here. The act was not bad, although Farrel had some oversized brows. Frankly, I can not believe how much I worried about any character in this movie. Situations appear on the screen in an empty string of nothingness. Part of Donald Sutherland contains several scenes in which he opens the door, speaks something and closes them again. I constantly watched the watch when I did not touch the dialogue on the screen. I never got out of the movie, but I was tempted to start this film. I gave this film '2' for the reason that I feel terribly shallow, but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed a short-lived earthquake scene, and the other is that Salma Haiek became naked and beautiful. I can not say anything positive about this film. Do not ask anything, can not talk!
