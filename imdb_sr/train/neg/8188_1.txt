The funniest thing in this funny movie is his idea that if he becomes a saint, he or she and his family and his significant other live forever. Forget that the saint, in order to become a saint, must be dead, and the saints have no other significant ones. That, Millennium, Nick was Jolly Elf to Fred's Scrooge never hinted! Open to Nick, how he learns how to make toys, and then on Freud how to learn to run numbers; Nick gives the sick child a doll, Fred returns the wheelchair, along with a family farm! After a few more such episodes, turn to today's Fred, coming out of his sleeve to Anonymous Brothers and Sisters, while his fellow losers nodded empathically. There, I just wrote a cohesive story of this idiocy! This Santa Claus, which is one of the "ho, ho, ho, ho, ho" away from the massive coronary, is a neurotic head that is burdened by the Queen of Harp, the operation directly from Hell of Hell, and answer the board (huh?) who just gave Easter eggs his pink egg. Oh, and his right hand is a blond blond in a little dress and go-go boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! But what really sent me over the edge was that Slam was proclaimed # 1 on the Naughty List. Should the Naughty Leaf be reserved for future Hitler and Stalin? Children who are the true incarnations of evil? No, old sausage, a good boy who refuses because it is undesirable and unloved is Seme Demon! Nimrods behind Fred Claus should be cooked in their pudding! Bah!
