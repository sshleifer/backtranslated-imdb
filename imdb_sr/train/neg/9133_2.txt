This is a strict review of the pilot episode as it appears on a DVD. Television came out of my life in 1981, so I never followed a series or any part of it - which means I am immune to a nostalgic charm that looks like Moonlight works for most reviewers. Pilot Moonlight is your basic "cave man encountered with hair transplanted", where a "charming" red-blooded man manipulates the wrong woman in the accomplishment of that what she really wants and needs. The subjects on which the "brainstorm" scenarios are based must already have felt stagnant around 1950. It also contains some sincere bad writing, as in the scene where Maddie breaks furniture instead of killing a criminal, strictly to prove incompetent. women who need men help. Often I feel that Susan Faludi reacts overly watching a male chauvinist plot in a simple party, but in this particular case I am with her - The moon's work has a BACKLASH stamp all over it. In one sense, however, this DVD is required for all serious fans of Bruce Villise: besides pilot episodes, it also includes a test on the screen sent by Villy's job. Both characteristics show how much Villis's acting ability was developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Countri). Impressive! Estimation (and I'm Bruce Villis fan): 2 out of 10
