This was supposed to be a film about Sam and his wife, the magnificent Peter Falk and the equally famous Olimpija Dukakis. It would be a movie worth watching. Instead, it's a Paul Reiser vehicle, with a small Falk thrown in. Beautiful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but hard to know. I guess Reiser is under the impression that he is a huge movie star who needs a suitable vehicle. It's not. It's even worse that Reiser today has made an effort to hire some of the finest female actresses on the screen, then pushing them all in his background. Dukakis does not appear until the last 15 minutes, but when it does, the screen lights up. The story is actually of Falk and Dukakis, but we are subjected to a meaningless, stupid, meaningless journey in which Reiser shows that it is very sweet, precious and oh-so deep with psychological insight (wrong!). . For example, on the restaurant scene, which I think Reiser hoped to be "Cassavetes-like," there is a funny false confrontation between Reiser and Falk, which is so obviously funny that I was unpleasant about Falk.
