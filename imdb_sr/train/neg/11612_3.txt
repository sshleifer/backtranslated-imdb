Detective Tony Rim (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his debutant, this time it's a laughing film. While on a diving trip, Rome finds a body of blue hair at the bottom of the sea, with feet as you expected, in cement. Rome immediately on the case after the man of the mountain Valdo Gronski hired him. Rome immediately faces the risk because it has to investigate some types of mafia that turn it around and he himself is considered to be the main suspect, now he has to flee and hope to solve the case himself. Powerful Sinatra is trying to sell us silly jokes and make us believe that he is a good detective, oh, not to mention that he is sexually attracted to the handcuffs Rakuel Velch, but he is failing to collapse, in this project emptying hams. The honestly silly outburst that surrounds every woman is pretty stunning, every woman in the movie is a head that shakes and who loves to lean in front of the camera, of course, director Douglas is obliged to bend the cracks of their donkeys each time bend your last muscles. There is even a ridiculous gai character which is a beggar with a belief, this is a film made by "real men" to "make men" confirm their own sexuality, that is a shameful demolition.
