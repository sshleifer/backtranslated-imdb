What a disappointment! I hated the mummy, but this was even worse! It was very tiring and incredible, and at one point I sigh and sway all the time. I can not believe that people really liked this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not convincing. The whole movie looked like a big tour of the most sought after buildings in America. Never stopping the flow of advice and the combination was also not very convincing. I stopped paying attention for about 30 minutes. What was supposed to be a happy night is a complete disappointment. What a devil ... I guess I just saw too many movies to enjoy the National Treasure.
