How can 4 of 16 previous voters give this film 10? How would more than half of the voters give 7 or more votes? Who's voting here? I can only assume that these are primarily children - very young children. The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way. The story is stupid; it's hard to even imagine action; characters are character-free; and the dialogue is terrible. I've seen this rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In a sad event that is being broadcast again, I suggest you read the book.
