I did not know it was a silent film with narration. I do not care about silent films - loose humor, flickering of lighting and film, etc. It was about chapter 8 before I found any interest in this story and that I had popcorn, maybe I threw it on the screen. Perhaps this attracts scientists? The only thing that was lacking was the zombie scene and brain transplantation. I went with two more people on Friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the whole theater. Isabella Rosselini has transmitted this film - one of the edible aspects of the film. Nobody left comments how much they enjoyed this, nor did they appreciate the unusual approach to telling this story. I can not recommend this movie.
