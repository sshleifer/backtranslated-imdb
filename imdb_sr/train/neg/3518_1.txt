I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found the whole thing so funny that we can not feel sorry. (First of all, if Stallone climbs independently, there is no need to carry any equipment, but I assume that those who wear more on the carabiners look like a "mountain mountain" and then throw them in. For those lobotomized people who think that Colorado looks like Dolomites in Italy (where the film is filmed), Hollywood moguls have many more funny and stinking things to swallow.
