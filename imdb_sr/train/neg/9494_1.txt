The only thing surprising me more than the number of people who loved this film is what Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire, directed. The waters did not have absolutely no chemistry. I can not believe for a moment that there is something deeper than lust between them. The story simply did not sound true. Add this stiff conversation, tons of stereotypes, and an incredibly slow complication that basically does not lead anywhere, and you get a real stinker. Kai Lenz's naked scenes can be useful for those who are looking for some sweet dinner, but otherwise it's a huge waste of time. My thoughts while watching a movie was that it would be better called "Cheeses".
