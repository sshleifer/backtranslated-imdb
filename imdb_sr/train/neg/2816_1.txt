This is one of those movies you see in a video that you just have to get because it looks so terribly bad. And indeed, we could not take most of it. There has been a lot of rapid progress. But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces a female protagonist (her name somehow slips out of my mind at this time). CRIPES. I have never seen a scene from the movie so many times (I estimate forty). And I never laughed so much in my life. You see, Englund has this thing to show his thighs. The last time I saw a movie a couple of months ago, but I can not stop laughing as I knock. In any case, the scene was the installation of footage ... Englund shaved the girl's underwear, Englund rode a horse naked, and some mysterious woman who hit the snake's head. This is absolute genius. You need to see it yourself.
