... not to live in Montana, and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century. "The river passes through it" is certainly a well-made movie from a cynical viewpoint. Great landscapes, Redford works well. Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all). I was sorry for the narrator / author, who is like a dry, matured figure like his father, a preacher. Being guided, not driving his life, he is left to look at his brother, who is also in a cage in the small town's surroundings, losing his life. The author has never even come close to incomprehensible brother motivations, but at least he understands that he has the least amount of fun. Everything that exists is fishing for flies, where as an old man he follows the style of his father. The end is not surprising, it is predictable from the very beginning. Definitely NO Must Be Seen (3/10) <br />
