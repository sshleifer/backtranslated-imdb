I'm speaking as a real hard-boiled u'an gangsta. The story is not worse than any number of gangsters, but never confused this film with Kum I or II, or Goodfellas. It's not in the same league. But what makes a movie occasionally painful to watch is that all Americans of the Italian people are shuffling about the fall of bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake accent. Pacino would be great if they could call him. I was looking forward to see Abrahams and Loggie, but their stingy accents ruined the party. Ah, the script is not too hot. Don Corleone would have done so to disappear five minutes after meeting with him, smiling and tapping him on his back all the time.
