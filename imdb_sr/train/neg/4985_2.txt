In 1993, "visitors" were a huge hit in France. So, the order was unavoidable and unfortunately, this sequence is among the worst ever made. This is a movie that does not fulfill its promise. Indeed, she should tell a story. Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages, so that time can normally follow his course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely relaxed in the world of the twentieth century, and that's why he makes him return to the medieval era quite difficult ... Instead, the film goes on a few other stories without success in following the main things. plot. As a consequence, the film sometimes becomes confused, sometimes a bit messy. But the film suffers from the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap as far as they can to avoid the first film: they cross over the top and become bored. Then, why did Jean-Marie Poire, film director, hire Muriel Robin in the main female role? He made a mistake because he seems sick and absolutely miserable. Other actors are not better: Marie-Anne Chazel does not exist and Christian Bujeau, unbearable. Of course, the movie contains several good moments with effective gags, but it often falls into vulgarity and ease. Certain sequences and dialogues are affected. It also seems empty because Poire takes the elements that ensure the success of the first movie. So the young girl takes Reno as a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding. Difficult and disappointing tracking. In any case, what is the interest of this film, otherwise commercial? <br /> <br />
