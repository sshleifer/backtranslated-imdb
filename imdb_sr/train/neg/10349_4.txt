First of all, I am a great fan of Madeleine L'Engle and I was so excited to see that the film was made for one of my favorite books, A Vrinkle in Time. This film, however, ruined this excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg is described in the book as a carbonated curl and glasses, and as very unsuccessful. The film has flat hair without glasses and a "sporty type" with a deep voice. Madeleine L'Engle did not imagine that Meg would be at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and she was showing how she felt when she was young. This is just one great example of how the book and the movie are different. I would say, if you want to watch it for fun, watch it, but if you are loyal to Madeleine L'Engle fan and its Vrinkle and Time series, I suggest you skip this movie.
