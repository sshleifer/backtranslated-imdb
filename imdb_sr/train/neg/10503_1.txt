Yesterday I saw this movie ... I rented a DVD from Blockbuster. Actually, I know one of the actresses from the movie ... I will not say who ...! (It's kept secret.) But I have to admit, it was not as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savini? They hide this guy .. But it's a shame that he was not in the movie for a long time ... What's missing in the film is an idea, a script, a sound, etc. Maybe it looks like a good movie ... but it's not fun. Well, I'm glad my sister paid 10 pounds for renting 3 DVDs from Blockbusters. Anyway, a thumb for me ...! It's not my cup of tea! 0 of 10!
