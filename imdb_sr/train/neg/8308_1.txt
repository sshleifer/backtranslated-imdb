Entertainment Tonight is going down the road in recent years, but since last night (August 17, 2006) they have reached a new level. to put real photographs of JonBenet Ramsei's body in their photos last night ... saying "Pictures from a case you never saw". Two photos were graphic and very disturbing. One was on the side of the face and head / neck, and you could clearly see the cable that used it to squeeze it around the neck and bruise on her face. This was so horrible, I could not believe it. How is this related to anything remote with Hollywood Entertainment? Nothing!! They have lowered their level of dignity and values ​​to a new level .... and it shows. This was once the premier show ... and now it's just trash. From now on I will be watching Access Hollivood.
