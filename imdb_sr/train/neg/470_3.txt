I used to love this movie as a kid, but, looking at it again 20+ years later, it's actually a shit. Up Academy may have been ahead of its time in 1980, but today it almost can not offer anything! Movies like Caddishack and Stripes are much better than this dog today. No T & A. There are no big jokes except for one-line, which we've heard so far have heard millions of times. Recently I bought a DVD in the hope that it would be the jewel that I remembered. Well, I was on my way! The Soundtrack had only 2-3 widely-recognized hits (not only that the compilations that others remembers) and frequent voices were terrible. The only thing that was interesting to me was to anticipate what lines of characters were before they uttered them. Yes, I watched this movie so much at that time! The only reason I'm writing this review is to give two cents to why this movie should be forgotten, I'm sorry. :(
