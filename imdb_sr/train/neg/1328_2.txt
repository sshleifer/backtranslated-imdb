This is a really dumb movie in that typical genre of the 80's: action comedy. Conceptually, he resembles Rush Hour, but he completely misses the action, laughter and chemistry between the main characters of the film. Let me know that I enjoy Jai Leno as a stand-up and as a talk-show manager, but he just can not act. He is terrible when he tries to behave violently - he barely succeeds in preserving this trademark from the face while talking about his liners, which, by the way, are not so funny. And watching him run (even then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have the feeling that Pat Morita - at least according to today's standards - does not give a very politically correct impression on the Japanese. Do not even ask me for a story. I give him 2 out of 10.
