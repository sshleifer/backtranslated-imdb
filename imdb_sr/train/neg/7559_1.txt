This must be one of the worst fillings I've ever seen and I've seen a few. It is slow, boring, amateur - not even consistent within its own simplified reading of the action. Actors do not work. I can not blame them - they got a script of such extreme banality all they can do is break through it with pain behind the eyes that has nothing to do with the bad events in Summers. There is not a single moment in this film that sounds true - it's not a straight line, nor a moment in which someone moves. The character of Nicholas Cage is so badly drawn that he does not feel like a crutch of compassion towards him through all his troubles. I have no doubt that I saw the man who was suffering there, but Nicholas Cage was fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst film of his entire career.
