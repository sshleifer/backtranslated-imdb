When people ask me what's the worst movie I've ever seen this one. It's not even close to the MST3k level of riffing, or a midnight view in the theater, or even as a Disney Channel late at night. The only way I ever wanted to jump from Disney's Vorld (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was to grab Dick Tracei jacket from the doll, cut it to pieces, and stab it in the commercial "Eat This Eat this wicked coat of darkness! " I've never been so angry at the movie, not even "Nutti Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Do you want beautiful colors and cinema? Is not here. The reviewers continue to say, "Oh, but he also looks like a comic book," well, I'm Gordita's color after a couple of weeks in the sun. It's also nice. He wanders around this landscape by jumping around and talking to his watch, himself and occasionally with other actors, hoping that someone will tell him at what time the sequel to the recording will begin to record. To be honest, I saw this film only once, but my threshold of pain is a man, not God.
