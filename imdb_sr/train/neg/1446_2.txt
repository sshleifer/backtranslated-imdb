The film is an extraordinary long story about a classic novel that completely fails to capture the spirit of original adventure. Pretty horrible American Patrick Svaize acted as a British hero Allan Kuatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality. The film continues to the story of "Hollivood-is" by changing the actions and characters more conveniently fit into the accepted mold. The film can be predictable throughout life, even to those who are not familiar with the story and are struggling with some very bad acting and terribly disappointing combat sequences. All in all, the horrible addition is already quite a bad collection of films based on the legend of the mines of King Solomon and Allan Kuatermain.
