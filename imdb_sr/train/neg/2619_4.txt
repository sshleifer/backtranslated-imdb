It's a good movie for kids who love dogs. It started a little slower early, but it ends if De Will comes across. The basic action is the same as the first movie. The bright side of an adult movie is a bird that says it thinks it's a dog. The bird speaks as a man (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barks like a dog. The comedy is that the movie needs more. See it in matinee so you do not have to pay the full price or wait for it to appear on Disney.
