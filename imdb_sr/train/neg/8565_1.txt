Sorry. Somebody has to say. This was actually a boring film. Maybe it's worthy, but it's boring. I nearly cried out of boredom when I watched him. The acting is quite terrible, the story is written and predictable, the result and the camera is completely standard and unobtrusive. It's one of those films you can not hate (because it's about people with disabilities), but I hate them, I suppose, almost everyone. Interestingly, the critics were kind to this film. I assume that they are not allowed to be objective. This was done to get rewards - what I remember. But it was neither interesting nor fun. I did not see the show so I can not compare.
