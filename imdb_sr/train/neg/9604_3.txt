The first thing I noticed in this movie was an unnecessary amount of nudity. It does not miss nakedness or anything else, but much was not needed. Anne Borel plays an upset woman who believes her story about ghosts that her ancestor, who was spookily resembling her jealousy, believes that their destiny is destined to be the same. Which was actually interesting. The original wolf man was supposed to be a complete psychological film, but Universal inserted the real wolf man you never should have seen for zero or two dollars. I think that this concept of someone who is not really a waswolf is interesting. Unfortunately, this is not the movie I asked for. Instead, we know that she is not from the inferno from the beginning, so there is no excitement or twist, they also try to make the movie look like it really happened. scenario. They do not manage to add one or two of the films that relate to this reality there. First I was excited when I read the description of the movie. But I slowly realized that it was only a cover to uncover as often as possible the breasts of the main characters. Anne Borel is either a decent actor who plays a big psychotic role, or a really bad actor who plays a psychotic role. Since Danniel's character does not have a brain, and which is just a nut that runs around crazy and creeping and crackling like a wolf, it takes a bit of skill to play. She had moments when her performance went through a creepy moment, but was quickly destroyed due to poor camera and light operation. The idea is brilliant, but terribly performed throughout the film. 3/10
