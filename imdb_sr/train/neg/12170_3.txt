No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a full-fledged photographer; it's a much better idea to hold it behind the camera than in front of one. Although this film is not without interesting elements (shoe from hell, etc.), it overcomes mana. First of all, it looks like Angela, a killer advisor, about the same year as camper. Having an elderly, predominantly camp director, would do much for the film. Then you have murder scenes. The budget was obviously too low for most of them to be done appropriately (without the intention of playing), although drowning someone in the toilet area is certainly genuine. But overall, there are tons of movies that are terrifying / entertaining to spend an hour and a lifetime.
