"The Little Man," now on DVD, is the failure of Vaians Brothers. It's a story smaller than a tiny criminally played by Marlon Vajans, who hides the diamond in a woman's purse after a robbery. He and his partner, Traci Morgan, cook an ingenious plan to conceal Marlon as a baby and plant him in the lady's house. Then he goes through all kinds of "Home Alone" or "Child's Play", like a sword to return a gem and to be treated like a baby. I was surprised how humor was in this movie. Jokes took place elsewhere so many times that they were not sweet or funny. I almost think that the movie may have been funnier that they did not use CGI and used the little actor who was glued to Marlon's face. While watching the deleted scenes (minus CGI), this actor was ridiculous in Mini-mode, but they chose the other route. Several cameos and Traci Morgan make some funny scenes .. Spend your fee for Borat hire if you want a real laugh these days. <br /> <br /> http: //mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
