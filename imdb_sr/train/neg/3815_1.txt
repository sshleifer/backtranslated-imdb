The act is a bad ham, ALL jokes are superficial and the target audience is obviously very small children, assuming they have a lower-than-average IK. I realized that it was intended for children, but also Malcom in Middle, but still throwing humor on adults and situations. What we can expect from a play led by Bob Saget, the only comedian in the existence that is less funny than a ball that hits the hips of men, which is probably the reason why he stopped hosting the most entertaining video in America. on college. Expose your children with nonsense and they will grow up.
