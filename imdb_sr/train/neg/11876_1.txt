I think that's almost everything I need to say. I feel obliged to explain my actions. Basically, I've never seen such a production, and I mean it in every sense. Although working on a physical camera, MIC's work in boom and other technical aspects of this movie are funny, unfortunately they are not the only areas. Unlike some classic independent films that have preserved their characterization with their scripts, this unfortunately has a terrible script, horrible acting, and, worst of all, terribly boring characters. It is a crime that for every independent movie that gets, distributed as a Haiku tunnel, there are 101 more indie movies. who died a silent death. I do not know who the Kornbluth brothers are in Sonia, but that may be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever received distribution. I'm pretty worried about having picked up this. The only part of the movie that contains any intrigue is its title. However, the reason for this is even lowering. I hope this review will save a few people who might be intrigued by the title of these films to watch it. I've seen a lot of movies in my time, and I'm very sorry when I was in the cinema, but this was too much. I will never forget the tunnel, because I have marked an important point in my life experience of the film. It's a shame that it's so low. <br /> <br />
