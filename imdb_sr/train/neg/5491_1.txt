We should have been suspicious when we found out that we were the only ones there with only two minutes to quit. Only five others joined before the film began. Nothing can be used for this movie. The acting is terrible (especially Mrs. Hurlei). The scenario is banal. The effects we've seen a million times. The film direction is the worst we've seen. Meandering and unconnected. No one laughed, including children. We went after 25 minutes. It would have been earlier that my wife did not go to a hot dog! Do not spend your money on this movie. If you do not have anything to watch in a movie, buy drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and watch some people. You'll have a much more pleasant time! <br /> <br />
