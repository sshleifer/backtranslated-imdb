We do not have this on television in England, but I went over it over the Internet at IouTube. Stupid, immature and boring! This is from Earthworm Jim, Douglas TenNapel, I've never got into that caricature, but I must admit it's better than this. The cartoonist did not do anything for years. For Doug TenNapel, this is a reversible travesty and is low all the time! The story is about three cats that inherit the house and a lot of money from their dead old woman. They are argued and continue to disagree about what they want to spend their money on. "BORING"! Animation is terrible. The main characters should be cats, right? But they do not look like cats! Just strange animal monstrous creatures with large mouths, pointed teeth and bulge eyes! Human and other animal characters are also drawn really ugly! Thematic song is terrible and irritating! Also, stories are lame and most likely copied from older shows. I was surprised that this show got 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. Television is not really what it used to be! But now most of them are stupid, cheap and boring. Some of you may not agree with me on the website. I'm sorry, but this is a total loss of money and the complete and ultimate ruin of your time and I'm glad that Britain does not have too much tolerance for this shit if you have a digital one) but I do not, so that's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it's very lucky to get it because I gave it the worst!).
