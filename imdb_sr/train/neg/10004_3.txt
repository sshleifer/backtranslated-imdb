"It seems that many critics consider the idea of ​​Voodoo Allen's drama to be unappreciative." And for good reason: they are unbearable wooden and pretentious imitations of Bergman. And do not be fooled: critics generally supported Allen's Bergman's claims, regardless of Allen's fierce accusations for the contrary. What I do not understand is this: why Allen generally greeted his originality in the Bergman imitation, but contemporary Brian DePalma was excited about the "ripping" of Hitchcock in his uncertain films? In the opinion of Robin Vood, this is a strange form of cultural snobbism. I have to agree with that.
