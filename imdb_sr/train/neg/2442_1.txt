I do not know why I'm doing it !! I am constantly defending the Dutch and Belgian cinemas and I claim that he should get more credits and chances ... and then you beat me on this head like this! Intensive care is a horrible production and probably the worst thing ever done in the Dutch speaking countries. It is a Dutch attempt to create our own horor franchise, clearly based on the American classical class, such as Friday 13 and Night of Witches. Producers and writers showed this very high, but they fell very low. Intensive care has become an uncomfortable product to all who have been involved and therefore a true cult film. It is almost impossible to capture the original copy of this and it only appears on special occasions, such as "Night of Disgust." In exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell the story, and even to create an action ... then it turns into a chrome and a low-brain-footed movie with terrible - but very funny and cheap - make up effects. The acting of the entire acting team is disgusting, although there are several prominent names. The main male role is Koen Vauters ... This guy could be the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, host of TV shows and idols of many young girls. He never mentioned the thing in which he acted. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he is trying to make sure that Intensive Care never happened.
