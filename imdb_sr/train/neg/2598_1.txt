Even in a bad movie, there is usually some sort of redemption, something you can say was terrible, but it was a performance, or that part of the scenario, or that special effect, this was simply terrible. The acting was funny, the scenario is awesome, complete with many inexplicable Breakfast in Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were at best bad at best. This was a very bad movie, and one that even Drew Barrimore deleted the wishes from history. Be careful if you want: a) To suffer a sharp self-inflicted pain. b) See how bad a movie is. This is a movie in which I can use the clich√© "there are ninety minutes of my life that I will never return" with some justification!
