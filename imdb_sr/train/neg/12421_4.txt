Mark Pirro's 1987 Deathwar Gameshov is a black comedy that is extremely syrus in many parts, but sometimes very funny. This movie could certainly be much better, the acting is terrible, and some extremely raw scenes make it difficult to watch from time to time, but the concept is ridiculous and has some hilarious moments. In the near future (1991), the games have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferti) hosts a show called "Live Or Die", in which convicted prisoners have the opportunity to play for their lives and for money. Candidates fail, they are carried out in the air using various methods such as guillotines, electric chairs and other, bizarre devices to perform, and then applause by the audience of the audience who cheers. The emission is, of course, more than controversial, and Chuck has made many enemies ... "Deathrov Gameshov" is incredibly cheesy and shy in many aspects, and the acting is terrible, but no doubt it's fun at in many parts, especially if you are a fan of dark humor. You did not miss anything if you did not see it, but it's definitely fun and good time. 4/10
