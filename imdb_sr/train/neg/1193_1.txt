Do you know how sometimes you can watch a shitty movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well, that was beyond that. I bought a DVD in Tover Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I heard it was a movie that you can laugh. It's actually nothing less than a pathetic one. About 30 minutes in the movie, my friends started asking me to turn it off. They prayed for about 45 minutes. After an hour, we compromised to move to the end, so that we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we watched Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, do not watch this movie. It's out of pain.
