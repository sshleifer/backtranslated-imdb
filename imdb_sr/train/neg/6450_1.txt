This film is astonishingly terrible. I was very sorry for the actors involved in this project, because I'm sure they did not write their words. They were sometimes delivered with a mild sarcasm, which led me to believe that this film was not seriously understood, nor is anyone watching this disgusting slasher. As I watched this "Unknown Creature" I could not help but think that there was not a lot of budget or a competent crew writer. But if you look at this for a laugh, you will be happy, the film is impeccable to be washed out, because I can not see how anyone could look at it and to be proud that this was directly on the DVD cliched wanted to be an action thriller / horror movie fightfest to light.
