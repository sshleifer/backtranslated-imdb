this movie was a fantastic great movie through terrible hell. and I think she was crazy about how a lot of pulse and IT and signs, etc., but with a great movie comes the shit end? RIGHT! The ending of these films is a pathetic thing. I mean, the ghost came back to the chick house and now thinks I did it means that I can call it and that it will be the right moment because it thinks it is. right? wrong. my ass! I do not care if it is the spirit of Satan, it just does not happen. His movie is yes, but most of the evil films or praised movies like this should make sense, but not. He just showed us what I just said and people do not think about it. Please, can you tell me why you did not notice this pathetic part. The movie for me ended up at the hospital and that's all. Look at number 3, much more shooting
