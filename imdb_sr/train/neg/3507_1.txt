The Maisles brothers have achieved a low point in human interaction with this film. You remember, those who used words like "masterpiece" when viewing this movie, that these Maisles creepers did not just accidentally drive to Hampton and accidentally filmed movies on some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor poor people, then they had to fund their project (and imagine what they told the money to sell the project). Then they made friends with two extremely vulnerable women. There is no mindset here or a real consensual involvement. These poor Maisles smiled, kissed their asses, did everything they had to do to Beales, and then exploited them as wickedly as they had ever done. He would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of regret and guilt. However, the process of film making, with regard to overwilling, recording and editing, took a long time and their objective had no provisions that would actually apply to Beales as human beings. Exploitation film committed by the worst people. Over time, their movie reputation was seriously colored by what they did here. Their reputation as human beings is cruel. So people will remember them. Groteskue hustlers.
