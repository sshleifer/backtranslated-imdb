The idea was terrible, the actors were incredible, the story could be very scary, but the writing was bad and there was no depth. I could not get into this movie. I could not feel if the characters were many clips, and the movie just ends very strange. Was this a happy ending? I do not know. Was that a sad end? Again, I do not know. You leave the theater unsatisfied. The film had so much to give, but he could not. Just because you can edit it does not mean it should, right? I would not really recommend this movie because you just can not say that you left the movie feeling like it was finished. You'll just be confused. Believe me, you'll probably thank me if you do not watch this movie. 3/10
