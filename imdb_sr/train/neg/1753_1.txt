Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings had a profound effect on my Christian life, and with impatience I was expecting to watch this film and learn more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This film was unconnected ... he did not give the background of his life, no historical context, and nothing about his great writings (except for a short, transitory review of "The Cost of Learning" by a colleague at the beginning of the film.) Instead, we see him enjoying in jazz (apparently in the US) and enjoying friends before deciding to return to Germany. Apparently to show his human side. OK, I'm ready for the drama part. The part in which he stands for his faith. Instead of emphasizing it, we get a very bad romance with a 17-year-old student. Regardless of whether this really happened, it should not be a major part of the film. Now ... we are still waiting for a dramatic part, or a narrative that explains what his writings were ... or something that would lead us to know a little about the size of this man. drum-roll ..... waiting ..... .... waiting ..... ZIP. Hope. This is a movie that gives "Christian films" a bad name. All they had to do was to create a structure for a film to accompany, with some backgrounds ... even with some voice, or flashbacks that preach from his works ... a narrative about who he was and where he was. But no ... we got this. It's hard to fit into the hero of Vera.
