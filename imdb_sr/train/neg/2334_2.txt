It had high intellectual pretensions. The main leader intends to provide a "deep" "meaningful" rendition (with a voice for his natural surroundings) and was certainly influenced by the "method" of the fifties / sixties - which, when the scenario and direction were worthwhile, but gave staggering results (see Clift, Nevman, Vinters). But the story here is insignificant. Apart from moving too slowly, you can edit at least 20 minutes - including pointless flashbacks - and the plot line would not be Time, it's very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his "uncle" character and his portrait often borders with a parody. The interesting side is just wiped out: the attitude of a young man / hero - if we recognize that the hero is the very kind of child - when he tells a young boy not to let him hurt, there is some kind of tender affection. But this is unsuccessful and only the final scene returns to it. Word of the Wise: Instead, take Foley's "close-ups": there are two great actors (Christoph and Valken and Sean Penn together!), it's also an unusual movie, but it's tiring, uncertain.
