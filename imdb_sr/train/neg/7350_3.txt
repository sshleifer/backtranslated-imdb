Despite the pretty bad reviews, I had to show this movie? In the end, the star of HK super-babe Shu Ki plus 6 other oriental lovers as a team of all-action cats crackers. Is it worth the check? Well, as babies go, fighting angels are hard to beat. Eye candy is of the highest quality. Shu Ki looks fantastic as always, and from other girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught me especially for the eyes. , it's absolutely stink! The story is a bad, action devil and special effects are quite pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and producer Vong Jing gave us a photogenic sound and a bit of it. If Shu Ki is the only reason you're thinking about it, it's better to watch Sek and Zen again!
