This would be Hollywood's central viewing medium if it had a good fit. It relies on a typical American thriller - "Who will outwit all". The acting is below the average, but with the brilliant look of the detective who is the best actor in the movie and is most responsible if the tension in the film is lifted. The film was completely suppressed by blank videos and sound recordings, and most seem like raw film material. All in all, if you do not mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, this is a movie for watching. I suppose that would be enough to say on this film, everything else could really ruin the tension that is probably low enough.
