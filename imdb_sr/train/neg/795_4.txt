When you see Boris Carloff and Belo Lugoshi as co-stars, you expect to find a well-made horror movie, but it was actually quite different, which was what I would describe as an early effort on a science fiction. Karlof and Lugosi play scientists (Rukh and Benet) - competitors to a certain extent, until Rukh wins Benet's demonstration proving his great theory. Science is here - at least it was a bit rough around the edges (in this way, science fiction, with a focus on fiction), but somehow Rukh uses some kind of air from Andromeda that allows him to look into the ground "a few thousand million years ago. " In that pre-historic time, a large meteorite hit Africa, leaving deposits of a substance that scientists call "X-ray" - which can heal and destroy. Much of the film is quite tired in Africa, looking for meteorite deposits, which Rukh finally finds and tries to create excellent weapons, unfortunately causing some kind of illness that makes him a great weapon. Karloff and Lugosi were pretty good here. Lugoshi is pulling a role in which a good guy is pretty good, although I honestly considered him somewhat unconvincing - especially during the scenes set up in Africa. The story also plodded a little, and she did not capture me when she caught my attention. Given that this is really a sci-fi radio rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in very early stages, I guess the film should be reduced a bit. It was all right - nothing more, but nothing less than that. 4/10
