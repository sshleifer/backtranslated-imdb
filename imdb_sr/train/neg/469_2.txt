Mad Magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for it ... but it's obvious that someone had some common sense when the powers - which - give up this loss of celluloid ... edit el crapo, the plot is incredibly skinny and stupid .. and the only reason he gets two out of ten is Staci Nelkin to take off his clothes and get a nice shot in his chest ... I never thought I would be sorry for Ralph Macchio who makes the decision to be in this thing, but I ... I really feel bad about Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, gifted actors who should never have appeared to this ... film ... at least Mr. Leibman had cajons for refusing his name to be placed anywhere on the film ... and he goes on ... there are copies of this thing with Mad's starting line still on him ... if you can locate it, grab it because it's probably worth something ... it's the only thing about this movie that's worth anything ... and a note to people on IMDb.com ... there's no way to break this movie for anyone ... the makers themselves spoiled it ...
