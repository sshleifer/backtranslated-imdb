Vov. Tonight I went to the videotape because I was in favor of the bad movie B Horror and I found this Gem. I looked at the cover and I thought it was just a movie for my mood. I brought it home and put it. This film was not a movie B Horror that I had in mind. This is much worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I got, I did not know that this kind of shit exists among people. This film looked like it was written and directed by a five-year-old and that's nice about it. I am an ambitious director and this movie has made me so angry that someone there really pays this type of direct films. He must work on the garbage in the garbage dump where he belongs. If you are thinking about renting or buying. I'll tell you the same thing I would tell someone to prepare for suicide. "Do not do it, it's not worth it!" I really do not have anything nice to say about this movie. DO NOT LEARN!
