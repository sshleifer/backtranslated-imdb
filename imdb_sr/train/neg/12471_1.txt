Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was excited when I bought a map for Sirian. After watching the trailer and as a lover of the thriller, I expected to first see a quick-moving, breathtaking movie that wisely collapses in the creation of a global policy and the relation of oil, power and corruption from a new angle. I almost left the film in the middle. The tempo was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotyped, the interlaced editing made understanding of the logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, you do not care at the end. Save money, save time, choose another movie. Robi Chernitsky
