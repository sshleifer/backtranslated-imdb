I'm usually trying to construct reasonably argued movie reviews, but I can not believe this was the stage of the script. Dialogue is terrible, acting very addictive, accents only horrible, and direction and pacing are at best hidden. Joseph Faines, as beautiful as he was, may have killed his career as soon as he started. Doctor Moreau's island was nothing worse than this garbage.
