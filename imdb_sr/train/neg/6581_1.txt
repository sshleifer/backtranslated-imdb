I rented "Nev Best Friend" hoping for a movie that is similar to edible thrillers such as "Gossip" and "Guilty". Instead, "The New Best Friend" is much more like "The In Crowd," which does not have excitement and the acting is incredibly fake. "The new best friend" is boring, and the events during the film are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
