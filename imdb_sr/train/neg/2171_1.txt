This film certainly has one of the strangest topics in history - up there with the passionate defense of Ed Vood for crossing into "Glen or Glendy?" Park Avenue is letting him go; Bohemians play. The Russians - who say very questionable "Russian" and have unbelievable accents when they speak English - play in the restaurant where they work. - even in spite of the great acting issue - it's unlikely to be much interested in this bizarre movie. Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are good. (Well - Frank McHugh is an incredible ghost writer - since Lukas is probably not Russian.) But everyone was sinking from a fetishist letter.
