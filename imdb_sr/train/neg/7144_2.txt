It was almost worth it to pass through this "horrible" movie, only to know that I will never again be able to experience anything so bad. Gluma - 0, script - 0, battle scene - 0, male lead - 0 (cheddar bob of eight miles as a stunning war hero who gets a girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is beautiful and not a terrible actress). These are the criteria that I used to go to two. I lost the number, but I believe that it's ever a movie clich√© in this movie. When the driver who allegedly killed her father miraculously appeared in the end to run against her, nowhere has he fixed the previous statement. Plus appeared for no reason. He had never been mentioned before. I do not know what else to say. Just watch it on TV for a couple of years. At least some of them will be made for commercials.
