I've seen this movie thinking that it will be one of those old B movies that are fun to watch. So I made a mistake! This film was boring and obviously aimed at men who like to watch mature women. The story was so funny and incredible that it lost my interest. It seemed to be in the same genre as Ed Vood films - the bottom of the barrel.
