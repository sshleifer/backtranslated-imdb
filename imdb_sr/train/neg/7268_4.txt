Bored, long, pretentious, repetitive, self-turned ?? this move was a bad date. The worse, the boring direction of the art school - with the heavy use of a spinning bull that went so far, almost made me pull - I scream constantly to be noticed. Add the tiniest graphics and practically without dialogue, and the movie starts to feel like a four-part epic about 30 minutes. characters. Really loud opera music. You blame the director for everything. The actors are very good. The main actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suitable for the movie star. He and other actors have some gentle erotic moments. Even they start to get bored after 5 minutes, and you wonder if the director is auditioning for Bel Ami porn business. The stunning architecture of campus college as a location in Mexico City is inspiring. How are universities in the United States so light (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this movie. Do you want to use the quick scan button? much.
