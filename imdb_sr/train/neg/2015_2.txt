I really enjoyed this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I'm a plane craze and I have a serious love relationship with helicopters. I do not like this program because it takes fantasy to an incredible level. The world record for speed for helicopters was set at 249 km / h Westland Line a few years ago. The only fast-moving helicopter was the experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960s. He hit more than 300 and was a complex helicopter, which means he had a propelling propeller at the end of the hull that gave the thrust. ving flight. And the Bell 222, the "actor" who displayed Airvolf, was not very fast even under the standards of a helicopter. And it did not stay long in production. It was a film that came out during this period called "Blue Thunder", which was much more realistic.
