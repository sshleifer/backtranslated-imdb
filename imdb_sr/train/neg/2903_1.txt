Oh God. This movie could be the subtitle "When Writers Strike!" What a stench. I really had great hopes for this, mainly after reading IMDb reviews, which is why I'm wondering about the entire IMDb rating system, but that's a separate thing. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Almighty Bruce, Office, etc., so I was expecting great things. To say that I was disappointed is the underestimation of the year. There are so many things to do with this film, but I will limit myself to (a) the unbelief that every family behaves like these people (the mass aerobics exercise? Please) and the fact that Dan's character is so uncomfortable, you wonder what is did the girl see in him to fall in love with him? This film was filled with clumsy dialogue, screaming direction, ridiculous scenes and was slow, slow, slow. We would leave after half an hour if we were not with our parents, who do not come out much and do not like to spend money. Unlike the creators of this film, who would be better throwing out all the money spent doing this movie in the cloak - that would be more fun. If you love movies, avoid this as a plague.
