I always wanted to see it because I love siren horror films and with that title, I was sure that "The Incredible Melting Man" will be fun. It really was not. I mean, the acting was fun bad, the scenario contained some classic bad lines and special effects looked like somebody sneezed around the main actor, so I should have loved him. Unfortunately, it is really tense between these peaks. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while I was doing a tax return. So this film is boring. Still, if you love bad movies, you will enjoy the dramatic exit from the fat sister and the stellar action of the guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be honest with the poor man, he has to deliver some incredibly rude lines with a flat face - like an interview he has with his wife about finding an IM Man: With a geiger counter. "" Is it radioactive? "" Just a little. "Yes, the plot has a doctor, Ted, wandering around trying to find a superstructure to kill zombies that are armed only with what looks like a mini-disson. a brave man, unfortunately, his plan fails when he finds a big tree on the tree. "Oh, God, that's his ear!" says Dr. Ted to the audience. I am so glad he made it clear. this movie sounds pretty fun. It would be if it was only 10 minutes, but unfortunately it lasts and lasts, and Incredible Melting Dude just hangs on making sticky clutter when and in my opinion, I should eat more people. I think if you were really stoned, you would probably like it, just do not have pop-cakes during the movie, because the main actor really looks like one end of the line.
