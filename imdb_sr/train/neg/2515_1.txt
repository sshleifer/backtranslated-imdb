This film is disgusting, and its creation should have been considered a major crime. One of the great mysteries of filmmaking is why no one has ever made a faithful film adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It's a story of a truly mysterious mystery, a fine old-fashioned romance, and dry English humor. Why the creators had to change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Iard policeman into an amateur detective, introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his English servant, changed part of the main story of the charge of murder and the circumstances of Gordon's fight to save the Accused, etc. etc.? These producers and directors who always think that they can make a better story than one in the book should write their own script instead of raping another person's product.
