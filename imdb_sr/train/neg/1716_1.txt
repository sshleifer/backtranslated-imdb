Although this was a production made for television, there is absolutely no excuse for the end result of the finished product. This film had a budget and had a casting department, so if you want to make a movie about a true life story, and actually put a "true story" into the title, should not you make any effort to try to capture some realism? First of all, this film is absurdly thrown. These actors belong to daily television sapuns, or to those funny movies about life channels, not in the real gangster / criminal story. All about them, from their looks to their manners, just screaming a generation from the 90s-shopping-mall-alt-rock-listening. What about the script? Two words describe him - stupid and insulting, and again it's too audible. I think true Clide Barrow never said the words "I'm leaving from here." As if a crowd of fans "Nev Kids on the Block" gathered and decided to make a "kevl flick" about Bonnie and Clide, you know, one that would be completely radical. Well, this sticker does not even rank on work and stone. Anything that can be wrong with any kind of movie is wrong, from casting and acting to editing and music. Everything is grossly wrong ... and it is disturbing that the parties responsible for this terrible Turkey had the courage to "tell the truth" in the title. It's certainly not a true story, but worse, it's not even fun as a foolish popcorn movie that's accepted under its conditions. As I stated in my title, it is simply awful above the word, at every level that can be imagined. Believe me about this, or look at your own risk.
