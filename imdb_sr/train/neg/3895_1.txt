Once upon a time, some evil people filmed a movie about a guy shot into the universe, supposedly to go to Saturn, but really only on some shots of solar torches, and then he gets nose bleeding, and before you know it, he's in the hospital in turns from head to toe, then comes a sick nurse with an unpleasant uniform and eats a guy who is supposedly melting everywhere, but it does not seem to lose any weight, and then NASA, or at least one guy in NASA, is upset because of that, and calls another guy to catch him, but the guy they sent to the hunter's gun must go to ku and that he first has soup, and his strange woman forgets the crackers, so that he can not have crackers, and then he must go out and look for a warm man with a geiger counter, and this really does not work, so he really only follows the track half and then there's something about the sheriff, and two ugly old men in a lemon tree, and a woman with a butcher's cutter, Some kind of industrial plant with security guards, and since I can not tell you how the movie ends, all I can say is that Jonathan Demme is somewhere in it with some guy with the stupid name Burr DeBennin g, and if there is any justice in the world, anyone linked to this film has died a disgusting, violent death and could not make more movies, and the world lived HAPPY EVER AFTER - END!
