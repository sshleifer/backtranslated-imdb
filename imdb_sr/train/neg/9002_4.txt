OK .... I only have 3 words - cheese, cheese and CHEESI! The only significant feature of this film is Dean Cain. In addition - this is CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! Film does NOT promise in the concept - the underground laboratory creates a dragon that produces a living fire - basically gives us more "Jurassic Park" meeting "Reign of Fire" ..... There are some great opportunities, but those they just do not follow ... Special effects are decent - although you know that the CGI dragon, it does not look terrible like CGI .... I would not blame Dean Cain (although he is one of the producers) , I would be more guilty of Phillip Roth - director and writer. His job is to make this movie ... and, unfortunately, he failed.
