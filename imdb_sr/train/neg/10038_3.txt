The film has no style, I mean the original style. everything seems to be copied, including action, the first appearance in the movie, songs, dialogue delivery, etc. etc. begins to fall down the hill with the number MH ****. It was one of the many stupid movies :) Something good in the movie? Yes, for the fans of karen, if any, Kareena in the bikini. For Aksha fans, his dialogues and action stunts. That's it. nothing else. So look at your own risk and do not blame the director or the actor. The director is already crazy and actors, I'm sorry for them.
