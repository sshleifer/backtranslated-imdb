Dance was probably the only thing that could be seen in this movie - and it was disappointing in relation to some other films. My gavd! For me, this is the worst kind of film - one that assumes it's an artwork because it has all the traps of film as an art. Yes, it is beautifully photographed, but in the end, the depth and tension of the dance around which the film allegedly surrounds is missing. The Tango is teasing, it's hot, it's got a drama, it's crazy - exactly what this film is not.
