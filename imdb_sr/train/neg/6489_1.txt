What looked like a good presumption for the movie ... unfortunately, it fails to deliver almost every level. It's very difficult to keep track of the beginning of a movie that I actually found in the fight against the urge to exclude it, and the biggest problem with the visual aspect is the fact that working with the camera is simply at the top with so many "artistic" connections and semi-subliminal cuts through a movie that you actually draws from the whole story. He's really trying too hard to steal you in a moment and build up to an uncertain ending, but the movie has only a lot of imaginary characters and irrelevant scripts that just leave a sense of disappointment and confusion because they tried to go so deep.
