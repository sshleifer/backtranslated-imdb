The trio of Bill Bojda, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play Carnes on Conei Island, which compete for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a working gallery selling saltwater saltwater. With the outbreak of the First World War, the Troika subscribed and, far from being pursued by Ginger. The first half of this RKO Pathe production is difficult, with three men watering the landscape with cooked single-liners and 'quick' dialogue that quickly becomes tired. The other half is concentrating on action sequences while the US Navy continues its German merchant cruiser and submarine. These sequences are vivid and well recorded, but all in all this is a long-lasting and unsatisfactory comedy-drama with a flat ending. Only for star lovers.
