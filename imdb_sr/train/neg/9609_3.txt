I started to watch this movie by waiting for a hard-to-handle Hammer Horror movie ... and I was not far away. There is a lot of glimpses up, and they cast lots of nudity, but in the second half of the film, several ironic plants are shown. The Holy Cow, they actually thought a little about the story and did not fully get into the foreseeable things that were expected at the beginning. And I dare say, some of the "free" nudity, however, were not so harmless as they fit into the story and environment. bad movie, but as bad movies go, it's a shade more intelligent than a REALLY horrible hole like Mesa's lost women and a robotic monster.
