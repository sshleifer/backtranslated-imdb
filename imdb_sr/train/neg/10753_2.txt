Part - "You are the stupidest smart person I've ever met." Calvin- "Well, I had a brain, but they lost it in rewriting." I think what I consider to be the most horrible about this digging of Asimov's work, as the figure of Susan Calvin is shown. In the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists capable of thinking about her problem. She's just a girl in trouble here waiting for her to save Vil Smith. Smith is cute, as in most of his films, but honestly, the story is not that good. Understand this much before these genius characters do it.
