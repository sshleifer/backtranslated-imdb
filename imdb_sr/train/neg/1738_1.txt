This poor film is a remake of the 1927 film. They should have let it stay. What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks does not have absolutely any charisma here. Caesar Romero is subjected to the role of a real jerk, and Bette Grable sings with the choir - What will I do with that Hungarian! 1561 Rome who saved the day by killing the conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now, let's move 300 years later, where Grable, just married to Count Romer, faces a similar situation when, on her bloody night, an attack on Hungarian soldiers. Romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives. He turns into a gig and he seems to be trapped when his violin plays Fairbanks. The ending is worse than the whole mischievous film when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him good news - angry Romero has annulled the marriage. , veteran of the supporting player who died in 1949; This must have been his last film. What kind of bomb comes out after such a striking career. Volter Abel is acting, but he can do a little with such a bad letter. Costumes look more like those who will come out of the Stone Age. I can not figure out what Fairbanks was wearing.
