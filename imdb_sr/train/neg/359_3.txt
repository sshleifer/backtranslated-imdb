I've seen my big part of badly completed finishes and final movie installations, but I do not remember any of the movies that committed suicide like this one. Film makers obviously hoped that the big plot would 'surprise' us all ... and that was, but maybe not the way the directors hoped. I felt surprised that Conneri, Harris, Fishburn and Capshav had anything to do with this party, individually or collectively. The film for the last thirty minutes was quite interesting and I like the story unfolding and the nature of the film as a whole. But when the bandage was discovered, the holes and inconsistencies were incredible, the basic motive of revenge was poorly conceived and the way that things were so neatly made for Bobbie Earl was ridiculously exaggerated. Worse still, after the craft was discovered, the rest of the film became incredibly predictable. Harris has given a brilliant performance and Conneri is like Morgan Freeman in never giving a bad performance, even if the movie is not that great! All in all, it started well and the viewing of the audience is intrigued by the audience. The last 30 minutes is one of the most dramatic dives in the history of the movie.
