Seeing the "Triumph of Will," I can only say that this film is terrible, even measured against the historically low "standards" of that time. Of course, everything is completely fictitious and harmful. That's what could have been expected of the German propaganda of 1930. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is exhausted and inexpensive. It's so obviously funny that even the modern Germans left the theater holding their noses. In a genre that is famous for its basic appeal, lack of originality and irreconcilable mistakes, this film does not even qualify as "bad". It would have to be significantly improved to achieve this status!
