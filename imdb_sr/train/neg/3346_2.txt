Cheezi action movie starring Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a one-time soldier who retired to teaching. But the changes in the neighborhood and student body left him frustrated and he decides to hang him. Things become dangerous when looking at a group of students in detention, some plunderers take over school as the basis for an armored robbery operation. His Dolph in relation to the villains in battle to death. The jaw is cast on movies from the exploitation of the late grindhouse, where bad guys dressed like punks, and some of the bad women had their daytime hair. What a stupid movie. Watching u can not believe that people did this way, this is an action movie that was probably condemned to failure before a low budget, fake setbacks and a bad action line were even blinking in the eyes of the manufacturer. Look at how late cars drive cars through the school (do not ask), they are stabbed in a security tower (they do not ask because they look more like a prison than a high school) and break up a barely-formed form (it does not look like in the previous footage). What did the gods of bad films do? Actually, I am confused because it was directed by (?) Sidney J Furie, a really good director who made films such as The Bois and Compani C. Did his ability fall, or was it hopeless from the very beginning and does not even bother? It's a turkey. Unchanging, but Turkish.
