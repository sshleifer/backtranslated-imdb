A ruthlessly wandering and painstakingly unhappy attempt to transfigure the character of Sheriff Bart from Mel Brooks's Blazing Saddles in his weekly sitcom, this is really as bad as some people say it is! It's funny to only remind the uninvited viewer what everything in this alleged comedy is meant to be a joke and how desperate it is to laugh! However, it's interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. His best to present himself as Cleavon Little. His embarrassment appears in every scene. He was much more fun at HBO's El Diablo than he was in this cheese board! Indeed, the best and most fun thing about BlackBart is the name of his horse!
