I'm definitely in a minority opinion about this. "The Hurt Locker" won more "Best Picture" awards than critics than any other film this year. However, not only did I not like it, it was difficult for me to sit. There is a minimal complication and little character development. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm more bombs. It's a whole movie. But the worst part was that the camera never stopped and was constantly shaking. This is a recent gimmick in filmmaking and should make it more realistic because it has a cheap documentary look at it. The camera was so shaken that it struck me to look at the screen. I usually do not care for war films, and "Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you do not have to take my word for it because critics love it.
