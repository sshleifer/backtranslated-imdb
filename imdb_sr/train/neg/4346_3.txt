Why oh why do people take good stuff and feel the need to change it? After reading the book allegedly based on this film a few years ago, I can say that there is little or nothing from the original book. I went to this low-expecting film - I knew it would have a shit with a telemonium - but it did not manage to meet with it. This is not overtaken - the only relationship that has with the original is the name. This is not a story about Carl Brigant, it's a story of a completely different character who got the same name. They just spat in the face of every Carlit fan on the road; adding insult to wounding throwing Luisa Guzman, who plays the key figure in the original film, in a different role. addressing the original, untouched material of Carlit's book - something I really would like to see. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books, as well as interviews with fantastic non-fictitious material, and they could make a brilliant biography of the scariest figurines in Australia's underworld, instead of making a ho-hum film about a disturbed but weird film pathetic little time thief (although Eric Bane's appearance was spot-on). Now we will never see Carlit's real initial rise and fall. Three stars are because, looking at him only as a standalone movement, it's not that scary - there are some decent performances (Jai Hernandez is not Carlito, but he could be good in other roles) and the story is not bad. Even Puffy Combs suits his role. But they completely misunderstood the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a little criminally-non-fiction) - something that the original film and books got right (after the then lawyer and now Edvin Torres wrote it). The fact, however, is that not alone - this is perhaps the most captivating event ever recorded.
