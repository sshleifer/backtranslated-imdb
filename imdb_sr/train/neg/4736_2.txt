The film deserves 2/10. 1.5 star for a girl, (I'm sorry I'm biased, I think a pretty girl is the only highlight of movies), and 0.5 due to the fact that it is shorter than Azumi 1. I was watching Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. I was amazed that I was able to pass through it. We will talk about plus movie points. Girl. Ueto Aia is cute. That's all you need to do to save the whole movie. The fact is, if the main character was male, I'm sure that most people (including myself) would not even touch the movie at all. Now we will talk about minus points. First, it's a real mischief, with many and many repeated scenes. Nachija and Azumi scenes are constantly coming back. It looks more like a dramatic way of shooting. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks and this movie. Secondly, the film is too unrealistic in the historical environment. I do not mind unrealistic movies. But this film is like a bad way of showing creativity, throwing ninjas that behave like bears and spiders, etc. ... it reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a fantasy movie. Moreover, in order to show "I do not know" what effect the director shoots people who die by spraying blood (literally) everywhere around ... people who do not realize that their head is cut off ... etc ... etc. Too many of them spoil the show. It seems that the impact of the anime in this movie is strong. This greatly degrades the performance. Thirdly, should Azumi be not a killer? It seems to me more like an army than a man, just a woman. I do not think you see killers killing in military camps. The only time I felt that he acted like a "killer-loved" was when he killed Kiiomas Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was lean in both films. It's a linear plot without development and surprise in any way.
