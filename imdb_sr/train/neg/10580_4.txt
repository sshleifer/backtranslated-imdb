I saw it last week after I picked up a DVD cheap. I wanted to see her for years, finding the action plan very intriguing. So my disappointment was great, at a minimum. I thought the main actor was very flat. This type required performance such as Johnny Dept in the Ninth Gate (of which this is almost complete), but I assume that TV budgets do not always provide this kind of acting capability. I also thought that the direction was confused and boring, serving only to remind me that Carpenter had not done a decent movie since U Usta ludila. As for the story - well, I was disappointed there too! I do not think there was any way to fulfill my expectations, but I thought that the payment and explanation were bad, and the way it finally got a movie against the climax at the very least. one of the main participants in AICN, and you can say that he loves his cinema, but I would love a better result from such a good starting premise. The same day!
