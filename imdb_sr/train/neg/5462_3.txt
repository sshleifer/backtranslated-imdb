This program reveals me! There is no sense in humor and it is too serious to be called "fun"! It's too educational for me! The characters are very stereotyped and irresistible. The plots are superfluous and the morale is repeated over and over again. Where's the party in it? I also feel that this is too long on the BBC and it's broadcast too. Do you really need to have a slot on T.V. every 2 or 3 months when a completely new show is running out of episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to start returning some of its older shows such as: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons and Count Duckula, in addition to continually giving contracts to these new shows! I thought the BBC was returning to the Danger Mouse, so what's up with it ?! 3/10
