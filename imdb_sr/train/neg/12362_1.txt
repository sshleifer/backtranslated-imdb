I saw this film in New York. The next morning, I waited for the bus, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. She was raining, and she did not want to wait at the PORT AUTHORITY. I went across the road and saw the worst film of my life. It was so bad, I chose to stay and see the whole movie, I still have not seen anything else. The year was 69, so call me crazy. I just stayed because I could not believe .........
