It's painful. Painful is the only word that describes this terrible performance of both entertaining and interesting shakespeare performances. I gave him a shot, but I was terribly disappointed and I could not even finish it. To the person who wrote the novel about how wonderful this turn is in Much Ado, I am pitying you and your boring brain. Let your statements about young viewers be raised without retribution. Please, do not even bother with this abominable, disgusting excuse for the performance of Shakespeare's drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting and require a comodo close to the TV that you choose to watch this shit because an unintentional discharge will occur.
