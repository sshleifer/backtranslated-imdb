I watched the movie tonight for a free review review, and despite the fact that I did not pay ten cents to see this movie, I felt exhausted. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this film, you leave Benjamin in place. The act is at best scared; Kiefer Sutherland phones in its worst imitation of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas seems to realize that he made a bad choice by leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones during the recording of this Turkish. Eva Longoria is a non-entity; Looks like she's reading her lines from teleprompter. And if you can not spot the "mole" in the first 20 minutes, then you've just landed on this planet from the world without television and recycled stories. If you really want to see a good thriller for the secret service, rent in the line of fire. If you see and buy this, you will begin to fear for President's security, because the Secret Service looks and behaves like adult versions of these types of 90210. Regardless of your feelings towards V, hopefully this will be art "does not imitate life.
