Why does any film about Cleopatra, the last fauroh, bring the worst in the movie? Whatever the attractiveness of women had for the greatest Roman, Julius Ceasar, and his successor, Mark Antoni, never came to the screen on what was except for the antiquities of the higher class. Despite luxurious sets and costumes, this film is as bad as any Italian "sandal and that" extravagance of the 50's. However, this type of spectacle is on the big screen, which is why the "Gladiator" has passed well, but "Gladiator" did not have all romantic novels. like Elizabeth Tailor, but Timothy Dalton has talent. It's a shame that something did not get out of the rest.
