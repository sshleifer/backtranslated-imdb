When I first started watching this movie, I asked for some kind of subtle metaphor, but soon it became clear to me that this movie is really about people in the train. Interactions between people are like those that you can see every day on the street and when there is occasionally a more interesting situation, the dialogue becomes stiff and boring. It's not that I do not understand how this film is trying to show the way people interact, but only that they are very boring in this movie. If you want to see and analyze these relationships, it's best to really get out and buy a train card and look at people in the train with you. It's real, but you would not go into a movie to watch a movie about sitting and watching a movie.
