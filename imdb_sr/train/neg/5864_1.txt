I'm sure this was the worst movie ever made. If you can not smile a 13-year-old boy with funny humor, you should always give up comedy. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose it differently. The film is full of predictable gags (some of them are racist) and very non-binding jokes. It is especially remembered a scene in which the doctor tells the main character that the rabbit has died and that it is pregnant (as I write this, I can not believe that this was actually a film scene). A man runs to a dead rabbit on a doctor's desk and tries to get his mouth shut. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The hit line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is "I knew I should be at the top." ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........
