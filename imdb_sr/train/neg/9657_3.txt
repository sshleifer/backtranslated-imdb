1) I am not an expert in weapons, but even I can see the difference between American soldiers in the First and Second World War. In the film, we can see private individuals, armed "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), Not authentic "Springfield from 1903" (called "Silent Death"), which is used until the Second World War. Difference - M1 can charge 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times higher fire rate! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield requires a reload after every shot. A little difference?! 2) uniforms of the German army have been borrowed since 1940. Especially - helmets. German helmets by the end of the First World War have a significant stomach at the top, we do not see any one in the film. And if we search for a little in the archives - how true is this "True Story"? I'm surprised how much "truth" can be film directors looking for cheap propagation.
