The only aspect of this film that saves it is that my least favorite piece of celluloid waste is a line spoken by an agent who tries to infiltrate into a tomato that eats a man dressing in a tomato costume: "Can someone pass the ketchup?" I specifically urge anyone with a sleep disorder to use this film as a sedative; works better than overdosage with demarol.
