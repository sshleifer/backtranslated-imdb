Although I rated this film as 2 because I showed a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horor movie, it was 10 times on an unintended fun scale. I could not figure out what was going on in the movie or who were people, but I did not care because I knew that each scene would have something to cry with laughter. The dialogue is minimal throughout the film, but I believe that this is because they started shooting without scripts. The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely varied. It does not matter if you sit down and watch a movie from the beginning to the end or if you look back it, you will be confused with enjoyment. I especially like the scene in which the prisoners run around battling with the sticks. I believe that the doctor calls this treatment. Genius!
