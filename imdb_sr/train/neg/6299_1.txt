This incompetent adaptation unambiguously to one of Martin Amis' weaker novels fails to even make comparisons with other drugs, such as Rekuiem For A Dream or anything written by Irvine Valsh as he struggles to decide whether it is a caricature of a waterfall or hyper-realistic Hallucination. Barely directed Villiam Marsh in crowded shades, a group of people who left the school converged in a villa waiting for three American friends to appear for the weekend decadent drug taking. And that is that. In addition to the absurd sub-plot that will soon be the main theme, an extremist cult group expressing itself with the violent killing of worldly elite figures, whether political or spoiled. Within the first roller, you know exactly where this is happening. What is a talented actor like Paul Bettani in this boring, poorly written boring? Made before his raising to fame and Jennifer Connelli can be convinced that, if he was offered this garbage now, he immediately changed the agents! Avoid.
