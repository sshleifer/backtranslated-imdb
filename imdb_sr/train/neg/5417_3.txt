The three Russian aristocrats absorb the decadence of Monte Carlo, despite the fact that they are until the last franc. In order to support their lavish lifestyle, three of them use counterfeit services and use notes in casinos, hoping to replace the fake currency for jackpot. Andrev Hughes, an American envoy, arrives in Monaco with her husband Helen, and the three of them decide to make friends with them, hoping for financial help. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to move on, with constant progress towards Helena, while disappointing a Count's servant, who likes Sergius. In the end, the circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats. Obviously, Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the glupidity of American women and inappropriate behavior of the aristocrats), instead of telling the story, and the film can really carry a modern audience, as I am so easily. Even the acting, which is big in later EVS such as greed and wedding mart, is just running a mill here. The film was able to use improvements at different levels. Rating, 3.
