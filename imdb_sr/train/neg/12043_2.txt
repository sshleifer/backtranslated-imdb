I love Brad Pitt enormously. He is an actor with brains and wit, not to mention the face, the pectoral, and everything else. Since I saw him in "Thelma and Louise," my thoughts hurt me, to whom does it remind me? "Troy" did it for me. He's the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious. Man, American, etc., But Brigitte Bardot, however, comes to mind. He is so wonderful that he is the most effective when playing against him. "California" "12 Monkeys" "Club of Fighters" "Snatch" His self-confident humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Only photos with Pitt, half naked in the eerie sprint, decorate the walls of the legions of the lover of salvation. Strange, "Das Boot" is one of the great films of the second half of the 20th century. What does Wolfgang Petersen do? Well, I suppose it would be very difficult to say I'm not in a position to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
