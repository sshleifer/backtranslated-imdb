Another insult and shame in the face of gay men everywhere. This mischievous attempt at comedy has nothing to recommend. Once again we have an attractive "real" hero who apparently can not interest any woman for him. Yeah, right! And we've been introduced to a 'cute, attractive' gay friend who is actually a fat, proud, ugly old man to be attracted to the leader. Even I did not consider him attractive, and I am a fat, ugly old gay man (but I do not wish for luck)! Whatever the actor's talent could be here, he was thrown into a bad script and a really terrible course. Mr. Snejedeker should be banned from filming films, but then he does not differ from the countless other hackers who work in Holliveed.
