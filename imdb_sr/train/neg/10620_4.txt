Despite some exciting (and bold) sequences, NBTN simply never goes. There are exploding boats, helmsman kills, mass suicide, body pathologists, and all kinds of classic mysterious / horror scenes, but they are intertwined with extended periods of pure exposure. Everyone in the movie looks bored. This is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered bold at the time it was recorded. Add to this "overweight" British characters and feel like you walked into Sherlock. Holmes film. Finally, cinema is very common. There are many opportunities for beautiful scenes of the village, or the complex snapshots of someone who is drawn into a huge fire, but it's all inconceivable and boring. Definitely only for Li and Cushing fans.
