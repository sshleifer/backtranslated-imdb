(r # 97) There is one good thing in Pokemon of this poor man (make of what you want): an introductory topic. It must be the most interesting music of any alike-called Japanese television show made for consumers-oop-i-means-young-fans. Unfortunately, after the introductory topic, some kind of broadcast should be added. And they simply could not have thought of something more interesting than people who were loudly discussing what tickets are better than the cards of others. Freud would have a day in the field, unfortunately, I can not imagine why any children would want to sit on a show where a dialogue that wrote a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes up 98% of the running time. "My Uber-Fantastic Creature Doomsday Ultimate Doom will take your dark pyramid animal into one strike! Do not you see that you have no chance to win this battle, fool?" HAHAHAHHAHHAHA! " Oh I'm sorry to watch this! I'm about to use my Destruction Force Delta Times Pie Pie that destroys each of your Pover Munchers and makes your Uber-Fantastic Doomsdai Creature of Ultimate Doom is to destroy Beiond all Significance The attack is useless! And I bet you did not see it coming! "Seriously, that's all they do in this show, they're talking. While in another crazy childish play I watched, namely, the commercial phenomenon of Pokemon (every little soccer lover), at least the monsters had the kindness to occasionally perform it, "Iu-Gi-Oh" is only, in the quiet words of Roger Ebert's "Clockvork Orange "reviews," plain hostages and boring ". Not to mention the long-lasting (I realize that I'm hypocritical in view of the sentence I just wrote). This show lasts forever. I do not know if there is a plot, and static monsters do not have Pokemon's character. Even when compared to my favorite cartoon as a child, this show is bullshit. It's unintentionally funny, but it's not funny enough to be worth seeing. Hi, sleep tight, dream wet dreams.
