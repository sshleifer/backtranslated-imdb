Five minutes in this movie, you realize that you've seen it all before. It's a boiler room. It's FIRMA. And it's the Devil. And there are no new elements here. Except for all-clear Bill Gates allegory. Certificates are always good things to create a movie, but why must it be so extreme? The boiler room is a good movie because - at least for a while - it looks real. The Antitrust is all wrong. How realistic is, for example, that your boss is paying the cheater to be your girlfriend to get you to work and control? I would give her 1, but the soundtrack is fine, so 2/10.
