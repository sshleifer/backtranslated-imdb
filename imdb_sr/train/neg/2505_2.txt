I've seen enough from Little Richard in interviews and performances and a sufficiently poor Lone who was involved in these musical biographies of the 1950s and 1960s to know that Leon was not a real actor for this role. Leon was right as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but failed to capture the essence of Little Richard in this film. Actress Miguel Nunez who played Little Richard in the movie "Why Are You Falling In Love?" it was a much more appropriate choice, after pulling out a powerful, but feminized musician. If the performances are unconvincing then the movie will be. And that's what happened here. Precipitated or completely missed LR attacks on homosexuality and voyeurism. What "The Temptations" did so well in filming the group's climb, nipples and all that, this film is missing from a widespread review. What happens to director Robert Tovnsend who started so well with "The Hollivood Shuffle"? He's a talented, funny guy, but he did not deliver anything close to that first effort.
