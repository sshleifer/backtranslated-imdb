The only reason I saw Shakedovn is that Eric Ellenak has him. She is as sexy as ever but plays another violin as the leading man Wolf Larson. It's a pity because it has more action skills than it is allowed to show here. The film consists mainly of endless shoots that quickly become monotone - especially when you see most of the time bad guys armed with machine guns that constantly pass Larson and him armed only with a revolver (which NEVER runs away bullets). pretty easy. The effects of the earthquake are decent, but there are also quite noisy movements and bad CGI explosions. As a psychotic "spiritual leader," Ron Perlman is trying, but the pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo he needs to utter is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman, or Larson (assuming that there are) completeists could look at this, and for others it is barely worth the lease. (* 1/2)
