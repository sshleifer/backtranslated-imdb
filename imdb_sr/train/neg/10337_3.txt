The man who finished this film is so horribly unimportant and dated that my whole class of aesthetics of the film smiled like crazy. Now, most of the rest of the movie was fine. He had several unintentionally funny scenes, but he had several good recordings and edits. Yes, Alderich is an excellent director who, among other things, made Flight Phoenix and Everything that Happened to Jane Jane. The problem is not in the direction, behavior or anything technical. The film was just destroyed in the third act. Why? Murders, turns, turns, and characters turn around NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What did the writer smoke when he came to it? The way he appeared from nowhere was perhaps the greatest Deus Ek Machin in history. For all the complaints on Burton's monkey planet, the life of David Gale or Notorious I think this is the worst end ever. What a descent.
