Another FINE effort by the American who watched the film most painfully. His knowledge of racism is STAGGERING, and IMPRESSES me to more than one level. The accusation that Lee is really just a petty little racist, poisonous dwarf who exploits the Hollywood system of affirmative action to film films of a lower quality is a complete NONSENSE, only the right wing propaganda. The very idea that Lee would resort to abuse of the current climate of political correctness in America to produce anti-white films filled with hatred is simply wrong and malicious. as if suggesting that GOTB glorifies Afro-Americans while rejecting other races: apparently, another HUMANITY spread by people who are opposed to peaceful coexistence between different races in America and elsewhere. The film is a long-lasting dialogue early between a wealthy black republican and others on the bus. The views presented by this man are simply FULL - all in all. 100% UNTRUE. He is studying, unlike the brilliantly informed guys that GIRLS kicked out of the bus. I also want to emphasize the constant LIES that in March of one million people, only 80,000 people have participated in it! (And now all you have to do is to take antonyms of all words written in capital letters ... So what kind of message does Lee send here? If someone does not agree with your political attitudes, simply apply violence and throw it out of the bus. I thought the film said "get on the bus" ...? Obviously, Mr.Lee is nevertheless for the segregation of the bus, ie, it does not differ from those KKK crazy in front of him: the bus is just for those black people who are in line with the Democratic Party's thinking line. So much about "liberating slaves" ... Final Loans: "This film was completely funded by black people." And it is distributing and selling a large Hollywood studio run by Jews and Caucuses, which Farrakhan despises ...
