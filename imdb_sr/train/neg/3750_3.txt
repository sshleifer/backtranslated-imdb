Finally, I had to look at this experimental Linch short after I waited so long ... and, unfortunately, it did not pay off! Even for the hard Linch fan, I discovered that this is really tiring .... Nothing happens, there are long, long, painful pauses in which nothing is happening, long, monotone tells where he did not say anything and the whole thing ends up with the viewer not knowing, or worrying about, what it is about, what happened earlier and what happened after that. It was an allusion to Mulholland Drive - a blonde girl and brunette were very Diane and Rita-esque, and the Lost Highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened, but they can not be spoken of clearly. Unfortunately, everything is very uninteresting and very boring, nothing is happening, it's very forgetful and I think I'll delete it from my computer and forget I've ever watched it. Sorri David!
