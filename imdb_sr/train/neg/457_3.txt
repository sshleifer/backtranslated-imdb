Of course, I like short cartoons, but I did not like this. Of course, children would love that. But again, I am no longer a child (although I am still a young person). I will not tell you anything about this story, for the simple reason that there is no story. How is this cartoon dragon nominated for an Oscar?! Well ... I guess it's because people in the 30s were happier with much more than now. In the present place we live, everything must happen quickly. Watch the movies today, and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow men to be slow. It's really embarrassing. I wish I lived thirty years, because it seems so peaceful. But each time has its ups and downs, I guess ... To conclude: if you love music (and frogs), you will have to see this cartoon. Otherwise, do not waste your time on it.
