It can only be described as terrible. It's a bad start from it and then it gets even worse. When you start, you really have to watch it, because it's impossible to believe it can get worse - but do not be afraid because it does. Another badly written script for the donkey director for the progeny of the former movie stars. It is difficult to decide whether the script is worse than acting or the direction is worse than both. And as far as the hero is concerned - so he binds everything, including one scene where the live light is tough, opens the door of the closet and breaks it on the window. And in the second scene, she is thrown out of the window and crumbles 20 feet to the concrete - even blinking - then she gets up and stuck in the crimes. This is a really funny movie. Fortunately, it cost me only $ 1.
