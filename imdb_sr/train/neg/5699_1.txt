VOV, this film was so horrible. I'm so glad I did not have to pay the money to see this horrible movie. It was as if history had been crazy about cocaine! the prospects looked decent, but it was really bad. I'll say that the idea sounded decent, but come on. It was really very bad. If you would sit down and think about it, you would realize that this is UNREALISTIC. Come back in the day when you think they have all these things to do. It was not as if Ben Franklin sat down for a day and made a damn puzzle. It was completely funny, and you want to see a bad movie, so be sure to go see this one. Everything and ALL HORRIBLE films could actually be on my top 10 films I've ever seen.
