I've always been interested in this movie because it's so hard to find, so when I came across it to Ebai, I grew up over $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why it's so rare! This film is so bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the final credits, which show all the recorded scenes in which they fired their lines, literally peak the film. The film talks about a psychic (Pettijohn, for one obvious reason, her scene in Toples), who uses his power with an experimental machine to extract objects from another dimension into this reality. When he pulls out some sort of box-like item, the army puts him in the open part of the truck with one soldier who keeps him, and you, what do you know? SURPRISE! A boy wearing a foam rubber monster jumps out, immediately kills a soldier with a scratch across his face, then flees to a nearby city. But instead of distributing half the armed forces of the district to find it and protecting the public from those in charge, let Pettijohn and Rai find it, but nevertheless, this film owes its credibility to LONG before that. This barely avoided my voice just because of unintentional laughter, someone should be warned by producers "Misteri Science Theater 3000" if they do not already know about it! 2 out of 10, really, really bad!
