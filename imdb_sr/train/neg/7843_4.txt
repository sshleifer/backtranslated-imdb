This is a bad continuation: the lack of interest and the light touch of the magnificent "Man Called Horse" in almost every aspect and when compared with each other, are hardly the same genre. The return is almost parody of the first and is trying to provoke different Indian ceremonies, but finds it too hard to try the magic of the first. In this film, the tribe is lost and abandoned, losing its homeland, modern life has captured paradise and lives in terrible misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to a place where we would like to be, a simpler time. This brings us to the broken Indians in the poor world, and the White Man is a hero and a savior who denies the whole idea of ​​the film. The beauty of the first lies in the fact that the white man learned and discovered that true civilization lies in value, not in Western materialism. In the second film, that's all, but I miss it and that's how we end up with a bad movie. Great disappointment.
