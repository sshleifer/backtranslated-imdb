So far, the worst movie I've ever seen was Ben & Arthur. You should really check the reviews for that movie instead of this. The stats for this film are positive through ruthless and unscrupulous pressure from some people who took part in his creation, evidence that is pretty easy to discover on the Internet. At least the people who made Ben and Arthur honored enough to leave him on their own trembling feet, instead of unscrupulously promoting it so that they will feed it with naivors like myself. script, story, casting, acting, direction, photography, editing, music ... what else enters the movie? Whatever it is, it's bad here. If it were not so embarrassing, it would be ridiculous. I have always watched how he thinks he must be better because I have not yet discovered that none of the positive reviews is reliable. It does not take much money to make an excellent movie, nor a small budget does not mean that the movie must be bad. My favorite example of a masterpiece with a small budget is incredible Little Nights by Gus Van Sant, but there are many others. Sideline Secrets? Director's cut or original is not bad because people who made it did not have money, but because they had a gigantic ego and no talent for anything other than self-promotion.
