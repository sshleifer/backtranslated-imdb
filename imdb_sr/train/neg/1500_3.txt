Oh, this is so bad, it's funny. The only way to explain something like this is a porn with medication that resulted in a resolution to make the film out of entertainment. I mean: you see porn actresses in toples, have sex, and then kill human mutants. It's a lot worse, including classic "something is wrong with it, oh no, it's half the person it used to be," and a random panic-related murder. But you can also find funny things like hoses drawn through someone's ass and a guy running in the woods, then finds himself with a stripped wire connected between the two trees (this makes metal doing sound like after the cartoon). Somehow there is a market for people who go beyond pornography, they really need to know what is inside the actress, only genitals are not enough. Because of this, you can see a lot of shortened autopsies on the killed bimbos. No NO dialog. Jenna and Chasei have very small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when he accepted the role here. I think this is a movie that needs to be watched with a quick swipe button and watch only juicy things, just to remember the C-class classical horrors.
