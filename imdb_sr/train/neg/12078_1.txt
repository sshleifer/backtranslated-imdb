I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. However, this is Shakespeare and it requires some kind of thinking to be interested or not. But this film goes beyond any barrier of long solilokvies, and what does not, it can prevent many simply not to worry about Shakespeare's story. Often while the character is interacting, it's almost difficult to distinguish who the lines are. Of course, I believe this film is synchronized to English. They could certainly get voice actors who could add a little more dramaticity to these classical, literary lines. maybe age and what would look like a very low budget. Still, it's absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
