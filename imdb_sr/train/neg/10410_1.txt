This is a confused and vague confusion of the endless scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. It's not exaggeration: you have to make a huge effort to even try to get involved in it. I honestly thought that Fassbinder would do something interesting to say why Ervin / Elvira suicide is ultimately, but instead, on each scene someone tries to explain: "When he was young, it happened ... "and" just came back from Casablanca and ordered that everything be cut down there ... ", etc. Br /> Soon in the film, Ervin / Elvira is in a slaughterhouse and talks to a prostitute friend (surely the slaughterhouse is the best place to have a pleasant little conversation), and while telling the story of Elvin's life, Fassbinder shows killing one cow on the other. It is difficult to choose between attention to disturbing images or what transvestite says. Of course, we come up with very coercive and rude symbols "I have suffered a lot in life, and I will die." In one of the rare moments where something really is happening, Ervin / Elvira meets a former lover, only recognizing Elvira when she has performed a gay choreography with two more (as if to go for the necessary level of homosexuality) . It has several interesting footage and ideas, I must admit (as if a nun tells the story of young Erwin), but everything on the film is lost due to Fassbinder's self-reliance.
