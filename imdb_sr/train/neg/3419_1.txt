OK, Chuck Norris has somehow found a way to deepen this sequel. I have one question - why? Who read this script and said: "The sound is great! Original!" This film is a fake shit that I would not hide with my VC. Of course, this is another story that follows the tradition of the MIA, the US Invasion, Walker, Texas Rangers, Delta Force, and so on, in which Chuck Norris is, of course, the one that can bring the same America from some bad guys. He does not even need his pistol the most times. It's a stupid patriotic jargon that supports the mind. Great surprise that the only one who will direct these Norris movies is Eric's son, Chuck. Eric Norris primarily worked on all his father's films and TV shows. Does not that strike anyone as a sign that there is no talented director? After that, he manages the same people as before in the same stories as before ... the only difference is the names of the characters. If that should make me patriotic and cheerful for the United States, then our country is in a much worse state than I imagined. I hope this is going to be caught in Chuck Norris's current suitcase.
