Wow ... where to start ... I picked this on Big Lots for only $ 2.99. These are three dollars that I will never see again ... ever ... and for what? I'll tell you. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring conversation and college anxiety that seemed more appropriate to the Lifetime movie than the terrible film that was being advertised on the box. (Some marketing droids that designed it burn in Hell for all eternity). Follow this with a bit of cheap blemishes (even if you do not mind well ...) and the plot in the end that comes from nowhere, and it makes no sense. Terrible, terrible, terrible ... Is there any sort of purchase quality? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs rock, there were six chests, but it's hard to value my long-lost three dollars. Without them, this could have been on the Sci-Fi on, say, two or three in the morning ... Bmoviefreak
