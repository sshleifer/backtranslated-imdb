Terrible, terrible TV show! Why Comedi Central has decided to repeat the old episodes of this program is beyond me. It's really bullshit! Of course, I'm talking about seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I exclusively talked about those seasons, this show would get eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians who appeared after the first two seasons, which were not part of the original acting line, are not good. They were, and they are, terrible. Comedy is not funny at all. AT ALL!!! The original actor was full of highly talented comedians, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mari Schorr (or as they are already called), all of whom should have better arrangements after they left MAD TV. This show is much overrated, and less valuable time to surf the channel than Saturdai Night Live, another terrible show. Come out on Saturday evening and have fun and leave MAD TV to die and die, as it deserves.
