I saw "Shinera" on DVD. As I watched him, I thought, "This is a really bad porn movie without pornography." I also thought, "Whoever wrote this has some real problems." I then watched as director / writer Carlson explains his process as a special feature. Yes, that was really special. The emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers that hit each other to get out. They are marginally attractive. There is a frontal and full nakedness. These factors probably explain that the film was seen at all. The most disturbing element of the film is gay-banging and still gaying the same victim who tries to foolishly revenge his attackers, two drunken losers. Not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from the technical point of view, but the stupidity is bad. Then there is a boxer stalker theme. This is really crazy, not just absurd. This unusual boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attention of the boy's flesh when he is working on the parking lot of his gym. This is in LA, look out. The boxer is so traumatized that he appears in the home of a stalker, a line in front of him and excites himself in that process. Well, all I can say is why a boxer who is in the heart Is the exhibitionist so traumatized by the care of a stalker? It just does not make sense. And, I'm afraid, some psycho-dynamics actually makes sense, if you take the time to read about them. However, bad scripts rarely make sense. It seems that the director / writer thought this film represents a significant minority within the gay community. Well, maybe she's right, I guess. We may never know, because that minority would be so dysfunctional that they could barely be organized enough to ever come to an unknown gay film festival or a DVD store in just two places that they could find this party. Thank God for that.
