Such a pretentious and brave attempt to retreat. Devil's scenario and dialogue and a really shameful acting. Really up the movie I've ever seen (in the cinema). Nothing in my opinion saves this film from total disaster. I saw him when he went out to the cinema in Brighton. People went out and there were more people chatting in front of the toilet than in the auditorium! In the end, there was boos and contempt from the scarce audience, which was quite sad, because the relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really gloomy. However, the film was so bad that I really could not feel so compassionate with them. Everyone has to start from somewhere and their son began his acting career with this really terrible attempt of 'Tarantino created in the UK'. It's been 5 years, but sometimes I'm still struggling to remember that night in movies! This is a movie without any redemption options! I gave him 1 as 0 was not available. They should invent a "somosometer" for everyone involved in this sad mess of the movie. I know that some of them have moved on to better things, it's positive that none of them could sneak below this.
