I can no longer say that this film was horrible. Whole Chinese is awake in your being because the ancestors were difficult to sell. But telling the audience that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even studying it, that's ridiculous. It's like saying every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino, etc. Etc. It's just not convincing. It was said that Shin was from the monastery in China - later he identified him from Beijing. However, early film sequences show a map that focuses on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to recognize areas such as Mongolia for its own, approved. But it is a distinct nation and even marks "Mongolia" on the map. Did Disnei Studios miss Geography of the 5th grade? The relationship between Wendi and Shin is at best superficial, and yet somehow feels connected with him. Her training is also raw. And, let's go hunting: everything about this movie is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry. Taekwondo's action was played and unrealistic in many cases. The evil thing was the cheese. However, the omitted ending would be the only thing about origin. It should have left the evil eye in it. But instead evil was defeated. Iei! All in all, it's not worth the dog's time in the movie. Brenda Song should continue with another study. "F"
