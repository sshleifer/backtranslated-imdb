The original performance was much better. She should have left a good note. This movie killed the whole idea. It was boring, too dramatic, and the funny parts were too far between them to make up for relaxation. This movie really seemed to be trying too hard to be serious, and this is definitely not what I wanted from this sequel. Not to mention, for a long time it was just depressing the same thing over and over again. I'm sorry, Tyler Perry, but the next time he's trying. This film is just somehow boring, and it's not so funny. Sorry. 4/10 stars is it. Jai Addison
