The "Secretary" is one of those cheerleaders, clich√©s, "trillers" who are watched on Sunday afternoon, when practically nothing else. While the plot (crazy woman jealous of all who succeed in the office and decides to do everything that can stop them) can be unique, I have recognized countless complications, probably taken from other TV films that I am for the same reason. To make things worse, I was not wild about the actors. Mel Harris is one of those actresses that appear in many TV films or as "mother" or some kind of "victim" of misconduct or abuse, that he must wonder what kind of life he is leading. In this, she enjoys playing mother and victim of psycho-secretary Sheila Kelly, who was not a very good choice for a villain. While Sheila Kelly has made some good career (Singles, Breaking In, and I presume, Lew and Order), she is also burdened with a series of sad TV movie roles, and this only adds. As for the rest, I have no clear memories of them, so it has to say something. This will be played on the Lifetime Network (I think that's where I saw it), but do not worry about it unless you're too boring. It's not that it will excite you more ...
