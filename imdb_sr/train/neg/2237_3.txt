I got this DVD from a friend who got it from someone else (and that's probably going on ...) Even the DVD cover looks cheap, like the whole movie. Shots and fights with fists with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple plot, it made me laugh until my stomach was injured! With very few financial resources, I must admit that it seemed quite professional. Seen as a movie, it was one of 13 in a dozen of winning gangsta films that no one is waiting for. So if you're tired and want a cheap laugh, take a look at this movie. If not, throw it out the window.
