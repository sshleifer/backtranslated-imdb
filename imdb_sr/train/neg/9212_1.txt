the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how badly it really is. with the complication that makes the average high school writer good, and the performance that is almost equally good gets my bottom score. one of Tom's films is very early films in which he obviously did not have the pleasure of being really picky. The best special effect of the movie consists of a guy dressed in incredibly fake tires.
