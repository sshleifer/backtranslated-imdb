That must have been a disgrace for every member of a fully afro-American acting team. Every bitter, disgraceful stereotypical about the black American community is highlighted. I will not intensify offenses by stating them here, except to mention chickens, watermelons and cubes. One good song Ethel Vaters (and a few bad ones), and the fantastic singing dance talents of 8-year-old Sammy Davis bring a total of just under 1 on the IMDb scale.
