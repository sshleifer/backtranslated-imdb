That's the only thing I can say positively about this movie. Cleveland is a star, I was there and I never saw the city look so good. Beautiful river and cityscape. This movie is moving forward so you hope you will not notice the lack of a real world-wide significance. People run around and shoot from rifles without any consequences. For example, in the Hunting house, the characters are shooting - two cars have been stolen, and the police do not appear there much later in the movie. The rent for rent never looked so incredible. Whoever wrote this film should be at the end of a film of countless bulletins. Many actors in this movie are much better than this. I am checking the date of the film only to make sure it was not written during the strike of the writers, but unfortunately this was not the case. This movie is currently rotating on a universal HD channel - unless you want to go over Love, there's no reason to watch it.
