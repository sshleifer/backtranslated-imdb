A man of wolves. I'm so angry that I can not write a real comment on this movie. The action was funny, thinly bound, and together - just lame. Nicolas Cage ... I'm ashamed of you! I assumed that, since you are in it, it will be at least decent. It's not. I felt as if huge parts of the film were left on the floor of the room for cutting, and even if it was complete - the film was just unusual and stupid. In the end you have left your mouth agape, the mind is confused and good taste offended. I've never heard so many people leave the theater on the day of the opening with so much hatred. People complained about it in small groups at the mall, four floors from the theater near the entrance. That's so bad. I heard it in relation to: Glitter, American insect in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so angry that he did not even talk about it. Grrrr!
