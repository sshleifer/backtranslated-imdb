I screamed from my head because watching this movie was my first film ever to have been around for 13 months. I remember it was incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I watched him again on television a few years ago. Big mistake - the action is wooden, the action is non-existent and the movie does not have the merit if the 23-year T & A is not what leads you ... 0 / ****
