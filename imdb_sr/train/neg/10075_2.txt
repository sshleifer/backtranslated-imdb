I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker Adrian Zmed could not preserve this sequel. I walked through half the film thinking that this was a flaw of the original. Then came this wild and wobbly motorcycle scene (notice that this is the only film directed by Patricia Birch); and I sadly realized they were trying to be serious. I got a blow from the fact that the opposite gang, having lost its "wheels" because of its gambling habits in the original Grease, was forced to use motorcycles in another movie. Since she was disgraced by that kind of carrington character, I would not like to see what they will later apply: perhaps Mopeds? Fit-in-Outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for-hard-guy-with-stupid-biker-helmet-looking. It was the story of Disney that went awfully upside down. So, it looks like you can ruin a good thing by putting a musical tire that hits Michelle Pfeiffer in music. The only thing I took from this movie was the idea of ​​how many ten points I give.
