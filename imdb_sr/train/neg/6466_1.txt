Marlon Brando has long lost interest in acting when he filmed this film. His performance as a "Swede" is the worst in his career, and that's exactly what he intended to be. He does not exaggerate. Instead, he simply acts in a bizarre manner and entertains himself in his unpleasantly large scale. The scene in which Brando climbs over the toilet cabin is probably the worst, the most amusing moment in the history of the film. While we are witnessing that he had fallen to the toilet for the first time, it is difficult to believe that we are looking at the same actor who acted in Tramvy called Å½elja, Na rivi, and Kumu. I guess the right question is why Marlon behaved in his later years. Was he sick of the movie? Did he just want to make a complete and complete fool of himself? I guess we'll never find out. But this movie serves as a fascinating study of how bad acting is. At that moment, watch a colleague of active veteran Donald Sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines, confused because he agreed to take part in this travesty.
