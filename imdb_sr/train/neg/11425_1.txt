I do not know what this is about in this film, which has hinted me so suddenly. Perhaps the characters were so unobtrusive and were not tempted enough to worry. Maybe it was an unorganized story. Perhaps the fact that Rob Love was wearing a long earring and eye pencil. Maybe it was because at some point in the film they all came up in a poem. Maybe it was because the 1980s were not 80's. Maybe it was because everything was a silly hyperbole. Maybe it was because the character shot a fist while moving away from the camera during the disappearance. I do not know what caused me to hate him, but if that means I'm trying to look at him again, I'm not willing to find out.
