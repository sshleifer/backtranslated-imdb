This thing is really terrible. No capacitors with weight, they all float around in BG. Motion Capture is a nice toy, but this movie shows you really need people who know animation animation. THE MACHINE CAN NOT WORK ONLY ONLY. If you see it as a bizarre movie, you will be entertained to find errors in continuity ... In 3D FILM !!! It's funny to see how the princess's dress moves like a thing with different physical things. You need animators and 3D animators, not data that know 3D programs. Pay attention to compounds such as elbows, how they lost volume and deformed. The person who made the design (very good) was surely satisfied when they watched them move, so you can not say they are alive.
