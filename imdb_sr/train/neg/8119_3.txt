First, in the movie, I really did not catch anything. It was not a bad movie, just another movie I said "Well, it was not anything special" after I saw it. Probably there were drama and stuff, but it just did not grab me, it was half-boring. As I said in the title, it was in some ways very cheap. The quality of the film itself was a poor quality and it reminded me of some cheap TV films from a respectable English filmmaker. Camera angles and footage were very amateurish, in my opinion. They did not really have any close-ups or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. I did not see many English films, and the ones I saw did not really impress me more than that, and they looked the same as working on cameras, colors and the like. The "Game" tried to be cool, smarter (see my review "Lola Rennt" about it, if you want), but it did not work for me either. All in all, a little indifferent movie that was not anything special (at best, I'm afraid) and unfortunately lost for more than two hours.
