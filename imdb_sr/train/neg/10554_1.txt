An avant-garde, humorous, extremely low-budget "movie" that has delusions of luxury. It's hard to pass. I got a message that the abuse of children is wrong. Wow big revelation. I had no idea it was wrong before I looked at this. Yes, it's sarcasm. DO NOT watch this "movie" if you are offended by nakedness of a male or female gender. Do not look at him if you're least nauseous. Do not look at him if you care about acting. On another thought, just do not watch this period. My Rating: D- DVD Extra: Making Movie, Premiere, Interview with Kristie Boversock, Deleted Scene Movie Photos, Directors Commentaries, 2 Versions Of Teaser Trailers, Musical Spot The Azoic, and a video experiment in the classroom
