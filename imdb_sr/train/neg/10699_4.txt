Yes, I sat in the whole thing, God knows why. It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was bitterly cold outside, okay, it's all crazy excuses, but they are the only ones I have. I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of the possible 10 - I saw up the movies, but this one is definitely there in the old bad movie box - bad script, bad acting, bad lighting and siren special effects. the viewer should "identify", all three were boring and boring. You just want the dark side to reach each of them. Dad is a chef whose hobby cars. Dad meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and also owns the beings he bought in a "mysterious" Oriente. Rubin holds him in a bird cage and calls him "Darkling". During the film, Darkling is explained as 3 or 4 different things: a shadowless person, an inner darkness that exists in all of us, and a devil. So choose what one of these explanations suits your imagination - because you believe me, it really does not matter. It seems that Darkling's main problem is to be a companion - he gets a human companion - and then he is ultimately dissatisfied with human beings. This, of course, leads to enormous wealth, followed by a catastrophe, for people who connect with Darkling. And for the rest of us - it only leads to a long, fatigued movie. . <br /> <br />
