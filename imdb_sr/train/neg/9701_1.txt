It's a really bad continuation. The first part had a lot of funny moments - the other part is only bad (in a boring way) and it is obviously made to expel the money from the fans. Shame on you, Otto Vaalkes! The only inconvenient moment in the film is Helge Schneider who seems to have written about other characters. It's easy to identify with him ... The scenario is messy / non-existent. The director should do all the service and immediately stop the job. The acting is worse than the game in the second class. Technically speaking, the movie is also terrible, but who can blame the cameramen / speakers who had to work with such a non-licensed director?
