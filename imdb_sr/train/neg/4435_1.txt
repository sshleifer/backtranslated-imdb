God, I have not watched this movie horribly for a long time. Maybe not from 'The Nev-Gui' or various films by Freddie Prinze Jr. Yes, it is amazingly terrible. Mira Sorvino is an empty and woody play, surely inspired by Freddie. Filming was inconvenient (as a play, rather, and this feeling of imprisonment does not work well on the film). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was terrible, and her sexual appeal was not there, so it was painful to see how she "seduced" other characters and "fell" on him. And what about the occasional footage of the live audience in the chairs? Nonsensical! I had to turn off the DVD player, it would be self-effective to complete this movie.
