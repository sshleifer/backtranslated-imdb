This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This is a lot of talk, given some of the choices I've made in renting movies. I got this on netfliks based solely on the fact that someone I went to high school in Toples. The toples scene lasted about 5 seconds, and the rest of the movie was just as fun as if the girls who were driving under my nails were forced to listen to Roseanne singing Big Spender. The "skits" are stupid and they consist of the worst kind of humor for bathroom juveniles and bedbugs, and it's so obvious (and poor) the discovery of the movie The Kentucky Fried that you will pray that Big Jim Slade falls through the wall and saves us from the nonsense "Vince Offers" (whoever it is). Unless you are a masochist, avoid this bunch of garbage.
