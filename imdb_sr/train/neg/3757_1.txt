How did this ever come about? I mostly love F / Bigfoot any movies, etc. . but I still expect them to be written without as much cheese as this one. The effects were sad, the lines were more sad. Avoid at all costs. I ended up renting just because he was in the wrong case (I asked for a Saskuatch movie with Lance Henrikson in it - I have not seen it yet). The film idea is actually good. There was a lot of potential to make a great small movie here. I just do not understand how this kind of thing ends this way. Talk to film / art / English interested students in any high school and you will find people who can write a better script.
