What a horrible movie! The idea that robots fight one another is cool, but the story is ridiculous, the real human action is funny, the non-existent and special effects (to which this type of film must depend) are archaic. I thought it was done about '80 -'84 and was stunned when it was since 1990. It's 5 years after aliens! OK, many people have said that this is good considering the low budget, but I just think "what's the point?" It looks totally incredible. I would not mind seeing remakes with modern special effects and a completely overwritten story, because I still like the idea that big robots hit each other.
