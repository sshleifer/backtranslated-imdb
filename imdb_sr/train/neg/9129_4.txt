Can not bypass-- this movie is horrible. I've seen old movies Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu, I'm familiar with the characters and his serial, but it's still just inconvenient. However, the genius of Peter Selers continues to shine with his portrayal of Naylor Smith, with the resonance of sorrow, tragedy and power that passes through the stoic facade; it's a performance I compared with Peter Cushing Van Helsing's portrayal, but I made a tenth of the cumulative time of the screen of all Cushing's "Dracula" films. If the film was shot in a more serio-comic vein like BUBBA HO-TEP via a TV show from the 1960s, this could have been something special. If you've finished Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, that's something you have to see, but it's a pass for anyone else.
