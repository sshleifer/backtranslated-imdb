This is perhaps the worst attempt of a zombie movie that I had an accident to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Every sentence found on this site is obviously the work of any filmmakers, family of filmmakers or friends of the filmmakers. How's this movie crap? Let's calculate the ways ... </ b> Action? Incoherent. Dialogue? Atrocious. I will not hit the effects / worse, because I understand that this is a small budget. But was there even one zombie who was not obese? Come on! And for a movie set up on Rhode Island, why did that truck have a massage at Massachusetts? Continuity, find some. The girl dances while the soldier "stands in the eye". Please, do not put your ex-girlfriend or sister in a naked movie. It was an ugly movie full of ugly people, and there is no business to even mention the Romer on the cover. The next time you decide to make a movie, do not.
