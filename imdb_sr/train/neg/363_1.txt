what ends up killing this movie is his self-consciousness, among other things. Here are short lists: 1. dishonest behavior. when the Beatles came in and injected their brand of "strange, dishonest" behavior / humor, he was greeted as fresh. That was 4 decades ago. go over it. 2. Fake sophistication. eviction from the base, quasi-social-political-ism is difficult to establish that the comedy is comic. Ask a wooden ale. 3. Postmodern "I am on this false world and yes, I recognize it inside myself" The snake itself eats - Used as an illustration with another animal in the film itself! - this is a renewal. 4. Smarmy, smug drollness. 5. Amateur writing, acting, direction ... ever watching student movies? the sacrifice itself, the only thing I can say is positive is that at least she has a sense of herself, and that I am now drawn into the self-reflexive thing she poses as worth, worthy. br /> but by ... what? after all, he just rings like any other pretentious piece - hey, you ever see the wooden alen bergman, ie: "Interiors" ??? Well, this just makes it more amateur.
