This is one of the worst movies I've seen for years! You could have been randomly picked up by five people from the streets and that they could act better in this movie. Absolutely wasting time watching him. I gave her only 2 as I love burning movies, but this is just nonsense. The act (and I use this term is VERY loose) is hopeless, please tell me that the 5 main actors made their first film? Do not waste your time watching this. The hostel was a better movie in a way. I can not believe that someone has spent money on this, I hope that it will cost only $ 50,000 for producers - it looks like a school project that kids who do not have a clue do. Has it succeeded even in the cinema?
