I often do not get out of the way to write comments, but for that I had to, just to warn anyone who would think that watching this would watch a comedy. This is not coming closer. Although the premise (change of color / gender / whatever) is bad enough (and it has been done, better, many times before), the actual transformation of two blacks into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on the screen. It would be bad enough that everything required in the scenario was a change in white chicks. However, Vaiani brothers must dress up in two specific white women. As you have assumed so far, they are completely decaying. I've seen that queens-free ladies make more convincing women than these two best special effects and make-ups that Hollivood can provide. His terrible. Add a basketball basket built like a building, a horrible dialogue, and more holes for golf courses, and this movie hits a new personal array. I love bad movies! Avoid plague.
