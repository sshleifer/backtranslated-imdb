Terry West had a good idea about this movie. He simply did not fill it. It has endless footage of violent school exteriors that last forever and likely to make the film run. There are only 2 students in this school. Misti Mundae is as good as usual, but this film will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie at the beginning). If the script was focused on her interesting feature, we would have a movie to watch. She's so beautiful! Good news for DVD customers, Terri Vest's earlier (and better) movie "Blood for the Muse" is a special feature. One thing I want to say is that this movie feels like someone who is not good at delivering a hit line at the end of a long joke for a end that feels the same way. Then again, just watch this for Ruby LaRocca.
