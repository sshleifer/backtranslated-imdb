I'll say the movie makes sense, but it's bad. The act in most cases is not good (I think that only Ski has shown any promise) and you feel uncomfortable to watch it. All the scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow, as when Ng leaves his parents. There are plenty of numbed details, such as the canons of tattoos on the shoulders of Heaven, magnets on a fridge for girls and horrible decor in sets ... and music ... and clothes ... and everything. Real life has never been like this movie. At one point, the boy says, "I'm gay, not gnawing." And he is not aware. Even the comment is terrible, I turned it off after Ng talked about how a strange lesbian actress was.
