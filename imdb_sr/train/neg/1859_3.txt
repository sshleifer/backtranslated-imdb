Boy, this movie has deceived me. I honestly thought that it would be a camphorical horror movie without any sense of humor, the guy who brought me a cold shoulder of that time. This film was, and I'm honest, pretty good. It was not scary at all, but cunning and cunning humor really crazy about this movie. Some of the terrible acting and killer clich√©s were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I enjoyed it. The murders all unclearly related to snow sports and Christmas, making things more intriguing. The corners of the POV camera were great. The film is about a viscous killer who dies in a traffic accident with a chemical truck while transported to a prison. Later he was resurrected in that same chemical with snow joined in the mixture. These were ingredients chosen for the perfect sniper killer. He then refreshes, like a snowman, on a policeman who condemned him. This film had such a bad acting, except Christopher Allport, that was funny. I will say that I am rather disappointed that this film was not a horror, but actually a grim sitcom. They had a great story with a good plot, but it was not done properly. All in all, the film first appeals to me, but now it's really boring. But this film is much better and darker than the sequel.
