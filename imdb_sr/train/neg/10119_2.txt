The animation in this rethinking of Peter and Vuk is great, but in 29 minutes the film is a sleeping challenger. It was supposed to call it "Peter and the snails," because everything moves at the foot of the crab. I could not even watch a movie in one sitting - I had to watch it for 15 minutes, and that was pure torture. I can only assume that the Oscar nomination committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the category of the best animated short (short!), The Voters will have to go through the whole thing. I'm already sorry for them - and I must foresee that there is no way for this film to come close to winning.
