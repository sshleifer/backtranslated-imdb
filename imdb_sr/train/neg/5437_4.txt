Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, the Mysteries of Pittsburgh are talking about the young son of a notorious gangster who spend the last teenage summer walking around with two friends. The year is 1983, and young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Totally contrary to his father's lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually invented by painful attempts to create a beautiful Indian cinema, the whole film feels like a director - whose previous Dodgeball effort was ridiculous if it was commercial - desperately looking for indie credibility by combining the aspects of other indie films, but spraying it with stars like Me Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like many stars premiered at Sundance this year, it felt like it was a mysterious project sponsored by the studio and that helped the director win some indie points of credibility - he failed in that sense and as a film by himself.
