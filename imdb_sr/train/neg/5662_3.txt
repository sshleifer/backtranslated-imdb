When I read MOST of the other comments, I felt that they were too worse for this movie. I discovered that he completely lost spark in earlier films of Zatoichi and only proves that after a long absence from the screen, it is often best to let things go. I completely agree with the Star Trek analogy with another reviewer who compared FIRST Star Trek with the original series - millions of excited fans waited and waited for the return of the show and were forced to watch the mild and sterile Approach of the original. The action is sometimes incomprehensible, terribly bloody (although the recent Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is much bleeding) and misses the heart of the original. Blood did not bother me at all, but some can be excluded (especially scenes with severed nose and cut heads). In addition, the weather was not good for Ichi - he looks like a broken and sad man in this movie (much, much more than usual) - and this is something that fans in the series may not really want to see. This was a very sad return to Zaichichi. Unless you are like me and want to see EVERYTHING Zatoichi movie, this is very expensive. See one of the earlier versions or the 2003 ALL-NEV version.
