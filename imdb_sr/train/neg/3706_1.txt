I realized that the entire joke of the film would be to see a rich white man who behaves like Chris Rock, and then see Chris Rock reacting to people's reactions. Instead, you see Chris Rock as yourself and people who do not understand it. There may be 2 scenes in the whole movie where they use their trick. This should have been much better.
