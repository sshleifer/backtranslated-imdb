First, I want to say that this film is worth more than four stars I have rated. I gave her four stars, because for me this 86-minute movie always seems like 2 and an hour and it's not attractive enough to sit through it all. However, "The Big Alligator River" (the title my DVD calls it) is better than the average nature returns the movie. The resort settlement in the jungles of Southeast Asia only opens up and hires residents while trying to manipulate the wilderness around. The Mother of Nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god of Crown, the giant Aligator. But the creature is not the only thing to be worried about by tourists and main characters (photographer and staff at the resort), and the natives are also walking the wrong way. This film is a pretty well made adventure / horror story with good music score and direction. But the alligator, the main attraction of the film, is obviously fake. Some big plans of his jaws are good, but that should be everything we need to see. Some of the underwater distant shots are obviously the one that really deals with the toys of an alligator toy that you can get at the souvenir shop at the zoo. But the natives are convincing, if not authentic. Probably not a movie that will provide you with uninterrupted excitement, if any, but recorded and produced well enough to be well mentioned. Like many movie creatives, this ends with an exceptionally high number of bodies. There are also many good landscapes of the jungle. Although the acting is below the money, but who expected it to be better, huh? Much, much better than the recent US Prime Minister, but nothing can be compared to Cheljust. But remember that it may not be included in a few points.
