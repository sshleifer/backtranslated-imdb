I went off knowing nothing about this movie and I went out in half an hour knowing all about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I am generally a good person, but if someone told me they liked this movie, I probably would never talk to them again. Anyone who loves him, most likely has an extremely dry personality of the type of hermit. I will also include that they think that they are also quite intelligent, just like the complacent fartenders who make voices for the film. I know that everyone has different types of humor, some people may not like mine, but that's fine; I do not think this is covered by any range of humor. This film is flat and boring as Vesa Anderson's mind. Come in and get ready to go out; It's best to get your money back.
