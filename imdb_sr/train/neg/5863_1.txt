I really can not believe this film is not in IMDB the worst 250, it's absolutely terrible. When I first saw it, I remember talking about it at the college, and other people saw it. We all told other members of the class not to see him because it was so terrible. By the time we finished, some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe that anything was as bad as we said it was. Do not be like them, just go over here. I'm sure everyone who was involved in this movie would also like to never see them in this movie.
