Miron Breckinridge (Rek Reed !!!) receives a change of half from the doctor (John Carradine - dead drunk) and comes out as Mira (Rakuel Velch). She then decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and continues to teach the history of the film at the acting college led by the scary John Huston (do not ask) and breaks up a young happy couple (young, handsome, great Roger Herrena and Farrah Favcett - to THE Farrah Favcett). They took the great novel of Gore Vidal, which was unfiltered and, of course, tried to record it. They also hired the English with a very anti-American attitude and hired a bunch of actors with dubious "talent" (Velch, Reed) and unpleasant old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae Vest) all together and .... JUDGE! !! An absolute catastrophe. The film won its rating in its release (dropped to R), largely due to a really inexperienced scene in which Velch sodomized Rusty (Roger Herren) and the scene in which Velch is trying Sex with Favcett. The film is very short ... scenes jump all over and people say and do things that make no sense. It's not good at all, but I've never been bored. The act is wildly different ... Reed is horrible ... really sad. Huston again and again chews the landscape and READY on the torturous extreme. Velch is not really bad like Mira, but its lines make no sense so you never know what to do about it. The West is barely in the movie (blessing) and it's really sick to hear a woman who has sexually joked for nearly 80 years. Roger Herren (what happened ...) was very young, handsome and not as bad as Rusty. Favcett is OK. It's hard to find things you could say about this ... just look in disbelief. Must see a movie - believe !!!!
