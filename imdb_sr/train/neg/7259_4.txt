This is definitely one of the films of the 1970s, and most of all it stands out in the decade of the Great Hysteria of the Great Foot. It also points out the small touch of madness throughout the film, especially when the dark, wistful first half is replaced by the MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to the character, Travis Crabtree, who roamed around in the canoe for some time , then ... he goes, he will never be seen again). Although it's painfully dated now, I'm still a fun movie that shows up to children, and anyone who enjoys Bigfoot or in the 70th peasant culture will surely get out of this. My favorite part: a man is so scared that he jumps his head through the door (!?) And the narrator explains that he has become unconscious of "shock". Uh, I would say that breaking the door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious, but whatever. 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you love a bad America.
