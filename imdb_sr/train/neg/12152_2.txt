Some journalists and their military followers are trying to tell the truth about the epidemic of zombies, despite the 'government that controls the media'. The film's portraits do not understand that George Romero's zombie films were just working because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films ("The Land of the Dead"). This satire is subtle as a brick on the face or a bullet in the head is more suitable for this scenario. What is subversive or subtle when you see a soldier who masturbates to death and destruction? Is there any nuance about various advertisements that are mutually cropped by a movie? Nope. Moreover, the acting is equally terrible, the characters are completely inaccessible, and the action is rude. Add all this and you have the worst, most competent zombie movie since "C.H.U.D. 2" raised his disgusting head.
