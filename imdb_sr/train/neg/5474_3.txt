To be fair, they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and six pens, but the dialogue was more than 9 lbs emmental cheese, and CGI was now a small old hat. maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly carved out of granite, that would make the film a little better. To say it was terrible, I did this movie as a wrong service, if you want to see something that is totally distorted, you have to you sit and spend a couple of hours of your life watching 'sickle', it's soo numbingly horrible, its really good, (a few big alcoholic drinks are deriguer though.) Any time up, I enjoyed this movie and its gotta not worth a look if you have not seen it yet, just do not expect anything like the Jurassic Park, lost world 'or' apocalypse '.
