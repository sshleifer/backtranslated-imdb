The original "Kocka" is a fantastic B-film rich in paranoia, fleshy characterization and fine over-the-top performances. Lively, mysterious and cool. And it stands perfectly well, in itself, without a stupid continuation like "Cube Zero". This third (!) movie in the Cube series is part of the retread (most traps are unfortunately recycled), part of the aberration. It takes a bold step in explaining what the cube is - something that has never been revealed in the first movie - but since the explanation is bland, I'd rather keep it secret. There are some potentially interesting references to a society that exists outside the cube, but they never develop beyond the indication of a kind of politically-religious totalitarian state. So, that little social comment that feels evenly and unsuccessfully. What does it do? Basically nothing. The acting is a purely amateur clock, pacing is slow (how much does this movie consist of two screens that watch the screen?), And the effects of the gore, while they are disgusting, fail to convince. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of "Cube" fan-fiction, a messy and so-called clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel.
