If you like movies about terrible cities, hotels, homes, states (ale Eagles "Hotel California"), etc. Who owns people who are "just passing", you read almost every novel by Stephen King. If you like setting up "Disappearance", start reading King's "Desperation", but also check out "The Shining", "Salem's Lot" and "Needful Things." The motif of a crow, a desert, a family that desperately tries to escape or avoid possession is tired. Why they just did not record a movie from the "Desperation" novel? Maybe they came closer to King and he took it off? They must have. Susan Dei and Harry Hamlin look happy to reunite and both have been well wearing over the years, but they are still television actors and direct access to DVDs.
