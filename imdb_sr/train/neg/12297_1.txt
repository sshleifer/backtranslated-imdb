Vitchi Hildegard Knef catches a group of people in an isolated hotel and removes them one by one in twisted, disgusting ways. I thought that I saw all this until an unhappy one was crucified and then turned on my head. Hildy is also a fairly humorous: he takes up the harp and closes his mouth ... and then hangs upside down in the chimney just in time for the noise! The "Wizard" tortured me. The eyes hurt me. I was ready to write it as the worst film ever made of otherwise competent people ... to the finals. I have to admit I loved the end. It's a boy and his recorder with playing tape in the corner that Linda Blair looked fantastically obsessed with. The scene only lasts a minute and the film is over, but you know the old saying: "If you have a great end, people will forgive you for anything!"
