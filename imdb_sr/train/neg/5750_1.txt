in fact, it was pretty funny ... in "God, how this film was made". If you're making fun of your movies ... what I'm doing somehow ... just watch ... but if you really mean "is this a good movie?" This film is sucked from the very beginning with the worst acting I've ever seen in any movie ... they usually get five minutes before you realize that this movie could suck ".. but no, you know right away. This film talks about Edgar Allen Poe ... he never tried to explain it to people who did not remember the story of the poet ... so I do not know if there is anything from what was said. </ Br> <i> br /> this movie is about the writer "ethan poe" with her cousin "Ann" ... both are descendants of edgar allan poe ... or are they?! ?, obviously, people give what their ancestors did. ip ethan poe is actually an ethan "server", who is allegedly a descendant of the story of the "house of servers" written by edgar allen poe. Anne's brother appeared sometimes to try to rape her ... Ann is also inaugurated, at one point in movie, three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... they are just behind her, watching her and she does not even understand). The characters who are killing appear in the end to try to save the day .... but can not. In the end, Ann shoots at Ethan while trying to kill her best friend. Of course, before he shoots you must scream "Never again!" this movie should be seen never again!
