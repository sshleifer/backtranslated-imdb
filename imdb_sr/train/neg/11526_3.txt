I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie I saw, "Burning Moon". But while the film was pretty dark and nasty, "Premutos" seems to be playing it for laughter. Although he admired how Ittenbach made this film without money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worth seeing this), I was constantly struggling not to move to the next scene. Of course, it's worse, and if that's all you want, go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: there is an unusual amount of lousy comedies and annoying storytelling. Many compare this with the films of Peter Jackson, especially "Braindead". But seeing what Jackson did on a similar budget in "Bad Taste," it's clear that Ittenbach misses one thing Jackson has - a talent. 3/10 (for quite good and abundant effects above, and for getting the most from limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for)
