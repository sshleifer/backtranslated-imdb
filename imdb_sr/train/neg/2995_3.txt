Only in very rare cases k-files episode does not generate any excitement, or the episode contains everything that is completely boring to watch. Detective and his former partner die in unexplained circumstances. The presence of the girl who was there when the death occurred.Mulder devised a theory that the policeman killed by his colleagues had returned reincarnated as a girl and to seek revenge. it does not matter at all, and it seems that only the random person is chosen as a reincarnation. I think this was a bit lazy writing by writers, and this episode was one of the worst in k-file history!
