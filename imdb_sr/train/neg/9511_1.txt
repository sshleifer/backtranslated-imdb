I wanted to watch this movie since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Tovn to see him last night at 7:40. I'm sorry I lost the ticket for this garbage when I could see something better. The beginning was a bunch of sexual garbage and cliches. They have exaggerated the way in which love works in reality. All the girls were stereo types. The boy was too stupid for his age. The passing gases that the pregnant girl barely managed to laugh. The bank robbery was completely annoying with the gags used in other films. Their escape car was an old beaten Chevi van that they claimed to have no breaks. Hey, why did not they get a nice girl truck for robbery? It may have boosted the audience's view of the film. This film was very low low low budgeted because nothing was damaged or destroyed. This film had many things in which Christian people would be maddened. Hey, I even expected a scene of car raid because all the films that rob banks had cars running, but I did, but it never was. So, I'm evaluating this film, which refers to a low budget and 1 out of ten stars.
