A fragmentary film about a couple of people in Austria during the heat. This type of film is done more often, and most of all, better. The stories actually have nothing to do with each other, apart from the pathetic finale: 'people are cruel'. Ugly flesh, unpleasant people and a movie that takes too long, not to do the thing ... Ultra-realistic? Hard ... Bored? Really. Even the wonderful Franzische Veiss can not save this! 3/10
