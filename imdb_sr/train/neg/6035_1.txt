I really would love to give this negative voice, because I think I only spent 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie I ever recorded. the acting was just terrible, I think REALLLIIII bad, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded like it was written .... I can not remember anything terribly enough to say. Both the day "out" and the night "inside" shoots make you think that the events lasted for several days. He was terrified, directed, directed, etc, etc. All the way to everyone's lunch. SHOULD BE FROM THIS ON EVERY COST. If my only saving grace is to keep myself from hell, if I do one good deed, it is to tell the world not to watch this shit. This film is the exact reason why horror films are never taken seriously.
