I know it's a Pover-Rangers trick and I'm concerned about 7-year-olds, but why did they take this film seriously? If you write a crayon action, at least have the power to be stupid. It's a bit hilarious if you're watching this. We have a typical family filled with clich√© characters (father veteran who lost his wife and guilty of LOLOL), children who are trying to fill a stereotype, but do not succeed in a terrible acting and ridiculously terrible companion that makes no sense. for the movie, but to fill the space of the camera. Funny stuff! However, the real moment comes close to when a war dad and a bad actor are trying to fight for a sword, but then they realize that none of them know how (probably because there is no budget space for choreographers) , so they came up with this type of setting up the American Gladiator to run around. LOL. Ratings 1/10 for trying this seriously.
