Good performances and art directions are not a good movie. This film is so terrible and depressing that I could not feel any joy for the "happy" ending involving a union strike. Attempts to engage in humor during the pregnancy of the lake are absolutely catastrophic, and every film involving Baldwin's brother already has a strike against him. In a positive way, Lang is still one of the great underrated actors in America, but he only does it worth saving in the VCR. I'm giving this 4.
