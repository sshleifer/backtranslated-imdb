Or "Marlove At Sea". Another funny overdone old movie with Boogeyman. Likewise. Bogey essentially plays the same character as in Marl's films; always in control of the situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous the situation is, women call it "slim" and "ladies" and other such nonsense, is the only "true male" the alpha male in the movie (the only other alpha male) is the man of the head of Gestapo - but he is just a fat alpha male), and - of course - every attractive young woman who comes to the road can not resist his charms and wants his penis within a few hours after their introduction. All the clich√©s are here. Bogey should be the same type of zinc-reform as in "Casablanca," and of course it often refuses money or other valuables when offered-but how does it fit with a strong cynic in it? No, so it can not be a cynic; Havks wanted this in both directions: a character who is "cool lone cynic", yet a good-meaning humanitarian. I think it's not like that ... Bacall is doing his routine for the first time, "cool babe", not too much, and there are also overestimated, not too interesting, so-called "sexual allusions" between her and Bogey; These dialogues sound stupid by today's standards. "Just push your lips and whistles ...". The burden of shit ... She was 19 when she was made, but she looks much older, and she's far less attractive than the female stars of the day. Her bony face, with its sharp lines, is nowhere near the dawn of the feminine beauty of de Havilland, the sweetness of Mirna Loi, let alone the likeness of Irena Dunne. Beckal was more suitable for playing vampires, not fem-fatales. (In real life she looks very much on her face: a Hollywood bitch.) There is a scene in which Bacall enters tears; very inappropriate for her character. There are two or three bad music numbers - but my rewind button was ready.
