I could not give this film a bad rating or a poor rating for two reasons: Robin Villiams and Tony Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller, and there are some insignificant disturbing elements that rely on the psychological, to which the film could focus a bit. Robin Villiams plays Gabriel Noon, a deejay who deals with storytelling, which goes through personal problems: his lover is moving out and Gabriel has what looks like the story of the narrator's block. One day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pit tells the story of his life and abuse he suffered from his parents. She lives with a adopted mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Tony Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and reveals the possibility that Pete Boland may not exist. I will not go into details because I do not want to spoil the film, but I'll tell you this: it's quite predictable. A fascinating atmosphere for the story and good performances by Robin Villiams and Tony Collette, which I thought was the key figure of the movie. Collette is no doubt one of the most talented and beautiful actresses. Her ability to get involved in the psyche and personality of the portraits is very unusual and I hope to see her win the Oscars (hell, I think she could get the best supporting actress for this, if the script is a little better). The film starts as a psychological thriller, but it's also predictable. If you are interested in finishing a movie and turning a movie, then watch a movie, otherwise I would rent another predictable thriller called "Hide and Seek".
