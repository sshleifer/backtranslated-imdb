This complete disorder of the film was directed by Bill Rebane, a man who is partly responsible for the truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-go go. As I was approaching the end of The Cold, I came to an incredible conclusion that this film is actually worse than the 60s shocker. Story ?? such as ?? there are about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people into their remote villa to play a series of horrible games. Whoever can sustain a step and survive to the end, will win $ 1,000,000. This is a very simple plot, but Rebane still manages to somehow make the boundary of the procedure with the incomprehensible. Things are happening. The characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Veirdli. I mean, damn it, what's the end? I suppose you have to make your own conclusions. Production values ​​and acting do not call into question the standard of pornographic film. True, Pamela Rohleder (Shelley) is not that good. She is so incredibly terrible that she is tempting. Unfortunately, the same thing can not be said for this crap-fest as a whole, it's just a cheap basement rotter.
