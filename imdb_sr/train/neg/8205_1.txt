Very bad acting and a very shallow story. Not even decent B-Movie Events that were shocking like people who came to an alien ship were boring and very poor. This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw 5.0 stars and I decided to watch it, because I like the genre, but it's so bad for me. Now there are very few good films on ALIEN, I think most of them are poor. I give 3/10
