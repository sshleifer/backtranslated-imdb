This is Westerne's action. James Steart leads all actor stars in the picturesque northwest, which is shot in great glory. Scenography and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stevart plays a wealthy cattleman who opposes the dishonest government in old Nothvest. The main disadvantage is a stereo-shaped cynic that Hollywood has always made a hero. Even when this film was filmed, the cynic was a stereotypical hero, and the one that Stevart shows really has a little rescue grace. He is kind to his partners, and this gives him an additional dimension of credibility and sympathy. However, he is so daring to everyone else, it's hard to really worry about him, or accept him for it. It is similar to one-dimensional western spaghetti (not so bad). Still, small characters are pretty fun. Valter Brennan, Roial Dano, Harry Morgan and others make this a worthwhile look.
