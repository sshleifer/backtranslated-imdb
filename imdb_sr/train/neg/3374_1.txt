Some people regard this film as a classic - I have no idea why. It's terrible to the point of being ridiculous. The only savings in this movie is the delivery of raw lines that are so furry, that they do not like them, but laugh at them. movie, or SO WHAT! There is no plot, it is set up in a theater without a landscape change, and Michael Douglas is depressed as always. My brother forced me once to watch this movie, because he said I would not believe how bad a movie could get! He was right. Usually, a movie that was terrible recommended that people should not watch it, but in this case I think that people should, because every other bad movie you have seen in perspective.
