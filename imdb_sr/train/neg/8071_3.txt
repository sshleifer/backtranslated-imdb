I wanted to watch this movie for Eliza Dushka, but she has only a small part in her, and her character is not very nice. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and perfect for enjoying the movie. This is nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent. She does a very good job. The story itself, at first glance, is pretty meaningless. After a collision, some friends may be dead, but they continue to live their previous lives, while all kinds of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are behind them, but we never found out who they are (perhaps they were in another car, but we certainly do not hear anything about why they are looking for them). Final scenes look particularly ambitious, but I can not draw anything coherent from this. The first scene, in which the bad guys (wearing some weird masks) cut the blue girl on the wrist and collected some of her blood, never explains or is not following. Unless the bad guys should be the representatives of a surgeon trying to pull Cassie (Sagemiller) back from the dead ... but no, that does not seem to work. The bad guys are just bad guys; they really just mess up a story that would otherwise be interesting. In the supernatural story of death and love and sacrifice, who, hell, need bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
