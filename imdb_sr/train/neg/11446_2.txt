My family and I checked Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog (I liked my four-year-old child), Hot Rod seems to look like Oscar-worthy material. The only thing that could save this movie was that Evel himself came out of retirement to scow Samberg to make this film. I admit, however, that the soundtrack was good. I was not sure if the film was set in the 80s, but with the majority of music coming from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass. And just stay home and watch the test sample at your local TV station. Or if you're dead and looking at this, people under the influence could enjoy it.
