Something I really love in the short films of this woman is the insensitivity of the theme - especially in "Life With Luck". This film has some nice beginnings - an unusual place and potential for strange film treatment, but it does not succeed in clumsy dialogue, uneven performances and very television coverage. ordinary cinema. Ideas are so expressed that they almost feel like television commercials. But the feeling is good so we can not complain too much. I really would like this director to make full-length animation and try to work with a producer who does not demand so much boredom of clarity.
