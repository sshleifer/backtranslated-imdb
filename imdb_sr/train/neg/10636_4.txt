I really enjoyed this show with regard to the quality of the actors and the fact that Scott's brothers were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes are gone! Again, we have said that we believe that the KGB is a group of ineffective morons, who have no idea what they are doing. At one point there is a funny scene in which the 4 KGB agents can not file a CIA agent. I was tired of these biased, one-sided and completely inaccurate displays of Spi games that took place during the Cold War. I find it ridiculous that the US is unable to make objective films about their participation in World War II and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we are led to believe that the US again got the Enigma machine, quite fake. The stores are also extremely well realized. Alfred Molina makes an excellent performance like Keaton (the conflict between them is very well made). I really wanted to like this show and I will no doubt watch other 2 episodes, but I really want American productions to stop trying to show their spies, soldiers, etc. Planet. It becomes old quickly and seriously diminishes the credibility of what could have been 10/10. S
