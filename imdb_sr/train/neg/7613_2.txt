Little Californian city of Diablo hit mysterious deaths after Sheriff Robert Lopez discovered an ancient box. Sheriff's daughters, Dominicus and Marie, to fight with an evil and bloodthirsty demon. "Diablo Legend" is absolute trash. I am a big fan of the indie horror flick, for example I loved "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone Sickness" or "Neighborhood Vatch", unfortunately "The Legend of Diablo" is a huge Inappropriate Avoid.
