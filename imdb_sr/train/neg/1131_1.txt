Too bad that even the talented director, Desplechin, failed to achieve a decent performance from the desperate-talented actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn has no substance to pass a very concise and clear plan. In an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of the acting state, the performance and presentation are too fictitious and poorly derived to attract any compassion for the viewer. In excessively long times, the excess of Estherina's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduce the story into the fragile frame of the disastrous display. The content is incoherent and free because Phoenix is ​​struggling to make Desplechin's instruction, just as Esther allegedly tries to do the same. Never feeling a convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never felt a victory in Phoenix's talent.
