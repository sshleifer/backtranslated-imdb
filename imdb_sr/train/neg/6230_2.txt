I was kind of interested in this movie as a trash cannibal. I was completely disappointed. it was the same kind of disappointment that I felt watching 'Friday, May 13th: Jason Takes Manhattan'. so much potential is lost! The home scene is a decent catcher of attention. then stop. abundant breasts and unusual fashion from the 80's can not help this movie. The only thing that eats near this island of Cannibal monks is piranha! I'm not looking for a Cannibal Holocaust, but I've been looking for a cheap exploitation upstairs. I did not get any of that. I found several parts of the battle scene a bit intriguing, hence two stars. I do not think it's really worth the time it takes to look. I could see him at a party where nobody cares about what's happening, and you just want something in the background. but I would not say to anyone: "Oh, man, you see this movie." it is not enough enough, nor is it bad enough to earn much attention.
