Horror / Sci-Fi is interesting because it's ridiculous. F / Ks pretty good ... for what you can see. Made for a TV thriller that is not as bad as the worst. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant, though misguided scientist that alleviates stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with that shark hammer. Horrible results produce one hell of killing machine. A group of scientists led by Villiamo Forsithe and Hunter Til are invited to a remote island to check out a brilliant new experiment. Of course, after laughing and stuttering in awe ... Coombs' creation, by the way, his son got up with a hammer, he was released to hunt one of his colleagues. Revenge is not always helpful. Also in the acting: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
