Disnei goes to the well too many times, as anyone who has seen the original MALU MERMAID will feel obviously torn off. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric are planning to meet with King Triton. Ursula's sister, Morgana, quickly dropped to the celebration, which plans to use Melodi as a defense tool to get the royal trio. By stopping the attack, Ariel and Eric draw a wall around the ocean as Melody grows up wondering why he can not get there. Terrible and terrible is what describes this directly on the video sequel. MALI MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you see looks exactly like other Disney movies. I guess Disney can only plagiarize! Do not tell me that the penguin and the sea do not remind you of another duo from Lion King. Other disappointing moments include a reunion between Sebastien and Louie, a royal chef. They played it awfully! The peak between Morgan and EVERYONE looked like another disappointment. I will not give anything, but in 75 minutes everything seemed incredibly cramped and too much to handle. Disgrace to Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better left to rent and laugh. Then you can prepare for the rest of the rest of the sequences Disnei will drown you later.
