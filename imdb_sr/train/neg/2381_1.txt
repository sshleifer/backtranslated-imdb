I'm not surprised that even covgirls get blues if this movie is all that's needed. I was expecting something better than Uma Thurman, for which I also experienced my way through this experience. A horrible movie with only music as a redeemable quality. It's a shame that we are not able to give 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This movie deserves it.
