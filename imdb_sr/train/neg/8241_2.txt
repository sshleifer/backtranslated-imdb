This film has many problems that are associated with it, which makes it go to a film school as a small-class budget project. Still, I have to earn her. Many times I hysterically laughed during the film. It was so terrible sometimes that he was a comedian, which made him an entertaining watch. If you are looking for a low-slasher movie with a spell of psychological horror and a somewhat funny campaign, then pop a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends, and have fun. I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. The dialogue is almost impossible to track most of the time, and the soundtrack is somehow there.
