Yes, Marie Dresler drinks juice juice for which he thinks the poison is coming out of the run. Dresler is good. I've never had tea, but she's a solid artist who keeps the screen safe. I looked at Polly Moran, whom I saw somewhere else. Here, Moran is OK - just OK - like Dressler's funny friend / foe. It's a shame that she drowned in almost complete oblivion. The operation is a good heart. The bad guys are trying to rob the citizens. Dressler triumphs and ends well. I'm wondering about the central parcel mechanism: bonds. This came out during the depression, and maybe they were all familiar with the bonds and what they can do if they are well used and if they are misused. However, not from that time, I know them vaguely. They're just different shares, is not it? It seems strange to build a story about the Little Man around a slightly sophisticated monetary whole.
