First let me be honest. I did not watch all this movie. I watched the first five minutes and when I realized that I almost fell to sleep, I decided that I could move quickly and see if it was later even more interesting ... No. This film is just a collection of lousy attempts to make a story that is already uninteresting and badly told in something that would never become: a decent horror. Because I think it's important to say that even a movie with bad special effects can still be good if it's well-made. This film is not and it will not just sleep if you try to watch it. In the end, I think it's important to say that this movie is in the public domain, so if you think you have absolutely to watch it, a little bit of research on the internet will surely show you a place where you will not have to pay to watch this bunch of cinematic garbage.
