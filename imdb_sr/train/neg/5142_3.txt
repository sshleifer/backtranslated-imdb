After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dinamite, he made one of his worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During this first year in films, Chaplin recorded about a third of his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libing, assembly, location, location recording, etc. This takes place at the racecourse where Chaplin and his friend are trying to go without paying. Mabel Normand is also with her friend, and Chaplin is able to get rid of her and Mabel's friends. Then Mabel was dragged on the platform without obvious repercussions of his behavior. There's a lot of slapstick here, but there's very little else to recommend this movie to others then watching Chaplin develop. The print I saw was very worse, which may have affected his enjoyment. Charlee Chase can be seen. * of 4 stars.
