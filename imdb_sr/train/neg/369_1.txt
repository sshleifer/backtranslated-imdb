I almost called HBO and asked for money back for the month just because they were broadcasting this movie. I can only see the movie bosses sitting around, "All right, we have to figure out something that is just like Home Alone, we'll just add a bunch of money to the kid, hire actors, and oh, that's a lot less fun! </ Well, maybe not the last part, but that's basically what you have here. It's not worth it to look at whether someone else's renting it, and as a movie for kids? Forget it, I would not let my kids see this, not necessarily because of a joke with bad taste, but because I would not want them to say: "What did you think to show us that poor piece of garbage, Dad?!?!"
