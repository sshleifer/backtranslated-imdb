I am not from America and I know what Swap Swap is. When the performance came out of that name, I was delighted to see some cool sexual moments from the program. But what I got was a real nonsense. I was wrongly rated by the name of the title, there is no adult content, no nudity, even vulgar dialogues (they are widely installed cast the Hallmark channel and I think they have edited / disabled such content to edit it). > Emission that gives an image of the current American / Western family situation, fat obese people, contaminated teenagers and their family departures. In each episode, two women / two mothers (more precisely) were selected to live in their homes and re-alter the family routine with their new own government. Sometimes it turns out to be good or evenly bad. At the end of each mother they return with her husband and try to conclude what they have done to each family in the past days. It is part of the sucking program where each candidate is fighting for his rights. I was sucked to see all of this, instead of seeing some great sexual sexual things. I mean, who makes this program more than the one who gave the name Swap Swap; it is better to call "Exchange of Mothers". All in all, it ruined all the great things that a wife's exchange was done! Replacement for your wife = Average sucking Realty Shov.
