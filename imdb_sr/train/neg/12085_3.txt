There really is not a lot of need to start this little review with the synopsis of the action. I mean, this is Shakespeare's Hamlet for God's sake? probably one of the most famous drama ever written. I am not embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet the way most people on IMDb have? through the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although the performance may not be the best place to judge the film, in this case I can not imagine trying to watch it without comedy. In a word, this German Hamlet version made for TV is bleak. 152 minutes? No way! It's too dark and depressing to spend anything for almost three hours. I said that countless times, but fun is a matter for me. And this wrist is far from having fun. I will, however, give a few points for what I felt like some pretty good behavior. It sounds 3/10 about me. As much as I enjoy MST3K, their comments do not help Hamlet become even more tasty. There are several good riffs there, but overall, Hamlet is just a wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is too talkative that comedy could have any rhythm or flow. As much as it hurts, I need to give Hamlet 1/5 on my MST3K scale.
