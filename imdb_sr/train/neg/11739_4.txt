Often reliable Leonard Maltin says this is "a wonderful romance" and that Sanders is "great." Maltin certainly confused this film with something else. Sanders is going down and droll and great, as usual, ?? you can imagine his delivery of a line of adultery: "Sometimes marriage chains are so heavy that they have to wear three," but the boring, wooden and dated are more accurately describing this film. The story itself, autobiography with Sanders as a murderous gemfiddler, Francois Eugene Vidock, who becomes the chief of the police, but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels, is fun, but has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that has been violated. as an epic period like * Marie Antoinette *, and certainly for the regret * Forever Amber * (who screams for the elegant remake). Although, in his defense, Sanders is vigorously trying to add depth to his character, all is nothing. I am the admirer of Douglas Sirk, but this was in 1946, and this is one of the earliest US efforts, without many signatures that would define his lush, rude poker. Sirk just wet his legs, and made several unforgettable films in the next ten years until he hit gold with * magnificent obsessions *, and hit it in a punch, bombarding us with such estrogen festivals as * All that heaven allows *, * Written in the wind *, and * imitation of life *. But * Scandal In Paris * Hardly His Best Work? a relatively low-budget affair with raw sets and inefficient costumes.
