OK ... This is the third in the carnosaur series. Dozens of dinosaur puppets! At the beginning of the movie, you can not see Dinin the cause when you start counting your body, you can only see Dino's eye, it's pretty wise to hide bad dolls! and maybe in 16 minutes ahead of the movie, some team of special forces with Scott Valentine as Rince, the team enters the warehouse and then begins to find parts of the body and dead body after Dino Raising, after a while a large box of failures in the team comes in and you can hear a scream velociraptora, pretty creepy !!! and then a black girl is walking forward, and now one joke has been found! She pops a hand of raptor and cuts her face, but if you stop when a raptor comes, you can see that it's just a guy with a hand doll !? VTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorists are attacking a truck because they, although they have washed some weapons there. 2. Those where they died were wrong that ten tonnes of raptors and one giant t-Rek are there inside! How did t-Ray fit in? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill dinosaurs! Unfortunately, some dumb blonde told him to catch one of them alive = (4. The Holy Jesuits have a game on their accomplishments!) 5. Dino is now on board in the Pacific. T-Reek had a strange thing on his neck 7. END Film It's good if you want a good laugh.
