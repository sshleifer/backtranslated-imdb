In the end, too stupid and meaningless. Yes, there is a metaphor with a gilded cage, but most of the children would probably miss it. Forgettable. Immediately. The animation is, as we expected, super real. The line-line can best be described as thin but persistent. Although my ending seemed arbitrary. The underground sewerage channel is a rather disgusting reflection of the world above and, somehow, wealth and money seem to be counting there. Oh, yes, and there is a romantic interest with a woman who is smarter, smarter and gets-out of money - it in itself quickly becomes a tedious (anti) stereotype. Probably your kids will like it.
