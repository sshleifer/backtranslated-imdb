Well, I can always break the question forever: "What's the worst movie ever made ... ever?" This is Let Furi, acting and co-author Steven Seagal. There are certainly many famous bad films, but this one takes the cake so it's taken seriously. It's a film made in Romania that only talks about how much Romania must go to catch Bollywood. He also talks about how completely he is deprived of the intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become. This film is so bad that you literally feel disturbed after watching it and you have to squat in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. (I can not imagine why) and I doubt that the workers who had to make DVDs must wear protective equipment and get regular counseling.
