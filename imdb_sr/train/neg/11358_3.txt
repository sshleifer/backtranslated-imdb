When I saw this trailer on TV, I was surprised. In May 2008, I was in Sik Flags in Nev Jersey, and it turned out to be a 4-D attraction (you know, a moving attraction). I guess the version I saw was a shortened version (15 minutes) and also made to add effects of movement. It was a sweet movie ... but that was it. She was educated and talked about the first mission, but the completion of the CGI of space walk seemed a bit ... well ... banal. I was not a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend this film to any parent who wants to inform their children in a fun way about the first moon's walk. I will say, the actors of the characters were well selected and the characters themselves were cute. So, all-in-all, I would say, if you want to bring younger children ... go to that. But if you want to take older children, take them to another movie ... they will thank you.
