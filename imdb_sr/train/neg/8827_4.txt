I love cherry blossoms from the 80's and I remember when "The Silent Night / Deadly Night" was pulled out of our theater, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of these on Fear.net. Better watch what I expected of these types of movies. The quality of the special effects was ridiculous according to today's standards, the character development is too long, but everything was ridiculously loud! The scenes that he lost because Santa Claus, or Dad, felt his mother and later when the mafia actually showed luminaries - not flashlights like the 80s, but the real torches! - I really banged my bone. However, the scenes where she checked the children in his neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of a different nature. I also enjoyed trying to figure out who are some of these art actors. It took me some time to realize that the main figure was a lovely bear on the Brahma.
