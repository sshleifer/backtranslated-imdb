Really, I can not believe I spent $ 5 on this movie. I'm a big zombie fanatic and I thought the movie could not be so bad. There were zombies in it? Did I make a mistake? To be honest, the movie had its moments ... I thought it was great when the guy took off his head, but it was because of that. All in all, I think it would be more pleasant to slip down a skateboard on a naked nutsack in an octagon, and then look again at this movie. The movie might be better if we could see some tits, but I had to watch a trailer for other films produced by this company to see it. The customer is kept ... unless you disagree with the masochism.
