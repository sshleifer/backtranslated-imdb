I saw him at Philadelphia Gai and Lesbian Film Fest. <br /> <br /> What to say? Against my better judgment, I liked it, but it seemed to me that the act was a little ... weak (I mostly noticed it from the family of teenagers). I mean, the script was not great, but the actors did not make me believe in relationships. The operation is also predictable. I loved it. The characters are nice and the action is not challenging or disturbing. It's sweet, the characters worry about each other, and I do not count as fifty minutes of unused. But I do not recommend it.
