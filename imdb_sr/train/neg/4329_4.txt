I will never forget the wit and a great comedy of ORIGINAL vacation films! Lines, pacing and the time of the events in that movie are remarkable! However, this continuation of the European holiday is a great downturn. In this sequel, Grisvalds will win the European holiday in the match. The problem is that many jokes in the movie are a bit more than mild, "ha ha" laughs. For example, a flier on a plane asks Clark: "Do you want your cockatoo in the office?" Clark replies, "No, I'll have him here." It's really the only line that's funny in this movie. European humor for relaxation is tense. As if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, they tried to re-hack a script that was made earlier, and relied on a funny sequence in the search for a waterfall stick toward the end of the picture just to kill time. Even worse, natural comics like Randy Kuaid as a cousin of Eddie and the original kids who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie so they can not be found. Their substitutions are not ridiculous, they can not work, and they just seem to be moving through the moves most of the time. There are some rude sexual jokes and comments that are not only funny, they are in bad taste. Grisvald was supposed to stay in Valli Vorld. The place they made legends! Do not join them in this European terrible adventure. The viewers should look at the original holiday movie instead of this! You'll be glad you did it.
