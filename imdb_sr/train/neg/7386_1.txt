I tried to re-launch the movie twice. I put it on three machines to see what's wrong. Did Steven Seag's voice change? Did he die during the shooting, and the studio had to call the sound with someone who does not even look like it? Or is the sound on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the actual voice of the actor. Although during most of the film, it sounds like sound is recorded in the bathroom. It would be a shame to give me a copy of this movie Goodwill, if I own a copy. I rented it, but I will never do it again. I will check this database before I rent more of its films, all of which were (more or less) good movies. You usually know what you get when you watch Steven Seagal movie. I guess there's no more.
