"Dahmer" is an interesting movie, although I would not use it "horror" or "thriller". It's more a small study of the character that looks strangely sympathetic to the killer. Jeremy Renner displays the serial killer Jeffrey Daher, who has been drugging, killing and breaking up his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and Rodney, who played Artel Cairo well. Rodney is an increasingly interesting character: he is in love with Dahmer and once he fled from the attack, he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives another attack. I think the film is unconnected because it contributes little to Dahmer's formative years, how the events could create a human monster that we see on the screen and does not give insight into Dahmer's belief that he could create the sexual zombies of his victims. The roles are well played, but the story is slim.
