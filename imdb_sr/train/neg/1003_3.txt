OK, I'm not Japanese. I know a little about Japanese culture, and a bit less about Japanese pop culture. Besides, I am Spaniard, I eat paella and I love black humor. Well, on this issue, I can comment on the film: I have no idea how pleasant it is for the Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii is a pretty good director - despite the too pedantic postmodern things in the Talking Head style, and even and that was curious and interesting - and I'm surprised he came to this. Perhaps this is just one of those loss cases in translation, I'm afraid it is, but as a European viewer watching a movie with subtexts of overloaded English subtitles, I just thought it was terrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked - I mean, let the public pause, and silence a little damn narrator - to the point that my head almost exploded because of excessive fast speech and absurd action. br /> However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great and is well-used in these animated scenes. However, the candy ends as soon as the characters are left aside to begin with endless, not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speeches in the photographs. It just makes you want to quickly move to the next scene of hysterical characters. I read Mamoru Oshii, actually plans to continue this. The idea was good, but terribly exploited. Perhaps the second part will show the good parts of this first and actually make an interesting movie, or there may be more and more of the told stories. But hell, if you thought Talking Head was thick, Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters would give you a cause. Of course, all these comments are based on the experiences of someone who is European. It's probably totally unusable for Japanese people, perhaps it was a really funny movie lost in cultural borders and translation. Maybe.
