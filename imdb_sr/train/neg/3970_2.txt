Okay. You see - I've seen LOTS and I think of many of these types of movies. You know, those in which the DVD cover looks so good and it's good that you can not wait to see it? Well, I got GOT again. And I'm pretty tired of it. But I step down. It's pretty simple. It's bullshit (I know, I prefer to be a minor), but it is. And so I agree with another poster that if we have to sit through the boring thing, why, WHY the main actress has to be so unattractive? The frustration she used transferred the unexplained pain / sorrow over the death of her daughter did not help. I mean, Jesus ... Oh, but the creepy-on-her-back-demon thingee is pretty tidy ...
