My first clue as to how this would be bad was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us the Blair Vitch Project that was a masterpiece in relation to this piece of garbage. The act was on the sixth grade of production in Oklahoma, and the plot, as it was, is predictable, boring and meaningless. 85% of the script are four letters and countless variations. It seems that mother F is a favorite "writer" because it is constantly used. It must have taken all 10 minutes to write this script in a dive at the last call. Thank God for hiring him, and I could skip most of that fast. Do not waste time and money with this.
