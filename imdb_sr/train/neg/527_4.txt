Play in a movie that's much smaller. Vanessa Redgrave dies, but before she leaves, she starts telling her daughters a story about her life and her secret love ... This is one of those films that have the look and expectations of a great movie simply because there are so many big actors and actors in it, so it looks like it's something else, not the potboiler who really is. It's not as bad as that, but with Redgrave, Tony Collette, Glenn Close, Meril Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all who give good performances) expect more than a scary story that's a bit romance with harlequin. Wait for cable.
