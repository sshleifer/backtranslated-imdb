As other viewers mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. Colors are comics bold. I think the director took his artistic vision of the film, not what he needed to pay attention to the content. Despite the great acting performance, the performances are glittering, and the story is almost unconnected. Madonna is probably thrown just like a stunt to get a pre-release. The good thing is that her performance gave her confidence in her album "I'm Breathless", which was a hit in the stratosphere (largely due to the involvement of the dance-hit "Vogue" - not in, nor has the smallest relationship to this film). I suppose that most of the money from this movie came from a tie-ins to Madonna's "I'm Breathless" album. If you look at him at home, by the ending titles, I think "there are two hours of my life, I'd love to come back." Save the lost time - do not bother with this.
