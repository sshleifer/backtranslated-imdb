This could have been a pretty funny movie, but instead he ranked with other dude like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinema chain of food. If they played this movie in the face, it could be a very fun movie, such as Re-Animator or Dead Alive, but Juan Pikuor Simon plays in the mouth on stains, but more often. The premise of this film is a small community that is surrounded by mutated snails. There is an abandoned toxic waste dumps near a sewage line that mutates molds into aggressive monster eaters-although monsters are slow moving and can crush under your boot. Health inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people who are ready to fight with the snails while the sheriff and the mayor think they are crazy. The highlight is the mess in laughter - unintentional - which forces you to scratch your head about how stupid (actors and scriptwriter) the scenario of destroying snails. STORY: $$ (No new basics) Simon seems to play elements up-to-face, but the dialogue was flat. Did Simon work with a smart script - one with many lines and eccentric characters , it could have been a cult film. BRUSHING: $$$ (You will not be out of work here.) We got a lot of exploding chest cavity scenes, as well as a big head blast in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant, the blood and intestines in which many viewers of horror films enjoy it's full of swing. You also get corpses of people who are clean from bullets and many scattering scenes. ACTIVITY: $ (Michael Garfield seems to know that he knows this script is stinky and he delivers his lines with the expression of a person who suggests that he knows how this absurd film is ndeavor is. Kim Terri, like his wife , he does an appropriate job, although he goes a little bit over it. "Teens" were all horrible actors - no exceptions. "Man, this film could have been used by Bruce Derne or Jeffrey Combus!" she entered the girl's bedroom, and a male and female nudity here ).
