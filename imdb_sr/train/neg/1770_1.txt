My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever recorded. Surely in the top ten that I looked to end. At least "Plan 9" was pleasant. I really enjoyed the "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and some other of his films. I did not care much for "Cujo" (just because the sound was so bad on the versions I saw and often I could not say what people were saying), or "Five Sematars." > <br /> But this mess is a total error in every possible way. The very "creatures" looked like they were devised by a nine-year-old. (No offense to 9-year-olds.) Even "one-liners" have made us sigh and we were not entertaining.
