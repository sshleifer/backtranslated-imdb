How in a movie with Ami, Posei and Raechel, NIŠTA is not funny? Believe it or not, 'House Bunny' has done it better and more fun. I hope the directors have had a good holiday and have received some money - this film is a disgrace for all of them. It's a cliché from beginning to end. Clichés can work well with the script, or at least with the idea. This movie uses nothing but uses clichés after clichés, not ideas or scenarios. She uses the already existing personality of actresses rather than develops character. Bad, sad and trash. Obviously, I have to have ten lines of text for comment. Really? Why? As an IT manager, this is another example of messy coding.
