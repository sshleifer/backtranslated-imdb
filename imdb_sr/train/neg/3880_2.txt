Sometimes I can watch a good movie. I've seen some pretty sick things. However, this is one of several films that I found grotesque in a way that was simply repulsive and disgusting. I love the movies above when they're fun. I like a lot of creativity behind them. Up in this movie is not creative. He's sick. That's disgusting. It's totally unpleasant. That's why this movie is certainly not fun. The film is a horror movie, but it lacks the fear. So the only reason why this movie would be watched for the worse, but it's the most disadvantageous and uglier aspect of the whole movie, and that's a lot of talk. The acting is terrible, the action does not make sense, and the music is really boring and too electronic. All this took away my film. Almost the entire film is a long, long-lasting pain. There's a guy who has an accident in the shuttle and wakes up at the hospital to find out that his skin is dissolved and dissolved. I suppose that he then comes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the process of melting. There is some strange backdrop that involves an old pair pursued by a dog, a sort of scattered head floating down a stream, and an end that involves a man who has suffered a current. There were moments when I really tried to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole movie that I thought was even fun was the early scene in which the nurse slowly walked down the hospital corridor. If you love ugly, nasty, unpleasant horrors, this is for you.
