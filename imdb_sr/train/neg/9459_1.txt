Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines compress this shabby little movie that only attracts idiotic children and their parents to cinema. and his ... # 1 movie in America! What does this country think? Mike Miers looks more like Micheal Jackson. Let the Chineese Lady fall asleep in 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesque and terrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham go out in 2005, I'll be so happy! (no) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham. They will try to drive Sam-I-Am and the guy who runs away with it. (I hope they will not destroy the classic book.) Do not waste your time and money by seeing it.
