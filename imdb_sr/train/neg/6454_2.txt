The monster from Enemy Mine somehow broke into a small mountain community, where he settled down. He is hunted by a woman doctor - a prisoner who wants to destroy him. This female murderer, who looks like a refugee from the Motlei Crue video, rides a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who decided to make Big Chill a weekend in the middle of a monster race. Decapitation and a lot of blood are primarily on the spot to get attention from a story that stinks like a bad version of the island of Dr. Moreau (and yes, he's upstairs than with Val Kilmer).
