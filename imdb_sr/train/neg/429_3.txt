I was lazy to watch this movie on its star, but that's all it brings. He plays much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about the corruption of big cities. The greatest disadvantage is its predictability and the ultimate lack of uncertainty. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and just follow them as they fall like dominoes. The film retains its merits of free violence and sex, but has forgotten to replace good, pure romance or excitement in any other way. All the taste of a good, straight decapitated child car. The "Questions and Answers", which also takes place in New York, is far better off, as is "LA confidential".
