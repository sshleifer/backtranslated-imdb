Why?!! This was an unforgettable, uninspiring and uncomfortable film. The shame comes from coming from the city where they made it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they allow these people to do such a BAAAAAD movie there? When this movie was originally released ... it was more romantic comedy ... and no ROBO - nothing. It all changed along with the kindness of Disney. WHY???? They made a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. It was not even fun to see how Matthev Broderick mocks his own films. Sheesh !!
