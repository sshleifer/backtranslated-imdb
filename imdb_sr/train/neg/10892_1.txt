This film is AVFUL! I do not even know where to start, I have no say, and I can not even describe how terrible it is. The blood is primarily flourescent, and the acting is joyful! The only good side was a cycling girl who saves the day. This film was ridiculous, I do not see how it could even get a voice of 1 so bad. It seems that they were made by high school students.
