This film is simply not worth the time or money. Full cliches and complications that make no sense! I can not believe that so many people gave this horrible movie 10. I suppose they are the film's marionists. If I could give this movie a zero, I would. It's a shame that IMDb does not allow this. The only reason I looked at him was because I went with a friend who really wanted to see him. What's sad is that I never had great expectations of this movie and I still felt a little changed. Take my word, do not spend my $ 8 on this piece of garbage. The only fun I got out of the movie was the laundering of the director's name. All in all, NOT RECOMMENDED!
