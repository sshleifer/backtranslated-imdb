I'm sorry for the fans of this movie, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slow, badly acting and badly acting was a movie that is trying to escape the messy romp in recent years and it's not working! McDonald and Parker seem to be unable to convey real emotions and are lifeless. They seem to be in this for any payment checks they get for it, not because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is DULL !! I love great movies like the next girl, and this is not one !! If you avoid a movie this year ... let it be
