1993 was the year. This was before Phillip Seimour Thomas won Oscars. Who knew that I would be an extra player in the movie with him? I was actually paid a bonus in "Mi Boifriend's Back," which was filmed in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, TKS. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thank God that the producers changed their hearts!) I was on the stage. I hastened to watch the movie the day it was published in the movies. It's more comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, you might want to check. Nothing even close to "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead" quality, but the cheese factor is good enough. bye
