OK, I found this movie very well in my daddy old pile of movies and it looked pretty good with the cover, but the movie is actually sucked! All right, the first story with the swimmer was pretty good, but it took some time to get in, then she and her boyfriend were completely retarded! It's not even scary! His dream sounds like a good night's story. Then the girls with the news were completely retarded. I'm sure someone will call the press and ask him to come with you. But that's where he ended up wherever he was, and she was in the hospital and saw him on the so-called. and he told her all the trash. The next was a nice gay story about a guy who returned dead people ... MOM is so stupid that I will not even say more about it. The last one was the best. It was not so scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty cool .. and yes, the girl is obsessed and she kills all her colleagues or something like that. Then when everyone is finished speaking their dreams to each other, the losers enter the bus (DO HELL AHAHAHAH) and see all the people from their dreams on the bus (Ha). The end.
