Add to the list of caricatures: a southern preacher and "congregation", a singer with torches (Sophie Tucker?), Dance Choir and The Mills Brothers - just worsens. performers of "black people", who often appear in films in order to parachute themselves and their race. Although the "red comedy" may have been accepted in its time, it is today extremely offensive, and I doubt it has ever been ridiculous. Although I would not be insulted, I do not think I would have laughed with poor humor attempts. However, as an 11-year-old white boy, maybe I did not understand something of it.
