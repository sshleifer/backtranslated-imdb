OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie is excellent or even good, or is deceived or known by the director, writer and producer and is trying to instill buzz on this movie. I watched the movie because my friend worked on it and that was terrible. I'm an actress and I've been working in the industry for a long time on big movies, even on independent films, and this film has bored tears. The reason I'm so rude is that this film was obviously a different attitude about "mice and people" and I should be sued because it's such a terrible tearing off of the story. In the industry where Hollivood looks like a creative bankruptcy ... someone takes a classic book and movie "From Mice and People" and destroys it with a new rotation. Actors, accents, dialogue and direction were amateur, and writing was sad. I mean, if you decide on a new story about an existing story, make sure it's as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified. This film did not even like it.
