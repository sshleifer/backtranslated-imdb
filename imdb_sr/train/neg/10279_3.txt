This film was so scary that he was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with terrible sound quality, poor cinema and many actors who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rapp really has been able to deliver a good performance (especially before the end). And the character of Marjorie, a drunken lady, also enjoyed watching. The action was very unexpected and could have been ridiculous without terrible singing and loud piano music. Some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty attractive (but not in a good way). Open house is a fun movie to watch simply because it's horrible! We think it could be a good theater musical (with great actors).
