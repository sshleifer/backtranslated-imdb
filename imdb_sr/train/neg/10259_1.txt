I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and I always remember it as my first experience with taking away a horrible movie with a good advertisement. The ad was great, but later I found out that it had every explosion or 'special effect' in the whole movie (about 4), and even some that were not in the movie. There was some kind of intruder alienation, but the aliens were never shown in the movie as far as I remember. It was obvious that someone earned a cheap movie designed to deceive people. I suppose that my world of innocence ended that day, when I learned that there are bad people there who make bad bad films.
