Yes, there are movies above. Most of them are made for entertainment, on shoes for shoes, or as such. film of the week, but even if it was a movie 'Sunday', he would have rated no more than two stars. It's a bad movie about a serious subject that relates to the abused woman who escapes the king serving in the protective hands of the king's people. (If this is an attempt to show that she does not need a man to protect her, then the male man is exaggerated in the film and should not be in it at all). There is no tension, character development, and heroine that could be overwhelmed by the Rotton port. (I think she pulls a ring on a boat with a tank, not only throws him into the sea in the ocean (where she would be any body anyway), and after finding her husband, showing that she is a moron, she still makes her childish assumptions that lead to almost killing him.) I am always stunned when I see this type of film that is generally high, and I realize that Dr. Seus still has a huge untapped market of people that will be driven by his work. After I laughed at humanity, I cry.
