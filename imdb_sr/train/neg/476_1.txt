When converting a book to a movie, it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's desired tone or to transfer concepts instead of ignoring the author. Although it is clear that the director had access to and went to the advice of children Elinora Stevart, it is crucial to note that the children believed that their mother was a complete liar in terms of good, enriching, strengthening the household experience in her country. . The book describes in detail her life on the neighbors' property of her husband and her husband on the vast broadcaster of Wyoming; with her numerous friends and acquaintances chronicles day-to-day adventures, although they lived several dozen kilometers. The film, however, takes a standard stand at the time it was made, portraying the experience of this woman as rude, unyielding and almost pointless. Perhaps the director has brought some of his experiences from the Vietnam War with him to this film (as some film lovers said), but it seems to be a bad excuse for taking all the joys and beauty of the book and twisting into a gloomy, disgusting landscape without a friend or hope. Do not waste time with this movie; read the book instead.
