"This" Malcom "show on Fok is really a real murder ... can not we make our own version?" I'm thinking and paraphrasing, of course, but in our hearts we all know it's true, and that's the only thing NBC has added to the Malcom sex meter. And, boy, did you add sex ...? Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets a breakdown and covers him with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally enters aunt's under the shower and accuses him of looking at and fighting. He spies a cute girl in the next house out of his bedroom window, and she knows she wants to see her toples, but teasing him with a smiling and closing window. And this is all in the pilot. Take it from an adult man - a puberty boy is so sexually crazy and guided by testicles that it's impossible to be ridiculous to the mainstream audience. The only road that ever came close was in movies, and you can count those on one side. So it's no surprise that "Tucker" has the warmth and appeal of a swimsuit strip club. Did the network really think we would like to watch the kids get into puberty? Are not these things for which people go to prison? If you suspect the perverted performance, consider this: 13 episodes were recorded, but NBC canceled them after only 4 episodes were broadcast; then they made an unprecedented move to "burn" the remaining episodes by broadcasting them in the middle of the night so that they can not see them. Initially, children were originally the target audience. In addition to its general blur, Tucker is characterized by the running of a voice from the protagonist to extract a clever text. Even in 2000 she was terribly dated, with ska random music and super-sarcasm. I could not love a single character enough to laugh at jokes and jokes did not really reach a mile, and ... The damage caused by NBC for this dirty attack ... they are better than that. GRADE: C-
