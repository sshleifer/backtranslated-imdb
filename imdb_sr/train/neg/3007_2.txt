Well, on an endless quest for horror, we will come across this movie, apparently re-released on DVD recently for some ungodly cause. Transmission is terrible, and quality is only bullshit. I do not think this is because of a bad event or anything, I just think the film is badly performed. Obviously shot in an abandoned school with a budget that is no doubt spent on a cheap beer and no talent, "Slaughter High" starts slowly and does not raise the rhythm until about an hour. First, we see the "nerds" as it was picked up by a group ... I really do not know what should be ... athletes? The Collaborator, with his ultra hooknose, is so ugly that he should definitely be thrown like a dumbbell. Then, there is a 'big guy' and a couple of stupid losers and chickens that should be 'hot' but not. The mystery is why this group of rejecters fights for one of their own, but I assume that the viewer assumes they are "cool kids" on the face. Casting elections are terrible because most high school students play thirty and something. As other reviewers have pointed out here, the actors (if you can call them that way) are a bunch of Britons whose accents come out countless times through this shit. We have to suppose that this group of 'children' were the only students in this school, because their 'gathering' is only those in the school, which now turned out to be abandoned, only they. The murders are poor, the blood is not great and it's scenario like Scooby Doo with the right people; lines like: "This place gives me a damn ..." and "Somebody gave me a beer" are accentuated ... It just is not good. Skip this, unless you're losing some friends and want to laugh with the right chromium trying to get rid of it. If you want to see it well, take Bava's "Bai of Blood", done 14 years earlier and much better. If you want to see a good bad slasher, see "Just Before Dawn" or "The Burning". 2 out of 10, kids.
