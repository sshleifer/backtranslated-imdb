Up from the rating he got. This is a typical SciFi movie nowadays: bad to awesome acting, a badly written and poorly written script. From the opening scene where DeMille bury his set to the end, this film is terrible. In the early stages, this film is Moses (who was Charlton Heston in DeMille), Pharoah (Iul Brinner) and Nefretira (Anne Baktor) above the boys who bury the box in the sand. The characters representing the three above-mentioned icons were terrible and had to resemble those people who were supposedly supposed to be. The fact that this is in the desert far from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and everyone shouts for an ambulance. The screenwriter is obviously not aware of the fact that in the middle of the desert there are no ambulances. I was very disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a film of such a low quality.
