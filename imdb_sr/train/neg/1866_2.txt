A cheap movie about the exploitation of mothers looking for her daughter who was kidnapped by people who make porn movies. The track leads a mother across Europe while searching for her child and we are in the audience struggling to stay in a dream. This is one of the innumerable soft-core movies that are made for people who want excitement of pornography without stigma or the danger of appearing on their credit card account. Personally I would rather have a stigma because these films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we see. This should be a sexy thriller, but it's not. Mostly its people talk about things that follow a lot of walking from place to place and lead to guidance. Periodically, through the film, various people are unmasking and everything has more to do with the touch of S & M in the process. Violence and fetish material are such that they cause laughter, not horror or even excitement, and all this is incredibly false. Worse still, there is not enough nudity to be interesting. (Mostly parallel to the course for many of these films) Forgive my lack of detail, but it's just a boring dull movie in which I stayed to the end, hoping that something remote would happen, but nothing was there were. The most interesting thing was a blonde ossified criminal with a huge bite and a nose-size Buicka. I watched her with a morbid fascination wondering how she looked like a young girl and wondering if she had a plastic surgery, not the things you should think about in an exciting thriller. Avoid.
