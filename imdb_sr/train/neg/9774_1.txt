Hubert Selbi Jr. gave us the book "Rekuiem For A Dream" and wrote a script for the film Aronofsky. This film succeeded at every level by delivering an intimate and impartial portrait of the horror of the lives of characters and vices that destroyed them. "The last exit to Brooklyn" still has marriages and multiple characters living a sad life, but it's hard for them to do the same justice done by Aronofsky. Especially when in the film, homosexuality is equal to death. One gay guy gets stoning, is launched to the sky by a vehicle for speeding and landing dead on the sidewalk. The other is crucified, and even more simply beaten. Another exaggerated value of shock, which could actually be convincing if done well, are the scene of union workers who are literally struggling with strikers. Who would have thought that the Brooklyn drama would present action sequences and truck explosions? movies. The film is uncomplicated and can not even be reconciled with the genre. The lake was given a useless role every model could fill, and Baldwin just seems to know how to look stupid in his equally small part. And then Jennifer Jason Leigh comes in as our leading, repulsive whore named Trralala (believe it or not, I'm not kidding). Her performance is nothing big and the fate of her character is least dirty. The poor use of color and composition makes it cheaper than it is, and also takes the "right" edge of the provocative bits. Miss.
