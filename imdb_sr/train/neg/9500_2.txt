This movie is really bad. The acting is obvious, except Michael Ironside. I do not understand the story. Richard Grieco was the only survivor of the fight between the two Mc-gangs. He comes to town and is suddenly selected to fight the bad people who want an Indian country. On the cover, it was written that he himself was the Indians who returned and his hometown, I did not hear it in the film, if it was not so. bad actor. Stiff and ugly. And he said his lines liked him. And we would not talk about Sean Young, she was not one of my favorite actors, but in this film she plays an Indians who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She's terrible. When I rented it, I chose this and this with Amanda Pais. I chose this for Michael Ironside in the actors. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge. Do not see it unless you think Richard Grieco looks tight on a motorcycle with sunglasses. I have it at home. I wrote it after I saw a movie.
