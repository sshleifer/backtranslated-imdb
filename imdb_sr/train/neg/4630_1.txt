Released in 1965, but apparently taken several years earlier, this is an unsuitable little criminal melodrama with some incompetent sexploitation. As usual for the grinthouse epoch, there are quite a number of undressing and dressing for no reason complemented by bad music, boring narration and clumsy editing. The coffee scene sets an exciting basis, while we cut back and forth between the characters to avoid actually seeing their lines speak. All we get is reactions in the voice outside the screen! 50-yr. Misti Aiers several times before the action started, bumped her French panties. She is constantly accompanied by what is apparently a music store from romantic to western to mummy-no-eating, mixed accidentally to produce, among other things, the most exciting lighting of cigarettes ever filmed on the movie. Watch it whilst it bangs! Watch it hit! Will she inhale or be caught by Apache? Only time will show !! The film talks about the rude story of how Salli gets deceived to work in a public house, falls on a drug, and can not escape. For some reason, we've been treated with some of the boring and boring whores ever devoted to the film, literally working on their nails or knitting, not entertaining the clientele. Have an incredibly silly comedy (a drink that accidentally drinks milk! Har dee har!) And a silent movie does not help. This is one of the worst feature films I've ever seen, even on a strange video clip. This is actually more cinematic curiosity for those who are interested in the history of cinema - a very bad cinema.
