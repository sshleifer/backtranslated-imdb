Well, I like to be honest with all the viewers I bought for Kirin's sex scenes, but unfortunately I did not see them much. All sex scenes were short and made in a random way along with all the weird and banal background music just like all the other B movies - it's just not like two people who have sex. In the end, it's a little complicated - Kirin's new lover is a killer. Вхоа !!! hov shocking !!! Why do not we nominate this Oscar film? I can not imagine that the movie would look bad if it was ranked with R (Mine was imported from Great Britain, ranked 18). Conclusion? Put it down and go, so it will not end up with a moron like me. Result: 2/10
