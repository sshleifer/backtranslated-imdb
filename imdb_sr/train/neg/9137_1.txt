What to say, this is a piece of brilliant film making that was supposed to win the Oscars. A copy should be kept in a safe sewer for the offspring. This should be mandatory for all high school students around the world. Sam Mraoviƒç is a genius, perhaps the most awarded writer / director / producer / chef / babisitter / valmart greeter who ever fascinates the film world in his art. Every millenecard of Ben and Arthur was so amazing! And Mraovich like Arthur, wow, he's so attractive. I'm surprised he did not go to Mr. Universe. I could not stay in the bare scene. I borrowed this movie to my brother and he called me by phone saying that Arthur's goal scene turned him into a gaius. I fully support, of course, this film and its beautiful lessons of tolerance. Why did I burn the church yesterday and write "for Sam and Arthur" in his ashes. The camera was the best thing in this movie. When this Fed-Ek plane came to the sky in the middle of the Vermont palm, I cried! Why, I never knew that they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel to Fed-Ek airplanes before this film. He opened my eyes in front of a new domain of opportunity. This film inspired me to enroll in the school of Sam Mraovic for screenwriting, acting, directing, composition, casting, production, production and real estate. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich. Thank you for bringing this creation to the world. We can never pay you enough."
