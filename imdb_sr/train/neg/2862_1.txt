Someone has to send this Uli Lommel boy back to the film school. Who ever told him he knows how to make a movie? Could they do movies these days? In the past, he always sought TALENT before somebody could make a movie. After watching this poor BTK film and others he made it, it seems obvious that the poor guy has so much work to do films as I do. Actually, I think I can even make better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the BTK killer, except for the names of the victims and the killer. THAT'S IT. Where did this guy realize that BTK killed people with rodents and all other senseless shit that are in the movie? This is a classic example that someone is trying to get people to watch their movie based on the term "BTK" for the glory it has achieved. Absolutely miserable. The only movie about a serial killer that I would consider VORSE is that chromatic "DAHMER" movie. That kid smoked so many cigarettes that he bothered me. Whoever did it should be hit.
