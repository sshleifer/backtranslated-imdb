I could not, for life, follow, comprehend or understand the story. As the shop progresses, it stays incomprehensible. I'm going to guess and say that there was a problem of pre-production story / plot that never resolved. Producers would never be able to detach many details that the novel, or any novel, has time and space to create from another idea, which is to produce a film about the serial killer and killer the police are conducting. They ended up with too many things that were going on for a limited time. Too bad, because they had a solid role, a director who knows how to move and a great cinema. In fact, a well-made movie where you can enjoy and relax for a few hours.
