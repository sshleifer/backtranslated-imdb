This film is worth five blows to my "hurter card". I saw it while I was stationed in Virginia in the mid-'70s. I saw him myself, so I was not disturbed while I was watching him. It's bullshit. It was the happiest, total loss of celluloid I've ever seen. I know that others who viewed this movie thought it was great. I offer this: if it was so terrible, what was in the box office? The end of the discussion.
