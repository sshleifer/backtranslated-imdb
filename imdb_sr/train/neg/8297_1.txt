Ugh! From where to start ... First, the continuous engagement of Campbell Scott becomes a real turn over time (a very short time) while internalizing his growing pain, curiosity and anger. Only we do not care! These characters presented by the writer and director are totally unacceptable, and there lies the key. They did not give us anything that would lead us to worry about being adulterous and whether they are or are still in love with one another. When Scott quietly tells his wife: "I could kill you" before their three daughters at the table, after the shock of his selfishly poor time vanished, I almost wished he had it - and then he did the same and complacent, wise apparition of Denis Leary before pulling him out of the crazy. Totally wasting time and maybe - just maybe - resources.
