From time to time I am renting an action / adventure movie only as a way to relax and take my mind without anything important. That's why I own a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a quality movie, but it makes me laugh and let me relax for some time. One of these days I'll probably buy copies of Princess Bride and several Monti Pithon films for the same reason. Anyway, I rented this movie because I wanted to have a good time without controversy. Mostly I got what I wanted. The action was somewhat similar to Ksina's badly written episode, and actress Kathi Long was very dramatic (not bad for a professional kick-boxer and an amateur actress). There were several high points by the cyborg. Somehow they managed to bring some pretty good actors to play bad guys - unfortunately, most of them quickly die. Like most martial arts movies, the more you enter the movie, the more accent is there action, and the plot (which was not strong to begin with) is getting worse almost as fast as the acting. However, the more Kathy Long fights, the director dedicates more time to his ass. By the end of the film, I seriously thought about looking at it for the second time, just to figure out how many times Kathi Long's tight red shorts were the central screen. Unfortunately, for this there was not enough meat film that would satisfy the curiosity that the movie should look at for the second time. If you are a hard-core Xenian fan who needs something to turn around for hours - definitely go to the store and spend 50 cents for rent. There are some great similarities between the show and this film. Just do not expect anything more than to be mildly entertained for several hours. Except, of course, You happen to love Katie Long derriere. Then you might want to buy a copy.
