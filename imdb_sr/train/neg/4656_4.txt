An incomparable and unforgettable remake of the old, famous English film. Although it can be overly disgraced as a total disaster (which is not), it never creates any tension and issues its TV sources. Richard Burton goes through his role, and the closed Sophia Loren (in this film) does not show much passion. (**)
