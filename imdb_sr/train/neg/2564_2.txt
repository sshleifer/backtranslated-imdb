When I go to watch movies, I would stay up and watch him, or if I did not like it, I would go to bed, but this was pure shit, I actually got up and walked out! together, I hated it. Also, they should not have taken Brendan Frasier, he was much better. This was not as good as I expected, given that I truly liked George from the jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first one, for example, the bird, and when it ever fell on the tree. I hope that the director will look after this, and the next films he is making should think ... terribly! I really would like Ursli to do a good job because she made a movie worthwhile (until I came out) ... all in all I give this film 2 out of 10
