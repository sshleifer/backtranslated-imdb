This film is the biggest loss of nine dollars I spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you would probably say, it's hard to imagine, but never, that's true! After I looked at the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it! If you are a fan of horror, mystery and uncertainty, why not? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; Unfortunately, the film is none of this. From cinema to script, to acting, this movie is a complete flop. If you are reading this, you are planning to go into a movie awaiting excitement, mystery, action, horror, or anything but losing an hour and forty-five minutes. > <br /> "Why is it so bad", you may be wondering. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor tense. Nothing about the movie is not at all "on the edge", scared or curious. The script was at best funny. Throughout the film, there were many times where the dialogue was so funny that I started writing it as a comic relief just to find out a few seconds later that it was not. The acting was absolutely horrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but this was a mistake. Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below the average. Cinema was horrible with no moment of uncertainty or mysticism. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this film that's about a mile away. I'm usually not a very rough critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see mystery / uncertainty / horror, I just want to be surprised. This film was a boring, bad acting, poorly written and huge disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
