This film is a budget effort to cash in on the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and Funerals. In fact, if they called Sek at the funeral, they might have done better at the box office. But the film falls between the two chairs and can not get up. The characters are an incredibly brilliant dialogue, but they never act in any way remotely recognizable as human. An arbitrary, senseless action follows the other to improve what goes for conspiracy, and one soon dies from the lies of the entire company. stolen by Imelda Staunton, as of all things, a police detective (do not they have the amount of demand there?). It seems that Mrs. Staunton is not in a position to make the wrong move. Could you also tell us the same about the writer-director. If Notting Hill has hurt you as a fake, go away from this. Phonus bolognus on half-shell.
