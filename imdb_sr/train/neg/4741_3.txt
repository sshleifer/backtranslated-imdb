Wendy Vu: Warfare Homecoming has a very good, powerful plot, but it is destroyed by tiny details during the film. I'm a younger teenager and I did not enjoy this movie. I thought the effects were terrible, but they may look more fun for younger children. The matrix movements ruined the action, you know it was absolutely fake. Then there was Jen Lo, an evil spirit who temporarily possessed random people and a return home in which Wendy aspired to win. It ends up as a typical film when Wendi and her Buddhist monk are Shen's brother-in-law Ien Lo (and forever destroy him). So Wendy teaches lessons ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
