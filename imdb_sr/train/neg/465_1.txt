When I was in the cinema the other day, I missed a blonde and a blonde, but something about it seemed like it could be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure that most people smashed Romy and Michelle before they saw it, maybe Blonde and Blonder were just another secret treasure that had passed. But when I started to watch it: Executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was scary for something. And not only that, but also what was regarded as the peak of heat: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they are not at all aging and playing roles that I think were more intended for women should have been in their twenties, and not in their 40s. The story was only bad and disgusting. Dee and Dawn are out of dumb stereotypical blondes, they really have no idea when it comes to what's happening in the world, it's real now. But when the girls somehow change for murder killers, cops are on their story and they are actually called girls geniuses because of their "ignorance is bliss." They are set to make a "hit" on a guy, and they think he will only "show good time," but the real killer is tagged and wants to kill the girls. > <BR> Denise and Pam look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know it was supposed to be a stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it was disgusting and it was simply unnecessary. Would I recommend this? Not for a million years, the girls were just trying to maintain their status of "sex kittens" at the moment, which is more a sign of despair, and blondes and blondes are huge blondes BOMBshell. 10
