Worst movie of David Lean. Even "In vhich ve serve" was not as bad as this. Usually, a movie with a very good reputation like this, has at least some of the features that it reveals, which makes it possible to understand why this could be considered a classic. But after watching this, I could not understand why this shit was so loved in 1945! I did not like acting, stiff British manic, story, script (which is sometimes quite witty, but completely incomprehensible) and soundtrack. The character of the elvira is thought to be attractive and attractive, but in fact it was ugly and he had a strange and boring voice. Just another movie that convinced me not to believe in the reputation of the movies. Another very overrated "British classic".
