I will admit it. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and that it was a mission to see every film she was in (unfortunately it includes terrible movies Batman and Robin, The Avengers) and this one. This is ranked as the worst movie I've ever seen. (Yes, it's even lower than the Avenger). everyone looks lost in themselves and it is incoherent outside of belief. Even if you think that the mind is goddess like me, please do not submit to this film. The next morning you'll be hated for that.
