Different scenes of nudity spoken by other critics are poorly made and apparently double bodies are used. If Ms. Pacula was not willing to do her own scenes, she might have to reject the offer for the role. Otherwise the film was not worse than other typical Canadian movies. As other reviewers have pointed out, Canadian films are generally poorly written and lacking a fun value, which most movie viewers hope will get. Perhaps the Canadian filmmakers were consciously trying to "de-commercialize" their films, but they forgot a very important thing - movies by definition are a commercial thing.
