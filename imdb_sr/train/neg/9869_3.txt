There was no concern for the film, the book was better. Does anyone know where it was shot? *** This was my first visit to your site ... I just found the answer to my question. so now I look like a doll, but I think I will continue to submit my comments. and yes, British Columbia is wonderful *** Or why did they take it from the south coast of South Carolina? (this question stands). Oh, I just read where I need to write at least ten rows. This is my second major problem with the movie. Kim Bassinger was too silly and not at all what I imagined from the book. I know, the book was a book and a movie; It's not good. I thought the character in the book was much more empathetic. The book also evoked rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. While the "castle" in the film was much more visually impressive, it distorted the sense of the story and it looked in contrast to the characters.
