I was not completely impressed with this film. It was originally called Son Eater and it should have stayed that way, since that's all that was about the last half of the movie. I'm not sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had with any other. It was very slow and what was about defending Robocop (Peter Veller) as one of the main actors. It was a sad thing. All in all, I would say to check if you are in the affairs of the Catholic religion, but do not expect the exorcist or Stigmate from this film. It will surely pass through a few days, and the word will come out.
