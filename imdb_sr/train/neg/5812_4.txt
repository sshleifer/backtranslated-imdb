"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who are fighting for their rights since Adam and Eve launched the free-release system." When "Politics" was filmed, the nineteenth amendment, which guarantees women the right to vote, was only ten years old. The film deals with the political power of women as a voting group. Advocating the ban, and closing speakeasies, was the main concern for women at that time. Blessed Marie Dressler (like Hattie Burns) becomes politically active, after a young woman was killed and murdered as she emerged from speakeasi. He wants to close the joints for selling alcohol; and was sent to the mayor's mandate after having held a strong speech at a women's gathering. Ms. Dressler has the support of her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (like Ivey Higgins) and her husband Roscoe Ates (as Peter Higgins). The bouncing of the dresser for the mayor of Lake Siti provokes the opposition of men in the city; So, Dressler orders women to strike, denying them, "everything" in the "lounge, bedroom and bathroom". The film sounds much better than it turned out. Humor, honestly, is not too good; and, there are some infertile and moderately abusive situations ("You look like Madame Kueen" refers to Amos and Andy's character). And, mixing the recording and slapstick does not mix well, this time. Producers may have thought that the film was more dramatic, focusing exclusively on Dressler and the characters played by Villiam Bakevell (like Benni Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Mirtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7) / 25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
