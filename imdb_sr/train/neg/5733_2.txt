I just watched it, me and my better half could not believe it was terrible and bad. If someone else thinks that it is good then you have to be satisfied. In fact, I gave up dinner to watch this, everything has already been done. IE. the hostel comes to my mind, but at least it did not make you suffer from bad acting and lack of stories, the same old things, re-hacked, I read about this movie, I even recommended it to my friends, someone said it was good ! there is no more bite, horror, or comeback than your average "terrifying film" to say, please do not bother with this movie. get mari poppins. now it's scary! I'm leaving now, I'm going to the movies and watching something more horrible than this, maybe a little sunshine
