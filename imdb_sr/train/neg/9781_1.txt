I do not think I'm too far from the base and I say that this is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm on the list of my favorite war films: "The Longest Day", "In Hell and Back", "The Bridge on the River Kvai" (all black and white), all of them having good plots, rich characters of great acting. I saw a better dialogue and acting in a school that was written by one student. The plot, however, is not a bad premise - it's just poorly implemented. It's kind of like a traffic accident, but I could not turn it off! The film does not require big money or big sets, i.e. "Twelve angry people" and "Rescue boat" to be good ... so the budget is no excuse. What did they think?
