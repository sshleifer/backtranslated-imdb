Adrian just left the asylum, rich and without a parent, his life seems empty. One day he meets Gonzalez, a poor boy whose mother is a prostitute. Desperately wanting to get some money, Gonzalo helps Adrian look for his life and who his parents are. This is the film of the new director, and this is quite clear in most films: scenes that are not properly directed, some forced dialogues, some disconnection in the script ... In any case, the end is unexpectedly well done (very little) and this saves a little film . Actors are famous and quality, but insufficiently inspired to make the film interesting; everyone did better work in another movie. The movie is boring and you'll probably spend most of your time thinking about how much time it will take until it's over. Of course, there are many bad films, but, of course, there are many much better ones.
