Discarded by Richard Sarafian, this catastrophe led to Japanese theaters before it came to America and immediately went to the video, where it was not seen again until Turner's networks needed something other than commercials to fill their 3-hour terms and found this tape at the bottom of the bin. The name Smithee should be used when the studio takes the film so much that the director no longer wants his name to be attached. But I am afraid that Sarafian can not completely blame the studio on this. Actors, mostly recently graduated "Overacting 101", deliver one ball after another. The plot is intricate. Special effects are not impressive. Parts that are not funny are just boring. A script or a book must have been good - why Palance, Matheson, Boile, or Heston would agree to appear in this dude? But something went wrong from page to screen. Summaries: Avoid. Not even bad enough to be so bad - that's good.
