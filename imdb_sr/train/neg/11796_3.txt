Nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then look at Phat Beach. However, do not rent it and definitely DO NOT buy. That would be a big mistake. I watched this on TV and I found myself laughing at certain points. I did not laugh long ago and I did not laugh very much. However, there were subtle jokes and comments that I laughed at. If you are looking for an extremely fun movie, take a look at friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that this movie is trying to do ...), watch something like the dreams or the hoops of Jason's Liric. If you are looking for some good black "booty", watch the porn movies of Dominic Simone, because the nudity in this movie is almost nonexistent. However, if you do not have anything better and this is on the cable, go and watch it. You'll be a little entertained. *** 3 of 10 ***
