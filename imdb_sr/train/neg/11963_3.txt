I like Billy Cristal, and I thought it would be fun to watch this movie, because I know that he admired Alan King and that they were funny together. I thought I saw all of Bili's movies, but I could not remember this, and now I know why. So full of clich√©s and false emotions; You can smell every scene that comes (and goes!). Billy does not even become often ridiculous. He is too busy trying to cry with false tears or to show his fear of how his father badly let him go. Alan King himself is pretty cute, as well as a sub-page about being an additional movie. But what a coincidence that Billy only accidentally visits his father as a major health crisis took place, etc. Etc. And when the end comes, boy, is it coming fast? It is almost as if the writers realized that they had painted in a corner and that the only way out was to make a scene of death. Mostly disappointing with a few glows of good humor.
