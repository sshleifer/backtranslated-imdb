To answer the question of one person: "Why does not anyone remember this movie?" this is because indeed, not that many people saw it in 1978 and since then it has not been shown much on television. (If it was on the video that would be news for me!) Even in the era of sometimes nonsense comedies that were in the '70s, filmmakers had the courage to avoid this film. Unless they like Billy Crital, Paula Linde or Joan Rivers "to" much! Paul Linde was more fun at "Bevitched" or "Hollivood Skuares" than here. Joan Rivers, at this moment in her career, laughing at making cruel jokes about the lack of weight of singer Karen Carpenter! Har-har Joan! It also seems that everyone is "a bit" familiar name from the era in the acting team. (Most surprisingly, Doris Roberts later "Everibodi Loves Raimond.") In any case, a somewhat good idea for a story, a man who gets pregnant instead of a woman goes here to lose. With the help of a male friend, Cristal sets himself up with a whore to finally lose his virginity, but because he is "at the top" instead of him, get pregnant! (Comment on women who occupy positions of power from men). Crystal stomach grows, it passes through all the women's emotions and related feelings. Unfortunately, he is now a socially wrong exile! He is being attacked by a mob who wants to erase him (probably). He is forced to go into isolation to have his baby ... in the barn. Or, if you want, a crib (God only knows where it came from! Evvvv!) It turns out (there is no shock here) to be a girl! All the rest of this film is worthless and forgetful, humor is high or low. 2 stars for a good idea and a few good touches and relevant moments of Billi Cristal. Ignore the rest of Rabit's test, throws a great deal of time! I can not believe that Roddy McDowell has signed up! (THE END)
