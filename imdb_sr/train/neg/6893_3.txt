I had great hopes for this film. The theater monologue is excellent and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man, with lots of experience and knowledge about films. I am a fan of many Belgian films, but this film is bad. It's incredible that actors who are 34 years old suddenly play the role of a teenager. The "linguistic games" were disgusting at the top. Nothing about the movie seemed to me real. The end was too much of a macho machine. I am very disappointed and I think I lost my watch and my life.
