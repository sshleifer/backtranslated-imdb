Despite their defects, I enjoyed "Cigarette Burns," an episode of John Carpenter in a season in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story looked like a cheap cross between UMU PEOPLE and 8MM, but it was still pretty good for the budget and the time constraints it was given to him. With Pro-Life, however, the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. Carpenter always has a strong direction, but there is a quality in writing and the whole production that gives the feeling that it was made in complete and complete haste. The scenario is not always clear, the message is unclear, and the story is full of holes in the land when you look at them. Perhaps Carpenter had re-written the script, this could have been a valuable episode. Instead, it's a mess that only the hardcore fans of Carpenter will find in the least pleasure. Definitely the worst Carpenter ever did. 2/10
