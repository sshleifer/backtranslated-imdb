This film reminds me of "Irreversible (2002)", the second film with artistic work is a violent and radical approach to human nature. I did not like the movie, but I can not say it's a bad movie. I also recall the "Camping Cosmos (1996)" where a bunch of low-class figures resident in the camp at the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, shoulder to shoulder against their will and with all conflicts of characters that disagree together. I also thought about the books of the French writer Emil Zola, who was a writer of style that is naturalism. I did not like the movie and I do not like people in it. Everyone looks so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One might wonder why they live, it seems that everyone on this planet is a great farce, forced to live against their will. Or you can say: hell is in this world.
