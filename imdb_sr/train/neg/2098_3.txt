I was hoping for some deep background information about the Apollo 11 mission and I got some decent material for an interview with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people who were involved in the mission associated with an overrepresented sensational voice that predicted catastrophes in the worst tradition of TV production. If you could turn off your voice and change the turn of the program to a positive testament that people can overcome a standstill in achieving the goal normally, then this could have been great - but I feel I lost about 45 minutes of my life while I watched a program of 60 minutes. I want you a minute back.
