Mann photographed Alberto Rocka Mountains in an extraordinary way, and Jimmy Stevart and Walter Brennan provide pleasant performances as it always seems. But come to Hollivood - Mountie that tells people from Davson Citia, Yukon to choose marshals themselves (to marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, and then fight it on the streets of control of the city? Nothing similar to what happened on the Canadian side of the border during the golden fever of Klondike. It appears that Mr. Mann and the company mistaken Davson Citi for Deadwood, a Canadian North for the wild West. Canadian viewers are preparing for a type of fun with a reefer madness with this ridiculous complication, or to shake my head.
