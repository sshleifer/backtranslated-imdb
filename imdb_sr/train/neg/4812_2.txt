I realized that any horror film with Orson Welles would be strange in him. It must have been somber, but it was a little too strange for its own good. The film really has a creepy feeling like dealing with the holy satanist / witch in a small town and trying to get a young woman to escape. It seems that the director deliberately tries to confuse the audience using flashback and dream sequences. To the end, there are too many questions without answers. Worse, since the story is so confusing, it's pretty hard to get any character. It seems strange that Velles would agree with the title of this film, especially because there is not much work to do. Perhaps one day they will extinguish the recording tape and the bloopers from this film. It would be really fun!
