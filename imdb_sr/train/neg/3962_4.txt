I really enjoyed seeing Nana after I saw Renoir's incredible debut work, Vhirlpool of Fate. I read that Nana was generally regarded as his best silent film, so I was hoping. Unfortunately, this seemed like a big step backwards. Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this movie. Her acting is at the top, even for a silent film. Her acting is more like what could be expected in a film than in the early teens, and not in the late twenties. Usually he has the same face, which reminds me (sorry to say) of someone with pain in jail. It was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall in love with this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about her at all. The film was also quite long, the work on the camera was uninteresting (except for a horse race) and the installation was boring. The story reminded me of Pabst's Pandora's box. It is interesting to compare these two, because between these films there are only 3 years. Pandora's box simply gets results at all levels where Nana fails. This film is intended only for Renoir wholesalers or very serious lovers of silent films.
