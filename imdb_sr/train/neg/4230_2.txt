Okay, I love B movies ... I know what B movies should represent. But this is terrible. I am delighted to have got such a decent overall result. The only redemption quality of this film is (mostly) marginal spraying effects. Do not misunderstand me, it's abundant in this movie up there - but a few effects really popped on me (like an anal "probe" ... that was great!). on your camcorder. Come on - rent at least Betacam, I've seen pornography with better production values ​​(and behaving better). But not in Troma or Full Moon. The story - fictitious! But that's what you get from such films. Very loose! Sets and props - sucked! My 16-year-old brother makes more complex sets for our house on Halloween. Dubbing and Dialogue - Shit! A terrible voice (I should not even call it an act) and every other word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". / splatter flicks out and they are not that hard to follow. Do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this shit!
