This is the last time I rent a video without checking in IMDB reviews. Limey was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote a really terrible Nightvatch with Evan Macgregor and directed such trash as Out of Sight with anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a good actor and it's a shame to get involved in such a bad movie. It's often confusing editing that looks like a last-minute decision to compensate for lack or story, recording and just common sense. This movie makes everything wrong. What did they think?
