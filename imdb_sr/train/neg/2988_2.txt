First I really enjoy Zombie 2 by Lucio Fulci. This film was totally trash. I could not stand looking at him. The story was a joke, the act was a joke, and the fact that Zombie 3 has nothing to do with Zombie 2 is even more a joke. People BACK TO LIFE. Whatever, this film is not worth $ 1.00 cost to rent it. I really enjoyed the movies lucio fulci, but this was horrible. If Zombie 3 is an indicator of how Zombies 4 and 5 will be, I think I will just skip them. Zombie 2 is a terrific flick tho.
