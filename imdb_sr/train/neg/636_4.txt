Several farmers struggle in life in a small village in China. Vang Lung (Paul Muni) is buying O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). Starring American stars, speaking with fake accents and highlighting old stereotypes and patriarchal ideologies. A good woman, many children and the country are best for men. They are considered as assets and investments. Since it's a big budget movie, in which many collaborators work together, big sets are being built and special effects take place, filmmakers can not risk hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won the Oscars for this show, which is definitely the worst in the movie. Her unchanging face creates a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan should be the heart of the family and the best person to be sympathetic. On the other hand, Paul Muni gives a better performance, again showing his talents. Another problem with the film is the end. It seems Franklin did not know when to finish the picture. This film could be dangerous if it is taken as a true example of Chinese culture and tradition.
