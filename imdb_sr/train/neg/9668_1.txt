1940. - A visit to the Lodz ghetto in Nazi occupied Poland, shot by a German filmmaker with the naive collaboration of the Jewish community, is combined with archival footage, clip art from international film news and clips from related cultural films The Jews of the World as cheaters and parasites. This 'documentary' interprets Jewish life from the standpoint of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. Honest, film-unique expression of racial hatred. Personally, I consider this film to be terrifying and very offensive. One can only hope that such images, like this, will never again come to the screen.
