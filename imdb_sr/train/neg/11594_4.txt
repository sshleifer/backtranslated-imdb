Like Freddie's Revenge, this sequel assumes a rather strange idea and does not enter the great powers to draw the story out of it. In essence, Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her child has persecuted Freddy, who gives him a refuge to persecute his friends. This has the least fatalities in the entire series, and wise cracks are pretty bad, so neither fans of horror nor comedy fans are happy. I do not have much to say about it. It is somewhat interesting to see the characters Alice and Dan returning from four, but it's not worth watching a movie. Uninspring and unenjoiable, perhaps only a competitive direction saves it from the worst in the series.
