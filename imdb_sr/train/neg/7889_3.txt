I just finished watching this movie. It was not funny bad, but I'm really disappointed with him. I'm not sure why someone would make such a movie. It was a bit fun, but I feel like the people who created it had a lot of disagreements about what they did. Monday, the writer was the chief; Tuesday, Director; Wednesday, the guy who gets coffee; It seems like they really wanted to make several different films, but they only had time and money to make one. Someone else commented that the performance is really good, but I would disagree. Then again, if the actors managed to maintain the right face during the shooting, they might be better actors than I give them recognition. The last part of the DVD leaves the impression that the movie will be a mystery ... something modeled on historical law and order or national treasure. It starts so, but then, nowhere is it necessary to turn to the bad episode of the Twilight Zone, or ... what was that second show that was not so good ... The bad episode of The Outer Limits \ t. My main objection to the film is that is just so played. There's a bad guy with white hair. There is a love interest, which, when it first appears, the wind really blows through the hair. Seriously. When you realize it's a Christian movie, it's pretty easy to spot the end. Cinema was badly made, especially in the introductory scenes - a way to move your best foot forward. It was not horrible for most of the film, but there were occasional funny bad old woman pictures, praying, hands in a dark room while the lightning striking - things that just make you a little embarrassing watch the movie.
