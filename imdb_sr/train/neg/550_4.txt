After the great AANKHEN (2002), which was a remake of Gujarati, the game comes with a VAKT that also looks like a theater show. /> The first half shows Amitabha almost joking Akshai Kumar 40+ who behaves too funny as a little nerter. The movie has a good message not to spoil your son, but unfortunately in the way Even his reason for hiding the illness, hospitalization and melodramatic speech Akija is postponed Some emotions Do not touch you, but most are too high. Rajpal's comedy is hilarious but too stretched in the second half. The Vipula Shah's director is overly impressive, although some scenes are good. Okay Amitabh exaggerates among the actors in the first half, but is great in emotional scenes. Akshai Kumar is also doing his part well, but seems to know very well in some too. His chemistry with Bachchan is unattractive. Rajpal is the peak, he smiles without exaggeration, and only his presence and his stupid behavior and meaningless humor are rebellious so he has nothing to do , this is her latest film with Akki so far Shefali is awesome, although she looks too young for Bachchan
