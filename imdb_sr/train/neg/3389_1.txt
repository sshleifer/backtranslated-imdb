I saw the original "Horus Line" on the Broadway God knows how many times and felt the passion, desperation and joy of this live experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew that he would have to think of "Chorus" for the screen, but he could never understand how to do it. If the person who came up with the show is confused - that should answer your question. There are some performances that are simply made to watch live - with the audience. However, Richard Attenborough, fresh from the musical part "Ghandi" and dancing with animals in "Doctor Doolittle", ended up directing this film that had little or no resemblance to the scene. You have added horrible songs (Surprise! Surprise!), Great songs are dropped or assigned to other characters (which made no sense). Michael Douglas was wrongly thrown. People who could not dance tried to act and there was a sexy "Landers" woman who could not sing, act or play - I suppose she just ended up being Gandhi's wife. Dances of Jeffrey Hornadai look like nothing more than a Flashdance shuffle refuses and nothing works. I sat in astonishment that something so attractive and emotionally could squeeze to nothing. If you really love this show and returns to Broadway in 2006 - look at it, but do not think that the long-time musical event that was "A Chorus Line" has anything to do with this movie.
