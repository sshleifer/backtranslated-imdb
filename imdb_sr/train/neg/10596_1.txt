Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. HERE IT IS. Now we know that this movie will be really terrible. For the first five minutes of this film I saw on TBS, knowing that it would be bad. But even I did not think this would be bad. The action is terrible, Van Damme is old (finally), but unlike Arnold, and his films are. Forget this movie. I do not see him. Ever. I would not even be paid to see this movie. 1/5 star - in his heart lies wonderful, full of excitement actions. , but traders would certainly like to think so, right? John Ulmer
