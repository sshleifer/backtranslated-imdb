Recreation from the 1950s (London) Soho and people coming. Based on a cult novel. Julian Temple is a video director. No more no less. Give him $ 15 million and make you a $ 15 million pop video. Here it is forgotten that two minutes are with people who really can not do one thing - but two hours? What he meant. Except who is the audience? Who cares about a book that was well remembered when she came back. The usual story from London that a cancer has used its chance. What could really pull this movie? I know, the third songs that sound like they were invented on the spot. David Bovie listens to the title of the film several times and this is the highlight. Soundtrack album is a material for clay pigeons. However, there is one good thing. Good recreation of the Soho period. Too bad they could not come up with anything they put in front of him.
