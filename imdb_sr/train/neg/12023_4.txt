Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia, who has been in mental imprisonment for more than a decade after finding him wondering how the blood circles on his hands lie. Doctors want to test a new experimental drug that will restore lost memories if it works. But when the drugs gave him the hallucinations of the demon, he would choose to escape. As she gets acquainted with the young boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) harasses his mother, she will not play close to the dungeon in his cellar and is generally acting suspicious. The film is a bit easy to identify, before it's discovered, I discovered that Mr. Diamond seems to be delighting enough to keep my attention. (In the interest of full disclosure, I was a great admirer of his Murder Department and his short, but extremely crucial role in the Shield through Journeiman & Dollhouse). It's not a big movie or a good, but sufficient service. Although I liked better than the previous films I saw from Michael Hurst, director / writer (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Manskuito) Eie Candi: a short-lived pair of hallucinations in the hallucination <br /> <br / > My Rating: C-
