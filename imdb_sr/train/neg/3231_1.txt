It seems that this movie has many people who say it's one of the most brutal times. After reviewing it, I can say that it does not meet these claims. The idea of ​​a movie is really demented. But in general, execution was not decent at all. Even the final scene (the thing about the eyeball) is not that bad. I was expecting something crazy, instead of having a worse quality than the ones described above on movies such as the ultra low budget Violent Sh! Т. There is no story (although most people certainly know it). The higher fans will be disappointed because, contrary to belief, blood and courage here are few. Not to mention the actress who plays the victim may be one of the worst in history. No matter what people say, this movie is not so shocking, it's all clear just bullshit. Avoid this.
