This movie was bad. This film was terrible. The acting was bad. The item was unrealistic. The story was absurd: a comet that appears once in eons will appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning, everyone except for the chosen people turned into dust from the radiation of the comet. Human clothes are still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but humans are turned into dust. No bones, nothing. That's funny. How can radiation burn people, but leave clothes and other biological substances untouched? Even better, the comet has mutated some people into eating zombies. Their makeup would not even look daunting for the newborn. Insane Clown Posse scares me more ... and they should look stupid. Then they survived. People who were surrounded by steel when the comet passed through were spared zombies-home and death. How can steel block the radiation of a comet that supposedly burns people on their paths? Equally offensive is the horror music of the sixties playing in the background through parts of the film, or the 80's stone that does not serve the purpose. movie and makes you want to record your TV. The stupidest part of the film, however, are characters that are directed at: two Dolly and Chuck's girls from Star Trek: Voiager. These three characters were completely unrealistic. Who would plunder the day after the apocalypse with fleshy mutants that ran everywhere? There were four 5-minute horror scenes throughout the film, and most of them were dreams. Between these scenes there is an unsophisticated dialogue that makes the South Park seem intelligent. The silence between the elementary dialogue was painful. I could make a better movie with four monkeys and Cheetos. I never watch this movie.
