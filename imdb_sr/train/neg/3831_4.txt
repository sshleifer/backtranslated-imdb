I will have to disagree with previous comments and with Maltin. This is the second degree, the overly evil Western man who squeals and sighs trying to put his central topic of the Wild West into homelessness and throwing aside from the constant time. He would love to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid," but he lacks the sharpness and charm of that movie. The direction of Andrew McLaglen is lame, and the last 30 minutes are a real fight, with some incomprehensible strategy by heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Somebody tells me if you can explain why they burned that hill.) There was something suspicious about the entire treatment of the rape scene, and the reaction of the woman after that was certainly not true. Coburn is pretty nasty because half of the breed escaped from convicts for revenge, but all of his colleagues fled the underdeveloped (they are like bowling that should collapse one at a time while the story leaps forward). Michael Parks gives one of his typically fictitious, lethargic, mummified performances, but in this case it was convenient because his modern-style stylist symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring.
