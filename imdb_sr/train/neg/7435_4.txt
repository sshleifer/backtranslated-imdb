This film (together with Rinne) is a small jewel among the retarded homage pictures that so far have gone on for horror films at 8FTDF "HorrorFest". And, yes, it's a really bad commendation. Because there are not much worse things in the movie than authors who think that the atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot. And that's all you get with Abandoned. This is a movie that was shot almost in the head of the director. Of course, it would be nice to transfer it to a movie, but it happened instead. It is a very nice film with several authentic fears, but the last roller is strictly for latte pushing the crowded crowd.
