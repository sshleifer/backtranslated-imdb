This movie was so bad! It was scary! It was awful! I can not stress that enough! The acting, directing, story, characters and everything was bad! It was so dashing and clich√©. Do not wrap your lid, or the dash of the "Texas Massacre" is nothing to laugh. "You're kidding me! It was funny. The first two minutes of the movie are good until it reaches the main character of Brendan, OK, it's shutting down now. What I got from the movie was: A bunch of ugly, boring and immature people go to a hut in the middle of the woods, and the clown singing the crib is killing them in non-original and false ways. This film was a waste of my time and money, and that would be a waste of your money and time! I am progressing rapidly through most of the film because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and it was still not worth it! Just watching in k Orice is a waste of time. This is the seriously worst movie EVER! Rating: does not deserve.
