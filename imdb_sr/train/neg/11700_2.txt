I really enjoyed watching this movie, but after I watched it, I was really disappointed. It was best when Stephen King was in it. Robert Berk can not save his life, like any other. A few performances even made me laugh out loud! The film was not what I imagined, after reading a book that was great, I imagined it was darker and much more terrible. If I was Steven, I'd really be crazy! I do not know why they changed the end, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you just found out that a pizza killed your daughter, you would not feed her to anyone else? The book was much better!
