I read reviews before I watched this movie, and I did not believe them. I love shit movies and I expected this to be average. It was not. This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 as big. The film contains bad acting, bad sound, bad puzzling story, bad makeup - and it made me so bored that I turned it off. Even nakedness was trash! Did they even have a budget for this movie? I do not think they are. You can say whether you like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. If you want a good siren movie, watch a toxic viper 4 or even the blood in the camp. Avoid this garbage - I watched it on TV and felt stiffly, so do not waste anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
