Really, everyone in this movie seems like they want to be somewhere else! No wonder that casting is not done with your left hand, but not at all. I did not see anything worse than Natascha McElhone who acted with an agent, carrying a gun. Do not use the spoiled city-brother-look in such a role. The only worse thing I can imagine is that Doris Dai throws himself like a prostitute. The rest of the actors is also terrible, perhaps with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you can see him trying, but he suffers. Oh, did I mention it's a totally crazy story? To jeopardize the lives of many people because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Veller) is German? 2/10, because the photo can be worse.
