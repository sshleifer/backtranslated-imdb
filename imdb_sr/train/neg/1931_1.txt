I went to see this with a lot of expectations. Quite unfortunately, the dialogue is completely dumb and everything in the whole movie is far from inspiring awe or interest. Even a child can see the lack of logic in character behavior. Today's children need creative stories that inspire them, which would make them "dreaming" of events. That's exactly what happened with films like E.T. and Star Vars ten years ago. (How many children imagined becoming Jedi knights and igniting their light swords?) You do not waste time and money on this.
