This film is NOT Hilarious - such a loss of great stars, who seem to be so caught up in their star they forget. Just glistening moments belong to John Cleese as a hotel manager who loves to dress - almost drop off a chair with helpless laughter when she dances to "Bad Girls" Donne Summer while wearing high heels, a mink coat and a gentle hat. Other: ABOVE!
