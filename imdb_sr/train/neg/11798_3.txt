I watched Phat Beach on the cable for some time and somehow I enjoyed it. Fat is the best character, as if he was a good guy. The other characters are only various stereotypes of young men and young blacks. I like to watch low-budget films that span a certain amount of time because they are almost like a documentary about annual attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because low-budget babies in this movie are strictly domestic girls. Most low-budget movies have the quality of a "local baby," and the babies in this movie can say that local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneis. Some of them had so much cellulite that hung from bikinis, which was ridiculous to see that "young" were ravaging because of what was basically some really over-exploited, hidden from a great distance. There were some sweets. It's the charm of these low-budget films. You'll see a lot of dogs, and some real cuties! I checked some of them on IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. A pity. It would be interesting if somebody ever made the book Where They Are now on all the cuties that appeared in the history of the film, and then they never returned. What happened?? There are likely to be one or two young men in almost every movie that seems to have much to do with them, and years later when you look at a movie on TV, you wonder "what happened to KS?" In any case, this film mostly blows, but it has some funny moments.
