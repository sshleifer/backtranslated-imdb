Steven Seagal ... how could you be part of such a horrible movie? I rented this movie because your movies were usually pretty clean. I've lost a lot of respect for being in a horrible movie like this one. Very, very bad taste! I'm ashamed that I even rented this movie. Steven, if you continue to act in films like this one, I believe that your career is over. My husband and I enjoyed watching many of your movies because you can always "get a bad guy" with a few maneuvers and make it clean ... and the language is pretty clean in your movies ... but this is something else. I'll think twice before I rent another movie.
