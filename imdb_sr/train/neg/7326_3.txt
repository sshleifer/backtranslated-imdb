This movie has an interesting plot, but the performance is pretty bad and the scenario is bad. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma that the main character faces is intriguing, but due to poor writing and throwing, this potentially profitable premise has been looted. 2 out of 4 people went to the theater after 45 minutes, while the other 2 laughed at how bad the film was. I put it to the end, but I must admit that I played Blackjack on my mobile phone for the last 30 minutes to be tolerable.
