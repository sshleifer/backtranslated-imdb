- The film crew shoots a horror movie in an old, supposedly cursed home where seven people died mysteriously over the years. One of the crew members finds an old spellbook and seems to be perfect for use in some ritual scenes in their movie. It is believed that the spells in the book are better written than the scripts they use. But as the book is being read, the cemetery suddenly revives. Now actors and team face real danger. - IMDb says a 90-minute duration. Nothing happens for the first 60 minutes. Too much time is spent on film in the movie. Should we be scared of the horror film that shoots? We already know that their film is not "real". These fears just do not work. - There are very few things to enjoy in the House of Seven Lies. The acting is terrible. Most of these "actors" would have trouble setting up a primary school. The result is terrible. It is very reminiscent of a television series of the 70's and does not provide an atmosphere. Speaking of the atmosphere, except for a few moments at the end of the film, there is no one to talk. The character's character is almost non-existent. Even in the movie you expect characters to behave in a certain way. Here I do not think that I recall one scene in which the character did not choose the most algy road that was available to them. And finally, there's the first 60 minutes of the movie I've already mentioned. Can you tell BORING? - I did not evaluate the House of Seven Lies below for cases where the film (probably by chance) really works. My two favorites are the beginning and the end. The starting order of the title represents the death of the seven previous owners and can be the peak of the film. And, the ultimate scene on a massive staircase as a zombie encountered by the film crew is somewhat effective (what a bell-approval). All in all, these moments are not enough to make this a good movie.
