It is obvious that Hollivood only shares money with everyone who has the camera and the ability to speak. This film was soothingly bad. Casting was terrible, the acting was inexpressible, and the story was filled with holes. The script? Who needs a script? I was surprised that the film was not as vulgar as I thought it would be, but I got enough T & A pictures that lasted a lifetime. The film was like listening to a 19-year street runner with an ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) to tell the story. Since he wrote so badly, I thought that the brothers in the movie were initially lovers. The scenes at the rink, along with the main female actor in the film, kept me thinking about Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the film Grindhouse modeled after ... only the writers thought they were serious.
