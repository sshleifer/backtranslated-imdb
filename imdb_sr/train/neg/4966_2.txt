I realized that this film was made at a very low budget, but that's not an excuse for the monster Grendel. The Deathstalker, Throne of Fire, Barbarian Kueen, Conquest, Invincible Barbarian all worked on modest budgets and bad special effects, but they managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily dressed warriors and a good sense of humor. Primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscapes enabled Grendell to be a very good low-budget sword and magic movie, but the creators completely destroyed this opportunity using extremely bad CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this film with Beovulf (1999). Maybe it's not Citizen Kane, but it's a good example that a fun sci-fi / adventure movie with a low budget can be made using credible special effects and appealing characters.
