Horrible film. About the old baptism of a painter who hangs out with a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil goes through the movements in her part, and has some of the brightest lines in the history of the film. Richard Burton looks close to death in this movie, and we need to believe that it looks "good for sixty." The acting is bad, as is the plot. The characters are terrible, as is the story. It's really hard to feel anybody in this movie, except Larry Evashen, who plays a guy in a porno theater that hits Tatum, he's kind of funny. This movie is a real waste of time. If you are a fan of Tatum, like me - why I rent it - do not watch this movie. It's really bad at it, and you'll wonder if PAPER MOON was lucky. It is not known, due to bad news and small releases, that it can behave well, but do not rent this movie. And if you are a Burton fan, rent something when it looked good, not fossil.
