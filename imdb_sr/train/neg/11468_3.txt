I do not know who got the idea that the orcs go around and kill people and beat and destroy things for vengeance, but my god is absurd. Orcs are definitely not cold-blooded killers, this movie makes them ... his nonsense. Orcs are extremely intelligent, do not misunderstand me, but I very much doubt that they know and understand a concept like revenge. So, I must say that everything I got out of the movie was a party as it was meaningless. So at least I entertained him a bit. I would personally recommend that you go and see Javas if you want to see a film about animals that kill people. But if you are like me and want to smile at something far from realism, then I would say to continue. : D
