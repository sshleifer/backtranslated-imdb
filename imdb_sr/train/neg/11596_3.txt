The "Dream Child" from 1989 is the fifth film in the (generally overestimated) "Nightmare" series, and at the latest from this moment the series becomes totally trash. The only good films in the series were the original Ves Craven from 1984, and the third part of "The Dream Varriors" from 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and that was the fourth part in which once a frightening craze Freddie Krueger began to bother with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry in the series hardly has anything to recommend except for (though great) images and an ugly scene, the flashback sequence as Freddy Krueger emerged. The rest of the film consists mainly of our brilliant maniac who turned to stupid jokes, and the old formula of a bunch of teenage asses, who desperately try not to fall asleep because the good old Freddy is waiting for them in their dreams. Lisa Vilcock returned to the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of unintelligible shit, as the super-stupid "creepy" baby song was added for nothing else but having some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel. ... In Brief: There is no originality, only the fall of the old formula, and the overload of painfully boring jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to great visual effects, and in particular emphasizing the difference in the horrible next sequel, "Freddi's Dead," which is terribly incredible. In case you are not a hardcore Freddie Krueger enthusiast, "Dream Child" should be avoided, and even if it is, this is more than likely to disappoint you.
