really horrible ... the main actor is OK ... a movie, a plot, etc. he was totally crap and inaccurate, maybe it was a sequel well ... everything that was little or not relevant to Carlitos Vai ... and should be avoided as a plague by any Carlit fan ... without mentioning Gail in fact he ends up with another bird, without the mention of Klienfelt, no matter how caught him, nor the importance of how he ended up in jail. .. they tried to do it as a flashback original at the beginning ... but to be honest when I was evaluating it, I asked for a zero mark ... unfortunately, I had to evaluate it more ... <br /> <br /> It's a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best movies of the 90's ... totaling about 6 pounds and 2 hours of my life in vain spending ... for all the "actions" in it, it's it was really boring, slow and predictable ... again for fans of Carltio's way to avoid this fiasco ...
