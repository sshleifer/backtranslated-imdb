This movie is a joke. I mean "ha ha" funny joke. Why? Because the only thing in redemption was a good laugh that I received in a pure, meaningless, meaningless, senseless plot, and horrible acting. Wow! In this film there are so many unanswered questions ... for example; Why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are "guards" zombies and what is their purpose? Since when do 6 people make a "nation" Zombie? And the blush black mascara for eyes "scary" for everyone, anywhere? Even 2 years? And finally; Why is this film recorded at all? Why? why? why? No replies? That's what I thought. On the demand channel, they published this comment after the movie synopsis: in advance we apologize for this movie "LOL. At least they had the power to do so much!"
