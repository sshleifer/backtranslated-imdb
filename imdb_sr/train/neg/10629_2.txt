The only reason I did not achieve this is that Sibrel shows that he is skilled in the technical aspects of filming the film. It's a technically appropriate movie. Once said, this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easy to disagree with. Most documentary films are spent on propaganda techniques to revive the space program, not the actual fact. And Sibrell's "irrefutable evidence" that the landings are easily false, if you know anything about orbital mechanics. Do not let Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity.
