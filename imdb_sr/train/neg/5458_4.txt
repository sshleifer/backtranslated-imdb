This film is a pathetic attempt, apparently to justify the actions of Mari Ann Letourneau. To do this, they cast 19-year-olds - probably not "to do it". There were no ways to throw them like a boy for 12 or 13 years, because love scenes would give birth to everything (if they were even allowed to work them) - as it should be. Marie Ann's boyfriend was my nephew's year, making her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of a pedophile does not have to include many children - all you need is one. I really do not care about her upbringing or unhappy marriage. She had a responsibility to her students who did not fulfill her. The reason is that she is bipolar, she refused the diagnosis and refused to take medication. It is understandable, therefore, that she did not think rationally. One is hoping to understand her actions now. Now that she and Will are married and have two children together, I pray that she be on her medication and think clearly. All this, Penelope Ann Miller was completely convincing and perfect for the role.
