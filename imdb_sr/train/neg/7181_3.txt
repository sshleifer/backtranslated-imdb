Now do not misunderstand me, I enjoy Christmas movies. I love my beautiful life and I really enjoy the versions of the Christmas song with georgia c. scott and alistair sim. but this film is horrible. I think that I love the life song, the spirit of the Christmas presentation sings is especially painful. Albert Finnei is quite good at Annie. I do not know what is with him in this movie, but it sounds like someone is trying to sing through a bunch of dead gerbils. the only thing that saved this film for us was to turn off the sound and watch dance numbers accompanied by the southern park for Christmas.
