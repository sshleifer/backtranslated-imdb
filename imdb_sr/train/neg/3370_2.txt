Just a stupid old movie. First, Stanvick's son gets a trapped leg in a really stupid way, and then her husband grabs her foot trapped in another stupid manner. In an attempt to save him, Stanvick does not get luck again, and he encounters a refugee. She has a chance to kill him, but she does not succeed in a very stupid way. In the end, her husband is saved, and Stanvick tells us through the narration how stupid the film is. Everything is good than ending stupidly. I could never understand how an unattractive woman like Stanwick ever succeeded as a leading lady in the Hollywood glamorous Golden Era; that the nose is so beautiful? So photogenic ?? The film is mercifully short, it takes just over an hour. As if the director felt he was making shit, so he thought it was best to keep the shit brief.
