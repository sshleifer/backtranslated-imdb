Baldwin really came down to make such films. Scenario, music, everything in this movie is a waste of time. The sound of FKS does not sound realistic, it's too much to distinguish (technical gadgets, etc.). If you try to make a movie about these things, at least try to get it and discard additional tones and sounds because these gadgets do not make you so loud sounds. Natural sounds such as steps and such are nonexistent, giving it an atmosphere of empty space. Directing seems to be fine for such a low budget movie (I hope it was a low budget production) Although it sometimes seems pretty amateur. Most of the characters look blank and fake, they just did not show this movie very well. I suppose it would be better if Baldwin speaks Spanish than that Spanish actors speak English, when we all know that it is a language that is more lively and lively, which makes the performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used. I mean, would anyone finally understand how stupid it sounds for international actors to speak English with a bad accent? It was necessary to bury a corpse in film production for a long time. The production team has ever heard of the subtitles? This movie again manages to portray the European police as lazy and corrupt, and society as vulnerable and helpless. I mean, if the action again goes like "Interpol can not do a jack, so let's invite an American to crash this international trade union" or whatever. he only produces movies for hell. I imagine them having some self-esteem. Should customers buy every dirty title just because Sony issues something good a few times a year ?! Maybe they should have used the same team as those who did Di Kue Si - I say. He speaks Spanish, and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job by keeping the film on the surface. It looks and sounds much better! Come to Sonia, wake up, produce less, sell more.
