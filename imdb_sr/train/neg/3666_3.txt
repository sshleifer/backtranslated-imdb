This is a very confusing movie. The film is very difficult to follow, and the plot just made no sense. Furi of Volfman was made in Spain and I think that when any movie is called from one language to another, it does not translate exactly the way it originally meant it. Perhaps this is part of the problem, but I doubt that it can explain all the problems with this movie. Recording is pretty bad and voices do not match well with the characters. Scenes are interrupted, there are a number of weird and irrelevant characters that not only confuse the viewer even more. What I liked in this movie was the look of the wolf itself and the scene it was attacking. Now that they could put it all together and make sense, they might have had something. Do not waste your time on this.
