This film is sucked. It was really a waste of my life. The acting was terrible, the action was incredible. A long, short story, these people are "terrorized" by these pathetic "crazy killers", but they are totally incapable of opposing in any way. And that's when they went camping, without equipment, and appeared in a camp that was already assembled and fully stocked with food, clothing and headphones. Besides, after their boat disappears, they panic that they are stuck in the woods, but then the boy's daughter just appeared and they obviously never think they could just walk out of the woods as he did to get to them. As I said, this movie is bullshit. A complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend tell you to watch her.
