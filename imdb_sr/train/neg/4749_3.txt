This film was so badly written and directed that I fell asleep 30 minutes through the film. The jokes in the film are trembling and although the action is interesting at some angles, it is overly unpleasant and, at some point, ridiculous. If you have 11 or more years, you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger, this is a movie that will attract your attention and be stunned by all the stunt (which I can add to be badly made) and I want you to be some warrior. Casting in this movie was not very good, and music was very disappointing because it was like trying to tension, but it did not fit at all. On the scale of 1-10 (10 is great, 1 is terrible) the acting in this movie is 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of film, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was laughable. When she made some of her "combat" poses, I began to laugh out loud. I think the worst thing in this movie is definitely directed, for example, in the part where her enemy turns out to be the person who the evil villain has, how her voice becomes dark and evil, I think it was incredibly stupid, and how Teachers Wendy ( Brenda Song) were all her teachers at school and they were owned by the monks, which was pretty funny. So, to sum up everything, a disappointing movie, but okay if you have 10 or less years.
