I enjoy a quality thief, and this is up with some of the best ones. The cg is out of this world, or at least before the date of our world, and the madness of the six feet of a guy in clothes rats in search of people is ridiculously bad. I really enjoyed this, but the acting is so damn horrible, and even the mandatory scores of the scene do not have any bump. Just a complete loss of time if I've ever seen it. I do not know who lost more time, I watched it, or poor juices that got into what they hope will start their career. I assure you, it will not. However, on the brighter note, I managed to successfully execute Kevin Bacon's 6 degrees from this film, so I think it was almost worth watching 91 minutes.
