Wow, what a loss of acting talent. My husband and I sat there, thinking both, this has to be better, and the actresses are too good to lose time on this shit. The unattractive characters, the hacked scenario and the pessimistic pacing are two hours. Actually, I could not hack it and let me do the grocery shopping (the cat's cat is more attractive than this movie). The husband remained and confirmed that it was no better - when Buddi was killed, you wanted everyone to be hit by a car and end their poor lives. It would be infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful landscapes and costumes can not keep this alive.
