This film serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks he can write and direct his film. Face it, you can not. Because there is so nobody tells you when you hack the big holes in your plot, you have meaningless transitions, a banal, unforgettable dialogue, and you succeed in turning a pretty cool Korean legend into a bunch of celluloid piles. I wanted to like this movie as a popcorn movie, I really am; I love a lot of shitty movies. But once I was forced to wonder what the hell happened and WHY, DRAGY OF THE LORD, WHY? More than a few times, I really can not stand it anymore. I would also like someone to explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene.
