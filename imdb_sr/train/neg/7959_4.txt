Andi Lau plays in another police secret story. Daniel Vu plays Nick who works for cops and is also near the top of the drug gang (Lau). The film starts as we look at how the police are trying to make a drug failure just to see it decay. Then we meet with the mother of the dependent mother and her daughter who lives near Nick and his friends and cops, and for 45 minutes I closed the film and published the news. He behaved well and wonderfully looked at it as a non-inclusion of the film, as I have seen for a long time. It's not bad because it's just that you're not really interested. I mean, I did not care at all. Actually, I started to do something completely completely forgetting about the filming with the subtitle, that's how much I did not care. I wish I could hate the film, but the film was such a disgrace that it did not leave any impression on me (it's not something I could only sleep on to ignore). Come on in a box called the Chinese Scarface, what after he's dead? This should be avoided.
