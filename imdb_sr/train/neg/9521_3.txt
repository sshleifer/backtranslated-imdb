This movie received a lot of games during the day on HBO or Cinemak. The reason is that they assume that people would be interested to compare it with Captain Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks of the same name. The only reason for this is an attractive Matt Lattanzi. Ium! Although I have to say that Matt was more than a long one in his teeth to play a high school student. If they were a woman, they would have to play MAJKU high school! (Is it just me, or did his daughter resemble Shelley Duvall?) Oh yes, plot - who cares? A typical teenage girl play adult.
