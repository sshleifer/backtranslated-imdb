it can be wondered why? characters cut, shouted and chewed the landscape for no apparent reason, except that someone wanted to shoot a movie in Barcelona. Billie Baldwin, is that right? It is forgotten in the role of a policeman / alienated husband / love-father-sweet-little-blonde. The story seems to be cut out and glued off scenes that have been discarded from adventure films over the past three years. The lack of charisma ellen is a black hole that seems to drain energy from every scene in it. His real acting is shown when he takes the blouse while movies are being shot from one toothy scene to another. Unfortunately, the director rarely goes bad enough to be a camp or parody. all this is just a cliche, known in every way. the director sent his daughter as an early bartender, probably because no reputable agent would allow the client to destroy his career by being in such a lame, fictitious and uninteresting movie. The only robbery is the stealing of investor money and the observer's time.
