When the comedy has its own beautiful soundtrack on the back, you know that you are not dealing with top-notch movies. I rented this film with friends who were expecting to laugh, but overall that most of the smiles would make fun of each other from the film. We could not choose a worse movie. Perhaps the movie was fine with a few changes. First, the comedy was painful. Physical gags are poorly derived and set. The fat kid in the movie made us want to kill ourselves, we bless him for trying scenes and scenes, but he was like a puppy who begs for love. If he was taken out of the movie, everything could have been tolerable. There were some funny jokes, I believe one of them was when a group of boys stole one of the pornographic films of the parents and turned out to be gay porn. But to best compress the comedy, I'll just say the opening for a fat kid. He wears a shirt of blisted stains and speaks of not knowing when something is done. To finish, the film editor could save the film by removing a fat kid, cutting 20 minutes of school scene and ending longer than thirty seconds of random bickering. OH, BTV, there are two good elements that the film possesses. Kadeem Hardison plays his role lovely and performs his jokes so that nobody misses or appreciates them. The second element that the movie is buying is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landri. Her character ignores the majority of the film that is ashamed. Do not waste your time even by renting this one. I did not like it and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
