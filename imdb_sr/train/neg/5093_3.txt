I just visited the Russian forum of our TV channel that showed this movie. Well ... 99 percent of the active Russian audience is disappointed. We wanted to see more true facts about our spatial achievements in this movie. But, the authors had in mind something else ...: (We are a great and beautiful country with the intelligent people who live here. We are proud of all our space dreams, a real achievement on the one hand in this field and science on the other. , I want to ask the authors: Where is our LUNOHOD and where, hell is our MIR station? Ah? I'm completely sure that the LUNOHOD events took place much earlier than Armstrong's "Walking by the Moon." And scientific errors - I really do not have time here and enough space!
