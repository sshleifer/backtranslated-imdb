It's often said that films can never be equal to the original book. Well, in this case, not just a movie is not "so good" as a book, it is an insult to the book. I'd rather the novel of Milan Kundere go into fire rather than this "something", which the director probably calls "adaptation". on your shoulders, or are you dealing with an unbearable ease of existence? "Instead, everything is dealt with by Daniel Dai Levis (I can not tell Tomas) sexual adventures with his stupid wife, his mistress, and other lovers." Francois Truffaut has said that: "Bad directors make bad films." Do not waste your time and money Instead, read the book, it's really worth it.
