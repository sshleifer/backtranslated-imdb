We're sorry - this movie is just cheap TV production. I've seen a lot of promotional material and I'm looking for a professional movie like "Stormriders" - what I presented was a low-budget movie like "KSENA" or "Hercules" on TV. Without an atmosphere, a very boring, more than a worse fighting scene. Some good ideas - no more. I hope to get an opportunity to make this kind of a movie and then show how to make such a movie! My ASIAN-Tips: "MUSA - RATNIK", "STORMRIDERS" "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROIAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry about bad English!
