Chances are a big mistake. You could have known director Emil Ardolin of Dirty Dancing and Sister Act, and you should expect something fun from him. But I guess I have to disappoint you. He made a really, really bad movie. According to the story, Christopher McDonald is dying to be born again as a baby. The baby grows up Robert Dovna Jr., and Jr returns to her former hometown where she meets her former daughter, Marie Stuart Masterson (complicated, right?). Then there is a former wife, Cibill Shepherd, and Jr also falls in love with her. I suppose I do not even have to recall that she loves Ryan O'Neil. In one of his first roles Robert Dovna Jr. It's on the worst. He copied Michael J. Foka. After 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves it is not suitable for acting in movies. as an antidote for insomnia.
