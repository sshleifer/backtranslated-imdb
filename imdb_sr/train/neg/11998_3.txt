This is a horrible, horrible movie !!!!!!!!! First of all TOO long. the longest movie I've ever seen. The stories are too damn !!!! In fact, there are too many stories to tell the line is Ruined. Comedy was not a comedy !!!!! it was not funny at all ... The story is so repulsive and badly written that it does not matter if the characters live or die ....... I had some expectations from of this movie ......... but my expectations have fallen completely in the first few minutes ...... The only thing that is good in this movie is MUSIC ... and obviously Vidia Balan. she gives the best performance and stands out among all the older actors ...... she is just new and still shines and makes the rest of the actors look so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and blonde, who play his love, also help to save this catastrophic film. Govinda fits perfectly into the role of taxi driver. and blonde also gives very subtle and consistent performance .... Another talented actress Aiesha Takiia is completely lost in this movie !!!! so is the priya !!!!!!!!! Akshai well performs his role, but it seemed to be too much at the top !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also completely lost ... the only one who is not lost is Salman because there is no talent that could ever be lost !!!!!!!!! All in all, this is a very impossible film with the Mishmashed scenario and TOOO Masladar that the story is based on stupid comedy scenes. Imagine how this movie is silly! 3/10 is four hours !!!! I think RETHINK before going to the cinema !!!!! better avoid it !!!!!
