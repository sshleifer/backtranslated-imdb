"Meatball Machine" has to be one of the most complex funny, horrible and exaggerated horror movies I've ever encountered. It's about the good against evil and the story of performance, with the goal of having fun with a bloody, scary and witty context. As a result, violence is not particularly terrible and does not make you suffer, but unnecessary bloodshed and nudity unfold. The performances of Issey Takahashi and Toru Tezuke is the worst I've ever seen, if that was not enough, directed by the unseen director Iudai Iamaguchi. This movie only has everything, it's bad to bone! It must be seen for every b-movie freak !!! ... Simple: pleasure and rare jewel.
