I saw this trailer and I thought that this god is my god who would like to see this movie, and at the same time I thought my friend turned to me and said: "We have to go see this movie." .. so I said so I saw this about 5 minutes and I tried to put a brave face and enjoy cheap fears, but they were gone. It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen that the director has no impact on the prospect of the same footage they were used again and again he did not build up the uncertainty actors are probably just saying a scream cry running down. I would like to see a script because for the first 40 minutes there were mostly boring girlish gigglers and bad music, there was absolutely no development of character. The plot was just ... so there was no complication it was basically I know that we will terrorize a high school group at their prom night with the stalker serial killer, That's great! Hmmm The act was what you expected in an Australian soap hopelessly, that the main character Blondie of the god damn upset me. her longest line must have been half the sentence, and every time she was on the camera, she just pulled out another indecent expression on her face. Please listen to me if you do not have the taste in the movies this, and if your like I do not have a good choice then I wish you luck, perhaps smuggling into an iPod or magazine. I can not believe this film was made!
