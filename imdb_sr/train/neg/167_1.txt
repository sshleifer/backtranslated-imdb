Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about this story, should be embarrassed by this series. Borg is not coming until K brings Enterprise into the Gamma sector, Klingons NEVER been seen until Kirk meets them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship carrying the Enterprise name ... should I continue? Berman and Piliar were outraged by the creation of Gene Roddenberi. After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in every episode of the stars in this series. I do not blame her for not being involved in this mess. Poor Bakula. He is an excellent actor, as well as all actors. I love them all, but the story is tragic and ignores all the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think that more people were watching Deep Space 9 (which was canceled untimely).
