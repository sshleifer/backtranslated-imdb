Bugs Bunny accidentally ends on the south pole while trying to spend a holiday in Florida. Where does a little penkuin, who tries to save himself from Eskimo, meet? This short attempt and penkuin is wonderful, but in the end it's a bit too light in the laugh section. Eskimo is not that great from the Bugs film and I've just seen a lot of better cartoon movies about Bugs Bunny honestly, even other shorts when paired with other unknown antagonists. So I can not recommend this with good conscience. However, it's nice to see it in an uncut form. This cartoon is on the disc 3 "Golden Collection Loonei Tunes 1". My Score: C
