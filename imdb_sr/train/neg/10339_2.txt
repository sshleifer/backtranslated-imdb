How did Mike Hammer live - in a penthouse with a GOLF BAG hidden in the corner next to a TV with cathode-ray tubes on a large screen and a strong fireplace? No, I would refuse to throw a bottle of twenty uncapped camels on the couch or on the floor of my office or in a smell in a bad house in LA, wiping out dried red pulp and dripping mud from the face, that's how. Spillane must have written the trash, but how is it going to get worse? Give some desperate chager maker an empty check, because he thinks that any Noir film called bullshit will be sold at the box office, add some hot tomatoes above the hill, and just generally screw up the story for some retarded, drugged scriptwriters, that's how!
