I love science fiction, fascinated by Egyptian mythology and appreciate digital animation. I thought that the film that combines these three films would be at least pleasant. I could no longer make a mistake: the story (or indeed its lack) was completely uninspired and lacking imagination - while imagination is usually the largest component of any science fiction story. Dialogue and acting are even worse than in the average porn movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives a new meaning to the term 'bad effect'. Poor acting would not be such a big problem that Bilal did not take the "director" seriously; all the lines sound like they should be poetic, it seems that Bilal really thinks he has done an artwork here. Well, there is no art or poetry in this piece of garbage, just pretentiousness! This guy should really stick with the comic, because he does not succeed on all possible accounts as a director. Worst of all, it's a horrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually looks at this movie in a physically painful experience. The graphics seem so fake that even the Van Helsing inlaws look like live actors! Since half the characters are CGI-animated, it's quite a problem that CGI effects look so fake. If the Egyptian gods really exist then Bilal is dead, because he will undoubtedly revenge it with the terrible way in which he displays them in this disastrously bad film.
