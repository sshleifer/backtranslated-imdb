I am giving this film 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. this film was terrible. It was very bad, the story was poorly written, the action was incredible. I doubt that even the Rescue Army could fight as badly as the troops in this film did. I will not even write a spoiler plot because the movie is not good enough for spoilers. Writing comments on the action would be meaningless. If I were to compare this film, I would have to compare it to Reign of Fire, but although I did not like Reign of Fire, this film was at least better than this. Some of the people in the theater went before the movie was halfway. The only reason I did not do this is that I simply did not think to do it. I was hoping for a CGI feast and masterly fought, but that did not happen. The martial arts lasted for 30 seconds, and it was from the routine exercise that was done during the flash-back scene, very disappointing. Neither CGI has been done well. One scene comes to my mind. During one of the earlier Tank battles, troops are firing at nothing. Someone forgot to talk boy animations to this movie, so the street was completely deprived of bad guys. I also think that the voice of a bad guy is named after the voice of Imotep from The Mummi. Did this same thing happen? (Someone owed some royalties, here?) Since I mentioned the scene of the struggle, I will say that this can be considered a spoiler, but only by the purists I suppose. , do not buy a DVD when it appears. You are warned.
