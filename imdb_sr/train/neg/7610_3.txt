I generally do not like the films of director Sidney Pollack ("The Firm" is somewhat an exception) and I was never a fan of Robert Redford. Still, I thought that "Three Days of Condor" must be good because of the many praiseworthy comments it received. Although widescreen cinema is pretty eye-catching, Mak von Sidov looks nice. The business of an evil professional killer, I discovered that this affair is extremely disappointing. The film undoubtedly radiates a paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by a cluttered plot that seems to make no sense. the viewer hangs in the air. And what can we say about this absurd romance between Redford and Dunavia? I'd rather watch Hitchcock's films five times in a row than sit again through this piece of waste.
