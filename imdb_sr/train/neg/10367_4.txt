This film is poorly written, it behaves badly and is very predictable. He was very low-budget and I understand why he was never published and went directly to the video. There was not even fun in the camps, there was only a total disaster and I would like to be able to get 1-1 / 2 hours back! The colors were terrible along with a parcel that has such large holes where you can drive a mac truck over them. The plot itself has done a young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically able to do - what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. About every movie comes to mind it's better than this. ejames6342
