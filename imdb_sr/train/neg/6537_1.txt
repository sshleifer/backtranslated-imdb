First of all, I should be warned that I saw this movie on TV and with an English name - which may have completely ruined the atmosphere. However, I evaluate what I have seen and hope that people will turn away from this version. I thought this film was boring. All the atmosphere of the film is lost due to dubbing leaving the frustration of the film in the ear. I'm sorry, but the worst film of sin in my book is to be slow, except when a movie about philosophy. I have not seen any deep philosophical meaning in this film. Maybe I missed something, but I have to say that as I see it. I rated it as "1". What can I say, maybe American-oriented tastes.
