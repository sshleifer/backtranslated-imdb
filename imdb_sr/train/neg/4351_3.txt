Every generation fully believes that it lives in the end times. This has been true for thousands of years. And movies like this feed on this. How did they get great Orson Welles to tell this wreck of the train? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. It tries to link prophecies as well as those with what was happening at the time it was made, making it obviously dated and somehow stupid. "but without high production values." People should be confused to participate in this. In short, the film is dated, silly, reactive, and useless. Good if you want a good laugh, but it's not good enough to really ask for it.
