I do not know what it is in the acting style of Donald Sutherland, or vocal style, but it seems to always behave behind massive wet paper. He's just ... I do not know, THICK? Somnambulistic? On drugs? Strange. I said that, for the first time I saw the first movement of my original edition, and honestly, I do not remember that it had finished anything similar. And a bad ending, because nothing is tied up. What about the dead husband? An unfortunate child (and is the kid called?)? Scotland Iard and military persecutors? I wish that something was wrapped up and that everything was dramatically closed, not just a great panoramic lift. And what woman is sleeping with the man she just killed? Even if she tried to alleviate the doubt of Igla to protect her child, she could always have a headache. The last encounter made me feel too distressed and unpleasant ...
