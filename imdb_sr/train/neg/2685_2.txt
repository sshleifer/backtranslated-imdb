I've never watched a movie on the internet, but I felt inspired to do it after I saw this. Someone does not appear at a funeral and says to the mourners: "My relatives have died, so why should I care for you?" They are called "arts". As a daughter of deaf parents, I was particularly angry about using deafness as a trick. Every deaf person who feels vibration and immeasurability would probably investigate, not ignore. The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer, there are a number of cases from which I would hold out: the Holocaust is one; This is different. I wish these filmmakers were not so arrogant (and incompetent).
