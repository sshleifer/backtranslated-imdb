I watched this movie after I had so many problems downloading through rapidshare. And I have to say, it did not deserve it. Parinda was so excited that I really enjoyed watching. Parinda is one of those films that do not meet the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers, despite the great story. It was even worse to know that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "On the Water". Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he came from America. The direction was missing quality many times, except for several scenes between them. Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure, will make a movie from him. I do not say that Parinda was bad. It was not good enough.
