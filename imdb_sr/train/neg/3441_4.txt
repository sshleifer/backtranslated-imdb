What was this? Someone obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We get an existential fear mixed with a cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing, but each was canceled by terrible music, CGI or acting. Even David Linch's work sometimes feels so, just like his interesting shows and movies that go on too long. And unfortunately this is only 98 minutes. Actors were attractive, and it's around the boundary. I suppose it touches the feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have, but it just does not make the characters kind enough to take care of their fates ... whatever they are. The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous.
