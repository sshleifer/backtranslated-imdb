A terrible end - and I can not believe that Moore spent a year with it. Пушки Л. Ron Hubbard and Dianetits, for which Hubbard claimed he sang in three weeks. This was disappointing enough to discard my discs from the first 3.5 years. The first 1.5 hours were packaged in action, although they were absurd in premise, and then it deteriorated into a slow, painful, breakdown of the series. Unbelievable how slow and exhausted the last hour. Did we think deeper? If I wanted a lesson in a-materialism, I would read Ishmael Daniel Quinn. It's absurd to think that 38K people would give up everything for a "new beginning". Absurdly thrown into the disappearing Karu, and again the appearance of the Baltars and the Sixth. It's absurd to throw it into a mitochondrial evening. Just absurd.
