This movie is horrible. It's boring, poor quality, actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen, and the script is so bad it's ridiculous. all the girls, but it's ugly, hard and it looks like it was from the early nineties. All the characters are absent for a weekend gathering among friends, but nobody is a friend! The couple did not see the "main" guy over 5 years, and even then they were not friends. The "Date" of the main guy knows him only from work, and then there's a girl he's picking up at the bar. Now tell me you would risk losing your job to spend a weekend in your cabin with people who are not even your true friends. Because this is what works at the beginning of the film! Do not spend any minute of your time on this lemon. I made home movies more horrible than this! <br /> <br />
