Racer drivers say that the speed of 100 miles per hour seems fast until you have reached 150 and the speed of moving 150 miles per hour until you've driven 250. Andalusian dog looks stunning. Eraserhead looks stunningly bizarre until you see Begoten. And Begoten looks stunning bizarre until you see Part C. Frederica Hobbsa. Fans of the race, Nothing in the world of the film has anything similar to the works of C. Frederica Hobbsa. Alabamin Spirit comes close to any of his films to have a coherent plot, and includes only hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinational corporations, elephants and Mystery Gas. And Fabulous Voodmobile, Sunset Cruise in San Francisco, of course. What's really amazing is that someone gave him a lot of money to make the Alabama Spirit. There are sets, lighting, hundreds of statists, costumes, lots and lots of effects. Somehow it makes Alabamin Ghost so wrong. You are watching some terrible cheeseball such as Night of Horror or Plutonium Babi, and at least some of the oddities are told on the basis that they obviously shot a movie from the height on their Discover cards. But the spirit of Alabama was made with a real budget, and that is the ZLO. I mean, I have a script about the cannibal tribe living in Thunder Bay in Ontario, building a secret temple in the woods of Twizzler, and no one pierces my door with a check book, how has this got funding for FOUR of the biggest films ever taken?
