but Thomas Ian Griffith simply does not have the polish that a big actor had, if this was done 5 years ago. Some humorous lines could have been timed for this to be not only action, but also comedy. And how will you get KC from Katie Koslovsky at all? Plummer's character was so scratched to fit better into Bullvinkle toon. Personally, if the action moves show the skin - I would like to see the same time between the female / male, otherwise I do not show anything.
