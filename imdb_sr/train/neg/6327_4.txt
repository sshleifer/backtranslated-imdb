I thought this film would be much better than it was. It sounded like a loudspeaker from a spy general, and the beginning was reminiscent of Pleasantville, but this film was short. The action is just funny. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have launched a spy school to teach their spies how to behave like Americans, but the city they set up for training is a bit out of date, so they grab two janitors from the United States to spice things up. I do not know, but this looks just there. It's becoming really weird when nobody in this Russian city speaks Russian accent. Someone screwed up the job in casting. Also, for comedy it's painfully dry. There is one, two funny places on top, and they have nothing to sing and dance. In the end, the movie will eventually fall asleep. And as a twisted face in the face, this film is so professional for the US that I'm sick. The film constantly repeats, the United States is God, and Russia is a devil. This is the kind of stain that was made against the Japanese in the Second World War. Movies like these that make everyone think the United States is full of themselves. This gets 4 out of 10, and I'm kind. She really should get one, but the dance scene was ridiculous, but then she dragged away a bit to make it really funny.
