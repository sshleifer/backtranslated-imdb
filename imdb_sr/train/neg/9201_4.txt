This is a movie that reflects the D & D fear of the 80's (and even today). It is a fear that people who play D & D (or any other gameplay) will be "sucked in" and will lose the ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and continue to kill couples, child victims, suicide, etc.). An excellent movie for anyone who loves to blame the problems of society on inanimate objects, but anyone who has played a game, a video game or even acted in a show will consider it an insult to their intelligence. It's for D & D what Vargames was for computers. Plus as a movie, it's kind of bullshit.
