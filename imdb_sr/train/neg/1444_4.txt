The film is very long and unfortunately quite different from the novel. If you want to watch a movie then do not read the first novel because it will shock you. However, cinema was fine and if you are a person who likes adventurous genres exploring Africa, then do it. The performances of the acting are adequate, however, many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis searched for his missing brother, not for the lady in search of his father. Gagool was crafty and killed in a cave, while it turned out that a good person who was more likely to stay with a new king was shown here.
