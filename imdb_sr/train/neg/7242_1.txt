Pallbearer is a disappointment and sometimes very boring with a love story that just does not work partly with the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow goes through the whole movie with a confused expression on his face and it's hard to say what David Schwimmer even sees in her. However, Pallbearer is sometimes ridiculous, especially in the church scene and group scenes. with his friends we laugh, but that's basically that. See The Pallbearer just for these scenes and speed up the rest. Trust me you do not miss a lot.
