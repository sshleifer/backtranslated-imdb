I entered this film, just as it started, one afternoon where I was home with a flu - otherwise I would miss it. That would probably be the best. I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jai Thomas - both very good performers - and he thought this might be worth a look. It turned out to be to some extent, but only because it is one of those stories that frightens us horribly. Zoe McLellan has little to recommend her talents, except for Jaine Mansfield or Loni Anderson breasts. Unfortunately, her acting heroism - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson look like Garbo or Davis for comparison. White rats of young walnut cases, a proprietary cat, a young walnut case that the owner threw out and restrained in his home, and a bunch of Doofus (including a young walnut case) running around a plant for biological danger and an absurd conclusion. I waited for at least some scene or stamped element to contain at least a small amount of realism, conviction or the ability to cause empathy / sympathy - but it turned out to be futile.
