As I sat in front of the TV watching this film, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could do with this!" It's also possible that you will. It starts intriguing. The British guard of the park living in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a beautiful woman of the black woman (Lisa Zane) whom she met in the park only recently. Then, one day she disappears. The police are not able to find any documentation that ever existed, and Firth is conducting his search. For now it's good. Just as she surrenders, she turns to her female best friend (Billi Zaneu), and they stumble upon her former life in the bad underground of Los Angeles for drugs, nightclubs and filming, and then in her history of mental instability. . At that moment, Firth's life is in danger, and the film is falling apart. No person from the past Lisa Zane is not interesting at all. The film is moving slowly, and there is very little action. There is a sublot that relates to the disappearance of money from drugs, but it's just a throw. No pursuit, no germination sequences, and no tension. Just some boring beatings and lots of conversations with boring characters. One thing worth mentioning, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brothers and sisters, but they never appear together on the scene. By the end of the film, you were torn between the questions that could have been and trying to stay awake.
