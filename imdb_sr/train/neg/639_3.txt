The clich√© of a soldier shocked by war shells is subjected to boring treatment here. Damn, great acting, acting within the boundaries of their talents, can not buy the "Return of soldiers" from his cruelty-inability to instill the spectator into emotional involvement. The best moments, as noted by the second reviewer, come when Glenda Jackson is on the screen; but even Jackson's cracking of good film power can not get the chestnut of this film from a cold, never-heated fireplace. Ann-Margret, whose reputation as a sex swing and too often accused of not having the ability to act, finds her real and rather profound abilities here - despite speaking with a flawless Middlesex accent. The exhausted party, which eats many TV miniseries on the emotionalism of saccharin, is in irritating chances with the emotional distance of the script, blocking and excessive formalism of the direction; Apart from achieving the result and writing a script and direction, 'Return of soldiers' has all the real bits, but it does not manage to unite them.
