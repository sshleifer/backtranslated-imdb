This film had so much potential. Anyone who follows the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details in the film that are ignored. Too much time and effort was spent in the film about Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption. Where is the character development? The origin of every criminal is always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where is the film about his adolescence when he began to kill and destroy small animals? Instead, we give a dizzying array of flashbacks that try to explain the origin of the killer, but they fail to deal with the main point in Dahmer's development. Also, the reason why the country became so intrigued by this story was the details - how he kept the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to achieve; his cannibalism and his desire for meat, etc. I could continue, but to summarize, the far backward points in the film, focused on his sexuality and insufficiently up - good things you would expect to see when the title of the movie is "Dahmer."
