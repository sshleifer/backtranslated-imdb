I hated this movie. It was a horrible, poor, poor, stupid actor, REAL REAL REAL dumb criminals who were NOT THE BEST BIT funny (as opposed to the first two home movies that were very good). all pitfalls are poor, pathetic excuses for ideas that were badly copied from the first two, which only meant that the people who wrote this film were just lazy because their salary did not exceed $ 20 a week. This film is absolutely bad, it's not worth renting either. In fact, do not even look at the so-called! Go use your eyes in a more beneficial way by looking at the first two! I DO this 1 star (out of 10). Just believe me when I say, if you like the first two, and you're not a complete stupid person, you will not like this movie, do not watch this movie !!!
