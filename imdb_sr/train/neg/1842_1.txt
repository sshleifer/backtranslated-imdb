This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I can not with good conscience allow this film to be unpredictable. People have to be warned! First, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") I like Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Veis and Christopher Valken, and yet, I hated this Movie. There is a plot, but who cares when there is no letter. The dialogue is unreal and boring, the situation is fictitious, the course of the event is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are insensitive and uninteresting, and the story, although based on a good premise, is stupid. This movie is a piece of poo. It's not important to spend money on this movie, it's not even worth the time you spent watching it. Please do not see it ... I beg you!
