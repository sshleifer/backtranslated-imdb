The first mistake you make in subtitling a movie is to use "live dead" without having a budget for a real Zombie FX. Sure, this was a zombie with a small budget - a really low budget. I thought it was a film school. Amateur actors and amateur effects. It was really bad as regards the above, and it presented an interesting craft of zombies. If you get "R" for violence, you could give us good footage of infants who are attacked. Women have been so little used in this film that they can almost be classified as "gai interest". And I'm staying out of Oakland. There was a lot of shooting and the police were not in sight!
