I saw this bomb when it hit the cinema. I laughed at all the time. Why? Because the stupidity made me crazy. I'm looking back and I realize there was not a single funny thing in the whole movie. Nothing is intentional. It's terrible for Lizzie to chew a piece of Nurplek and become a gigantic, carnivorous demon ... yet her tiny dress is perfectly intact, despite the fact that it is now hundreds of times bigger than it was when it first put it on. Or the type of film in which a man can be shocked by a defibutor and only fall into unconsciousness, and come back to consciousness without any medical help. And do not let me start with the ridiculous fate of the "criminal" that they have decided to create a "conflict." Uh huh. For a person who complains that Disney targets only children - it seems that the disorderly parts of this film disprove that statement. Do we really need Darryl Hannah to accuse Jeff Bridges of having kinky video tapes? You work if you are Disney and you have no idea that the movie attracts the audience above 8 without writing a more intelligent script! I am completely convinced that Disney's pay off ratings, so movies can get away with murders and still get family-friendly grades. What is the loss of DVD format?
