All right, the first video seems to have been shot in the 80s. I was shocked by the fact that it was published in 2001. Second, the action was everywhere, and the story was confusing. If there was a short prologue or the introduction of a story it would have been better. I also appreciate the fantasy, but this movie was too much. It was bizarre and badly recorded. The scenes did not go smoothly and the characters were weird. It was difficult to follow and perhaps it was a translation, but it was difficult to understand. I love Chinese epic movies, but if you are looking for a movie from Chinese epic fantasy, I would recommend Promise (visually stunning, plot is interesting and good character) and not this movie. Be careful that you will be disappointed.
