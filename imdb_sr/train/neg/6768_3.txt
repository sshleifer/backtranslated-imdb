Herbie, a Volkswagen who is thinking like a man, has returned, is now being driven by Maggie Peiton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing standing in the way is the current champion, Trip Murphi (Matt Dillon), who will do everything to stop them. Original love beet was not so good. Even as a child, I remember that I did not like much. Still, I was hoping for a bit. I think actors are pretty good and the trailer makes it look like a pretty funny movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is no better than he was before. The film is defiantly bad for people older than 12 years. He'll probably entertain kids, but that's all. I realized it was a movie for kids and everything, but they could make the film even more interesting. . There was very little laughter and it was boring near the end. Most actors seemed dead in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was as good as Maggie Peiton. Usually he gives better performances such as Freaki Fridai and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best results to everyone. He was very good as a bad guy though he did not have much work to do. Justin Long, Breckin Meier and Michael Keaton are really there and do nothing special. He tries to keep the film interesting, but he works with bad scenarios. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote a script and would it be a surprise to you that they were responsible for both Taki and The Pacifier? These two make light films, but they can not make the stories interesting or pleasant. It's not entirely their fault, but we hope that next time we will try more. In the end, Herbie is a safe, predictable family movie worth watching if you are a child. It is better for everyone else to skip it. Rating 4/10
