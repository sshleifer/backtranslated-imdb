Robert Forster, a very powerful character actor, was lost here on the sea as a man from New York, seeking revenge for the abusers who killed his son and attacked his wife in the house. A terrible topic that is used for cheap pleasures in the vein "Death Vish". It's not hard to make fun of these daring procedures: the dialogue is full of cries, statistics on crimes are irreversibly dated, and the auxiliary characters are ridiculously copied (especially a disgusting judge who allows the accused killer to get out of court immediately). Low-cost production is suppressed in its self-regulation, especially because violence in our cities has only increased. * from the ****
