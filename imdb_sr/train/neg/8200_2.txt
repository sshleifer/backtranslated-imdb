This film could not decide what it wanted to be. There were a couple of sub-parcels that made you think for some time that all of these things would eventually be merged ... but they did not. If you want a story about "aliens in frozen waste," follow the version of "Things from the 1950s" (and not the disgust that has changed in the up-to-vision 20+ years later). We could not go beyond the fact that the "alien" looked pretty recycled since the day of independence. The "smallest" sets would be more efficient to hire actors who would really be able to react and take the intended mood. Many landscape gum with a little payout.
