I think I agree that many comments here must be false. Even if the movie is not necessarily bad, it's definitely below average. "Dark Remains" is basically a Ghost Movie with a premise on your own ghosts and the bad emotions that are haunting you. The film starts with two stories loosely intertwined, which are not even connected later. Couple loses a child in bed. They moved to a farmhouse to escape from their past and hit what ... the house was haunted, somehow. From there, Dark Remains begins very slowly with some daunting moments (the first performances of the ghosts are good, and the luminosity sequence also worked well). OK, then ... Woman sees the spirit of a daughter, other spirits of people who have died in accidents or suicides, man tries to solve the secret of the houses of the past, the woman becomes depressed, strange neighbors appear. Its almost everything was there, but the premise that it's your own emotions is beautiful, so you'll be waiting for a turn. There is no turning around, only the story about the history of a haunting house, a strange neighbor, a totally meaningless creepy jail and a dead daughter together with a photo idea that reminds me of a "zipper" is confusing. The end is ridiculous, because when you start and finish a slow and piano music movie, it's pretty poor to include some of the ghosts left at once, which look like zombies, of course just to return to a slow pace and piano music. To be short ... Dark scraps could have been a beautiful scary story about ghosts if the script does not try to go everywhere and not arrive anywhere. to feel and oppose the basic atmosphere of the film. And besides ... please, do not use the abandoned prison again. So it's worn out and in this case it makes no sense at all. "Hey, there's this creepy jail up, let's shoot it there." I assume that many of the ingredients in Dark Remains are inserted into such a mix.
