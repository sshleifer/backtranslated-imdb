My wife and I both thought this film was diluted, made for the BBC (BBC) version of the Manhattan Murder Mystery ... which is itself good, but not great. The story has little intersectional tension or chemistry, not much complication. The character of Voody Allen just wanders around running on his mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson do not have much more work. I must say it's pretty disappointing. The role of Ian McShane is just an extended look. The first thing that came to my mind was: "I wonder how the BBC had to pay Voody Allen out of Manhattan?" He must have needed money, and he needed his call to expand his audience outside the youth market attracted to the two stars. I give this film 4 stars instead of 3 because it's an unpleasant background noise. If you ever want to have something while you knit or sort your stamp collection, this will do the job. I would not pay to rent it again.
