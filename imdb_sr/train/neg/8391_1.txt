Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title of his "House of 1,000 corpses", I can now rest in peace. Nothing about somnambulistic performances or a banal scenario would raise the dead in "The House of Seven Lies", but the groovie ghoulie goes out of his plot (ha!) Anyway, to kill the bloody amateurs who make low rates of horror in his former abode! In the Hellenistic House (I apologize, I do not remember the real name of the place of residence), a bunch of mysterious, inexplicable deaths happened long ago; some, like the arthritic Lurch attitude in John Carradine (whose small role only provides moments in which the film is worth the attention), attributed it supernatural; John Ireland dismisses him as a supernatural hockey. The result appears as "The Satanic School for Girls" (a striking title; values ​​produced for TV production; an intriguing action) crossed with "Children should not play with dead things" (a low-rent movie about low-rent movie producers that you wake up dead); It's trouble, it's not close, fun, or fun. "House of Seven Lies" is dead in frame, and the rest of its 89 minutes is spent through rigor mortis, dragging us for any other pain ...
