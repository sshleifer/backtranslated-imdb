Powers Rangers, a children's show of the 1990s television show, must be the smirk and smarter television show ever made. the rate of plastic nonsense for children? After all, there is nothing, even remotely, nor interesting for this show. See costumes that look like a spandex gone bad. Hair, Earrings, and Fashion in the early 1990's these days look totally funny. Avoid this show at any cost!
