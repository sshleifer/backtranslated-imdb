This film could have been great (because it got a fascinating premise), but never rises above a clean caricature. The act was seriously flawed and there were moments when I moved so fiercely that I thought I would fall into my place in the theater. I never think I've ever seen this godfull piece .... The Danish film has been getting a lot of good years in the past years, but if this piece .... crosses the border, I'm afraid that nobody can ever want to rent a danish movie. This film is the reason why I decided to register here. I really felt that I had to push people out of this part ... my sympathies go to people who have already gone to the movies to watch this
