If you want to laugh like crazy, rent Cage. Cage is about two war heroes, Billy and Scott who are best friends. When Billy was killed in Vietnam, he is not able to defend himself, and Scott brings him. Billy and Scott love to "wrestle", and Scott tells Billy that he is "still sick last night", among other things. Pang Pong, cut yourself! Indian guys who should play Mexican gang members are also top-notch. As they say, now it's "fun. Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba." I could keep on forever, but just watch this movie and laugh at your $ $ off. It was so funny I got out and bought a DVD for $ 5.99
