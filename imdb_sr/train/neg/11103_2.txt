OK, I just saw a video, although it appeared last year ... I thought it was a generally decent movie, except for a story that was stupid and terrible ... First of all, we never know anything about creatures, why they have they appeared in our world, and really, were they on Earth before we were or just came from the universe? Secondly, the role of butchers for maintaining order is so obviously created ... Really, how much underground could be a great underground? There were only so many such creatures, so I think that instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have just set up some tactical bombs, or maybe cleanse you, and Nuke would do the job. I know it sounds funny and that's it, but I do not see killing people like NOW ... Third, Leon behaves like Superman jumping in a train and fights against Vinnie Jones, who was higher and higher in height. Then again, when dealing with a conductor, he does nothing and behaves like a weakness, watching all the abominations. I mean, fine, the conductor had terrible help (lol), but if Leon was so brave to go to the end ... I mean, he risks his first life, and then he does not do anything right when he needs it. He could have died like a hero, but he lives like a coward ... that could be the case, but not after he showed so much courage ... Then, the policeman ... come on! This was a city with an underground railway, I bet there were other police officers other than that lady, another police station, this was kinda silly ... All in all, the great acting of Vinnie Jones, an interesting idea to the reason behind what was not built at all ... By the way, what did the signs on the chest mean? Vinnie Jones can not make up for the rest ...
