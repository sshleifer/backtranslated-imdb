That was disappointing. It started well enough, but as it continued and lost every opportunity to rise, it fell. The actress Maria Schroeder is terrible, she never means what she says, or even knows what she says until she says it. She did not show any true emotion, either for her loved one or for her mother's story. When Len seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lenin's story. It seems that there was never a true connection between Lena and her mother, except that the mother seemed to have a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The assumed parallels between Hanne's "mixed" romance and her mother's relationship with her father were clich√©, because they came in anyway, and was poorly broken. The wedding was totally incredible and stupid. The peak of the protest was unhealthy, and no matter what Lena did or did not do to influence the outcome, she would surely have shown a certain complexity of feelings at that time, a faded look, unexplainable ambivalence. In fact, no feature in the movie had any depth or spark. It was very difficult to take care of any of them, even for little Ruth. Everything with Luis was an issue. (Why did he break it so that she phoned the hotel? There was no context or explanation for it.) If any mention of him was removed, she would not have been noticed. A simple story confused by the poor development of character (whose mother, again?) Is a bad act, and the direction that made everyone look like they are acting. You could almost hear "quietly on the set! ...." I began to think that this was worthy of 7, but as the film went, he quickly fell to 4, and then he earned 3 after the stupidity of the wedding scene. This was cold and sterile, as I saw. A terrible loss of a good story.
