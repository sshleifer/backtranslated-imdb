A very sophisticated and boring movie, designed to be hip and modern, is shown in the style of editing and some strange corners of the camera, which results in only sleepiness. Casting is lost, writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing to pay out is the top Lalo Schifrin soundtrack, really cool and the initial sequence, very original and interesting. Run if you can, bad reviews and comments about this movie are completely deserved; It's really clean trash. Of course this has its charm, watching a movie in which everyone would not drop a glass of beer if it was lit, but save it for a stormy day where you have nothing else to do.
