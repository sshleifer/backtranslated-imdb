The story is about the lives of ordinary people from Antwerp, who live their lives. So I said that, and there is nothing more specific to apologize for this story. The film is fast, like MTV and well photographed, and we think the director is talented and should be working on more films. So, let's forget this and hope for the best with the next Deus-Barman picture.
