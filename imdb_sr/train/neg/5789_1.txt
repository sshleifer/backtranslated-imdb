My wife and I really hoped this film, but that was a great disappointment. It was otherwise an American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who does not succeed in anything he tries, e.g. fishing, hunting, apparently subdues his family with his wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but in this process he often lays his son many times on various obvious things. The words can not express how bad this movie is. Children and women are very real, making the film even more sad. I do not get humor ... unless you like to laugh at other people who make a fool of themselves. I do not understand how this could have happened for rewards. Save your money is not worth renting.
