It's hard to criticize this movie because I do not like the story itself, and no good work would save her. Think of "Arizona Raising" with a middle line. The acting is transient, but Jennifer Tilly is far above the top (but it's not enough to make this a nice camp movie) as usual, comes somewhere between "Misery" and the sarcastic DMV employee. Other actors have eyebrows continually knitted in fear, either due to the strain of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise. Real degrading a few hours of film. Darril Hannah is performing too much of a movie to understand it. I wish I could tell you how it ended, but I got out, I'm sorry.
