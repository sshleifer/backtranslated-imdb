So I was looking at this last night and the only thing that did not make it totally awful was that it was straight ahead. There was no fight around the bush that this child was Anti-Christ. However, the film was only poorly written. For example, they never explained how they incurred an accident with the dentist "accident" or, in the end, how the policeman ended up in a miraculous way at home to save the child, and that the police have not yet been called. The death scenes were really bad and they were not fun at all. The kid who chose to play Anti-Christ was boring and really could have chosen a better child. Just do not waste your time watching this.
