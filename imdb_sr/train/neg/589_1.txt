Frankly, I went to watch the movie, not for actors, not because of complications, but because it was ranked 17 in Luxembourg, and the movie must be really brutal or pornographic to put it in this category. Believe me, as a movie freak, I've seen a lot of brutal films in my life (Ichi killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser), but this film was a disturbing and brutal picture I've ever seen. The action is stupid, the direction is terrible, the acting was central, even music was a cheap copy of the so-called "Horror Soundtracks". There is no intelligent aspect in the whole film, and some scenes are really difficult. (especially the scene, where you see embryos in glasses and you hear the baby crying - terrible). I can not understand why the film was rated as 16th in Germany, where the criteria are really heavy (for example, Murder (brutally but mockingly and having had great allusions to Asian cinema in spite of magnificent directing) even a movie like the state of grace rated with 18). Nobody can call it Horror movie, as it actually was more about showing up than about scaring the public (showing "Creep's" face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); For me (an excuse for my term) it's just one crazy director who lives his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes, you see violence, which has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, nor explains anything. The action has holes and shortcomings, the dialogue is boring, I can not honestly mention any positive aspects of the film except the British and Scottish accents. If I had something to say, I would forbid this movie from the cinema, I fully understand why none of the big manufacturing companies have invested their money in this shit. I'm looking forward to getting feedback on my topic and I will be glad to talk about one or the other topic. "Live in a dream, live in a dream" David Aames
