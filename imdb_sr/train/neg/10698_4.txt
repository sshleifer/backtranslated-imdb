Darkling was a very interesting and funny movie while F. Murray Abraham was in it. Spoolers: Approximately half way, F.Murrai has stuck, because Darkling is a kind of demon-like creature that enjoys a living business. He takes burglars and losers and continues to blame them, giving them everything they want in terms of success. Feed from enjoying the Seven Deadly Sins. However, part of it is that it should bring people who may be wrong, but not completely evil. Otherwise, he can not "distort" their natural goodness. That's what the little boy said in the voice of Barry Vhite, which I found both charming and funny. Mostly fun. As if you imagine Barry Wyte that he was a little dwarf and had spoken to Aiden Gillen "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, Eet Come, Dee Plane!" Throughout the film, Dee Dvarf (actually a robotronic heru) talks to Aiden Gillen in Barri Vhite's voice, saying things like "It's okay to be bad, you know you want it." "Now you've committed the murder, you're really moving around the world" and other remarks that sound like commercials for "Being Evil" stores or something like that. He's really hilarious in a sickly way. In any case, Aiden Gillen is not F. Murrai Abraham, and film tanks as soon as Murrai gets an ax (or knife)? F. Murrai brings some luck to his role in this film. He's a good actor. Aiden Gillen, on the other hand, has a permanent happy smile on his face, and looks like maybe his correct English Comp. the class never hit Mythological characters and could not imagine what the film was about. COMPLETE is really scary and yet almost comical. If this film was a parody, the end was perfect. If it was not a parody, then it was creepy; but the cheap use of a little girl to deliver something that a movie can not deliver. The people who made this movie lost what they wanted to do sometime before the end. It just ends up as if they just realized that their money was running out and that they had to record a quick ending.
