This "movie" is one of the scariest things I've ever seen. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent fabrication. Accepting frowning is not counted as a "direction", which this film needs in the crowd. It was not that all this was wonderful, but we stayed with a bunch of completely artificial characters focused on this artificial way (pseudo-documentary "style" valued by those who do not know how to direct). This film leaves the impression that this is cynically done to appeal to critics who do not know the first thing about filming the movie (most of them). Just terrible. He talks a lot about Sundance and how he became Victor Vargas.
