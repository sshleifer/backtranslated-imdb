Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would have rolled into their graves to know that it was a hit that comes to dinner, in fact, in cinemas. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with repertoire Stanley Kramer in 1967. This day is a joke. So, the white man from an overly stereotyped Italian family in Rhode Island brings his girlfriend from the African American (Insert GASP here) to the funeral of his great father. The reactions of his family members were, of course, ... foreseeable. This film was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish that my girlfriend started lying snoring to signal me that she wanted to leave. Make yourself a service and rent an original. Take a pass for Vake.
