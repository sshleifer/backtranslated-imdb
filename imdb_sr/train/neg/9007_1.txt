This movie is one of the worst shit I've ever seen. While I was watching this film, I literally had a sharp pain in my head. CGI was terrible, and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-Can-Understand-anything, except that he seems unable to properly operate his helicopter. The biggest problem was the operation of the camcorder of the split screen. I felt like I was looking at Brady Bunch or something like that; it was not just different people in boxes, only close-ups and different views on the same thing. I can only conclude that the actors really needed the money, because this film was not worth the film on which it was filmed.
