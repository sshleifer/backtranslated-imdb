I was eager to see Mr. Fik It because I'm a big fan of David Boreanaz. What I got was a 1-1 / 2 hour sleep. The premise looked pleasant: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, the owner of a business called Mr Fik It. The film is a montage, script and acting. Although I found Boreanza pleasing in his other film roles (with the exception of the movie "The Cloves" he did), that was disappointing. Sometimes his character was interesting, and others, flat. The support reminded me of the players on the soap days. I realize it was not a big budget movie, but some of the scenes and music just did not work properly. My advice: look at your own risk.
