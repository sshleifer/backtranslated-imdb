I'm watching bad movies. This film is not good enough to be a bad movie. There is not a little sense of humor, nor a little talent. I am LAZY. Usually I see a bad movie and a curse. This was so bad, I actually made a review and tried to save others from a totally annoying riot in which I was a victim. I was smashing a copy of this movie. It's too miserable even if the room is used. So boring. Watch 'Bloody Bones' or 'Shock, shock, shock' for absolute crap that has some merit as a party. This sludge looks terrible, terrible, and whoever did it, it should feel terrible.
