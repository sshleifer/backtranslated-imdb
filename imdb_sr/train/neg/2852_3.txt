This is a completely unpleasant, even stupid movie. I tried this because Richard Dreifus and Jeff Goldblum appeared, two good actors, and because the complicated line - the mafia boss was soon released from a mental institution - sounded promising. The movie is charged as a comedy. What we have is an endless series of footage - you should apologize - people in poorly lit and elegant, although somewhat unreal, interiors that shoot each other - in the head, stomach, knee, foot, heart (no part seems to be anatomy avoiding, while pronouncing an unclear and cryptic dialogue, some of which are supposedly to be humorous in some kind of postmodern fashion. Goldblum's dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3k5 card, and he wears an expression of faces - the Sardinian cereal - in Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hi Burt Reinolds tells me that they are in the list of points Rob Reiner and Joei Bishop, but somehow I missed them (a good move on their part). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and untrustworthy: I suppose it's the heir, u style 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers.' If you like it, you will probably like this.
