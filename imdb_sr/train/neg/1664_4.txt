This film is amusing enough due to the great performance of Virgin Madsen and the fact that Lindsei Haun is wonderful. However, the reason why the film is so predictable is that we have seen it all before. I did not read the book Mother's Gift, but I hope that Britney and Linne Spears are completely different from this movie. Unless you consider the completion of a movie with a music video that is essentially an original idea, the whole film in mind mentions plagiarism.
