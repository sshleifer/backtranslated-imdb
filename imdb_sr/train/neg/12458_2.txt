The premise of this film is so simple and obvious that only a millionaire in Texas would have a problem with high oil fumes and whiskey to understand it if somebody screamed him through a proverbial car park. In short: the oil business is in the congress with the Government (or Gummint if you prefer), Gummint is in a deal with Middle Eastern despots, and the CIA is a unique bunch of double-sided (insert word) relying on any line that comes to the road. The only people who finish are good, like Mr. Cowney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is the result of poverty that globalization creates when evil multinationals are pushing the world for a delicious download or three. This really fits into profiles of well-trained perpetrators 9/11. In Siriana, this easy fabric of political semi-histories and Hollywood holograms is stirred up in the disgusting vermicelli of the curves of the twisting stories, turn around and turn around through the gloomy circumstances of their own insignificance until the poor observer remains alone with the conclusion that: 1. "The director" (a good joke) should never be released near the camera 2. People like Clooney and Hurto know how to behave, but safe do not know how to choose script 3. if you want to see a movie dealing with corruption in a big business country, go and see Claude Chabrol "L'ivresse du pouvoir", which is an insightful, entertaining and brilliant feigned. Blank, loaded sentimental buffalo rolled up to evening pounding length.
