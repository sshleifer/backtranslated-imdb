'Metamophis' is a story of a poor young scientist, respected in a local college, undergoing research by financial providers for college. This forces him to take shortcuts in a typical bad-Hollywood melodramatic fashion. My first thought after this film was this. "It's not good, but it's not bad, from the beginning to the mid-eighties." Of course, then I realized that it was made in 1990, which almost dropped it to '4', but decided to keep it on an average '5', that is it. Metamorphis on several occasions looks like a good movie that desperately tries to get out. The act, though not starred, is mostly competent. You can even see the occasional glittering of modest quality. Pacing is a big problem with the movie. After thinking about watching ninety minutes, I realized that I was only watching for an hour. Special effects are not great, but the director seems to be competent enough to bypass this weakness. The lead, a mildly charismatic man who seems to be trying to fit the channels of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves reminded me most of Dita's character in the "Vild Things" movie. The female hero works well, but does not differ anyway. Here is the role of an 'innocent girl', and the actress does what she can, but she does not look much. There is a childish actor who can not decide whether the director is lascivious, cheerful or just strange. Pacing, as I said, is the worst issue with this movie, until the final battle with a bad guy who would make the blush Pover Ranger. It's bizarre and inexplicable, all the way to the final scene, which should be dramatic, but simply hilarious, saturated with every bad camera and excessive work that can be compressed for about thirty seconds. watch 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'. Nothing that will bring you back, and nothing to buy.
