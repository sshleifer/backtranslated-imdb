The House of Ghosts is pretty scary. I live in South America, in a country that has suffered a military dictatorship, just like the one that the film is trying to describe, and although everyone knows that films are far from reality, this movie is viewed by the viewers as ignorant and stupid. Things are not as straightforward and linear as they appear here, and of course political processes are much more complicated and more interesting that the plot in "House ...". If you can not show that the complexity on the screen is better, you do not even make a movie at all. There are many examples of how politics can be taken seriously in cinema, without so many common places. In some parts, I felt that Carmen Miranda could appear in papals and palm trees. When you talk about certain things, you must be not only careful, but also respect the intelligence of your public.
