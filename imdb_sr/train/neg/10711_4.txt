Minion is around ... well, minion. Satan's servant and his goal is to get a key that will unlock the doors in which his master is captured. He is a kind of demon that possesses human beings and when the body dies, it will possess another. Anyone who is accidentally obsessed will go to some rampant rage. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of the secret order of Templar, who has the task of keeping the key away from the favorites. The film begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East, where several Knight Templars run away from the favorites. Then it flashes forward until 1999, where the key rises somewhere underground in New York. The archaeologist has a task to study / excavate the place where the key is found. Needless to say it is a key minion, and the film becomes a long scene between hunters and Lukas and an archaeologist. . The film lacks energy, and it just hits. You will follow the search, but you will never feel involved in a story that deliberately takes ideas from previous movies (in particular The Terminator movies). The scenes of the mine fight are problematic because you never get a sense of how good or bad the demon is. She turns "skillfully" into the army of one man when she fights with the templar team, but it's bullshit when it comes to one on one. And it should be around for a long time. All this shows that every sense of logic is simply cast into the convenience draw. The whole idea of ​​the secret order of Templar, the door to hell, and the key is not well explained. We just accept that they simply exist. It seems that the film was made with the feeling that there is not much potential for the story, but only enough to make a couple of dollars. Dolph Lundgren certainly seems to want to be somewhere else. Judgment: 2 of 5 stars.
