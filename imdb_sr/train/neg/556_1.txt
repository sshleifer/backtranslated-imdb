In my book "Basic Instinct" was the perfect movie. She had an extraordinary role in the parts of Stone, Douglas, and all other actors who supported the role. She had beautiful photos, music and fastest noir scripts. All this adds a movie that is as good as it will ever be! This sequel is just the opposite, can not get worse, bad acting and lame script, combined with completely incompetent it's really bad, boring, boring. The only thing that holds you somewhat concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene, which is exactly a repeat copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they smiled and I laughed a lot in spite of myself, because it was like watching the demolition of a glorious monument. The only thing that's good in this terrible mess is the BI1 results for Jerry Goldsmith. Michael Caton-Jones and the half-smart scriptwriters even included the "No Smoking In This Room" dialog on the screening stage and she sends her lawyer (now a lawyer)! I'm sorry to see this horrible movie that should never have been made! It's damaging to the original, it's so bad. The only redemption value is the recognition that aesthetic surgery (and I'm sure Ms. Stone has provided the best money for a surgeon) can do a good job, but obviously can not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body also refers to film creativity. There should be a law: Never make the sequel of a perfect movie!
