I reviewed Richard Burton's list of films when I came to this title that clearly recollected since I first saw it on the cable in 1982. I remember the dialogue from Tatum O'Neal, which was astonishingly bad. I remember that Richard Burton's figure seemed so hopelessly lost, and then he remembered how his motivations did not pass. In short, I remember "Circle Two" because it was so terribly terrible. This film came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with the unhealthy or distorted teen angles of sexuality. We recall the "The Blue Lagoon" (and other Brooke Shields disturbances), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other films that seemed to be dealing with teenagers who have sex, especially with adults. As a teenager of the time, I discovered that the obsession, combined with sexual excesses of the '70s and' 80s, was made for a subconsciously disturbing environment in which all this can be done, so to speak. "Circle Two" is not explicitly acting or unnecessarily brave, such as "Blue Lagoon". In fact, he deals with the issue of love between young and old in brave, if it is completely unsuccessful. But honestly, it's one of those movies you will never see if you did not see them in the first run, because it was really terrible. No one would want this garbage ever to be lifted to the surface that will be publicly distributed again.
