The problem is the role of characters in the movie. A human man shows a British anthropologist who kidnaps two pigmeas and takes them to Scotland, and then realizes that they are not animals or subhumans but are actually equal to themselves. The problem is the role of pigmea in the film - two people who were kidnapped, treated as animals, yet got such a shallow, stereotypical role in the film ... The kidnapper (British anthropologist) ends up as a hero because he "manages" to connect with pigmails. There is no idea how these two hostages feel, from their point of view, their temptation ... I consider it a shallow film, with a one-sided racist look ... he never managed to distance himself from the "white people"
