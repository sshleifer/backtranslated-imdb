This should be a great movie ... Meril Streep and Jack Nicholson act as two newspaper writers. Mike Nichols directed. Uh uh. It's a dull dull! Senseless and predictable! Slow and unsuccessful! It is a boy who agrees with the girl, the boy marries a girl, the boy has an affair, the girl leaves the boy a story. Now there is an original concept! After two hours (only two? It looked like six.) I was not sure whether it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy, or a soap opera. It was done in 1986. I'm sure that we all did things before sixteen years ago that we'd rather forget. I hope that damage to Streep's reputation and others starts to heal and that the emulsion on the master begins to fade. Not that it's a bad picture. It's just so good.
