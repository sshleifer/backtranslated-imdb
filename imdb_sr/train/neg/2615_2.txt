I do not know why, but for some sick reason, I think that since I was at Disney's party, I decided to see 102 Dalmatia. The first movie that was remake of the classic Disney cartoon movie starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Will looked like a safe shot, but it was just a bomb. I think that the reason why these films are not working because the 101 Dalmacija, original, cartoon, only worked better and was more attractive to both children and adults. This was not so much fun because adults run around trying to act as cartoons, not just real human beings. in the movie. The story of Dalmatia 102 is not so good. Cruella De Will has been in prison for some time, but things change when she proves she loves animals now and that it is a pleasant human being. But her reputation is now damaged as a cub, but she buys a shelter for dogs and suddenly everyone likes it and it seems to have changed. But when she sees her Dalmatian policemen, she crazy and starts to see points, and she loses it. She returned to retaliate with the puppies and is still determined to take the Dalmatian coat she always wanted. but to face it, this movie made the entertaining criminal more even a stupid case of walnut. Likewise, as sweet as puppies, it just works more for animation, it sounds stupid, but it's just not that convincing without cartoons and their personalities in the mix. I would not recommend 102 Dalmatians, it's OK, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, it's just the same thing. 2/10
