Knowing the comics of Enki Bilal for some time, I had to see this film. I thought this would be a good way for an artist like Bilal to spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I thought this would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought I would enjoy watching him ... I was wrong! The movie was a real torture to watch. The idea has the potential ... but the film leaves too much to be desirable, and essentially all who see this film leave the impression that it can do better. I will not give suggestion whether you should watch this movie or not. Chances are you are reading these pages that you have already seen, or that you will see them - but be prepared for a very bad 102 minutes.
