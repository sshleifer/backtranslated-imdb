How hard is it to write a movie that can be seen with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here. I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays Big Brother). I must have missed that part of the story, but in reality it really did not matter. Many scenes looked unreasonable and fictitious; types of "funny ideas" of scenes that are overly drugged away to a place where the sense of comedy is lost. The director / producer tried to go "tear jerker" in the end, which would have been convenient if it was worth keeping track of anything that led to that point. Ugh, great disappointment. I see how some people can enjoy this OK, because many people will take any trash to eat, but I would strongly encourage the wait on DVD. It's NOT worth the $ 23,978 how much it takes your family to return to the cinema these days.
