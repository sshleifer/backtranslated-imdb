Now I have turned from curiosity and I had to continue to watch - in the same way you are watching a car accident ... I appreciate the fact that this is a mistake, but it should not be stopped me from criticizing divine directing, acting and dialogue. Seriously, this has been rated as one of the poorest films I've seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from Criptkeeper, and the poor one in it ... Okay - a few reviews (1)) when the doctor had a heart attack against the monster (we never see him attacked by a monster, so we assume his heart attack), then the army launched grenades, missiles, bullets in a monster - that was on the feet of a doctor - yet the doctor was not touched by any projectile and is still alive (2) an army attack of about 100 meters away, and we see that it is beneficial and the flame thrower - God, these things have a range not exceeding 30 meters! (3) when a monster attempts to take a professor, soldiers run into a classroom and shoot at the ceiling; the monster is releasing the child, and the soldiers do not try to shoot at the monster? Come on! (4) The monster looks like something from the Rangers Rangers! (5) there is one scene in which five "good guys" (priest, girl, doctor, reporter and child) look shocked and we get reactions (along the line from hand to mouth) one by one - So natural! (6) General simply flees, time after time (7) General refuses to try electricity and does not want to listen (8) The acting is terrible (9) Did I mention a monster of rubber? (10) this terrible music, non-stop!
