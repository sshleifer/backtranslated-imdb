As a fan of Eric Rohmer's study of contemporary warfare, I was very eager to see "Lady and Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)" how to treat men and women during the real war, the French Revolution. The film looks beautiful, and each scene is designed as a period of painting, such as painting in style. I expected many conversations, such as Rohmer's style. But perhaps Rohmer was restrained by basing scenarios on real female writings, why this was generally felt as a sculpture by Scarlet Pimpernel. Someone admitting that the French aristocrats were spoiled derivatives? I kept singing: "Marat, we are poor, but the poor are poor." You can also select a melody from "Les Miz". I was not as sympathetic as a central figure that has to go back and forth between her city home and rural estate in order to stay ahead of the revolution. At one point, her servant claims that the pantry is empty, but she certainly manages to make a fine repatation. I simply did not understand it, an English sympathizer who alternately refuses and defends his former lover and sponsor as he and the Revolution continue to change their political focus; I think I should sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations, such as the character from "Scarlet Pimpernel". Hey, the only reason she did not return home was her embarrassment after an affair and a child with the Prince of Vales or someone else. Usually in the revolutionary period there are changes in the relations between men and women, but I have not seen them here. Once I went to the lecture of Herbert Marcuse that ended with a long K & A; The last question, from an audience that was much older than the rest of us, who had gray hair, was: "Why are revolutionaries so gloomy?" She was excited and Marcuse did not hesitate to answer that seriously - but that's the only thing I remember all night. Rohmer shows that counterrevolutionaries are also dark and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 8/11/2002)
