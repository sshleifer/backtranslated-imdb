I was very convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: 1) This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen 2) Unless he receives more comments, he will not be on the list of all the worst movies - which deserves to be 3) I was kinda happy - I paid five pounds for it. I saw him at 15 pound stores. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS FILM! You will be very angry 4) There are many movies in the genre of horror that do not have a fair grade (in my opinion) and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminally Summary of the action: a friend without a friend meets a promising ticket to the world - well, the magical ability to appear to everyone else as someone else. Our hero turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on swings, sitting for babies. He kills them one by one until the police find him and finds him. Why is it so bad? To start the acting, VRLO VRLO is bad. Someone compared it with school production. No, this is worse than any acting I've seen on the school scene. I bought some previously prohibited movies from the DVD company vipco and I was not as disappointed as I was This. Okay, acting is bad, but the movie fails to deliver in any other sense. What was the purpose of making this movie when there was no blood! Okay, no worse. What else can film like this offer? Breats? No, not even titration! It is true that this movie can have a certain charm in its unique nature, but any potential buyer / viewer of this film should be quite careful that this film, at best, is valid only one in ten.
