By the middle of the film, my eyes began to hurt, and I almost fell out of the chair with uncontrolled laughter. as always). Who the hell brings people with a bad pony tail in anyway? It is always written in completely incredible love interests with women for at least 20 years. All supporting actors look like they were filmed in the dark - btv, did they record this film in the dark with only a light for lighting? This is really disgusting in every possible way. Invite all your friends and make a social event - this is really special.
