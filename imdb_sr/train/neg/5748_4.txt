I must say that I hated this movie. I do not like to say that because Gerard Butler is in it. About half an hour of boring conversation, apologize to everyone who really worried about the plot, I began to quickly switch to Gerri's scene. I really do not know the end, I was so boring. If Gerri was not in it, I probably did one of two things: I fell asleep or went out, but Gerri is the bright light of this movie, as with most of his earlier films. If you are a fan of Gerrie, do not worry, he is wonderful and precious as always, but if you really want to watch a movie for a plot, good luck, because you will need it, or that or a lot of coffee or soda to keep you awake! 4/10 ... and that's just because the acting director made sense to put Gerri in this movie, even though they had no idea how to write his name!
