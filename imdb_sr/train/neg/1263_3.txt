There is nothing like watching huge robots struggling for a desert desert, and Robotic wars are delivered. Of course, the acting is bad, the dialogue is a sub-pair, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has huge robots! The very special effects themselves are actually pretty good for that period. They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but they contain a minimum of computer graphics and instead use miniatures so that it has grown pretty well. His shortcomings are easily overlooked, since films are of short duration, and have some humor in the parts that make him pretty comfortable. I would recommend this to any fan of huge robots or cheesy science fiction films looking for a carefree watch of interference.
