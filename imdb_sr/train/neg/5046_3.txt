The lethargic direction destroys the otherwise tempting story from the period in which the miraculous Zhang Ziii appears, in the excellent role of the woman joining the extremist group in 1928 in China, just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and reunited with her former lover who is now working for Japan . Every piece of drama and movement for the story is dried by the director's style of director Ie Lou. The characters stand and look at each other for a long time, without saying anything, handheld cameras are held forever on faces that show endless reactions longer than necessary, editing repeats the same reaction is a triple redundancy. We do not know anything about the characters because the story starts and gets little new information as the story progresses, only silence and static images of lovers who do not speak, who through interaction through a quiet dance do not share obvious emotional intimacy. A film that causes sleep.
