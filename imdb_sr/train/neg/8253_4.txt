The film had a sweet opening, I really believed that I was in one of the best romantic comedies I had seen for some time ... there was something particularly "strange" about the way the film was set, real but somewhat abstract and mystical. But then the story began to become increasingly unrealistic. To say that the ending was CORNI and PREDIKTABLE would almost be underestimating ... The most typical romantic ending in which everything goes great for every 'cute' character. A scene in which the main character realizes that he made a mistake and searches for "the wife of his dreams" only to admit his love for her in front of a lovely audience. Come on. In the end, good guys win, 'bad guys' ... ... you get a picture. WASTE of a potentially interesting movie.
