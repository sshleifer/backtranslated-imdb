This week I thought it would be fun to make up for Corey Haim, only last week, and I've seen it all two of "Lost Bois". It's not that I'm a fan-boy-not far away-but I loved those two Corsis in some movies in the early teens days. So, I prepared for the three films I was playing. Unfortunately, I chose the "Dream Machine" as the first (I had never seen it before), and it was so horribly terrible, I decided to lock Corei back into my closet and let him get rid of it first before I started something else . But first I managed to break through this film. I had the impression that he desperately wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's Dai Off" (1986), but was caught in his delusions. Virtually the whole movie wants to be a comedy, and endlessly trying to be a thriller. The only good thing about the "Dream Machine" is the premise: a dead body in the boot of a Porsche. Everything else fails so badly, that's embarrassing. Even the most for Haima. I can dig it out as a young, enthusiastic self, but at least when it comes with some kind of directional guidelines. This was obviously not the case in the "Dream Machine". So, we have the perfect car, yes, that black Porsche. Haim's the perfect girl? Just a blonde who has barely any rows in the movie. Perfect killing ... almost? Some guy who falls on his ass as the villain of the film, trying to entire movie steal the body from the trunk, never fails, and then at the end of the movie thinks Michael Miers (minus white William) Shatner mask) and errors Core Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis . Do not think they could make this movie if they try. A stupid, infertile film with a story that leads to nowhere in the direction of a director who does not know how to direct his actor. Great accomplishment! Another last question for Mr. Haim: Who had the idea to smile straight in the camera in that last frame of the movie? Your or director? So it's not done.
