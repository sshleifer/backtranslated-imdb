Hmmm ... where to start? How did a serious actress like Demi Moore get involved in such a shit? "The First Blood" could be rated as a bull *** but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with tits, a point. Of course, if you are interested in shit (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of NAVI Seals), which is the dumbest clich√©s I can think of, you will say that "GI Jane" is a great movie. Only Vigga Mortensen's performance made this film bearable, but hell, I can not imagine Demi Moore Rambo (especially not for the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve credit for making this film for women with equal rights, it's just a headline propaganda for the US military and to make it more attractive, it was thrown over by Moore. Avful movie.
