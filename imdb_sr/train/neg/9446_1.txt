An absolutely terrible adaptation of a wonderful book for children. Cruel and inappropriate humor, some terrifying parts and a painful side of a story about a mother who wants to send a boy to a military school to get him out of the way makes this completely inappropriate for children who will probably want to see her because of books (3-8). Do not spend your money, your time or your good judgment.
