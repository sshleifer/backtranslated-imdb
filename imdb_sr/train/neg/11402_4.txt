Exactly what you would expect from B-film. Derivative, free nudity, boring in parts, funny mountains and sirens special effects. Of course, it could have been better, better behaved (definitely) better written, directed, etc. But then I do not think it would be a B film. The actors were pretty sucked, in fact, this pretty much looked like an episode of a vampire killer or something, except with lots of blood, swearing and nudity. She is the absolute queen of screaming the new millennium. It's not that the acting really matters in these films, but it was better than any other actor. She is also warm, in that plastic dress that she wore for the entire movie - wow! Her back is absolutely stunning in that outfit, I think every time she turns, she can help but check her. And close to the end of the film, the viewer was rewarded by watching completely non-existent. So if your free b-movie is horror lipstick (like me), check out this. If not, you should avoid at all costs.
