Desperately I want to give this film 10 ... really. Some movies, especially horror films are so budgetary that they are good. A wise-burst ninja scarecrow who can apply corn pistols as a deadly weapon ... definitely fits into this "brilliant budget" system. The film's depth is definitely its strong side, and the contours and turns are applied, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, really driving the dreaded ... ninja ... puberty ... students 30 years ago ... non-cowboy drawing ... wise shooting ... terrible scarecrow in the spotlight as the creepiest icon of the horror of the year. All I can say is 'Can you dig it out' and recommend watching movies such as Frankenfish if you enjoy such a horrible horror.
