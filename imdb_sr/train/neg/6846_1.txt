I'm a big fan of karishme Kapoor and Govinda. I watched this movie after I saw Fizz, which was absolutely brilliant. There are movies that are bad, and there are also movies that are cr * p. but this movie just takes a cookie. We were so disturbed that we were cheated by paying our money expecting a decent movie. that. 1/10
