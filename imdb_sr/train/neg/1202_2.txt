The dog in the local kennel is mating with Satan and has a litter of puppies, one of which is given to a family who just lost their previous dog to a blow. Puppy does not want to make time like Donald Trump and fired a Mexican housewife as she is solemn. Only the father doubts that this dog is more than it appears, the rest of the family loves the demonic dog. So, it's daddy to say the day. This late 70s made for film horoscope on TV has little to do but for the wrong feeling of nostalgia. When I saw it as a kid, I discovered that it was a tense nail-bitter, but to look at it again as an adult, I now realize that it's just lame, boring, and that it did not do a good job. <br /> <Mi Grade: D
