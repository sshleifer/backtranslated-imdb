My objections concern the tempo of film and material that is at hand. While the use of archival film and script gives the film a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the material selected for highlighting is not very interesting (for example, when Goebbels complains about this or that illness, or, for example, a bitter German hometown). Also, the film crawls along c. 1920-1939, and then goes through the war years. All in all, the movie is a bit better than the Channel History documentary, with the filmmaker having somewhat greater sensitivity than the average documentary Channel Histories, and in that way it can more thoroughly regulate the details of Goebbels' life. Still, I found that he wanted to.
