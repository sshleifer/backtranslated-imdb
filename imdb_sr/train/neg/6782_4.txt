This was not one of Keaton's best efforts, this may have been a covert attempt to revenge the family he married - Talmadge. The barrier in Polish / English and a series of coincidences lead Buster to marriage with a great Irish woman who treats him (together with his father and brothers) herself until they think that he can be the heir of wealth. Wrong identities abound - gags are set, but for the main ones they are not worth it. This metro short has at least two real laughs - Buster cleverly turns his lack of dinner using the wall calendar and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring meat into his plate. The second is a family photo, while the whole group slowly descends to the floor while the tripod of the camera loses stability. Overdose of yeast beer could be a catalyst for a massive gaga series on gags, but it stops short (for all the accumulated) development. The Kino print is clear and clear, and the result is one for piano players, drums and sound effects. Not one of Buster's best efforts, but worth a few laughs.
