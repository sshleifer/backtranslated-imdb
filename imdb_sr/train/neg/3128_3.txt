... from this terrible film! There are so many things in this movie, acting, writing, direction, editing, etc. It is incredible that something rises to the top and proves itself to be absolutely the worst. Music! I noticed that the film contains two composers. This must be the reason why every frame has music, from the absolute worst "D" movie. They have never heard of the term "less is more." It's so painful to listen, I silenced the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was so good. You must be sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they have not seen these roles in the twilight of their careers. You see it at your own risk.
