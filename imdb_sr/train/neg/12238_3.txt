The concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together, but ... Rudolph's brilliant nose did not demand the "explanation" offered in this movie - much like Force in movies from "Star Wars" did not need an explanation of "Mechanochlorins in the bloodstream". But mostly, the film left me cold because of Winterbottom's excessive complication to destroy Santa. He has the power to make suggestions in people's minds, so why does he do things in such a way? Breaking the magic of Rudolf's nose, framing Rudolf, threatening to dissolve the Frost family ... A comical exaggerated complication of Pinki and Brain and "Phineas and Ferb's" Dr. it seems simple and simple compared to the Winterbots, which are expected to take seriously. There is a particularly (and fun) strange moment when a character throws his two pistols on a bad guy, like a bumerians. I understand if they do not want to kill a weapon in a family movie, but why do they have weapons at all?
