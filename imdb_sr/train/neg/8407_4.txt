From the stupid "weird African natives" of travel videos with our poorly-established principles that act as narrators, to the terrible false ears that turn obedient Indian elephants into African elephants to the complete lack of any logic, to the constant Maureen O'Sullivan blaming "Tarzan! Tarzan! ! ", there's nothing about this movie that deserves a classic status. 4/10
