First, before further reading, you have to understand that I am not a neo-Nazis, I'm just trying to correctly figure out Hitler to make sure that no one like him can take power again. I saw this and found it horrible. I mean, OK, it's interesting to look at, but is it real? I asked for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler was not angry all his life, the show shows angry Hitler, even when he is a child. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact, it was very likely that Hitler was in fact gay and that he fought all his life to suppress this secret. Third, people will hate me, but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to come to power if he was so cold and ugly? Because he was charming. It is a common point that I found in interviews with people who live close to or far from it (of course, not Jews). ugly, and of course, not charming, you're mistaken. If you think you will allow people like him to take power in countries and you do not want it. If you really understand that Hitler has managed to come to power and stop thinking that he is just horrifying, you will be able to find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember that he was selected) and stop the topic before it is too late. Life is important for protection, this series is just terrible to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler as such, the other will unfold exactly the way he did it first.
