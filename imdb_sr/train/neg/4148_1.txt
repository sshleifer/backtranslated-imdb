I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I was getting into. I started the film and soon I was drawn into the world of pain and visual torture. Finally I know what hell is. It's this movie. For eternity. This movie has no value. He did not even have a plot. There was something in every scene, but there was no explanation as to why something was happening. be able to. You will see that the outcome is much more pleasant than this movie. Do not even look it. I can not even see how bad it is. I beg you. If you look at it, then it means they have won.
