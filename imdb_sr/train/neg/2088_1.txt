What a terrible play. Fans of science fiction fans are looking at anything more, regardless of quality. It shocked me that something special like Firefly lasts for a season, while garbage such as overhauling the Battlestar Galaxy triggers a spin. This spin off is poor in every aspect of the show. The acting is underage and uninspired. The characters are cardboard clich√©s of everything that has ever been in the bad Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than the soap opera in the hitting period. The direction is bad and the sets are terrible. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is one spin off that should never have been made.
