Well, what can I say? GOLDEN CHILDREN belongs to the category "so bad, it's good". Eddie Murphi has some funny (and sometimes quite boring lines), but you still have fun. Chales Dance was never worse than his role as the badger Sardo Numsp (what is the name)? Who needs to watch GOLDEN CHILDREN ... hm ... it's hard to say, but my best opinion is people who love unfriendly movies and can be entertained by bad acting, bad complication and even more unpleasant dialogue. 4 of 10
