Unless you have between 10 and 14 years (except for R rating), there are very few things to love. One or two orders from Ken Thompson, David Koechner (we should see him more) and Jackson himself are funny, and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can think about her environment, but unfortunately, that's it. Poor plot. Bad acting. Even better writing and delivery. Special effects are sad. As long as the whole situation is a strange and terrible joke, significant individual embedded situations are equally terrible. If we take into account the action parts, there are incredible action sequences in some of the movies that make you funny and there are some who cheer you up. This film contains only this other type. This leaves a little left. I'm so glad I did not pay for it. In spite of any hyperposition, I can read and think, so as I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but I was a little worried about going in. However, like a wreck of a train, you can not just look around. Even without expectations, I am disappointed. Bad. Not even "so bad, it's good" material. I am very tolerant of bad films, but it does "Sik String Samurai" (which I liked) Oscara decent. No, this piece of over CGI's garbage is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. As this is currently rated 7.2, it completely mystifies me. Brainwashing or somehow matching the voting system is all I can imagine as answers. I could continue to continue, but enough to say that I was witnessing a train wreck tonight. I need to wash my eyes. 1 of 10
