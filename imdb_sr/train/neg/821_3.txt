Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things: action and excitement. DOMINO PRINCIPE presents Gene Hackman as a prisoner who came out of prison to perform some mysterious task. Richard Vidmark, Edward Albert and Eli Vallach are his operatives - they are supposed to work for the government, but that, like most movie actions, is never clear. Hackman asks a lot of questions that you NEVER receive an answer, so the movie absolutely does not go anywhere. While trying to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAKS VIEV, DOMINO PRINCIP mixes ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The movie is extremely well photographed, but even against it. Kramer direction is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie! The acting is fine with Hackman, which proves to be rather incapable of being bad. Vidmark and Vallach are appropriately nasty, and Albert is well-thrown away as Vidmark's cruel lacquer. Even the usual disgusting Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's assistant. However, one strange fact is that Kandis Bergen was thrown like Hackman's wife. We were told that she ended up in jail and seems to be trying to insert some sort of southern strand. Kramer's idea of ​​a garbage trash in her trailer is that she wears a nasty brown wig. This role is more convenient for those like Valerie Perrine or Susan Tirell.
