I would not call it terrible, but nothing in this movie does not shine, and it is burdened with some seriously incredible basic plan. It started well, but when the main hit is done, it is transmitted into a long background around a young girl who is not tempting, and some action scenes that are an absurd theater are unrealistic. For example, at the aerodrome there was an extended shootout in which the lighting was stroboscopic. There's no explanation for that. How credible is the space for airport storage to have flashing and reflection lights, enough to make Snipes's incredible escape? This is one of the few action scenes that are interrupted by meaninglessly set up settings that simply fail to attract a ban on belief. shoot this place, but get out by telling the British "national security". This trick relies on a stereotype that is far from reality to be satisfactory. There are many better action movies there. Better formulated, better executed. This is sometimes fun, but there is not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes quite boring - something that should never have happened in a good action movie.
