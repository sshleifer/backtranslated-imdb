*** spoilers *** spoilers *** spoilers *** spoilers There are bad movies, and there are also movies that are so horrible to become a kind comic in their incompetence. This is the case with Columbia Pictures 'The Grudge'. This film jealousy began when a well-intentioned American saw a Japanese made for the Ju-on TV film and inspired to process the film in English. This began with a real tsunami of bad decisions that sailed the globe until it collapsed in Orlando on October 21, 2004. The premise, and I use the word loose, includes a house in Tokyo that is haunted by the Thin Mummy Spirit that looks like the cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with his terrible helper, bushy, unconcerned or evil in another class. Is there anything more horrible than a furious 8-year-old Japanese? Of course it exists! Count Chocula comes to my mind. With this humorous crowd, we have to add a mysterious black cat that I gently called Chim Chim. (Remember the Speed ​​Racer?) As you have already assumed, they have been killed in this locality and now they want to kill anyone entering the premises. You see, as the Japanese detective explained, when someone dies in his anger, their spirit seeks revenge on anyone who enters the property line designated by a district commissioner or something like that, I forget. The story begins innocent enough with the famous actor Bill Pullman who jumped to his death from the balcony. My assumption is that Bill Pullman got this job because his children prayed for a trip to Disneyland in Tokyo. Then we endure a mildly interesting story about the medical nurse Ioko, 'do not go there' screaming the crowd, but unfortunately, she does not care about the terrible warnings and is predictably suppressed as a magic lamp. About 30 minutes in the movie we finally see her American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sara Michelle Gellar could have been a competent actress, but I could not think of Buffa the killer of a vampire, so much that she was distracted. It's the same as Jennifer Anniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York City. Try as you can, you can not stop thinking about another project that made it famous. But, I step down, Karen, the nurse is working as a replacement for the original provider who disappeared in us. She sniffs around, meets the ghosts, the coma lady dies, and some other things are happening. Looking at the lean hair in search of traces, I half expected to find the ghost and take off the mask to discover that it was actually an old man Gover who owned an abandoned amusement park! "And I would pull out with him and that there was no concern for you and your dog!" Director Takashi Shimizu, who competes to be Ed Vood from Asia, has made two unfortunate decisions about sound. First, he chose to use the sound pad only when someone was killed. This is a great idea to wipe out any uncertainties because the audience gets a two-minute warning to prepare for another miserable, predictable murder. Second, the ghosts gave a bizarre throaty sound that sounds like a hill. After the film, I heard several people who came out of the theater making a sound and a laugh. Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up as the only survivor. And of course, we learned that the fire that set fire to the house went off in time for the mandatory next chapter. However, given the audience's humorous reactions, they did not want to continue, but apologize. 'Grudge' can easily be rearranged into a comedy, maybe it will then be appreciated for the value of the camp. It will happen as the biggest movie thriller of Godzilla vs. Megalone. I suggest you wait until the movie comes to your local discount theater, where it can receive publicly laundered so richly deserving.
