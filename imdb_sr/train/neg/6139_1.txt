Thanks G_d that it was bombarded, or we could treat us as "Skate Fu" where we can see Brian Boitano running a triple lutz and cutting bad guys on tape with his sharp skates, but I step down. One thing that could help this party would be a little T & A from Ms. Agbaiani. The world would not see anything new (at least that part of the world that saw Plaiboi spread). I honestly believe that pornography would better suit her "talents," although Aubrei Hepburn could not stay on the sink of this sewage. One explanation for the presence of Kurt Thomas could be a traumatic brain injury, and it may often be too frequent to appear. It is good that the IOC was not so diligent for doping as it is right now, or Kurt would certainly be deprived of his medals. Should be avoided at all costs.
