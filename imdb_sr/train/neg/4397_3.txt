One of my friends lent me this game, and it's too hard! It has the look of a game for kids, but you have to learn how to make many tricks that require you to turn and turn your hands in all kinds of disadvantaged positions, and you have to search for seemingly endless levels for 100 notes, improve your 'score'! You also have to find these incredibly hidden pieces of the puzzle, which require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! I AM THAT DO YOU THREE !!!!! Perhaps, if you do not have a life, you can stay at home all the time, you may get something from it, but otherwise hold on! AND DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN - I LEARN TO HAIR IN SATURDAY!
