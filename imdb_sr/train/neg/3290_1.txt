This film is sucked! They took something from my childhood, and raped him in the cottage! This film was so bad that I wanted to go home and hold my "Dukes" DVDs and cry in the corner. The actor was terrible! They were not "The Dukes", but Stiffler and Jackass who drove the car. When is boss Hogg evil? When was Rosco a hard guy? They never did! Chief Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When was Jesse smoking a pot? It's never been! Do not misunderstand me, I am very liberal and there is nothing wrong with a small chip, but there was no place in this movie! The only thing that was good in this movie were trailers before the movie and final credits. It was a waste of time and air. Avoid at any cost !!!!!!!!
