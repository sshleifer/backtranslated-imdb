One hour, eight minutes, and twelve seconds in this movie, and I decided it was pretty scary. That was immediately after Hopbalong (Chris Libbert) fell on a horse from a tree to join a good guy. I was pretty confused with the entire Hopalong Cassidi / Great Bar 20 trick that did not turn into anything at all. Apparently, the name Coppola in credits can not guarantee anything here, even with more than one. If you reach the end of the movie, you'll probably end up. asking myself the same questions as me. What exactly was the hook with gloves? What about the rodeo script? Who was the Alien supposed to represent? Why did they film this movie? I could probably continue, but my energy is exhausted. You see, there is already Western called "The Gunfighter" of 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. By looking at it, you will feel as if you are looking at how this feels bad. I can recommend it.
