First I must admit that Batman: The Animated Series is the best batman series. We watched him when it was on TV. I did not know that there was a fourth season. Actually it was not. BTAS ends season 3, and it was supposed to stop there. Why did they have to cope with good things. Catwoman and Poison ivi now have terrible gray faces. Joker looks scary, it seems that every time he revises his look it looks more and more. It seems that there are no more students, and now it does not even look like a human being (although it is). Bruce Vaine has expressed Kevin Conroy making the best batman. Although now he looks like a superman. There is nothing to separate it because they both look the same, Bruce Vaine now has blue eyes. Night Ving really needs a haircut, please! Alfred only has pupils from his eyes, looks more like a character from the '80s. I watched three episodes from disc 1 in the series and I've already discovered that this version is more violent and graphic (there is blood in each episode.) If you are a fan of Batman : animated series, no batman season 4. They only included this series as the 4th season for market sales. If they were just released as Nev Batman Adventures, I do not think many people would have bought them. <BR> Save disappointment and hold season 1-3.
