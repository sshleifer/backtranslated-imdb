'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Getraumte Sunden', is a fight to pass, even for a lean 76 minutes; more than this terribly boring and pretentious euro of horror, and maybe I got into a coma. crews from the head to hallucinogenic class A, since no second of this mess made any sense. Apparently, this is one of the better of his 180+ movies? It's hard to believe that he has worse effort. The inviolable action deals with Frank's usual topics of sex, violence and lesbianism and throws a little S & M for good measure, yet it manages to keep the mind numbingly boring. I can leave it a lot of time before I go into the world of dodging Euro Horror again ?? life is too short to be spent watching this kind of mushroom.
