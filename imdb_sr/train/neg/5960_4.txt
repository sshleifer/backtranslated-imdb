My friends and I rented it for "Bad Movie Night" with great hopes, but The Brain was something that disappointed us. The brain itself is magnificently silly, but mostly located on its small platform. Who thought it would be cool for the brain to get only three people during 94 hours extracted? This movie has a lot of things to try out at the start, including Estevez's actor who acted rebellious genius (we are told that his huge intellect is misguided in his elaborate jokes and school acrobatics, which include placing cream creams on someone's chair). It also has some great lines, hilarious van-of-form and out-of-dah henchman that barely thrives everywhere, and, Ih, some chick gets naked. However, the director desperately needs some education in the art of pacing. During the last half of the stuff, they begin to drag and drop, with at least 3 or 4 meaningless, boring scenes of the trail that make up the middle third of the plot. Scenes within the PRI complex are particularly bad. At least 15 minutes of this film are people running up and down the same staircase. I could fix a scenario on this thing for half an hour more cheese, more up, more nudity, more action Brain. If you're going to make a bad horor movie, at least give me something cool to watch while my superego goes out. Perhaps the director was trying to bring the audience into his film - I began to feel like one of the zombie residents to the end of this crapfest.
