I've seen other Guinea pig movies, such as Mermaid at Manhole & On Never Dies, and while they're pretty sick, at least they have little sense of humor (no matter how dark they are). However, the Devil's experiment is nothing more than recording a bunch of punkers who commit many methods of torture and violence to a young girl, and there are no conspiracies and no redeeming values. It's not scary, except perhaps thinking, but it's definitely disgusting and I would not call it fun. Now, I am not a model of good taste in movies and I love my trash and hangover, but this was too much for me, really. I'm for harassment, I'm actually looking for things that are disturbing whenever possible, but that's a bit. The young woman was beaten, beaten, was subjected to constant noise over the headphones until she dropped off, then she was looted with raw meat and intrusions and left to hang in a chamber somewhere in the woods. If you think it sounds great, go to it, but it certainly rejected me from watching more things from guinea pigs. 1 out of 10, absolutely tedious.
