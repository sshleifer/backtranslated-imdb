Terrible, terrible, terrible. Relaxed remark at the beginning and a few nasty autopsy photos are not a good movie. I am once again amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving film production, yet they have no pride to realize that what made a complete bunch of shit. I sat and tried to think about the redeemable feature, so I could at least balance my criticism, but the only one I could think of was that opening the song from Pink was pretty good .... I wonder did she see it? Beware of your danger, so far it can kill you.
