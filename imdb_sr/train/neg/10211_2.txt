Except that I admit a good cinema, I can hardly say something positive about this movie. The only real problem is the dilemma of the protagonists to stay with their childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take their own lives. Rich "emotionally powerful" scenes do not go along with this action and, due to their bad acting, they fail to create the desired atmosphere. The director only succeeds in introducing Anthony's dilemma and ultimately brings an easy solution. It seems that characters do not evolve, although it's difficult to talk about any characters ... maybe except Sonny. In addition to him, actors do not play much and when some of them have to, they are discharged as complacent amateurs. I wonder what destroyed the movie: a superficial script, rejecting all the potential of plot, or a bad acting, disturbing any complaint that could be left.
