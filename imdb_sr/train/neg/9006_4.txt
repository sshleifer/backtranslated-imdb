Once I ignored some of the incredible, this was actually a pretty decent movie about the horror / monster. First, I will give you some good things: - The dragon was quite convincing, especially as she went through tunnels looking for lunch (a hint: she likes people). - the action was quite uninterrupted, and after a start, I was quite absorbed in the story. - I'm sorry to say, I was somehow a root for a dragon - she was probably the most convincing and most consistent character in the movie. you hunted a fire dragon in 1100 of our era, would you fill it in his cave with gunpowder under your arm? Ghost. - a female figure with an all-American name, a blond hair and an obvious Slovenian accent, trying to turn out to be Spanish? Huh? - a leading scientist whose Slovenian accents can be cut with a knife, and he was allegedly born in Chicago, educated in the United States? - a military helicopter pilot who makes his own repairs, flying a huge transport helicopter without any other crew, and whether a professional shooter and a fighter soldier are dumped? OK. Uh huh. I will not even mention his giving 3 different callers in 2 minutes while communicating with his base. It's even better than some Japanese monsters from the 60's, but not much. If we are lucky, we will not see the Dragon Fighter 2, although, of course, the end has left this opportunity wide open. Or, perhaps, next time, he will employ the right director. In spite of everything, I gave this film 4 out of 10. Add 2 more if they re-write the action, and Dean Cain gets it. Eat in the first ten minutes. <grin>
