Oh my God. The idea that this movie thriller is an absolute joke to me. in addition to what he seems to have written a five-year-old. plot, acting, and even requisition and filming of this film were without shame. I'm usually not so critical to any movie, because every person has his own style. However, this film was probably the worst film I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe that this film is unknown, and I think it should remain this way, because such films make a humorous genre. /> I recommend to everyone who are fan thriller movies, or even movies that are far from this.
