Lame plot and two-dimensional scripts made the characters look like a cut-out card. Needless to say, this made it harder to feel empathy for any of the characters, especially the fiancé; He looked and acted more like a cartoon. In short, I guess it could be said that this was in keeping with your typical television drama. Uses almost every cliché in the book. A tortured classical musician who wants to break through and play salsa. A free witty fiancé is engaged on a person with a "bean-counter" that he does not like. I will not enumerate them, otherwise it would be a spoiler, because I would give the entire plot. The dance was fine, but nothing special. I saw it upstairs. 3 stars for good music. The band was very tense. I saw it on iouTube. Fortunately, I did not pay good money to see him in the theater. I'm still a little shocked how great reviews this film is awarded.
