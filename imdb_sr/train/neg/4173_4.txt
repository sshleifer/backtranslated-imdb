I have to say when I saw a trailer I was excited. Futurist soldiers, getting on the bad ass Vampire led by genre veteran Michael Ironside .... In the universe. I mean, I did not expect high art, but it looked like a potential B movie classic. It was without a doubt a TV pilot, who was later rearranged into the feature film after he was not picked up. I will start with movies of several good points, the action was competent for a film with a lower budget, and the CGI and the used locations were passable. Now for the bad, first on Michael Ironside he was barren in this, and his performance here .... he was well cheesy not in a good way. But as I said, he was not in any way anyway, so I can not blame him. One thing that was really stupid was the PETA type group for the Vampire, I'm not kidding, it's the stupidest and most unbelievable thing I've seen at the same time, and this is taken seriously. Also this film is one of the main sins of B film, teasing the lesbian scene and not delivering. Most of all, this film is pervading nothing. Since it was supposed to be a pilot, the script almost does not exist and there is no regular ending. Even the main villains are only coming to an end. If ever a movie is needed to raise Sleaze and the above factor, it's the Vampire Wars. In the end I will tell the main crew on the spacecraft, they were all very capable actors and they could very well put this mess behind, and move on to bigger and better things. They just have nothing to do here.
