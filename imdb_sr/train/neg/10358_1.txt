I read the entire book 'Bor in Time' and then I saw a movie. The film contained all the elements in the book, but since the book had 190 pages, and the movie was 2 hours, it felt really full of effects and bad acting. Boring in time is around a girl named Meg, Charles Vallace and Calvin must team up to find Meg's father and leave the Camazotz Island. The start of the movie is really a stink. The acting is terrible, the direction is ridiculous, and so far the situation is not necessary. I was really crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle who wrote the book and made a movie, made a great book and a horrible movie. The acting is worse than any act of shooting. Yes, I must admit that there was a cool effect. But, seriously, everyone did it terribly, not serial in any way. If you read the book, the film will break you. I would like to give him 0, but unfortunately, I can only give him 1. Half could be useful.
