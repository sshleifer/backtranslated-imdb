A guy walking without a motive ... I'll never get those two hours of my life. The guy continued to take over identities and cheating on his pregnant wife. What did I mean? How was it anywhere? I realized that he loved his father, but in addition, the film was completely meaningless. What was the purpose of so much walking and going to the funeral of the stranger without obvious reason. How did this enrich his life? Why did we have to see the dying old lady on the underwear? Why ??? !!!! I think it would be deep or something more interesting. I do not recommend that the movie go to sleep while sleeping ...
