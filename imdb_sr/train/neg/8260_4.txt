First of all, I would like to emphasize that, although I am not an expert, the way in which the trial takes place will insult your intelligence. First, the prosecution has never proved that "facilitated learning" actually works. Irresponsible to the prosecution (because he can get an appeal) and defense because he has not acted on this issue. As another commentator said, ease of learning proved untrue. Second, they used Terri as an interpreter who has a personal interest, and will even testify at a trial that is just stupid. If the court allowed him to testify in this way, they would bring someone neutral, otherwise they would only seek a complaint. Thirdly, this child was never specifically asked about the defendant (stains, details of events, etc.), and even when specific defense questions were asked, as it began, he could not answer. If that is not a reasonable doubt, I do not know what it is, and a competent lawyer would get a acquittal. At the very end, it starts well with the pressure to be a child's parent autism, but the trial makes this movie absolutely incredible.
