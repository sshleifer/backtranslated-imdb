I found this movie annoying to watch. I felt as though I pushed the story down my throat as if I could not handle the subtlety that I needed to keep on saying it all the time. alcoholics, I did not really feel it was a film about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, real alcoholics are very lonely people, in my opinion. It's hard for them to communicate, something that the main character did not have any problems, except that he had the problem to say that I loved you at one point - which was a small effort to establish his cool character. And he was constantly surrounded by people !? I felt fooled that at no time we were not alone with the character in order to really gain the sense of his inner loneliness and unrest. I could not connect with the image and I did not even feel the connection with my father. I never felt anything when I finished, only relief was over. Kevin McKidd is a good actor, but not a strong figure! The magic orange thing was subtle like a brick. McKidd was too old for teenagers, they should have three different characters or avoid a teenage stage and concentrate more on an adult McKidda. at the beginning of the movie !!
