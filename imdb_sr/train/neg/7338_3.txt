I watched this movie, hoping to find a funny and interesting story, but the story was not good at all. Actors' play was no better. Of course, Shahrukh Khan was there, but he was not enough to make this film "credible" and interesting. You have read that this film is based on Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovari," but I did not see for myself that it coincided with the Indian mentality. good weather, not wasting time and changing our mood in the mountains. I just can not understand how he could get such a "high" vote with an average of 6.8 / 10 in that! You'll only waste your time, unless you love a "dark movie" with a "weird and unconscious story".
