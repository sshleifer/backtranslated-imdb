One could wish that the idea is good as the "invisible man" works better and be more careful in the time-boggling special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters and, finally, the last 20 minutes of the film are fresh as a crazy scientist from the early 50's. There are some great moments, mainly because of incredible special effects and the very idea of ​​an invisible man lurking in the streets. But, unfortunately, we will soon return to the cramped detention of an underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but also schematic. There have been many processing of old films. movies or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But for every film becomes more and more clear that the idea of ​​putting classical classics under his nose passionate madman like Verhoeven (which has its moments) very bad. It is obvious that money is the key issue here: the time and energy in the scenario are not nearly enough, and as a result, "Holl 's Man" is seriously undermined by clichés, sarcastic characters, predictability and lack any depth. . However, one thing that really impressed me, besides special effects, was swearing. When making this kind of film, modern producers are very interested in letting children see them. Therefore, the language (and, sometimes, violence and sex) is greatly reduced. When the whole world explodes, good guys go "Oh darn!" and "Oh my God." "Hollman Man" with gratitude rejects such a type of hypocrisy and characters are free to say what is most natural to them. I'm not saying that is the most natural response to something that went wrong to swear - but it seems more plausible if someone actually swear by. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
