"Paula, maybe I'm a bitch, but I'll never be a butch!" The chiral line in an otherwise rather tedious move of the skin that contains pretty honey in Stacey Valker, but that's all. This girl is a real dude who lures her guys, associates, and even her lesbian Paul to her bedroom, but then turns into a mess that cries "rape" and invites the police! The schizophrenic personality of this certified c ** t is interesting perhaps a bit, but this story eventually turns into a true repetitive affair. At least the ending is worth the wait, for those who will continue to worry.
