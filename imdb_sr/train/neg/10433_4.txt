The battle scenes were great. They loved old and new cyclones and painted those on their side. It was the end I hated. I was disappointed that it was a country, but 150 years ago. But to travel so we start again? Are you kidding on my account? 38k people who have fought for their existence and when they arrive in paradise, leave technology? No way. They must have been eating paper and feeding food, but that's over. They can live again as humans. They have only one good doctor. What will they do when someone has pain in their teeth? Nobody would have made such a choice.
