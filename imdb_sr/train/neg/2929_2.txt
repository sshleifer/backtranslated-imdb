It's not funny - how can someone connect with Monty Python? It's absolutely funny - there is no laugh. This is not funny. Over the top, but ugly, strange just because of a strange sake, and it seems to me that these people were always on something. Unfortunately, something that did not make them funny. It should give him some points for the effort, etc. In fact, it seems to be a ridiculous path - or is it? Hummm .... Because you can barely make a laugh, this is a controversial issue. Perhaps this is what I do wrong - maybe it's some kind of exercise. Some kind of art - in that case everything goes, it does not matter. But these guys play women with high voices, turned nose. Come on !!! Not funny. There is only one successor to the intelligent Monty Pithons, which is Stephen Colbert, and perhaps Jon Stevart.
