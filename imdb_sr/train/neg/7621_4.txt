As already mentioned, this formula has been recorded several times, recently as "You Have Mail" with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Rian. Of the few versions, this is the least favorite. I think the problem is that the studio has stopped on charisma of Stars, which is unsuccessful here. In this film chemistry between the two guides never comes to boiling. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of old donuts, nice, but gentle. And when traces are boring, the rest of the film can be tracked. Judy is particularly disappointing. Looks like there's no neck! I do not know if she had a pain problem or something else, but she looks like a turtle trying to pull her head into her shell, all worn and everything. I could not figure out why Van Johnson was so warm. I'd make a line of bees for that sweet violinist. Van was not great either. I always considered him a generic Hollywood leader and he does nothing to dispel that image. If you are a lover of the stars or early 1900s then you may want this movie to like you. But there are many more fun romantic comedies, and they offer you much more than snoozing styles.
