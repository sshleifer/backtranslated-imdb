Of the three Jess Franco titles to find their way on the official list of DPP Video Nasti (Devil Hunter, Bloodi Moon and Vomen Behind Bars), this may be the least credit for fame, because the terribly boring jungle scream is revived very little small, insecure, rape, and a bunch of nudity. Beautiful blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays film star Lauru Cravford who was abducted by a gang of merciless hijackers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a wild tribe that worships the "god of hell" lurking in the jungle (big, naked, bulging natives who like to eat hearts of feminine sacrifices). Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $ 6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Veston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnamese pilot veteran travel to the island, but they encounter problems when bad guys try to cross twice . During the confusion, Laura escaped into the jungle, but ran straight into the hands of the island's inhabitants, who offered it to her god. Franco directs in his usual style and burdens this funny effort of his usual horrible brand: bullshit, rude cinema, quick zoom, numerous grooving clips, focus pictures, terrible sound effects and editing with fists. The result is a terrible confusion that is a real struggle to begin from the beginning to the end (I needed a couple of sessions to finish the thing) and even the view of the gorgeous Buchfellner in my natural glory is not enough to make me look at this movie again.
