This was a waste of 75 minutes of my life. The acting was terrible and the plot was ridiculous. She turns around an evil lesbian woman who richly marries men to have sex with her, and then blackmails them for money. One of the victims is a candidate for a prosecutor, which causes problems in his relationship with his wife. The other is a plastic surgeon, also married, and the evil lesbians also seduce these wives! In the meantime, a girl of evil lesbians does not like to sleep. It ends with a happy ending where everything is forgiven. Women are too naked, mostly in situations that emphasize reality. bad bad bad.
