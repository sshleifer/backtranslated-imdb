Have laws for the weekend? Then this is a movie that will speed up their departure, but it will not be able to provoke a catatonic state to bring about a welcome relief from constant objection. The film is allegedly placed on a luxury cruise ship, which is more retired ferry; the plot has more holes than the average cradle and thrown from the depth of the famous D list. An interesting piece of added entertainment is "Spot the Villain" while the passengers join the boat. You will not make a mistake !!!! A script that sinks faster than bricks, cliche pieces and an abundant amount of raspberries that multiply as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of the thriller, action movie and up-fest, and at the same time fails to fulfill any of them. > A must watch a movie, at least just laugh at how bad it is.
