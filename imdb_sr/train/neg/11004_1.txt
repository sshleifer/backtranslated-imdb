It really impresses me that it was made. The director / writer / actor must be really charismatic in reality. I can not imagine any other way, etc. What I want to consider is this ... while I watched the movies, I was very sorry actors. It felt like I was in a stand up comedy club where a guy dies on his feet and you sit there, not enjoying it, I just feel bad about him because he is trying. I really like to know what the budget is, I suppose it was low because the quality of the film is really bad. I want to write 'I did not like jokes'. but the reality is that they turn to you, you should be the man who wrote them. or retard. Imagine this in the form of a script ... and this guy has a green light. It's impressive, is not it?
