This movie seems to have been made for TV. For years I've been waiting for a movie about Rubin Carter to be made, because I wanted to see it in a box on old MSG, and to see this film was very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for Mr. There is nothing good to say about this movie except for the song I liked.
