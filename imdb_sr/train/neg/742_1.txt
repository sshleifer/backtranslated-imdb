If this film had a budget of 20 million, I would just like to know where the money went. The monkey could make better CGI effects than spending 3 hours on this horrible piece of garbage, although I have to admit that the machines and marsants looked really, really cool on the original game of the 1 station, and early PC games. since the mid-90s, if the game has ever been made. What confuses me is where the money went? Pendragon's films could have made an excellent movie with good old models and computer-controlled cameras, and George George Lucas around 1975-83, and actors who seem to be worried about what they are doing (or in this case being broken) by the same 20 million. This is probably the worst movie EVER! I'd rather sit through the 24-hour re-screening of Ishtar than watch this movie again. I hated it completely! I'm down. I say this is THE BIGGEST film ever made, because unlike other bad films like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus wins the Martians, these are films that are so bad that you have a special place in your heart for them, you love them. There is no love for this movie and there is no place in my DVD library for that. I sold it to the boy for the dollar. I bet the money for the movie is spent on drinks and other weddings for the actors and the team. Shame on you Pendragon movies! I want my money back!
