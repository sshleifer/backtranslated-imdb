I love B movies .. but come ... this was not even worth the rating ... The end was stupid ... b / c WAS NO REAL QUALITY !!! ... not to mention that Life comes by itself ... I do not mean illumination of a storm or crazy demonic power? Slow down and then they start killing characters one at a time for a time period of 15 minutes ... and I will not even start from killing a man without his head .... and then you can not even see what Jigsaw does and with his so-called "new puzzle" .... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Go and look at the color before I recommend this film to God left to anyone else ... oh, and to be even better, another totem of the film you can see the guy throwing a creature in the ground floor scene from the window .. that was funny like hell and it's probably Make a good part of watching that movie loss
