You know this will be a cheese film when: 1. Made in the 50's 2. Black and white. 3. No names of actors! 4. Screaming compensates for the lack of special effects! So not to be outdated - this film brilliantly combined all four of the above elements to make this a real movie mistake. Br /> Ok - shhhhh but I will discuss special effects - or their disadvantage - Have you caught the underwater scene? It looks like it's badly filmed through the aquarium - keep in mind that rt flies on the breeze. And the repeated use of footage (external photos, bridging scenes - greatly improved the KRAF-Tiness of this movie - not from "PLAN 9" - did I see so creative use of the images. </ p> <p> And where the special effects were lacking - do not worry - screaming DOES NOT take it Yes, this film even wisely used this old hacking trick. Grab the popcorn - set the brain to stun (a few fermented drink definitely helps), come back and wonder: why were they again put on a movie again? Vaino <br />
