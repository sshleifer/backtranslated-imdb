The thought that they can be collected from various comments on this topic. I was amazed by the number of people who loved this movie who want to make it "mandatory" or "required". Br /> I think this gives us a little insight into the reasons why this film and the background issue are so polarizing. The issue of global warming is greatly attracted to people who want to force others to "do good". Especially like those who are "more liberal", because this does not apply to the morality of the bedroom, which is usually what conservatives want to make you "good". And it's a movie problem. Al Gore is a politician. And it's very successful. He simply can not help himself to address those who want to force others to do what they want. The political complaint is too big. And here we have a scientific question that can be of great importance, reduced to a political issue that is called to those in the political body with a tendency to force others. Another interesting question is how did environmental movement movements be abducted by such people?
