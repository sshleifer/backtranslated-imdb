I'm surprised to see this high rating for this movie, as well as a few reviews that will be positive. I saw a movie and I was pretty disappointed. I did not like it at all. It was slow and lacking a fun value. Even scenes are brilliant scenes, with real shots close to generic stitches that do not look good at all. And the assumed great turning point is not much, I saw it coming, and then the ending looked like a cliche. This film may not be remembered much, but because of what it gets a bit is overestimated. I would not recommend this movie.
