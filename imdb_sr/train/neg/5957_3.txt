The insignificant and low brain (haha!) It's like 80's as if it were thirteen to ten, but it can be considered fun if you look at it in the right state of mind. Special effects are sticky, dramatic, and scenario seems to miss a few important paragraphs! The "brain" takes place in a typical, quietly-American urban setting, where every adolescent works in the same restaurant and where a cold kid in a high school throws bombs to sour chairs in the toilet. Right here, a TV guru named Dr. Blake and his beautiful five-brain start their quest for mind control across the country. Under the label "independent thinkers," the giant sirens of the brain send waves through television receivers and make innocent viewers kill! How cool is that? Now, on the teenage insurgent Meadovvale, to save the world! The most fun thing about it is that it never explains where Dr comes. Blake and his monstrous brain. There are obvious references to alien life, but that's all. Meh, who really needs the background in the movie? Unfortunately, there is not a lot of bloodshed, and the "evil" brain looks like an overly large sock-doll. The only more or less interesting element for horror fans is the look of the actors and the team that made this film. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same people who made "Bloody Birth" (My Guilty) and "The Plague". And they are much better films and wisely decided to resign to the film industry. The most famous person in the plaster is David Gale's unmistakable big-name, whom the fans of horror will forever adore because of his role in the Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak gives a factor of nudity and is obviously a great talent? There are exactly 3 films on her repertoire, of which this is "masterpiece". In her debut, she was named as a "fugitive model", and in "3 men and baby" her character is called "one of Jack's girls". I really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress?
