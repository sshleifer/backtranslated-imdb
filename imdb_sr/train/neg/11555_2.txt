Slasher film - it's a shame that producers are not part of the script. The basic summary of the action - a red-haired fetish man invites such women to his apartment just to go to some kind of strange coma and continue to dismantle them in different degrees of success. Only the shooting team behind the scenes had to think that the film was a commercial as I did and I cut off a movie from the movie. Nothing flows, it's lost on what redhead at that time (was not he been there before?) And most of the time it looks like a man from the camera fainted and continued recording when he woke up. It's not that I can blame him for failing 2-3 times and I had to rewind back and I continue to try to recover that little parcel that exists. Warning when you see the ending DO NOT try connecting it with anything that happens - you'll only get an aneurysm. It's not worth the time, effort, or God do not give money. The only reason I get 2 instead of 1 - is a small chance that hacking happened between the film and the horrible version that I watched.
