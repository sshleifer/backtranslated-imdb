This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest last weekend, Grobari were the first. The graveyards were better. I can only assume that I was watching that production was pretty limited. I admit that the story started to be interesting, but in the end it was very nasty. We did not really have the time to sympathize with or understand any character who just did that each of their wrong characteristics was even more bothering. I have to point out that there was also a little wrong throw with the 12-year-old boy who played the sheriff. The only reason I went through the whole movie was to find out what a big secret was, which turned out to be not very interesting. Something more about the family would help, but they did not look like a family at all. This movie is so amateurish to me that I could not even see it on DVD. Four ratings are for the initial potential the story could have. This is one for skipping for horrorfest.
