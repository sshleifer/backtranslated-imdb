I usually come to this site before I go to the cinema because I like to see what others think about the movie. I read many of the critics who were talking about the 'thriller, not the horror movie'. That led me to try this movie. I really have to deal with these 'thriller / horor' statements, because it did not exist! I almost went and asked for my money, and if you have a lot of viewers enjoying this nonsense ... well, you must be very happy! At the end of the film, the people behind me said "what is a waste of time," and I turned to them and replied: "I could not better summarize it." I was constantly waiting for something to happen ... but it did not. There was the potential for many good fears (or excitement if you wanted), but none of them happened. Villiams played this role pretty well, but I felt it was short-lived because of a bad scenario that moved away and went nowhere. Save money to people, this is a party that will be presented on DVD 'cheap' in your area in the foreseeable future!
