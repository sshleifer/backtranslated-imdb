Life in a future fascist or near fascist state that seriously limits personal freedoms is a topic that is repeated constantly in modern literature and for filmmakers. Such works warn us about undesirable trends in our society to be watched; but to be effective, they also have to be fun. Unfortunately, most books are probably more effective in publishing alerts than entertaining us enough to become really read; while the problem with movies is usually reversed. The first such work, which became very well-known, was probably 1984 by George Orwell (first published in 1948), which is still easily available in both book form and film. Vatch or read: and then, when you feel a bit depressed because of man's inhumanity towards man, reach for Cinderella 2000. This is a lightweight low-budget film comedy based on the same theme that provides easy but ungrateful watching; and as was the case in 1984, the calendar has now gone beyond its previous period. Most comedies are tricky, although there are only a few really funny moments. To focus the mind at longer distances, you can focus on whether this movie will get a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or will ultimately disappear into oblivion because existing copies of the cassette exacerbate redemption. There are many bad movies that appear as DVDs these days, and frankly, I do not care what will happen anyway. So far, the best films of this genre were probably "The Handmaiden's Tale", but I would very much like to replace them for a well-made film about Jack London's huge novel "Iron Heel". Ambitious, for that to be, it still seems unbelievable that no modern film maker yet dared to try (IMDb quotes only the B / V silent version made in Russia in 1919).
