It's hard for me to understand why this piece of garbage is repaired. The only salutary grace in the whole thing is the body of Ariaune in her sexy uniform. Her humor should also be appreciated. She is definitely a plus, but she needs a magician to save this garbage. However, it must be positively recognized for its heroic efforts and genuine professionalism. I can not say the same about her star, Lilith, with her voice that creeps into your nervous system. He appeared uninteresting and left the impression that only her presence on the set was all that was needed. All except Ariaun's performances, it's really the ultimate garbage.
