Where, where do we begin to describe the comprehensive troubles of Neil LaBute's latest attempt to film the movie? There are many types of film fans, but it's by far the most unpleasant and richest. You know, Mr. Intriguing, is not it? He is a guy who no matter how stupid, chrome, and incomparably boring film, says, "God, I do not know why everyone hated him, I found him intriguing." He is the type of man who finds the smell of an intriguing dog. Especially when smearing it in the form of Hitler's mustaches on the upper lip and marshes around the house, about the brilliance of a science fiction that contains thinly hidden references to Greek mythology. He is also the guy who made this version of The Vicker Man. No one else could handle it.
