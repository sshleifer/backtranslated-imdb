The "shot" takes 82 minutes. This review is a long 82 words. Three unacceptable Nev Iork Lotharios, merciless "rogue", end up with the same woman, played by Amanda Peet, with catastrophic results. It relates to the story and the film. Too sophomoric to be misogynistic, flabby and ridiculous, "Vhipped" mixes the shock shock jock Tom Likis with the Penthouse letter of fantasy. Although technically skilled, dated, graceful, poorly written, malicious and obvious. People do not behave this way. People do not speak like this. Really.
