I watched 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any effect on me. I watched several documentaries about him. He is an obviously intelligent man, with great knowledge of films and passion for them, but that makes him a good director. Definitors NO! Complete anti-talent. Can make a good documentary because of the aforementioned features, but a movie with actors ?? Never! He can not direct or write. His scenarios are filled with badly designed situations, and many situations / dialogues in his films are so childish and poorly made that they can not hide behind the word "art" in any sense. No way. Not to mention an unruly direction, so amateur. To say that he wants to direct and write such a shit is a lie. As a scene when Scheitz was arrested and Storszek was hiding in the back of the store. WHO WAS BORAVIOUS? He is a cheater; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want. He knows which elements to put in the script to attract their attention and empty commendation. It does not matter the rest of the script and the messy direction. Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can shoot a movie like Medem, then I may again check his old films and try to find talent in them.
