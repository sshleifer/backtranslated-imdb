Vov. I've seen some really bad movies in my day, but this one really takes a cake. It's the worst movie I've ever seen in the past decade - without exaggerating. As a veteran of the US military in the war in Afghanistan, it's almost impossible to even end up watching this funny movie, not because it restored its memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt to "authenticate "finds anywhere in the movie. Not as much as the smallest little piece. It seemed as though he was written by an 8-year-old child who got all his notions of war (and military behavior) straight from comics. The film was shot in Honduras, which should have been a trace, but even that can not fully explain the terrible production value of this cliché-cliché cliché. I could try to list all the endless technical defects, but it will last practically forever. From ancient units on the shoulders that have not been seen or worn since World War II, as well as the names of the names, such as "ColCollins" (colonel Collins), which is actually written in reverse, mirror name "N".

Uniforms, equipment, plot, and especially the behavior of the characters themselves - every scene was filled with funny inefficiencies, inaccuracies and completely foolish clichés. the story itself is not itself, nor did the characters be the least credible or convincing. It was all funny, childish, in extreme sense. This was obviously a movie that should have been appealing exclusively to children of pre-puberty, and I do not doubt that even this the film was extremely absurd. In short, this movie has absolutely none of It's a total waste of time. I would strongly advise anyone to read this through this garbage: It's really not worth spending any time of your time.
