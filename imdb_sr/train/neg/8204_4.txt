An unoriginal, excessively predictable and just slightly fun low-budget re-sci-fi formula that we've all seen a hundred times - a group of scientists in isolation that faces some strange thing, and in all places (surprise, surprise) Antarctica! The film shows James Spader and almost immaculate support (with the exception of Carla Levis, who is not really that bad for a non-actor) - who deliver ho-hum performances that do little to revive the diamond scenario. To make matters worse, the pace of the film is slow, there are almost no sub-blocks, and several action sequences are stereotyped and not so exciting. No wonder this thing went straight to DVD. What is a wonder is why Spader - an excellent actor, who won the Cannes Best Actor Award for 'Sek, Lies and Videotape', and did a great job in the innovative movie 'Stargate' - decided to apply for this project. Or maybe not, if you look at his career, he seems to have invested his talents in more missions than hits. many elements from so many great sci-fi movies, and still the thing turned out so voluntary and fanciful. There are huge lending pieces from "The Thing" (both the original Howard Havks and John Carpenter's remarkable remake of 1982), "Contact" and "Outbreak"; a few indications of 'Alien', CE3K ',' Andromeda Strain ',' Kubrick's 2001 '(i.e.' alien black box ') and' Mission to Mars' (i.e. mysterious message); and even a bit of moving 'Sneakers' and 'A Remarkable Mind' (although not sci-fi movies, they share a 'cryptological' link). Hell, there are even fields for corn and Antarctica, just like the recent 'Ks Files Movie'. And the light transient spaceship in the end looks just like something extracted from an extract from 'Baby.' Everything was done earlier and done much better, although I will admit that there were a few slight surprises in the end. I could say something more about complication, but absolutely no need. You already know more than half of this movie, and you never see it. (5 of 10)
