Distant, dust western from director Richard Bruce, who seems to be completely entangled in the genre, while all the usual clich√©s remain intact. The horse race at the beginning of 1900 attracted cowboy with a low key (Gene Hackman), a crafty gambler (James Coburn), a crazy kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a female (surprising game by Candice Bergen). When preliminary meetings get off the road (with predictable arguments about whether a woman should take part), it becomes a pretty impressive entry, though one who does not interrupt the new ground (instead of resembling something from Garcia Cooper's era). Convenient, if the long piece is a sword sharp and finely thrown, but the tangle mechanisms become tiring pretty fast. ** from the ****
