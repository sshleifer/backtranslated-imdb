I was probably broken by having first seen the 1973 version with Michael Jaiston and Sorcha Cusack, so the 1983 adaptation was such a disappointment. I just did not get any chemistry between the two main stars. A lot of watching and theatrical acting does not work for me, and what was all about getting Tim into the role of Rochester. Did the director ever read the book. Very weird! He's a good actor, but Mr. Rochester is definitely not! And Zelah was just, well, strange, a couple of blends. For her benefit, the support was pretty good, and the Lovood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation, but overall did not capture any magic of the novel. Surely you would not ask anyone to look at him as a real adaptation of the novel. Real descent!
