Movie 'Gung Ho!': The story of Carlson's Makin Island raiders was made in 1943 with the aim of raising the morale of the American people during World War II. This shows a better way for a movie to form a body of propaganda. The value of this movie is just a collection and is not artistic. In the film of propaganda it is useless to judge the direction and the actors. Watch this movie if you are interested in learning how propaganda works in movies or if you are a big fan of Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the film. If you want to see a movie about World War II, they are much better and more objective. I rated it 4/10.
