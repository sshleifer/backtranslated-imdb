This film is incredibly funny. I love horror movies, but this is the worst I've ever seen. I'm a big fan up, but most of the deaths in this movie are not shown. It only shows us dead bodies, and the only scenes of death shown in this movie are terrible. The graphics seem so obviously fake. And the actors are terrible. There is no real emotion from any of them. Not only did I waste my time watching this piece of film, but I had to undergo real pictures of animals that were beaten at the beginning. If I could evaluate this -10, I would. F * ck this film. It's bullshit. Do not look at it.
