I wish I could give this film a zero. Cheese effects and acting. The only reason to watch this movie is that you can see how bad it is. Let's start with the kid who plays Brian. What a geek! I could not trust my shoes! Then he talked to himself. I guess I can not just make the movie quiet, but still. Of course, he had to hurt him, not something I wanted to see. But Jared gave a great performance, compared to the special effects department. Everything, from the bear to the collision, was something I could do better. I seriously doubt that Garry Paulsen had anything to do with production, since the movie was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I do not think the writer has ever read the book, since nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie smelled like a stinky goat!
