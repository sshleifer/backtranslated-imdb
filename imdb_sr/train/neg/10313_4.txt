This film was difficult to hold, and when I saw it at the end, the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown person takes advantage of the aviation industry that does not doubt and gets millions in ransom without harming or ruining anyone. With all this embedded interest, so that anyone could make such a brilliant, accentuated film of this true life. While Villiams is always interesting, the screenwriters assumed that D.B. Cooper persona was a stereotypical heroic movie star, and what we get is the type - without any interesting details or insights into the mind of a person who is brave enough and smart enough to take it out. Harrold practically steals the film with its glupidity and pure beauty, but the real disappointment was in dealing with the complication and direction of chromium. Shame on this movie even for the existing ones.
