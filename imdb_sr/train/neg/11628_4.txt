Uh, you guys are too good! Corni, Corni, Corni That's what I think about this movie. It started well with a good idea, the guy (Edward Asner) escaped from the prison dressed as Santa Claus, finds a crowd of children and believes that his real Santa Claus is so Fake Deda enters kids to help him find a stolen money bag. The film is like a Christmas version "Whistle Down Wind". The film starts well, but gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the extent that it becomes funny and you just can not seriously grasp this film. For example, you get Scrooge's character called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois) who is a complete Douchebag who treats his little son as a bunch of garbage; he treats his son so badly that he does not even buy decent clothes; the poor child is wearing jeans with holes! but a 45-second scene with Fake Santa's visit to Sumner and to the end of the movie you get a guy who is happy to sing Christmas Carol and gives a embrace to his neglected son ... iep that's how Corni is ... I'm all for good a film especially during Christmas, and I am a big fan of the seasonal TV movie, but this is too much for me, the bad thing is that it started well, but the other half of the film casts a supernatural element on a movie that simply does not match the rest. It's not quite bad, there's a solid acting, especially from children, but there's a much better Christmas movie.
