As a great admirer of "other" PLANET APES movies, I rented this DVD in spite of my repulsion to all Tim Burton. Once again, he does not fail to disappoint his uninvited direction. Even the appearance of a monkey looks different, which is unforgivable with regard to the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg once and for all proves that he is not an actor (as though BOOGIE NIGHTS was not sufficient proof). I was uncomfortable with real talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. There is no doubt that their salaries motivated them because they could not be a hidden scenario. I rented this DVD on a special night of $ 1 and I still feel exhausted.
