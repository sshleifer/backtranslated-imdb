Based on the darkest bestseller of Raja Russell, this John (VATCHER IN THE VOODS) Hust-scattered bust has little to do with it. The "Incubus" title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into the vagina during sex - more precisely, rape. John Cassavetes, who worked on his successful career, is convinced that he is a doctor who is questioning the circumstances of bizarre attacks on young women. Terrible possibilities of the victims who create demonic progeny are not taken into account - nor the tolerance of the crowd that slowly moves. The inviolability of the scenario to investigate the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise illustrates the main problems with this Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise exercise.
