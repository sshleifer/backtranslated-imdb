The months that preceded the release of this film have seen that it is advertised in all types of print media, so I patiently waited on his video edition to see what it was about. After I finished, I had to apologize to the roommate who had taken the video recorder for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. Basically this does not work because the film is based on the character of unforgettable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is Amanda Peet) you can not withstand any of them. The film relies on its dialogue that is sober, cunning and rude. The only trivial fun character is Eric, whose view of the only married member of a group of friends is dead. The final turn, designed to make you smile on three main characters, only instead inspired the same kind of anger towards Peet. All in all, rent only if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
