The water is in the Vietnam War, while Rocka IV boxing is in the heavyweight category. The story of Oliver Stone about the experience of the US military in Vietnam in 1968 is so exaggerated that it is ridiculous. While most or all occurrences in water occurred during the 10-year period of US military engagement in Vietnam, to show these things to a small group of men in such a short period of time (a week) gives a terribly distorted picture of war. In the water, people in the water see everything next for one or two weeks: American soldiers kill civilians, American soldiers rape civilians, an American sergeant who kills another US sergeant, an American private assassin of the US sergeant, US soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire , 90% + killed or wounded in water. For Stone to try to pass this film as a typical experience of an American soldier in Vietnam is a shame. Two Vietnamese war films that I would recommend We were soldiers (a true story of the biggest battle for American soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's great lie.
