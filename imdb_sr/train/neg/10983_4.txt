When this show was first shown by the BBC more than 30 years ago, it would be something completely different during that time. So some people would consider this to be rather scary, and maybe they were impressed by the special effects? Watching the game this day and year, it does not appear to be so terrible anymore, even special effects can leave much to be desired. Would a train really be allowed to pass the red light into a dark tunnel? I do not think so ... but if you look at this show again, you will notice that the first train that enters the tunnel runs straight through the CRVU LIGHT! (maybe it was at Dickens time)? You will also notice that the track leading to the signal box is very steep and in poor condition. Certainly there would be a series of correct steps with the grips so that Signalman could climb or lower into the cutting. (I can not fail to notice such things) I will not take anything away from the acting, and Denholm Elliott (Signaler) and Bernard Lloyd (traveler) have given wonderful performances. > <br /> I'm not at all sure what's going on ... I mean, the ghost is a traveler, or what ??? Does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story? (maybe I'm the only one who does not) ??? To sum up ..... The game has a wonderful atmosphere in full, with a great atmosphere. nature. Today it's suffering that it's not that terrible, and that it's a little, if not very confusing in some places, and has some unusual signaling practices .... Thank you for reading my review.
