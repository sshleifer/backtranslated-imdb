I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I understand why. The act was the worst I had seen for a long time. Lighting and sound are bad at best. The action makes little sense even when it's sober (WARNING: I do not advise you to watch this movie when it's sober.) This movie looks like watching a movie of someone who does not come out much. It's really a pity that all the little money spent on this project went to such waste, I'm looking forward to see if any of those involved has a career, except eva longoria who is the only "star" of this movie. it obviously did not hit a bad stick. I am sorry that none of these criticisms seem to be constructive, but I will say one thing to James Cahill, do not try again. According to the skuirliem, "His is seriously lacking in a good department."
