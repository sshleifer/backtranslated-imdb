What made it so attractive from the idea of ​​watching this movie was the hope that it would fill the brightness of Charlotte Bronte's original classical story. I was deeply disappointed when I discovered that this film, which seemed to be written or recorded in a great hurry, did not have the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Most of the witches back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eire and Mr. Rochester, seem either to be missing from the script or left on the floor of the cutting room. She also lacked the charismatic feelings of Jane Eire, which allowed her to suffer through her unrest and triumph over everyone. The original Jane Eire was a hero. It seems that the woman in this film did not have much to triumph, including one of the biggest parts of the story when Jane flew off Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her embarrassment for having to pray for bread, a threat of freezing in the cold, all to escape from the man she loved was, in my opinion, sharp parts of the story simply left out of this film. The title character seemed dry and non-inspiring. The story was unattractive and for those who did not read the book, I can not imagine this story being the least interesting. The scenario and directing little contributed to the classic story.
