Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd) and his chief fiancee, Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking for arrangements at the last minute for their admission. It's their wedding morning, and Kate is in a rage, giving caterers important information about her food presentation requirements. But the horror of horror, an ice sculpture "angel", ordered by Kate, comes without a wings. In the battle that followed the scion, a heavy "ice" girl falls on Kate and sends her to the next time. Now, a year later, Henry's sister arranges a psychic to tell the young veterinarian that Kate would like to start dating other ladies and move on. Still, the lovely medium, Ashlei (Bell Lake) becomes interested in Henry himself, which has greatly disturbed his hospitality partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create a havoc for Ashley, because she does not intend to allow another woman to get Henry. Can anything be done to get Kate back to heaven forever? This is an extremely romantic comedy, one of the worst that this dedicated fan has ever seen. No, it's not an actor, because they are trying to do things. Longoria is beautiful and funny as the frustrated fellow believer and Bell have an unusual style and humor that is also contagious. Biggs, the funny actor, is also completely lost. Regarding Rudd, a very gifted performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please) he is trying hardest and, in fact, is the main reason to see this clunker. His charm, looks and easy understanding make a long journey in filing a movie. But nothing can turn a foolish scenario and a dire direction into the winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you are a colored lover of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you separate money for this one. Even free tickets entered your wing, we warned that this movie is almost a mortal experience for those who love cinema of love and laughter.
