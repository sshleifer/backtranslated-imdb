I saw it in the sausage two days before the official opening, and I must say that I was extremely disappointed. And I have to put most of those problems on the decision to Claire Danes turn the main role. Depending on what you think about the Danes, she was either terribly wrong, or she is so far in the head that she should be the first favorite for Razzie for the worst actress in 2007. I think we should be sympathetic to her. Instead, it is completely different. Other "great" actresses do a good job, but they certainly do not illuminate the screen. Of all the "great" actors in this movie, I would say that the best one was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the picture, and appears only at the very end. And the horrible scenario. He is read more as reading lines than he is really "characteristic".
