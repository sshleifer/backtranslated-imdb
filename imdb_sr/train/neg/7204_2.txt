This is one of those films that you think creators would refuse to release them because it's so scary. They obviously thought that the kids were stupid and that they were great for absorbing endless commercials and that they would think they were fun because it was funny. What about a car that talks with buttons that say Vendi, McDonalds, M & M and Skittles? There was no car in the cartoon. (Dr.) The claw should be evil, not handsome and charming. Why is Rupert Everet "Claw" anyway? Did the drug writers write these scenes? It seems that they (poorly) launched Robo Policeman, by turning a man into an android to fight crime. I tried to get my money back, but there was a policy where, if I watch more than 30 minutes of film, you do not get a refund. I'm sorry to have been watching for more than 30 minutes and a bunch of shit. After telling me the policy of not refunding money, I decided to look at the rest of the disgusting garbage called Inspector Gadget.
