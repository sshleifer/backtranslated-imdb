Ironically, although he can do a "split", Tomas is totally dumb as an actor. This film has been remembered as one of the brightest and most competent movies I've ever seen. As such, I really like it. However, the only reason he gets more than one star is that Thomas is an excellent form, and it's fun to see his tiny, muscular body that performs various roles of gymnastic skills on unusually shaped rocks and poles. about the eastern European country (including a notorious hoodlike hat) in the middle of a rural market that Tomas uses to shine his legs into the faces of various crazy villagers). But a poor man opened his mouth and tried to stomach, and any illusion that he could have a film career was immediately cast into pieces. At least at least Tomas had an excuse not to be an actor. Everybody else in the movie - actors, directors, editors, cameramen, etc. They are at least as bad or worse, and most of them are professionals. So Kurt does not get as bad as you think. I hope that poor Kurt took the money and escaped. If anyone ever asks him to perform again in a martial arts movie, I bet Thomas threw a guy in the face.
