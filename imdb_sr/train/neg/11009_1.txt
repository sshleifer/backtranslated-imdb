I rated this film as AVFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie could be pretty cool. "Guaranteed to offend ... everything!" said the trailer. Well ... it offended me because this movie is really shit. It's hardly a comedy because I laughed about two seconds during the whole movie. And what about all the gays in this movie? I'm not gay and I have no problems with those who are, but what is the purpose of adding so many gai-scenes to the so-called comedy movie, when these scenes are absolutely not funny? I guess the director is a homosexual in denial, or something like that. So, my advice to you is: if you want to spend good money, go to the lease of a good comedy that you have already seen a million times, it will be better for you to watch this Mother of all bad comedies. It's really total bullshit.
