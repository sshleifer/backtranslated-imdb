* Spoilers and extreme bashing forward * When this show started, I found it likable and fun. Pretty Oddparents is a kind of cartoons that kids and adults liked. He also had high marks together with Spongebob. But it began to fall due to the next shit that Butch Hartman and his team entered the series. First, the toilet humor is not so ridiculous. You can easily laugh at the little boy with banging, but it's mostly the only audience to laugh at such a clich√© scarf. The following are children's jokes. We can see people in their underwear and we can see people dressing. LOLOLOL !!! I can not stop laughing at such gay bliss! Somebody help me! But of course, this performance would not be so bad that there was no stereotype. Did you see the team showing Australians? They saw them as clowns who love Boomerang, who live in a hot desert. But now ... Is it a shootout why this show is really the most loudest of all ... OVER-USED JOKES !!! The show is constantly pulling the same jokes (most are unhappy) thinking it's the biggest thing ever! Cosmo is mostly guilty. I hated that they still remember "Super Toilet" (which also has a mixture of kiddish humor in it) and Cosmo would be crazy. And who could forget about that stupid battery joke that every damn parent in Dimmsdale would use in that e-mail episode? You know, the one in which each parent (not knowing that other parents speak) said the same sentence before he broke into his children's room? Yes, it can be first-class humor for some people, but it's pure for others. If I'm not mistaken, I believe that Butch Hartman has said something about the completion of the show. Thank God! Everyone around me says it's the most entertaining Nickelodeon shov ever. Can not I agree with that? I think it's another bunch of horse balls we get on our day-to-day carts, just worse.
