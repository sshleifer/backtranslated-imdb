Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (again) in the trial for her life. As the faithful dog sleeps on the master's tomb, she must be killed, according to the law. Unusually, it was also explained that Lassie had no "legal" owner, which, obviously, was against the old Scottish law. If there are no owners after three days, dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) acknowledges Lassie's case, which leads to an extended reflex, indicating that Lassie has been adopted by Donald Crisp (like John "Jock" Grai). ("Greifriars Bobbi"), "Challenge to Lassie" returns several previous Lassie situations; and does not improve them. Comparatively speaking, this is untidy and unimaginable; and, this is a disappointing continuation of the "Sun Comes" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (like Susan Brovn) and several other artists can be charming, but they can not raise this. Little Jimmy Havkins (from "It's a Wonderful Life") is among prominent children who support Lassie; Much later, he will grow up to marry the "Dark Shadovs" "enchanting" Angelica "(Lara Parker).
