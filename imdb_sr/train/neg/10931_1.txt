I went to see this film with pretty low expectations, thinking it would be a nice piece. Unfortunately, it was not even that. I could barely sit through a movie without the desire to go out. I went with two children (10 and 13 years old) and even asked me: "How much more?" After the end, I was just wondering who would approve this scenario. Even trustworthy Fred Villard could not save a dashing dialogue, state jokes, and a banal plot. I suggest that the one who wrote and directed this film (I use the term freely) should sign in on a screen-timer or go to a local community college for film lessons. At the very least, there are many books on directing, writing on the screen and producing films that will teach them something about structure, complication, dialogue and pacing.
