The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a top comedian, in other situations far from Stooges. He had definitive results because he was very fun and smart. Moe and Larry and Shemp knew him or at least him for years and liked his work. What, then, was happening on Earth when he joined the army as the "third puppet"? Obviously, nothing. In most of these short short "late Stooge", more often than not, the boys confront each other or with Joe against the other two and this is not exactly the Stooge label. "One for all, all for one, each for myself," to quote Curley from "restless knights". One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Mark Brothers, no matter how they all try to take advantage of each other or slam each other around, when the chips are actually lowered, they stick together and help each other. In this particular case, none of this is happening. It's almost like watching a dog fight while trying to deceive others or be mean and nasty, not for a comedy effect. It could be assumed that something is going on behind the scenes, art imitates life. Perhaps there really was the reason why Besser stayed with Moe and Larry for a long time. Just look at the history of other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
