This stupid, incredible story is being redeemed only by the introductory scene in which a stubborn police detective delivers almost sound lines that confirm our greatest fears: He is dead. Perhaps the film would be preserved that the director brought out the brilliant star power A. Martinez in favor of this sad-anonymous actor who briefly filled up the screen. The fact that a non-hacker's name on the street can save such a dinner film is no less likely than the villain who committed the murder by throwing rocks in a quarry for a diver who does not doubt. His moment is short; his promise is huge. Perhaps this obscure actor will be treated by us on multiple screens if this film that does not agree is continued.
