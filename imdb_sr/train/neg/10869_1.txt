My friend borrowed this video and I was pretty excited to watch it, but after ten minutes of slow vocals, James Hetfield and Lars, who banged on their drum set up what looked like a slow-motion recording. Looking at this? That question will pass you through the minds of 5 ?? 10 minutes after you press Play. I returned the tape the same day, as you would guess, it's not worth buying or watching! Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
