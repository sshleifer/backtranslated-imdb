This movie was pretty bad. Sci-Fi is usually my favorite channel and I'm watching all the original movies that play on it. I really do not know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo / theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar. What is it, oh, Jurassic Park. But this has instead of tiger Sabertooth. The film begins with several stereotyped kids on the island who are doing some type of treasure search. One of them dies from a rather terrible death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. Blood looked like a ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to have as many dental teeth as possible for people to enjoy. Three of them have already escaped and traveled by tourists, or people were invited to the island to see tigers first hand. Again, it sounds like the Jurassic Park. Probably the coldest thing was a toothed 1000-liter tooth crawling on the front legs and killing a crazy scientist with something like a toothpick that somehow is collecting and going through the neck. The funniest death I've seen on TV. The acting is extreme cheese, special effects are terrible. CG tigers could almost go for clay models, and even some sounds were turned off. For example, when one of the students tries to escape, he uses a tree to break the door, the ax enters the door, and about 2 seconds later a sound is heard. This movie was pretty bad. The cruel death was nevertheless quite ridiculous.
