They had such a potential for this film and fell completely. In the first cruel intentions, we remain wondering what motivated the main characters to become what they are and to act in the way they do it. There is almost no character development in this previous text. It's actually a very sad story, but this film has not done anything for me. They seem to have omitted good writing instead of unnecessary f-words. And the end has no meaning and nothing explains. Writing was terrible. Another thing that bothered me was that they used lease 3 exact same lines that were in the original. As a "boy down", or a scene of kissing, and a few others that I do not remember. I was not impressed at all by Robin's acting, but Amy did a great job. It's the only thing that calmed this movie.
