This film is so bad that I can not even describe it. What in the shining cave is not right with writers, producers and directors? How are, for good, received the means for this horror? The action is ridiculous, acting is at best bad, story ... What story? The first fight in this movie is fine, but then it's constantly repeated until you want to turn it off. I guess I'm the biggest loser, I do not exclude this stupid movie after the first minute. *** SPOLER ALERT *** I saw this film just because Scott Adkins was in it ... and he's in it ... 30 seconds . I give 1 of 10 because this is the lowest rating that IMDb can offer. Make yourself a service: watch Uwe Boll movie instead ... ... more valuable than your time.
