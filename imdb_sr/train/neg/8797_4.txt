Never-ending frenzy of smart visual ironies does not necessarily have to create an interesting movie. Half of the movie "Blue Wig" never landed, perhaps due to too much self-reliance by the manufacturer. has much more attraction. All the ingredients are there, however, the element of a girl's story that meets with a boy occupies the back seat for artistic thinking. Character development is uneven. Missing emotions. For music lovers, Vong Faie "Mung Jung Iun" (canton version of Cranberries hit "Dreams") is used in Chungking Express. Faie Wong also made a version in the Mandarin language called "Zhen Tuo". They are both on CD, although only "Mung Jung Iun" is on the CD of the official soundtrack.
