This film is a very funny movie. Violence is bad, acting is ... Well, Dani, you are singing or screaming or whatever the hell you're doing. Random chickens that barely have something are just to catch sexually frustrated goth guys. Personally, I think this film really sucks. The story and the characters could have been very good, if we say that the directors, the actors and other small things have become better. But the movie is just a bad one, the only reason people like this shit is because Danny has it. This movie is perhaps the worst B-rate movie ever. And believe me, it's hard to achieve, especially when you compete with Def bi Temptation and over empty voices for "serious" horror films. I'm not a fan of CoF, and that's why I see this as another movie about garbage ... Really bad. If Days did it as a comedy then it's good to go. Very well done. More than that, however, I think it's low because it's bullshit. Look when you are in a happy, happy, joyful, joyful way, so you can laugh at everything or if you are on several different types of drugs.
