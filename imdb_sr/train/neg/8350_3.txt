I just got back from "El Otro" playing here in Buenos Aires and I have to say that I was very disappointed. The film moves very slowly (do not misunderstand me, I enjoy movies moving slowly!), Slowly to the extent that you are crazy. All you hear is that Julio Chavez breathes hard during the whole movie. This is a poorly-made movie, but more importantly, it's a film without the inspiration, I did not feel anything for the story or its characters. I'm making a movie ... forgetting. I advise you to forward this, if you want to see good Argentinian movies, look for Sorina movies.
