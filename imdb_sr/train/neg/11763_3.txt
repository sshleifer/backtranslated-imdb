Yes. I admit it. I believed in all the hybrids of this work, about the trials and troubles of 6 people living in Mecca Citi in connection with their sexual life. And so I really expected to finally see a Mexican movie (in years) that was popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately, the film was extremely disappointing. The story presents two pairs, both with very obvious marital problems. When a third person comes into the life of each pair, their problems reach a key point. Or absolute absurdity. The action then turns into a battle of poles. The position of each group (yes, they are a literary group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is obviously dumb and childish (I suppose humor should have been there). And everything goes from bad to worse. The performances range from a good (Miss Zavalet) to the central (Bichir), and Serrano performs an acceptable job in his opera reception. However, the precise circumstances that make up the plot, one-dimensional characters, very bad (if not stupid) perception of what sex is in a mature relationship, etc., make the film unsuccessful. Miserable. SPIL had a (impressive) good reception in the box office. Trust the hypo at your own risk.
