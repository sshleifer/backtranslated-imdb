I am very sorry to say this, but "Thunderbirds" does not even come up with a loud pop, no matter what the thunder. At one stage I seriously considered leaving the cinema, I remained in the lost hope that the film will improve. I should have been disappointed, if it was not better, it was worse if it was possible at all. If I went to watch a movie with the thought that it would be a "hoax," I would still be disappointed. They had a great opportunity to create a great franchise here, completely lost the opportunity. Bill Pakton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be confused to join the names of this film, and Jonathan Frakes is good to say, it should be embarrassing and shame would not be far from the truth. I saw this film on the pretext, I waited to see him the most prominent, growing up in the sixties with original shows. To say that I was disappointed, there would be something that would be something underestimated. The last thing I will say about the movie were puppets in TV shows that were just a bit more wooden than they were actors in the movie.
