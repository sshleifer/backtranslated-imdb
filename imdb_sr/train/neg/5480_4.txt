It was 1 o'clock in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Do not judge me ... please. We went back to the time of Spanish settlements. The group arrived on the island. It does not take too long before they reach a big "reptile", which swallows their horse. They are soon captured by the natives and, in order to gain freedom, they must kill the "gods of the reptile". CG is bullshit; It reminds me of CG early console video games. Meetings were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about this is the hottie native running around in scarce clothes. Otherwise, this is only a central effort.
