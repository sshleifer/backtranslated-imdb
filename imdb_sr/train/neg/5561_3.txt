I saw this film titled "Tied Up". In principle, I enjoyed Dolph's films, so I tried this one. It's not worth it. I've read some of the previous comments about a box that attracts viewers. Do not be deceived. This is at best a bad movie. Act does not exist. The plot, the little that one has from one, is very predictable. The film in places seems to be tangled together. This just ordinary stinks. Not even worth the cheap night rent. As a fan of Dolph, I was constantly waiting to see him in action. By the end of the film you will still be waiting. It is best to avoid this film, and spend time watching almost anything else.
