He seems to be imagined to be a thriller film that's almost funny. It led me to cry: "Oh my God!" more than once on complicated contingency contours that were just stupid. Imaginary or absurd sites for pure novelty or a dramatic situation and incredible, almost impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too much You've understood why they exist. If you have the time and want to discover how bad a picture is, then you will want to see this. Otherwise, spend some time watching some dry colors for a more productive time investment! (If the film that was released in 2003 already shown on TV in July 2003 can give an indicator of the quality of the film)
