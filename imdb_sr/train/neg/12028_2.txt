I agree with everyone above who said everything that will convince you not to spend even the shortest moments watching this incredible amateur movie. Very bad acting, unusual production values, ultimate pedestrian direction and script that is so incompetent and meaningless should never be written, let alone produced. Even Hollywood "professionals" obviously go to work only because of salary, although no one should have been paid for this bad job. Careers should instead be CONCLUDED through this unimportant difficulty. OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so bad. And Chad Love is terribly and consistently bad.
