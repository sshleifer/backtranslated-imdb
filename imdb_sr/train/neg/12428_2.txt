I loved the first two films, but this film was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie. It's a funny thing with a plastic pistol and a car for toys, which can enter another house. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two films were so funny, but the terrorists in this are so stupid and not ridiculous. Believe me, this movie is just a waste of time.
