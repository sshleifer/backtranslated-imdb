"Visitor K" is an unsuccessful attempt by black comedy that focuses on what might be the most functional family in the world, including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a mother breastfeeding her mother and her adult daughter, etc. . the film is so unheard of that he received some critical praise and established a small cult. However, with the quality of home videos and the production of slapdash, "Visitor K" simply does not even retain curiosity. Genitals are blurred, and sanitary devices are clearly visible, make-up is terrible, and everything else is amateur at best. Waste of time. (C-)
