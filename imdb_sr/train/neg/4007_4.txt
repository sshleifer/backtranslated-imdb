I hope that anyone who taught these losers on their accents has been fired. The only high points are some of the supporting characters, 3 out of 5 of my favorites were killed by the end of the season (and one of them was a cat to put it in perspective). The whole story is focused on sex, and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, sex with vampires, sex on vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex in front of vampires, vampire sex, sex without vampire, sex because we are afraid of vampires, sex because we are angry at vampires, sex because we just became a vampire, etc. Nothing against sex, it would be nice to be a bit more subtle than being immersed in the story. Maybe he has a story, and then some sex is dressed in it. But they did not even make any effort to do it ... and Anna Pakuin is a giggling bitch. Either the bullshit or her character is bullshit, I can not figure out which one. The second part of the story which I find very incredible is why the 150-year-old Vampire Bill who seems to have his things together was interested in somebody like Sookie. He is constantly flying from him for things he can not control. He went for two days and has already decided to "not come back" and suddenly he has feelings for a dog? Give me a break. She should be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. People close to her everywhere, and she has the brightest smile on her face because she just gave her V card a guy because he can not read his thoughts? As the main character of the story, I would hope that the performance will make a little more that it is understandable, and someone will put your interest, not someone you secretly hold in the hope of being killed or put in a coma. I can not find anything about her character that I like, and even the fact that she can read thoughts is impressively non-inspiring and not least interesting. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time watching the 2nd season come June.
