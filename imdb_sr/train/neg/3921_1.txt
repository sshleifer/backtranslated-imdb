This short podium can be found on the Elite's Millennium Edition DVD "Night of the Living Dead". The good thing is that I would never go even a small time to see it. Replacing zombies with bread sounds like a silly harmless party on paper. In execution, this is another matter. This piece did not even cause me laughter. I really did not think I was going to say this, but "The Night of the dawn of a son of a bridegroom to return the vengeance of terror attacks of evil, mutant, alien, the flesh that eats, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In the Shocking 2-D" was a VERY better parody and it's not nearly as chromatic or boring. <br /> <br /> My Rating: F
