This is the LARGEST Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took my little children to see this. It was the darkest, worst workplace - the family has no money, a mother loses a job, a father killed in a bank, a bank robber steals a family car with children in the back and after high speed, leaves the bridge and strikes them in the river. Mom stayed alone. No wonder her Christmas patron disappeared. Christmas angels do not save children who have drowned, and Santa Claus does not return dead fathers! I thought this was the worst message for sending children. It's better to tell them that there is no Santa Claus than to show them a movie like this one!
