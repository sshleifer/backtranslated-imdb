Let me start by saying that I really loved Betty Grable, especially from "Dawn of Argentina Vai", but when she reached that disaster, she had a "circle" and frankly, the entire film was a shame. With Douglas Fairbanks JNR (who was certainly pretty desperate) the story was bad, the colors were good, and the film was too long. He had some of his old obligations, such as Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner, to try to stimulate interest, but without success. The music was poor, and I must say that no melody was unforgettable in any way ... as I was a Miss Ms. Grable fan, I would always like that I never saw this!
