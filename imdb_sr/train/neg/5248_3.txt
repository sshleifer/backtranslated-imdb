"Die Sieger" is recommended to be one of several good action films made in Germany. I looked at him last night and I must admit that I am deeply disappointed. If it was supposed to be the "last best hope" for a fun and challenging German action cinema, then there was not much left. It's nothing like that. The characters are wooden and stereotyped, and whenever they do something unexpected (which does not happen too much), an act against their nature. It makes it difficult for me - almost impossible - to follow or even identify with them. Most of all, I think the film is very bad. There is not one character I believe in. Perhaps the superior officer of the SVAT unit - but that's all. Those people who try to look or act like special units, such as elite policemen - I do not believe them. Not for a moment. The story is not that bad anyway. But I think it's badly said. You do not even know a bad guy at all - for example. And when after the "very dark" show Karl Simon (good guy) asks his already dead opponent "why ... why?" I asked the same question, knowing that Dominik Graf would not have an answer. I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do better, even action movies.
