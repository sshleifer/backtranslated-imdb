Oh man, does this movie ever bite! If you've ever been afraid to see a rewriting of the slasher genre, done as cheaply as possible and at the same time more cautious (pc-friendli, meaning no nudity, the classic element of slasher movies) cut it. Each clich√© is renewed without a hint of self-awareness and action. Oh, the acting redefines the horror word. I should have known better, because the direct Dutch translation of the title would hint at me.
