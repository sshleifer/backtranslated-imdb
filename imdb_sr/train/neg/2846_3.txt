What a horrible movie. The only reason you would like to sit through this mess is the pleasant sight of Miss Eleniak. The painful exaggeration of Mr. McNamara, which was sometimes embarrassing, ruined what might have been reasonable if the actors were corrected. G. McNamara is not Tom Cruise, an actor he obviously wants to be.
