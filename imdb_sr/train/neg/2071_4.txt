I had two reasons why I was aired on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and I was not disappointed here. She looked beautiful. Secondly, through the reading of the film, I got the impression that there was an absurd humor in it that was not similar to what can be found in the films of Philippe de Brock. However, for that reason, I was sadly disappointed. I think that jokes are predictable (except for some witty remarks on the subject of war) and the characters are completely one-dimensional. Also, the action scenes were performed in an unusually mechanical and uninspired way, without any sense to the drama. I watched everything to the end, but I was quickly bored and I just sat there and waited for Lollobrigid scenes.
