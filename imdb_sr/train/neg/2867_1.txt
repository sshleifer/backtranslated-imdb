I was lying on the bed, with a very bad cold or flu or anything else. I guess I might have been killed for some time watching some horror movies my mom bought recently. I wish I had never chosen this movie! After watching him, I felt more illnesses and I wanted to recover. After the word (when I was better off) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that Dennis in the movie was nothing like law. I hope that nobody ever sees this movie, but if you do not ever eat or you will feel the way I felt after I first watched it. I think it would be better to watch Santa Claus 3. At least the film had better reviews on this site.
