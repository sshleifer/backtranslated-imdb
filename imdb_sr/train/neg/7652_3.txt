In 1967, miners found the remains of an ancient missing civilization named Abkani who believes that there are worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something went wrong before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the government's research agency for paranormal research was led by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthev Valker), who performed experiments with children without parents. Today, one of these children is a paranormal investigator Edward Carnbi (Christian Slater), who just acquired an Abkhaz artifact in South America and was persecuted by a man with abilities. When an old friend of the foster home disappears in the middle of the night, he discovers that the demons return to Earth. With the support of anthropologists Alina Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leaders of Biroa 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his team, are fighting against evil creatures. Despite the charismatic good acting, Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff Tamno "never work and pose a complete mess, without the development of character or complication." The reason can be explained by the "brilliant" interview by director Uwe Boll in Ektrasim on DVD, saying that "video games are the bestsellers of younger generations who no longer run books." Furthermore, its target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty five years. I'm sorry, but I do not think both claims are respected by the younger generation. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not the kind of stupid stereotype that the director says. Furthermore, the IMDb provides excellent statistics showing that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My voice is three. Title (Brazil): "I'm in the Dark? O Despertar to Mal" ("I'm in the Dark? Waking of Evil")
