Absolutely fantastic. Now, before the legion of movie purists smother on their bars, let me elaborate. As much as I liked it, this is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it's certainly the worst movie I've ever seen in a cinema (an impressive claim, because I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). Two traces (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were at best unconvincing and, in the worst case scenario, terrible. Of course, they did not help them with a scenario that had so much emotional depth as the Daphne & Celeste single and the characterization that was equally convincing as the OJ defense. The action (slightly extended term) was weak to non-existent, and the 'upstairs' scene, although undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and ridiculously formulated. What kind of plot spin around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who was abducted, detained and subjected to various nausea, both psychic and physical. Scenes of torture are felt as unrelated pieces and the emphasis is placed on shocking, not the audience's scare. Although there are really few positive results from this film, its redeeming features are just the disadvantages that make it so horrible a movie. I've never heard a louder audience in the cinema. Within twenty minutes, the whole movie was in the seams and the rest was like that. On my part, I got out laughing, inspired by a movie that rose to the climax of the terrible film creation. In whatever way you are watching it, this is truly a film achievement and a plan for future director's bands that detail in detail how not to film a movie. P.S. I did not mention that I managed to get into the movie for free ... so I could afford to laugh. I was still tempted to look for money back ... it was really bad.
