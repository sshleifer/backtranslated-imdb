For me, it's just a soap opera. I suppose that every display of scattered people can be considered a "social commentary". But in the final analysis, I just do not care how you characterize this movie. No character is very nice or attractive. I did not feel any chemistry between Hadson and Beckall. If there is a love story here, it is lost in weakness. And despite the fact that the end of the screwing is ensured by the complete and current (and therefore, incomprehensible) reversal of Dorothy Maguire at the witness site, the story is insufficient to maintain my interest. No matter how Freudian symbolism and psychology are thrown out, this story is sleazy, melodramatic and banal. Rock Hudson is a noble wood. This is the least engaging role of Lauren Bacall and one of her poorest performers. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspired performances, but her character is rotten and he is pathetic. Robert Keith, as the father of two adult juveniles, who is full of love, is the most sensitive character. The most interesting of all is, however, serious Robert Vilke in the small role of the owner of the bar. He is best remembered as a nasty follower in countless Westerns, but here he is a sincere, cute guy.
