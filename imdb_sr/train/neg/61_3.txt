There is no sunshine in Sunshine Bois, which makes the title of this alleged comedy just the ironic moment of Neil Simon. Simon, who adapted the scenario from his performance (which goes unconfirmed), equates the age with irrational behavior - and, worse, clumsy, galmfing, subversive irrational behavior. Valter Matthau is reluctant to play an older lead vocalist and talk about reunification with former comedian George Burns for a special television program (it was said that they were 43 years old, which raises the question "How long did you run?" Burns, who won Oscar for support, has an unfortunate incidence of about thirty minutes, after which Matthau has already destroyed the material in hell and back. The more weird the film is, the less tolerable and visible it is. The director Herbert Ross worked only solidly when he was not bio pov Ezan with one of Neil Simone's scenarios, Ross here sets the scales as an amateur slut, hitting on battleship routines that are not worth it (such as the semi-incoherent Matthau that appears in the garage of mechanics at the audition for TV commercials). , Matthau was still too young for this role, and over-compensated him by descending and shouting. On Ros and Simone was to temper character, to harden his temper to give "sunshine boys" a little sunbathing, but Valter continues to project as We're all crazy. The image looks terribly crazy and crawls along the spiritual pace; early loses hope. * 1/2 of ****
