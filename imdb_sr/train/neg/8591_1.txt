I'm trying to decide if jumping into a wooden helicopter would be more fun than this shit. It ends up destroying what was once a classic pair of movies. We have the death of Lucas' career with the Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith. She wants to swallow Annakin's Vader's nonsense? I never believed it was true. This film justifies these feelings. The story did not work since Phantom Moron, and every new movie just bumped the shit until everything left of the toy parade remained. I have to go. I know where some new walls are. Want a spoiler? Here they come. Luke and Leia are not connected. Vader is not their father. Duke Countoo was supposed to replace the parties while he could. The Ioda has less verbal skills than Iogy Berra. His advice was never good to anyone. Obi Van lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin did not build C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mother about compiling it from scratch. Chevbac has a flea. This whole mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed for that stupid Ammu-Lammu-Ding-Dong. If she had a brain, she would not come in for a year from Annie, but she said that she did what George Lucas wrote for her. What a drug!
