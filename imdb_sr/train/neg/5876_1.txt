I had to compare two versions of Hamlet to my Shakespeare class, and unfortunately I chose this version. Everything from acting (actors deliver most lines directly to the camera) to camera shots (all shots of mid-range or close-ups ... without landscape scenes and very little background in footage) were absolutely terrible. I watched this during the spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I have been taken off for 114 minutes of rest. It is not recommended in any way.
