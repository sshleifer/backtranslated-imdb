I bought a DVD of this movie for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the girl-spirit in this movie, and enjoys the movies about paranormal. The movie is fully recorded on the video so it looks like a special PBS. Special effects are fake, but there are some terrifying moments in the film that led us to jump into our place. There is a particularly effective fear involving the statue of the Virgin Mary. Still, the acting is bad, the scenes of "plot" are long and very boring, and I will tell you that I have no idea what happened in the end. If you get a movie, rent it, if you buy it, please pay less than $ 5.
