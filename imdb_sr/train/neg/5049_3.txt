The group watched this movie is really disgusting. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo was not on it (not that writers / producers can do anything about it). Writing was bad, the script was a sub-pair. What really shocked us: 1. When the two realized that both of them were having fun with Natalie, they not only left that stupid (and ultimately humiliating) contest - but only because they were cat competitors, not because they really wanted it alone Natalie. 2. Despite being unable to choose between two guys before gathering, Natalie suddenly decides to really love one of them and is she now ready to marry him? (and there was no indication that he was really better, as if the writers had turned the coin, and then only spit out at some kind of momentous film). 3. Blair talks about not wanting children, and then suddenly, when her husband says she wants to have children, she blissfully agrees with him.
