MOST MY GOD .. THE LARGEST SH * T AND ALWAYS SECRET - this is the main idea that came to mind immediately after watching the movie. And I really do not understand anyone with the opposite myth. Although, perhaps the idea was good, but the effect was poor. I especially think of the role of H. Graham. What was that??? In my opinion, it destroyed all the positive intentions of the manufacturer. The character played in an influential and boring way. Every time it comes up, it reminds you to watch a movie and destroy the spirit of the moment, and then the entire movie, because what you see most of the time is its stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create an emotion. TERRIBLE, do not waste your time.
