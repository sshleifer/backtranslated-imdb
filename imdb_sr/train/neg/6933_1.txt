In comparison to other Columbo films, this can be rated only 1 (horrible). I seriously do not understand what other reviewers saw in this terrible collision of the movie cart. Only by morbid fascination I continued to watch it - to see what a bizarre or incompetent decision would be ordered by the director. role. In fact, I think the real reason lies with studio bosses, who were certainly horrified when they saw what he did with their money. It's a miracle that they did not kill him.
