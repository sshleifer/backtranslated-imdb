This was a senseless movie I've ever seen because it was not complicated, and the actors did not care. 90% of the film did not have any complication, I was so laughed that my ribs began to hurt. the old men when they caught Robert Duvall were ridiculous. at the editorial level, filming a noir film does not include a lot of rain sequences and pointless close-ups on the main character. this is an unsuccessful attempt to create a noir thriller and instead repudiate the viewer with incoherent scenes. Looking at how this was based on John Grisham's "manuscript," I do not consider it one of his books for film adaptations because it does not portray any uncertain and appealing story as movies like "firm" or "umbrella".
