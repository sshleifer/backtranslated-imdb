It's a bad movie, it looks like there are only 5 policemen in the HK, they did not use a gun, and that makes me feel like Jackie Chan's movie. They used their gun all the time to point out the suspect. When they finally use their gun, they kill each other, what a funny movie. In the film, as if all the good guys died for no reason. The story of the movie is also shit, tells jumping here and there and boring people. But if you wanted to see a movie, I think this is just OK type of film, I think the American film zombie is bloody than this.
