I'm wondering what the reviewers @ IMDb gave this TV movie as a high score, just like they did. It's an innocent, sweet, uncomplicated clich√© of the movie that had two great names (both of which had a decent job), but this film is delighted with the low budget we can see every day of the week. less cable channels. I love a good romance like anyone else, but as we did my wife and I watched this - even before we saw the rating - we said: "There are people who will very much rate this movie simply because there is nothing in it to challenge their the brain, their faith, the level of their comfort, or their cultural preferences. It is possible to make a good movie like that (and Avai from Her is an example), but this was an amateur clock. True, another in a long series of desperately inadequate films holiday.
