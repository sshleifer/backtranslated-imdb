"Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in Peru's Amazon in 1955. One year later, he left the jungle ... naked. It took him 45 years to return." Allegedly, "Hold the river on the right" is a "modern cannibal story". In reality, anyone looking for an insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. The first half of the film looks more like a travelogue Nev Ginue, mostly advertising domestic art. The other half relies on photographs of the Peruvian tribe of cannibals, but this is indeed the case. Except, of course, if you are interested in home movies about a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum that represents your former lovers. I give up. A lot of disappointment, not a "modern cannibal story". - MERK
