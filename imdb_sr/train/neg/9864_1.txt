As a player, I can not say that this movie likes me. The fact is that I hate it. I tried to watch her as open as possible, but when it comes to it, it's pretty offensive to my social group. For me, there are several reasons why. 1. The characters look unnatural. I met many players, different layers of life. I do not know anyone who acts like any character in a movie. It's as if filmmakers took the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all in 5 people. Most players are social people, some with a fairly active life. 2. The style does not work. Mockumentary style is poorly adapted to the subject of the film. A real documentary about players would actually work better. Although it looks good (IE, Clean Together), it's not very good. 3. Dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It seems that any context in the real world is missing. The players swear, I confess, but we do not have Tourette's syndrome. 4. Missing humor. While self-portraying humor is the stronghold of my group and several other groups I have encountered, this is less confident, and more like humor for the toilet. Likewise, a great deal of humor for players is full of jokes and anecdotes, and not toilet humor. Most players will refrain from avoiding anyone who has made such jokes. 5. The biggest problem for me is basically this: Accuracy. I do not mean rules, but on dynamics. This film will be compared to movies that are even lower than the The Gamers and The Gamers budget: Dorkness Rising, which both show players as real people who play the actual game. The difference is that Gamers: The Movie represents a situation in which you want to beat the players meaningless against The Gamers, where you can say something like, "Huh, I know that type ... Yes, it's definitely like Garry."
