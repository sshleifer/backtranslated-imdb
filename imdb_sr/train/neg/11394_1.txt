Oh, for loud crying, this must have been the LAMEST movie I've been watching all year, and I'm sorry that otherwise terrible John Cusack was even involved in this stupid piece of stupidity. Where the insomnia in Seattle delivered what is the same message, although on a more subtle, somewhat mature level, Serendipity transmits it to the small, and then continues to break it into your psyche for the next hour and a half or more. (and this is an hour and a half of my life I will never come back again, thank you very much!). It's bad enough that the main characters of this film have a level of emotional maturity of fourteen-year-olds (I actually know better fourteen-year-olds ...), except perhaps for Jeremy Piven, who was amusing enough. Only the first fifteen minutes of the film in which the character Kate Beckinsale plays this boring stupidity of the game of throwing his sensibility on the wind (literally) had my best friend and I upset my belief. I said my husband Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least the characters in Rockstar were not half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this "accidental" mess. It is uncomfortable to watch protagonists who seem to have no idea of ​​the choice in their lives and feel that they are nothing more than a marionette of fate and despair of destiny. How extremely tiring. I'm sure this film is probably going to be enjoyed by those who do not want to embark on a chaotic confusion in making more complex life choices and then living responsibly with the consequences. After all, here is a film in which our hero and heroine live happily until the end of life only after the ravages of the lives of other people (namely their fiancé) have been ravaged, not to mention other relatives and friends, only to arrive there. <br /> <br />
