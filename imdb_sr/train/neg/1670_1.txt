The film's premise is frightening: a woman gets pregnant when she kisses a stranger in a bar. But as soon as the film starts, the awesome introductory scene confirms that it is a S-Fi TV type C film. It's a great Star Trek and a bit of X-Files, but more than anything else is bored. When the film enters the action, everything is predictable and clich√©. It looked like more than 2 partners in a bad Sci-Fi TV series. No tension and excitement, but not because of lack of experience. Only a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. Do not waste your time.
