Writer / director Bart Sibrel is based here on a can of a film that he says NASA misrepresented him. He says this shows that astronauts are playing television footage of their trip to the Moon using tricks for the camera. Astronauts were constantly on Earth's low orbit, and editors in the field made this raw shot in just a few seconds of the finished movie. Unfortunately, Sibrela's research is so reckless that he does not understand his "backstage" footage was really recorded largely from a 30 minute live broadcast (also on that roller) that saw millions, not hidden in NASA's vaults as he implies. And we have to wonder why Sibrel puts his conspiracy story about the astronaut's sound in the footage, because the astronaut's hearing with his own words clearly shows that the astronauts just tested the camera, not playing shots. In the end, everyone can see raw recordings for themselves without the need to buy Sibrelov's hacked version. (He shows you more about Zapruder's film about the murder of JFK than about his "smoking gun.") Sibrel thinks he is the only one who saw him. What is even more revealing are the clips from this raw material that Sibel chose to DO NOT use, such as those that clearly indicate that the Earth is distant from the window and so on, destroying his claim that mats and foils are placed in the windows of the spacecraft It creates the illusion of the distant Earth. As with most of the films of this type, Sibrel rely on allusions, unprofessional assumptions, wrong comments and selective quotes to manipulate the viewer to accept the conclusion for which there is no fragment of real evidence.
