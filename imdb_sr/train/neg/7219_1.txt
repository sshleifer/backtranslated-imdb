I still find it hard to realize that the film is as bad as it could be done in Hollywood. The acting and story are simply pathetic and the direction is terrible. I do not see any logic behind this garbage, except that the director had nothing to do. It took me ten minutes to figure out that I lost thirty rupees. It filled me with disappointment that I would spend more time in my life on this shit. I bet the movie was shot in less than a day. I do not know which category it belongs to. Please avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, even hit your walls, but do not go to this movie.
