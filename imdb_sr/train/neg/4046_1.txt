What an insult to the SA film industry! I saw better SA movies. Comments I've read about Hijack Stories, saying that it's worth ten out of ten is pretty scary. The rating of the film should not depend on ..., "OH, THE FILM FROM THE DEVELOPING COUNTRY. TROUBE THEIR INDUSTRY, BY THE NECESSARY THINGS ON THEIR WORK, EVEN THAT IS THE LOW." We have the expertise to make good films. Do not judge the film industry about what people say is how big Hijack Stories are. We can tell great stories like Cri, loved country and Shaka Zulu. Crying to the beloved country I will give 9 out of 10. Great director Darrila, great acting two great older actors, no matter where they are from. Hijack Stories .., I will give 1 of 10. It could only be people involved in a project that would give him high scores. And I would do the same if it was my movie.
