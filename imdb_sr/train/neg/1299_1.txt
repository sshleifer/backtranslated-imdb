This production has absolutely no story. The act is unpleasant. Promising Dutch TV Sophie Hilbrand should not add this film to her CV. Her acting is far from flawless and personally I think she has crossed the boundaries of professional competence; in connection with the way he is exposed in this film. This film contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sexual scenes, and raw language. It also shows the wrong picture of the Netherlands (like most films). Do not try to watch this movie: time loss, money loss, and an unpleasant record for Hilbrand, which proved to be better with her on the screen.
