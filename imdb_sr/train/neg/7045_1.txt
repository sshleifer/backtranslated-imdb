This must be the worst, and I think the worst biker movie ever made! And that's a lot of talk because the line of scoundrels is long and stinking! Now at least we know what happened to Ginger after being saved from Gilligan's Island! Scared Tina Luiz (she was probably afraid someone would see this mess!) She is a motorized driver who is struck by the most disturbing motorcycle gang in the history of the movie. But do not worry about the fans! Batman, I think Adam West is a doctor coming to town! Pov! Break! Boom! Saint Toledo Batman! The only good side of this "bomb" are some sweet women, some funny fighting scenes, and still "sexy" Tina Louise!
