I watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lbs and House, M. D. .. Tucci's character is brilliant, but socially incapable of choice, similar to Lauri's character House, but without the nonsense Laurie brings to House. In the meantime, Tucci's "real guy", unequivocal Dr. Seger, did not grow into a more interesting figure, such as Cuddy and Wilson who made a mistake. Character Indira Varme, Adrienne Holland, is too similar to Dr. Jennifer Morrison, Cameron, to be a coincidence. Someone in CBS obviously noticed the success of House, MD and told his staff to capture him. similar performances, hoping that mimicry will prove to be successful. However, copying a show such as House requires the same balance of high level of wit and uncertainty, and Tucci and the company are simply not challenging. I did not know that the show was canceled until I read the comment on the IMDb, but it does not come as a surprise to me.
