At first glance, it leaves the impression that this will be ridiculous blinking, and contains the moments in which it moves in that direction. However, the basic idea of ​​a story is much stronger than one could expect and represents a respectable effort in raising the issue of the World War II military. The recognizable actor is a hit and a failure, with Glinn Turman, Richard Prior, and poorly used Billi Dee Villiams who agree best. Stephen Boyd, however, stops only when he turns his chips into an exaggerated star. Obviously low budget leads to inconsistencies in production value. Locations are large, effects and actions are weak. Imagine that "Saving Private Rian" consisted of half the water that was killed exactly in the same way that Caparzo Vin Diesel had (except that we can see the shot because the effects can not stand), then Hanks, Damon and Burns drove around Jeep and killed five Germans for the peak. However, the outburst, with heroic soldiers who do not respect their achievements because they are black, and Boe's racist captain who deals with it, is convincing, as are Turman's characters who write in the magazine of his imaginary explosions if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead bathing toilet. In short, the "Black Brigade / Carter's Armi" does not work perfectly. But this is a notable failure, not a bad joke. It can be transformed as a very good movie, and as it stands, it's an interesting effort.
