This stinging melodrama is quite easily the worst film in which Ingrid Bergman plays I saw. Even her brilliant presence on the screen can not preserve this unbearable slow and twisting film that is almost impossible to pass without much to be transmitted. Only for stubborn Bergman fans; others will probably fall asleep. I suggest you watch "Who you are ringing for."
