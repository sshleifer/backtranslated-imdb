Rebellion of zombies is bad. There's nothing fun about the movie. She is boring, lifeless, badly and badly written. I often complained that the original Dracula is a bit slow for my taste, but this movie makes Dracula look like a slide ride. It took 165 minutes for 65 minutes. Story: An expedition was sent to Cambodia to uncover the secrets of mind control through "zombification". One man finds a secret and uses it to make the woman she loves marry him. When this happens, he releases zombies under his control to horrible consequences. That's it. That's the whole story. For most of the film, I was trying to figure out where I saw the male head. He seemed so familiar. I had enough time to think about this. Nothing happened in the movie. Just before the "zombies rebelled," it hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I've seen him recently as a general in White Christmas. So I "entertained" during most of the film. I'm glad I did not buy a DVD for this movie. The king of zombies on the other hand is a masterpiece of filming films in relation to this film. It's worth it, I'll give him 2/10. (I will not go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, I've seen it up.)
