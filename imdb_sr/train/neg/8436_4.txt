David Mamet is a very interesting and very unequal director. His first movie "House of Games" was the one I liked most, and he set up a series of films with characters whose perspective of life is changing as they enter into complicated situations, as well as the perspective of the viewer. br >> So it is also the "murder" that from the title tries to distract the observer's mind in the usual criminal drama. The main characters are two policemen, one Jew and one Irishman dealing with the racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish store owner who turned out to be an old war veteran of Israeli independence provokes a Jewish identity in the mind and heart of a Jewish detective. These were film defects. are more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and difficult to believe, a group of Jewish militants is operative, and the way that the detective finally goes to the final violent conflict is pathetic. The end of the film itself is as smart as Mamet, but it disappoints with the human emotional perspective. .
