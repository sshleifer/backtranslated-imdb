This is a movie about how men think women think of love. No woman describes a sexual encounter for one night and declares him a love story. Of the ten monologues I felt that only three really had any truth through them. I always waited for the film to be better, and that did little, but never better. This is an interesting concept, and I continued to want it to be good, but it never succeeded. Perhaps they really loved stories, that would help them.
