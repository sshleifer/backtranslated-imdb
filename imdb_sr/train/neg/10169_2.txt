It's 1978 and obviously there are too many black players in the teams! The fans will be upset and surely 75,000 places will be full, only less fortunate that there are so many black players in the field! This is made for a TV Super Bovl film that can be watched. It's not much more, but it's really surprising that the actors of talented actors who appear (at that time), probably the most significant Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, every good Selleck brings on the screen, quickly cast "actors" like Dick Butkus. It's a stupid story about super balls. PJ Jackson charges "New York" (read the mafia) to ensure the end of the game for their service, in this case $ 10,000,000 bets. PJ is innocent enough, and seems to have a loose understanding by buying a few people here and there. But things seem to be falling apart for him. The other person, unexpected Lainie, takes responsibility. For some time, the mystery of murders is not certain, but it is revealed quite clearly on the last assassination that Lainie is a new antagonist. It's a bad movie, but it's visible. The acting is decent, and the recording is fine. At least there were no typical automobile pursuits of the 70s (they only have their place here). Just be open about past stereotypes and cocaine era and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 2.5)
