I love movies. I love independent efforts and great studio productions. I love films with stars and I love those with strangers. I love drama, comedy, action adventure, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, any genre except horror. I like foreign movies, as well as those in English. I love good movies and I love even bad, because almost no movie can not entertain or entertain at some level. Except "Covgirls Get the Blues." When I attended the late night performances "Covgirls", I joined the audience of about 10. Less than half way to that, I was alone. Soon, even I could not tolerate the disturbing mess that unfolds before my eyes, and I'm gone. To this day, "Covgirls" remains the only film I have ever left. I do not know how to describe this incoherent, empty, worthless, senseless movie, or how to adequately convey its lack of redemption value. Suffice it to say that this is one of the worst big movies of all time, absurd and unpredictable at every level. She tries to be smart, but her conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. Trying to be funny, but humor is rude and brave. This is one of the few films that manages to profane their own ethos, showing the protagonists in such a way that they rebel against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, watch "Vatervorld", "Ishtar", all but this. Except for the new "Alexander". If you choose between this and this, read the book instead.
