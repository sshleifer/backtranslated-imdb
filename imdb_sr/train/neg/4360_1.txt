First of all, I have to say that I had to think a lot about writing comments for this movie. The best criticism for this kind of film is just silence. The film is intended for housewives and grandmothers. This film is trying to look "honest" and the characters should be "real people". The Italian would never have thought that the characters could be "real": they are just "weak" stereotypes. It gives a very misguided vision of what life is in an Italian village. The action is poor (complication? What a plot?), And humor does not make laughter to anyone over 12 years old.
