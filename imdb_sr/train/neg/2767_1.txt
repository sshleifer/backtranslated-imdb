This film is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life - surprising the previous film that was dumbest, "Spavn of Slithis", which I saw when I was about 10. Bad acting, stiff and funny dialogue, incomprehensible plot, mishmashed cut scene, even the music was boring. Did I leave something? Well, special effects were not bad - but CGI does not make a decent movie. I can not believe I actually spent money to watch this movie. If someone has contact information for Hiung-rae Shim (Director), please forward it to my gmail username, and I will contact him to personally request a refund.
