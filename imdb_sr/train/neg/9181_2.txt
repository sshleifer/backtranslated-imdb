I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my GOG !!! This was the worst movie I ever saw. Bad acting, bad effects, bad scenario, all bad! The action follows a group of teenage clich√©s on the road to rave (taking place in the middle of a white day) on a remote island. However, when the group arrives, they find only empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the other parties, the clan went on a mission through a zombie forest. During this crusade, they are assisted by the police and the marine captain who have the right weaponry for every child. They also meet with Jonathan Cherra and some other survivors. In essence, the rest of the film is a collection of poorly-targeted action scenes, including too long shooting outside the "dead house". This fight came along with raw Hollywood violence, redundant pics from HOTD video games and messy rotating cameras. One of the characters is even a volunteer to sacrifice to save others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face was acid-damaged, the zombie spat it after he continued to beat the creature long after he was disabled! Should I be sorry for this guy?!? All in all, there's absolutely no point in watching this movie, unless you want to see for yourself how horrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure that the money I lost by watching this piece of chick could easily cover the costs that were supposed to be made. GRADE: F
