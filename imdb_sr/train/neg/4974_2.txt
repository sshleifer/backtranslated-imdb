Let the saints save us, because this film will not help. Someone with access should send an email to Mel Gibson and tell him that we need faithful production of Beovulf. Something that actually has something in common with the epic song that is the basis for contemporary Western literature. The recent (since 2000) versions of Beovulf make us wonder two things. First, why there is so much interest in the story. Secondly, why all these filmmakers are spending cash plans on this shit. The only reason they got two was that the version with Lambert in it (Beovulf 2000) was worse and it needed 1. <. Worse yet, some people will watch this and get the wrong idea about the song. As an industry in which Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion into a movie so the law can be misunderstood so wrongly. I mean, the Roman Forum as a model for Heorota is too much. And please, horns on helmets? Spare me. This is insulting. <br /> <br /> / hjm
