I also saw this film at the local screening about a year ago. First I'll say it looks great. Cassella is an incredibly talented and fantastic cameraman. I wish the movie was as good as it looks. I would not call it a horror movie. Putting a few shots of a rotten spirit does not make it a horror movie. There is no mystery, no tension, you know who worked all the time. It's a drama. You know what's happening on both sides of the whole movie. The acting was fine, I suppose, but nothing special. And the label "Revenge can be deadly" .... really? ... they should have checked how many hundreds of horror / trillers The same movie had the same badge? It hurts me to say something about it, but I know many people who worked on this movie, and I know they do not want people to blow their ass, so I give my honest opinion.
