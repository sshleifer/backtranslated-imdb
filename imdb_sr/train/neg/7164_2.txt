This movie is much more glaring than ever, using a tense actor like Voken to play in this piece of garbage, it seems that he had nothing better than playing a boring role like this one! The fact that the movie should have been about a witch and that you really do not see it almost to the end of the movie, and in the meantime you have to sit and watch this boring movie as it gets, or you're trying to get to the point and you need to go through this whole track boring actors and actresses thinking of how much you have gone through another film and decided for this and how you have just diminished your money just makes the sense of time useless sitting there. I'd rather watch cartoons for goodness. Leave this alone, please!
