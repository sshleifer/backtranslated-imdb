Until the last 20 minutes, I thought this may be the worst movie of Jackie Chan (excluding his work before 1978, which I'm not familiar with). The last order of the battle has changed everything: it's long, good, and intense - indeed, one of the peaks of Chan's career. But to get to that, you have to go through a lot of "comedy" that could entertain five-year-olds (oh, look! Someone threw a tomato on the face of that guy) and an endless "football" scene. Not to mention synchronization (which includes the line "How can I turn off? Not tapping" - watch to find out what it refers to). "Dragon Lord" is worth renting only for the final fight, but the rest of the film is only for Jackie collectors, and even then only for those who have already seen at least 15 of his other films.
