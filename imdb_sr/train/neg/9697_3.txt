I saw the first dwarf movie, and sometimes I had a little fun watching him. In the first part there are numerous famous TV / comedians who are presented in fantastic costumes, typical small episodes of their Stand-Up program, and this is precisely the problem with which the other film must fight. Everything was already there ... nothing new to get. You know most of the most often boring and stupid "jokes" and you always feel like their goal was to get in every comedian of the last decade and who wants to go back to the stage. There is nothing in the story: a typical fairy tale about Rumpelstiltskin, without any significance. I expected something like that, but that was nothing I could regret. In fact, I'm sorry for the lazy people who had the whole background story; Their only job was to get a lot of jokes and parodies in, but they did not get it anyway. This shit is just the great appearance of Helge Schneider who wastes time and money. (If you do not like it, remove 2 points of my assessment) If you want to save money and get bad jokes, then watch shit broad cast every Friday night on SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you'll recognize some of the "laugers" I saw last night at the cinema.
