I really liked ZB1. Really, I did. I have no problems with films with extremely low budget, and I enjoyed movies with poorer production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing, check out 'wise zombies' if you're interested). Indeed, I prefer zombie films of a lower budget, because I doubt Hollywood director's do not understand what zombies are. But ZB3 was so bad. It was retarded. I do not want to try to be dignified in my criticisms. I want my 90 minutes back, etc. Except that it took only ~ 80 minutes, because I put it in the passage at a speed of 1.4Ks. Well, here are some reviews. <p> 1. Pacing was TERRIBLE. Everyone spoke in monologues. Even when someone had only one line, the operation of the camera, and the editing and insertion of the crowd of F-bombs in each sentence made the FEEL line as a monologue. Initially I was excited about 90 minutes of driving compared to 70 minutes ZB1, but there were actually fewer events in ZB3. Everything speaks. 2. The effects of the above have become duller. Just glue through the stomach of people. 3. In spite of the epic presentation, there was really no complication. And the show is truly epic! I will not spoil it if you watch it. (Do not look at it.) But then, it's just a bunch of lame characters walking around for about 80 minutes. or less, if so selected.
