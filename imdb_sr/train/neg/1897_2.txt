This was a horrible movie! I gave her 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie and the other for the beautiful Porsche in the beginning ... Apart from the fact that the story is just plain sucked and cars that ride through the towns were not so new in the 1970s. I was the most irritated, rarely seen something so constructed!
