Taking into account the original movie version of The Haunting, it's in my first ten films of all time. I approached this adaptation with anxiety. The original is scary for me as a child for one reason! You can not see anything. Robert Vise has used an innovative camera and superb lighting to generate fear and therefore works. She relies on smart special effects and pyrotechnics to come from A to B, it's even more sad that the ingredients there (actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) did something else. !
