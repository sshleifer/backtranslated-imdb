This film reminds me of many anti-drug films in the 50s and 60s due to the fact that they were made by people who obviously never experienced social evil that they warn us. Tom Hanks and his comrades are "playing roles," but there are no cubes, lots of candles, and then you're just taken to a poor editing that shows Hanks falling for the lady in the group. pretty funny or wrong. I wonder how poor children have ruined their D & D stuff and told them that their imagination is the way to destruction. As a movie, it's basically a special, bad act (though Hanks shows some of his talents) and conversations about relationships, and no one seems to be having fun. These films seem to have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the path to adultism, which is obviously more serious, and it requires you to get down and do what everyone else is doing. In spite of my voice of 2, this is worth watching thanks to its unique genre, movies that are scared, which is to me personally very fun.
