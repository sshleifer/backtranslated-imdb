Forgive me what I say obviously, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course, there are extremes within these two broad categories. Movies such as The Godfather, Saving Private Rian and Star Vars are conveniently classified in a good category. At the other end of the spectrum there are movies that simply do not deserve to be mentioned by name. Occasionally, however, someone is truly a sad movie. A film that should be highlighted as a demonstration of how a movie can be horrible. A film that's more than bad. Such a film is Maiden Voiage. In short, Maiden Voiage is a story of a luxury cruise taken by a gang of criminals who seek ransom from the equally wicked owner of a ship. Of course, there is an American hero on board, complete with carved fork and sculptures that save the day. This is a production that brings new depths. Everything is bad. The acting, direction and so-called action are poor in breath. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of every unhappy observer. Even the American viewer would be angry about his shortcomings. Yes, it's so bad. I resist the temptation to compile a list of things that made me angry for this movie. . However, his stupid conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I think. Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and that you stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. . You're in company with a hero who holds a bomb that ticks. He said that your hero is throwing a bomb and throwing himself into the sea. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I would throw a bomb as much as I can into the sea. Not this guy. He sees our hero swimming and then trying to disarm the bomb with unhappy (for him) results. He said enough. Such death should be mentioned on the Darwin Awards website and could be a suitable conclusion about the lives of the production team.
