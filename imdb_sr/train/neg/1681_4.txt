The assassin on the highway is a madman shooting on the highway while shouting a bunch of mystical singing on the car. Police believe he is a casual killer, but Sunni, the blue heroine played by Darlanne Fluegel, discovers the pattern. Like a former policeman, played by James Russo, they also join forces and bodies in search of a criminal who has removed his spouses. Also starring Richard Belzer, this movie has its moments especially if you love car hunt, but it really is not a good movie for the majority, check if you're really bored and you've already seen Hitcher, Joi Ride, or Breakdown otherwise keep away from the highway.
