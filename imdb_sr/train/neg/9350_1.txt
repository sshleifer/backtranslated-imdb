This film was terrible. The first half hour is like ... well, an apology for lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of A Clockvork Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork! Apparently it was a tidal, according to the appearance of the Clockvork poster on the protagonist's wall, however, "ripoff" is more appropriate. The film felt as though it had been separated by Kubrick's classic, shot only through the eyes of the new director. A blind director. Unfortunately, when it stops the massacre of Kubrick's work, the film becomes even worse. As the other commentator said, the depth of this film was just pushed down the throat. Arrogant, self-satisfied and ultimately meaningless whimpering. Perhaps the protagonists would wander around touching their nerves if there was real character development in this film. I did not feel absolutely anything for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I think if anyone could feel anything for him, that would be me. Character development, dialogue and plot. The worst part of this movie is the title. For a movie titled "16 Years of Alcohol", alcoholism is barely a factor in the film. See the first paragraph - it was such a shelter A Clockvork Orange that it can not get over it. A more suitable title would be "16 years of violence," or, better still, "A Clockwork Banana". Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you ignore my advice and take it anyway, drink it. Trust me.
