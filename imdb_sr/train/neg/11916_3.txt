Iuck. I thought it was strange that their ancient book of curses was made using an ordinary font instead of a written hand. The acting is sometimes so apathetic and so dramatic in other times. Why would the "demons" kill two suspicious quiet doctors who helped him to make him immortal? Just because of that? And is it really necessary to show Lilit's engine whenever it is anywhere. We understand! You spent a little money to rent a third-degree rocket. That does not mean you have to show it all the time! The "Faith's" den is like the old Battlestar Galactica school with a few changes at the last minute. There is a scene in which we met a few people to talk about 30 seconds before they were killed for no apparent reason and without any relevance. Everyone is throwing. Unforgettable characters and even more unforgettable plot make this film one of the weakest imaginative films I've ever seen with the SciFi Channel. Keep on going, unless you're in bad movies.
