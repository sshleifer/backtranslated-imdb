Well, I would lie if I said that it could easily be confronted with Spiderman or Batman movies. Still, I was more attracted to his moral value. First I bought VHS when my son was about 2 years old and immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are Robert Tovnsend's passionate admirers and since she used credit cards to finance her first movie, "Hollivood Shuffle". True, he needs to use the talents and knowledge of technical advisers to make the movies more convincing, but his films are even more entertaining. Meteor Man provides heroes with Urban Contemporari feeling. I always felt that, if there were superheroes, they would not give the same scenarios as they were shown in the comic book. Meteor Man is a real hero with real problems: auto broken, bad environment, local gangs dealing with drugs and using children for distribution, etc. The scope of his mission has remained fairly within the community. It was discovered that it's really fun, beyond the performance of James Earl Jones, "how young people" respond to his newly discovered powers. It did not take much time before they had the whole order for him, without his contribution, of course. It was hilarious to hear how to offer it to other communities in which their extended families live. with my children # 1. Robert Tovnsend is working to bring the movies home. I doubt that he will ever be truly recognized as a talented actor / producer / director who really is, but there are always those who love him for his efforts. film, which I find to be fun: During the whole battle with Simone, nobody tried to call the police ???? Also, what does your mother and father know to see their son struggling with the window? My mother would be here, she would have been removed with me, a toe. Daddy would fill his pistol. lol <br /> Rent it and check it out. It's worth at least once and good for those who are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc.
