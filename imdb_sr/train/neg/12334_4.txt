The premise is ridiculous, the characters are incredible, the dialogue is wobbly, and the absurd end. Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Kline, but watch him say the real Pepe Le Pev's emphasis in 2 hours as the presumed Frenchman is not nearly as entertaining as it sounds. For her part, Meg Rian is again rude and lovely (choose): kevpie doll, baby, puppy, kitty, whatever you think is the sweetest creature on earth. It also does not look like a real human being. This film seems to me as a chance that friends Lavrence Kasdan and Kline used for a holiday in Paris and in the south of France, while they were well paid. So I can not blame them.
