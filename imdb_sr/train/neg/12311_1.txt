I know that I already added a comment, but I just wanted to clarify something ... I'm not an old foggy generation of Babi Boom, who grew up adhering to the blinking b / w image of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, etc. Bilko was already 20 years before I was born, but I had the pleasure of discovering Phil Silver Bilko thanks to BBC2. I wonder if I would enjoy the grass of Steve Martin, if I had not seen or heard of Phil Silvers - I do not know - I might have it. Some other reviewers who think this film is worthy of the '10' recognition that they did not see the original. I can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching one episode. If after watching the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshava, Dina, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin and others, you still think that Steve Martin's movie is something above '2' - I stand you a pint ....
