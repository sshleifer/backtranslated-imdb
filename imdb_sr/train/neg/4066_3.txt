In Eric Stanze's editorial "ISOIC, IPOIG", three men were subjected to torture in the hands of a woman that they were all sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat her own shit before she is killed. The next guy ended up with a bullet in the bumps after he refused anal sex with the body of the first guy. But that's the third man who gets him the worst: he has to watch the tattooed 'star' Emily Haack naked and masturbated with the handle of a broom (oh, he also gets a lunch by pushing him in his ass!). > And, unfortunately, so do we (we see how masturbating, that means we do not get brooms for our asses!). Yes, 'ISOIC, IPOIG' is a sharp viewing experience, not because of its relentless violence, but because it is Haack, which is obviously under the wrong idea of ​​having the body of the goddess (unlike the one for travelers for Metallica) is constantly bare for the camera. This is not a convenient sight. In addition to the non-stop nudging from the hacked Haack, viewers can also see the terrible direction of Stanzee (who thinks endless footage of tombstones and trees). it's very fun), some really bad acting and a thick penis. Presumably, I give "ISOIC, IPOIG" rating of 3/10, which is actually a little more than the current 2.9 average. That's one thing for a messy attack (which, while I was a goat, really enjoyed it); one point for the part where a fat man pushes his face in a chocolate mousse masked like an ejection (ridiculous); and one point for pure courage to suggest that this film could be a continuation of Meir Zarchi's superior exploitation of classics and Spit On Iour Grave.
