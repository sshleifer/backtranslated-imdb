The patient escaped from a psychiatric hospital, killing one of his guards, and then a university professor after breaking into a local college. The next semester, the replacement of the late profession and a new group of students must face a new group of murders. The dialogue is so clich√© that it's hard to believe that I managed to predict the lines in quotation marks. This is one of those cheap movies that were thrown together in the middle of the late 80's. Despite killing a heroine, this is just poor quality trash. Terrible acting, horrible script, terrible effects, terribly horrible! "Splatter University" is just a gunk to put in your VCR when you do not have anything to do, even though I suggest you watch a head cleaning pane, which would be more fun. Skip it and rent "Girl's Nite Out" instead. Rated R for strong graphic violence, disrepute, short nagging and sexual situations.
