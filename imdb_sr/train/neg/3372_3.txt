The pale shadow of a great musical, this film suffers from the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the meaning of a musical, unnecessarily "opens" it, and blurs the play's move. The show deals with a group of dancers at audition for a job at B'vai Musical and examines their desire and desire to work in this demanding and not always-rewarding job. Attenborough gives us fresh actors of hope, assuming they are trying to get their "big break" in a show business, instead of presenting a sandy combination of characters created on the scene as a group of active "gypsy" live shows that will be shown along with several newcomers. The film has one advantage over the show, and this is the introductory scene, which shows the size of the original audition and the right scale of reduction to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count Cassie, which is stupidly kept out in the movie). Anyone who can capture a local personal opera in producing a play will have a much richer experience than seeing this badly designed movie.
