Where to start ... If this film was a dark comedy, I'd say it's FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and for all those who have free time and money available (given that I paid, I got it from Val-Mart), this film should have been a thriller. The only THRILL I got was to watch Kirkland's poor interpretation of Anne Wilkes from Misery Sansi Snovland Area. If you want a good laugh, on a rainy Friday night with some friends, then I recommend this movie. But if you want to watch something at least halfway decent, then do not even bother. I am for one enjoying the shitty movies, which is worse the better in most cases. But Vov ... I thought VOV !! The only person in the whole film who did not stink was the boy played by Vincent Berry. The only reason I gave him three stars is because he has given me something to do.
