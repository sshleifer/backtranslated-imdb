This film was very boring. At least 15 minutes. The pictures of the child and the animals that were killed were a bit disturbing. I think that in this case, we are one step closer to the honest assessment of this title. What else can I say? I fell asleep during this film 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from an 8 hour long sleeping period. I think it's by itself. There is no dialogue between characters except perhaps two sentences at the very end. Rewrite and compensate because you will fall asleep again.
