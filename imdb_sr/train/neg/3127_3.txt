An archeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally stumbled upon an ancient 40-foot mummy, a well-preserved underworld in the desert of Nevada. They are determined to keep this secret and invite the Jewish translator to help discover history. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and one of the few giants that apparently existed in those "days". In order to save his son from a devastating flood that was supposed to kill everyone, he murmurs his son for several centuries, burying him with several officers - planning to wake him from that time. In our present time, the fallen angels continue to walk around the earth, the mummy is rising and it is expected that a ritual will be held. Much of the film is slow, it has to do with a lot of Bible shit and a couple of bad, fighting strokes. The mummy is decent, but it does not show enough. It should have had more to do with it, but a lot of things went on ... eh. Do not bother.
