This film is a cold reminder that Bollivood is just Hollywood's parasite. Bollivood also has a tendency to feed past blockbusters to improve their industry. Vidhu Vinod Chopra made this film with the reason that the cocktail "Deevar" and "On the Waterfront" will bring Oscara home. It turned out to be a starting error. Even the title idea is inspired by the classic Elijah Kazan. In the original, Brando is portrayed as raising pigeons as a symbol of peace. Bolivud has to leave the shadow of Hollywood if it needs to be taken seriously.
