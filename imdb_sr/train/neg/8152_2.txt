"Do not Drink Water" is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on Broadway's drama from 1966. Voodie Allen. She plays Jackie Gleason, a comedy genius behind "The Honeimooners". The director, Hovard Morris, appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies (Life Stinks, High Ankieti, Silent Movie) and made a trace in animation (the characters he uttered include Gopher from Pooh, Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey) went wrong? I think the problem is that the premise takes place too seriously to be effective. Allen's original performance was a tongue-in-the-face, and for that reason she worked on Broadway and Allen's remake from 1994. Scenario R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beat the premise to death and make too many changes to the original game. Getting Gleason's wife in the head in this version when the stubborn woman was in the original is just one of the reasons why this does not work. The performance is not much better. Gleason does the best he can with the material, but he can not save it. Gleason was a comic genius, but also a good actor, as he demonstrated in "Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain" movie. His abrasive personality could work here, but a bad script does not even give him a chance. A pity. Estelle Parsons's wife on your head will crawl you after 20 minutes. See how quickly you will need to strangle her. It's also embarrassing because she is a fine actress, who turned into two exceptional performances in "Bonnie and Clide" and "Rachel, Rachel". None of the other actors is particularly good. Voodoo Allen hated this film so much that in 1994 he reorganized the movie with himself and Julie Cowner (Marge Simpson) in the water. They are able to hit all the right notes, and the film itself is a comedy masterpiece. Finally, on the video after a long battle over the law. Go and find this version. Everything original originally from 1969 is good for cleaning unwanted guests who stop receiving a welcome. 1/2 * of 4 stars
