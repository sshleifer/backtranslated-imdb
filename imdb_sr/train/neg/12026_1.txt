I really want to, when I make a comedy, people actually tried to make it funny. This is a movie through which you can sit, but nothing is special. After watching, you will say that it was okay. It was not boring to watch, but gave the audience a joke to laugh. Fun should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. do it. This film wanted to be "Tootsie", but instead he failed. I gave him 1 of 10.
