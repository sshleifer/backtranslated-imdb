Without a doubt, this is one of the worst pictures I've ever paid to see - the kind of movie that you select from despair to a movie downtown during the Christmas holidays when you missed the starting time for something good, but they are still dead ready to watch the film! And that's exactly how I came to see this stink bomb ... <br /> <br /> away from most of the three decades can still feel rotten fish that makes this story. An incredible complication - the killer whale carries the crimes against the individual rather than the sea - is ridiculous. And that's all, apart from being a "strange" love theme "that takes place at the end of the movie without a love story. The bar is Charlotte Rampling beautiful (in a two-dimensional role), or Richard Harris only chew the scenery. He was Captain Quint (Robert Shav) and this is not Chelsea. Fortunately, I threw most of it out of my mind and when I rolled over on TV shows, I immediately started. "Danger, Vill Robinson!" Look at the current TV show showing husband and wife watching whales ( "Orca - Orca love ...") - at least over in sixty seconds. This film rep announces 92 minutes of my life that I will never go back.
