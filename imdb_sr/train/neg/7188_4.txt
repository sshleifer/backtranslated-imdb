When I saw the title that I thought we would get another tester-hip-slasher, I actually found the "7events 5ive" to be mildly passable, and almost 80 years after a bored slow mid-range swing for the last half an hour, which is it has led to an incredibly sticky climax and an end to it. He will not win prizes for originality, as he is systematic as you can get and steal his thunder in the path of excitement (the usual cheap jumps), the location (isolated fairies) and the motivation from other films. The shimmering direction is a book, and the material is rather scarce with poorly realized red haringams in its complex drawing and a bad letter. Sometimes it was funny, but nevertheless I was having fun mostly because of its brutal and terrible acts of violent behavior toward some rather unpleasantly boring students by a psychotic killer with a battle ax. The performances were not bad in the form of a brave young actor, but the characters they were displaying were not particularly tempting. Always present Rutger Hauer appears in short support as a spilled detective. Slickli made, but a shallow and unforgettable addition to the foll.
