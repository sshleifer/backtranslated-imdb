Another of my teasing in a cheap bun, this film gave me exactly what I expected - a burst of horrible horror with a screaming lady. Everything started so well - I liked the little introduction with "" a young couple who was exposed to a nuclear explosion, and was completely absorbed until the first person started up ... <br /> < From then on, the film went down into open nonsense, and sometimes it became almost embarrassing to watch. When it turned out that the heroine was affected by the same condition as the main character (the ability to illuminate his own fart without the help of the game), it seemed that someone at the last moment threw the idea ("You will be good!") You can almost hear them say ...) As for the almost psychic relationship between the protagonist and the nuclear power plant, well ... The film came on cheap movies. Thats - if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 for what you did.
