How sad it is to see the beautiful and talented Tina Luiz down to this horrible excuse for the film. Tina still looked in shape and attractive, but for some reason she looks genuinely scared. I can understand her fear; fearing that this stinker third rate would somehow be released to the public. Also, I am a fan of the lovely Adam Vesta. Again, like Tina, Adam looks good and in great shape for a man of his age. His acting here is passable, but the script is so bad, it's hard to even listen to the dialogue. The film is a rip-off of the classic Brando biker, Vild Ones; a biker gang outside the law is out of control in a small town. Bikers here look like a diverse group and I certainly would not want to go out with my sister. The acting is stiff and woody, and the story is as old as the sand. Hellriders is hell for watching!
