Abismal with a big "A". This must be one of the, if not the brightest shov on television. It's about me like the shrubs, but this show is not even laughing at me. What you think of Bush as president is absolutely nothing to do with whether you like this piece of shit. "Jokes" are not ridiculous at all. For example, in the scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head: "Welcome to camp al-ka-eed!". There is nothing funny about it. Should there be a joke at all? The ads that were shown on Sunday preceding the show were more entertaining than the show itself, and it's just sad. I hope this is not even considered for the second season. You should not have first.
