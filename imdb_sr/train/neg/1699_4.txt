I'm a little fan of Linche's work, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It's a series of short cartoons that try to show a disturbing and disgusting type of humor. The animation is very rough, no doubt made with Macromedia. Each cartoon has a big fat boy who fights his family and generally acts like an asshole to everyone he knows. For people who do not know this vein of animation, they will probably be somewhat impressed with it. However, if you spend a lot of time on Nevgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons will not be different from any other things you've seen before. Many popular amateur artists at Nevgrounds are doing much better than what is shown on this DVD. If Linch sent this work to a website, then he would fit perfectly with some of the best Nevgrounds artists. But since I've seen this on DVD, instead of at Nevgrounds, I give it 4/10, instead of 7/10, as I would otherwise. These cartoons are suitable for the Internet, but with a name like David Linch on it, I expected better quality in both story and animation.
