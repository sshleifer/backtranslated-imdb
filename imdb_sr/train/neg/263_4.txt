After a day at work, I sat down to relax and turn on movie channels. The film appeared on the guide and it sounded interesting, so I switched on just before the beginning. The first 30 minutes were enough to interest me, but due to the lack of acting skills in Jamie Fokk and the slow movement of the action, I wanted to wake up and find food during the film. If there is any credit for acting in this film, you should address David Morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting. All in all, do not plan to impress your friends by choosing this one as a movie night owner.
