This is a film about animal cruelty. Under the guise of a marathon race we see images of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death. The guy who did that, then his conscience is spiritually cleansed by the flame of burial / burning of a horse, which is of course still dead, after being tortured to death. This is one of the weakest, toughest films I've ever had to have discontent with watching. Like Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the target line on their DIING animals, we need to admire their spirit to finish the race. I would like to produce and direct in the marathon race; I'll decide when they're done, probably about 20 minutes after stopping my breathing.
