I have to persuade this by saying that I am a great romantic. That's why I really wanted to love this film. So I write my thoughts to save you others from the disappointment I felt watching him. The whole year speaks of the fate of a fulfilled story about Li-Ann who falls in love with Jeremiah and pledges to meet with each passing year. A very romantic premise, based on a big short story and an actor who does not seem to be watching another Jack Neo movie. Why is it so bad then? First, I feel that filmmakers thought they were recording a musical spot because they decided to replace narration and all true emotions with raw editions, predictable actions and clich√© lines. I was both upset and confused that I was one of the first in Singapore to watch the Year of the Year, but I would agree with the cinema that our muffled sighs in touching performances spoke a volume. I was hoping to watch a romantic movie that would surpass Forever Fever, the best of Singapore's romantic comedy so far, and the offensive years are not even approaching. Some blogs have called it The Crap Iears, which is raw, but ultimately true. Do not spend money or emotions like me. The movie will forever give up love.
