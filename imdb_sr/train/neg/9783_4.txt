Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely not very good. I am a paintball player, I often played airball, and from wood to airball it is a big change. The film shows similar qualities. First of all, the film begins with a team that obviously tries to kill this "phantom" type or anything else, it seems like a professional team wearing shirts and shots, autocoakers. One guy is sporty. It's not much wrong in the film, but more about how it was perceived was very sore. A lot of kids who are good guys are players on a tree that does not seem to have much money and have dreams to get a "better weapon". The other team constantly takes them and insults them because they play forest and blah blah. The boy helps these boys fight for them and train them and all that shit, causes them to play airball and actually defeat all teams including "professionals". So what's true with the movie? Well, the budget is a huge thing, and the paintball movie would not be bad, but the budget is pretty low and the film feels like it was an amateur. There are no big names in this film, and the acting is very syr. The perception of paintball is also pretty bad. They seem to imply that everyone goes to speedball and all that other shit. In my opinion, it was just a bad movie and it does not give a true perception of what paintball is. To be honest, real paintball is not just like a friend, it's a lot of cursing and bonus baling, not "respect" and playing by the rules. Do not watch this movie and then expect to go to the field screaming "4 is 1 !!"
