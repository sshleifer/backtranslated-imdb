I do not know what else to say about this horrible movie that has not been told yet. Frankly, I just have to be mad at myself. I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a terrible shit, but I loved war games so that I left my hir. I'll live to regret that decision for the rest of my life. From the very beginning, when government officials explained that their super computer could determine who was a terrorist just by how well they played the video game I knew I was driving through the country-to-good-writing-forgotten. The list of very, very, very bad lines, dialogue and acting is so long that I would break the IMDb if I tried to set it up. For those people who said they saw the worst movies of this, please tell me. I'm really curious to see something that could trigger this pair of horses.
