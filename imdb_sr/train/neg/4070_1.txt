Imagine disturbing goth college students in a throwing film, insert a storytelling and a lot of terrible acting, and you're still not nearly as close to this movie. bad, bad effects, bad acting. Attempts to shock the horror. Everyone I've shown this becomes depressed watching him. Scenes of sex are disturbing, not necessarily because of their content, but because they are just something you want to end up as soon as possible. The last scene of sex is just a foul, even before it comes to the type. I am one of those people who like to watch movies that people hate, which is why I chose this. But, for your own sake, save yourself time and avoid this disgust. It's so bad. I literally threw him into the trash.
