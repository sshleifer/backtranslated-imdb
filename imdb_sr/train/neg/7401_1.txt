* Sigh * Let us Finns take a stupid idea, blow it out of proportion, and try to sell it cool. Lordi is at best the central band, and one single trick will only get you so far. All of your marketing idiots out there: this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when Finland tries to export something. The Lordi is not terrible. The Lord is lame. Lordi is OVER. I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic nonsense. Of course, they won Eurovision. No, wait - they won Eurovision. That's it. I reschedule my case.
