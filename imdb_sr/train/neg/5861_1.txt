I saw this film when it first came out in 1978 when I was in the second year of high school. I took the date to see it. There was no need to say, because the film was so bad! Career Joan Rivers never fell as bad as she deserved after she made this terrible, unhappy shit. In fact, immature is not a serious enough expression: this film is ANTI-FUNNY! You come out and you feel as if any laughs that could have happened over you had been overcome before it happened. This is not worth watching from curiosity, or from any sense it's "so bad - it's good." Not even a gang in the MST3K could not look at this! The fact that Billy Cristal's career survived this early attempt at suicide is a miracle.
