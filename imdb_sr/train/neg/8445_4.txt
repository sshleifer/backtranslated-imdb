For me, every piece of art is judged according to these criteria: Form, Function and Meaning. It seems that Guernsey is devoted to the forms: beautiful recordings and sometimes interesting acting. Long large plans suggest a function that the viewer can fulfill himself. Because of the lack of texts, the story becomes a quiz. An introvert person suggests that it has depth, but sometimes it turns out to have nothing to say. This film acts as an introvert person. If you have not read the synopsis, you can not see it as a suicide (and a question without answers why?) Which changes Anne's view of life and makes it suspicious. "Why do not you talk to me?" asks Sebastian. Anna does not answer, she has been in it for a long time without a word. What is the function of this shooting? What it means? My question is like the Sebastians: What does this film have to say? What does this film mean? Answer for me: It shows us a handful of people with a passion of glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. The motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest is: leather, residences, landscapes. Beautiful and artistic, but meaningless without the use of 'instructions for use'. In my opinion this film is made for colleagues and not for ordinary viewers.
