This is only the second time that I feel compelled to comment on the imdb about the film. For the first time, it was probably the best film I ever saw, and for Memento. See that Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I had an accident to see it. In addition to the two scenes with naked women, there is nothing in this film to pick it up from the trash that it is. To see, apaling effects, cliche script, bad acting and about 90 minutes long. My wife and I mostly laughed in disbelief as to how bad it was. Unbelievable, I watched him to the end, as I did, I do not know! AVOID !!!
