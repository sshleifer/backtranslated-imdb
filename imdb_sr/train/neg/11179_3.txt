As we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this movie. The advertising hack on the ugly end of what was once striking and idealistic career Pachino plays his part that looks like a rugged bed and attacks everything with a completely fake and inconsistent southern accent. Action This way, it revolves around with so many loose ends and incredibleness that the mind moves (and then retreats). Kim Basinger is there, does not work much. Her scenes with Pacino are straight and unconvincing. It's hard to believe they meant a lot to each other. There is no energy there. Tea Leone, on the other hand, illuminates the screen. She was electric and her scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting in the film, but not enough to save Ala from shame.
