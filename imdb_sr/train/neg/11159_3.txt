I saw this film on a 'overview' and I honestly have to admit that I do not like movies with Meril Streep. This picture was the worst. Half the theater did not come back after a half-hour break. I could not blame them, if it was not a true story, there was no need for the other half of the picture. Immediately before the film moved forward in a dozen years, I was expecting that the credits would appear.
