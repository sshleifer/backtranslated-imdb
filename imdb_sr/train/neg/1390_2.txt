I'm a big fan of B5, catching up just at the end of the third season. I had faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated, concluding that it was one of the most perfect stories about dolls that ever hit on television. Even filling episodes were interesting. The films were also well-produced and entertaining as well as anything that could hit theaters. <br /> What brings us to the "Reka Soul". Of course, after I saw everything else, I had great expectations. It seems that Martin Shin was playing Ed Wood, not in a serious Sci-Fi story. The story itself, it may have looked good in the form of a sketch, even got to the storyboard. However, he obviously suffers when the time has come to fill that notion in a two-hour film. There are no special effects that would entertain us in the complete absence of a convincing story. There are places where they obviously lacked time and only improvised the dialogue to fill the story. If this were a regular season, it would rank among the worst episodes.
