I've been watching this ... let me rephrase ... I suffered this because I'm Eve's fan. I do not think this is a movie that will be placed on the back of the photo. I love gangsta flick, but this was not even close. The budget could not have been more than a few hundred dollars, and that money is probably spent on the caterer. The premise was interesting, but the first victim died before you got the chance to worry about or not. I will not try to say who did what and how, because it is not worth the effort. I'm just glad that because of my monthly rental in a local video I did not have to pay for this garbage. OH! Before you blaze on me, I love movies, I thought some flicks were good that some of you stuck, so I would tell you everything you need to know.
