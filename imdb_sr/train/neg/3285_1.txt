When a movie like "The Dukes of Hazzard" enters over $ 75 million, it brings some incredibly sad statements about the state of our society. Or we are collectively too stupid to not go further than this garbage, or maybe I just do not understand how many people will like this type of garbage without effort. good films, because if they throw out garbage, people will still see it because there is nothing else on the screen. That's it. I got out despite receiving a free movie pass. The dialogue could not be stupid. Stunts can not be over-the-top and excessive. Perhaps this "big big picture" is attracted to Texans, but I did not like it to me or anyone else in the theater. None of the "big names" was in this film that ended his career, except Burt Reinolds, who says everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - Do not laugh at me. I would not even recommend this movie for video, even if you were desperate. It was all because the public was fooled to make enough money after the opening to equalize or do better than it was through marketing. They did it despite the public being warned. Nonsense abounds.
