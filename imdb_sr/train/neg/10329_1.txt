I'm trying to imagine the pitch for Dark Angel. "I'm thinking about Matrix, I think about Bladerunner, I think that this girl who plays Faith and Angel, wears great black skin - or some fish like her, leave it with us. Just - take this! - I'll do it without any complication, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just some loud scratches and hot chickens in a shiny black skin that stretches across big bikes, is not it? "Very colorful, shallow, gloomy, formic, no passion, boring , boring, stupid, with no sense of humor, useless, barely competent. Live action anime without any action or any kind of life. SF exactly the way Joe Fanboiu likes it, in fact. :(
