I wanted to love this movie, I really am. He has good actors, but eventually he falls. In some places she tries too hard to be ridiculous (daughters of poor cooking attempts), go to others (a scene where someone's yard is cleaned, so she agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that, although mildly, are really only full ( all work scenes). And I did not think that "villian" were terrifying, or worth the hatred, as far as I found them childishly boring. I met people like those in the movie while I played a church ball. And I will say that the judge is on the spot, however, in the end, I really did not care about the characters, or their quest for the glory of the church balls. Perhaps because they were all so dimensional that I may not have thought so much about the film as being more fun or it seemed to be all the smoother. Kurt Hale and Halestorm have made some good movies, but this is not one of them.
