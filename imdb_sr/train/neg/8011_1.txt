I really had to catch another movie from other commentators on this site, because on the projection of the movie last night, the audience was so disturbed by the dialogue that I (even not kidding) left half. Filmed as if the filmmaker thought he was approaching a bold new territory by presenting a story about a homosexual upcoming age, David Linch's film uses inspired images with Fassbinder's inspiration. The performances in this film are so boring and boring that I realized that one of the actors would be fainted from how inspired by the script. What's worse is that it is colored as an episode of jokes from Miami. I do not know who this director thinks he is; there may be surreal pretensions such as Bunuel, Jordov, etc. But the problem is that all the above-mentioned directors show the level of sensibility that was missing here very much. I could understand the meaning of this film a decade ago, but when we have masterpieces like Bad Eduction, Misterious Skin and Shov Me Love, why bother with this movie? There's nothing new here.
