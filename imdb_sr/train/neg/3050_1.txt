Just when I thought I'd finish all year without a single "Bomb", my friend brought me this notorious bunch last night. I was afraid of the worst, knowing his reputation, and that was as horrible as I expected. This is a Mexican made mess, named in English and produced by K. Gordon Murrai. There are terrible sets and effects, and there's a pretty scary Santa Claus who does not work on the North Pole, but instead of a cloud in the universe, and does not have a little elk that helps him make his toys, but all different groups of children from virtually every country. The opening sequence, where St. Nick sincerely laughs as he watches monitors displaying all these boys who work hard while singing horrible holiday songs in different languages, seems to last forever and without a story. Obviously, this Santa Claus does not respect the laws of child labor! In the end, we will get some disgusting and slippery helper from hell who travels from hell to Earth, only to make small children scarce and turn Christmas Easter into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and distorted experience, and will surely scare off young children and turn them off from Santa Claus and holidays forever. It is strange that Jesus Christ's name is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, which in a way makes it increasingly creepy in the context of all the bizarre things that are happening. This easily makes my personal list of "The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen", but I'm sure it's nothing unique.
