I had to give movie 1 because it's so bad, but do not think I did not enjoy watching because I laughed and laughed, and I had several questions. Halfway through the time I laughed, I spoke halfway through "what the hell is going on?" or "why would someone do it?" et cetera. Most of all, I enjoyed the terrible effects of fog, in the 80th act of scene / battle / dialogue / bare scene and the way the warfare swings in the wind when riding horses. And there are some shaky effects of the model (they should not be the right tree, right?) And I still do not understand the guy they found in the cave, what the hell is he? One of my friends talked to me about these films and I thought that I would give them an attempt, and I actually liked the movie as people like Ed Wood's films, I have no right to enjoy what the movie should be, I watch it in my own funny way. So do not let it hinder you if you really think it's an action movie, that is, I just liked it for other reasons. It's much, much worse than Evil Dead, so it can make you think like you're wasting your life watching it (which came to my mind several times). I suppose that for most people it would be best to drink some drinks, talk to some friends and smile at this movie. Maybe this is a bit rough, but I do not think so, rent it and see. Io.
