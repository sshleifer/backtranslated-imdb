When I looked at the performances for this film, I did not expect much to start - about the second-rate teen of horror film. But wow, this film was absolutely horrible. And that's generous. First, casting for the movie was terrible. You do not feel sympathy (or any morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I was just waiting and hoping God would end up terribly. Second, there are points in the movie that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Can someone explain to me why the girl looks screaming "PANTAKES !!!" on the top of his lungs while going to the moves of Jackie Chan I've never seen before, and even further biting a guy who has a virus? Why does a father's kid continue to be angry with a virus-infected person, and go to a crazy home to find him? I stayed with the feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I literally said, "Where does hell come from?" I really thought I had seen some bad films, but I must say that Cabin Fever is all on top. This film made me want to vomit, and then vomit again. Then blow me up the brain. Please, save an hour and a half and do something more productive. Watching the grass is growing, perhaps, is a real alternative.
