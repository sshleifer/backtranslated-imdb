It looked like I was watching this movie a thousand times before. It was absolutely predictable. Every time the story tried to turn around a little, every time I expected something interesting, I did not see anything other than what I expected. As "The bread factory opened another facility, because there was not enough bread." In two words: a straight story, which has become a clich√©, a bad act, bad special effects ... Only a stupid Russian policeman, Vlad, was a bit ridiculous while punishing bad guys. The pile of muscles was so incredibly stupid that I smiled for a moment. I wonder why I'm wasting my time spitting on that shameful movie ... It will not be worse (because that's not possible): D
