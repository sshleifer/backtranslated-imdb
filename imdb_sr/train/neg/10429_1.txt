The first half was OK, but the last half is really, really disappointing. It's strange that the producers even admit that they have no idea about the end, and it really showed. Which is really sad is that I have to write 10 lines of comments so I can publish it. I really did not want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks because the show is not really worth the effort. When the Battlestar Galactic came out for the first time, I was very excited about looking for a better remake, it did not happen that the first season's border was space porn. In the end, they cleared it a bit and had a pretty fair play, so I started to look at it again. But to finish the series with kara as an angel of a cyclone god, the same with the baltar and six is ​​quite stupid.
