This movie could have been an interesting study of the character and could have given some insight into the topic, but the real problem with this film is that there is none of it in it. It does not give any insight - or a solution to the problem. It's just showing the 'old' male sexual addicts and the problems that it creates for his everyday normal life and family. Why do you want to watch this? It's all totally pointless and meaningless. It also does not help that the main character is some wrinkled man older than 50 years. You will hardly be identified and sympathized with him. He just looks like a dirty old cloak, which is a constant hunting for wife and sex. He has all kinds of sexual relationships around 3 times a day with different women, and not just with prostitutes. Also, there is no bad visual style, although everything seems a bit compulsory. Still, it's better than other direct video productions. Who knows, that filmmakers get better material for work, the film would earn a better faith. The story is sometimes washed. There are really some pointless dashboards that are often more ridiculous than they should have been. I'm speaking, for example, of the whole Ordel plot. Things get worse when they start moving toward the end. Also, the whole way the story is told, cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main character sessions with his psychiatrist feel a bit cheaper and easy. But as far as bad films are concerned, this is simply not one of them. It's not much better or worse than any other random direct film, with similar concepts. simple little insignificant production such as this one. I suppose they are really desperate for work and money. 4/10
