I hated this shit, every Friday as part of the tgif, and consistently sucked a lot of time with glupidity every week. If you want to see something funny, watch "No On Vould Tell", starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, is really hilarious, showing exactly why no one ever goes to a good career after a terrible TV series. This show really makes me sick, I hate kids, and Bob Saget has to jump from the bridge to ever make this crapfest. I've seen things on all sides except here. I'm writing 10 lines! Watch 'full house' to see the least what humanity can offer in the way of art and entertainment.
