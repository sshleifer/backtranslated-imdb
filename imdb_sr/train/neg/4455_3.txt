Where to begin? OK, do not compare this movie to fight the club to start - funny. If there is even a patch at a fighting club, violence, blood, mountains, etc. It would be much more obvious and more realistic. Secondly, this film is not a football factory - which is much more realistic (and Danni Dier makes Nicholas Nickelby look unpleasant). Fair enough, the story is pretty decent and the fighting scenes are well choreographed - I can add with a decent ending. But the film is generally poor, seriously poor. As people mentioned accents, they should not spoil the film - I disagree - either a simple mistake in performance, or a lack of effort in leading voices, causing the film to be irritating to the end - it was obvious from one scene of an American / Geordie played a role. Do not misunderstand me, a good guy who looks great with the head of the skin - but not a hooligan. I could keep on forever about how futuristic the scene was - the situation with the "fake manager". Also, when the GSE is playing United in the North, they go by train, expecting only 3 of them - it does not make any sense - this is the gangster and bandit organization that is shown in the movie to be a Mickey Mouse cult about 5 people. Regarding the accuracy - did West Ham and Milvall play for the last couple of years together? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure that "Bother" could only get into the Milvall company. Basically, a very bad movie that will appeal to people if they have little knowledge about real football and hooliganism. If you really love football and you are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism, you will simply feel like this film has offended your intelligence. Ross George
