"Ghost of Dragstrip Holl" seems to be taking place in a flawless world, a time that has long since passed, where the biggest sin that a child could commit would be in opposing the law and obtaining a travel card. He opens up with a young auto fanatic who takes the job from his rival, who is pushing him into the car race. That's all because of a drag race - this B-movie is mostly dealing with rock'n'roll, man! People from American International obviously liked decent, square teenagers who liked to have fun, yet did not have anything against an adult companion. There are a couple of fun dual entundas and fruit exchanges (Necking Kid: "We thought we would get out of the fresh air" ... Dad: "Where did you think you would find it, down her throat?"), But the spirit was a bit late in coming . Short in 65 minutes, the movie is cheating us with a superb car race that actually runs out of the screen, and the pre-Scooby Doo is carved, which makes no sense. However, for lovers of nostalgia, some foolish parties. ** from the ****
