I will give this movie two stars, because it is spinning with a beautiful photo. Otherwise, it mostly permeates clich√©s and stereotypes: mountain people are either stupid white garbage of fanatically religious or racial racist species, or wise white Indians. Indians are magical people who move without sound, they can disappear in blink of an eye, talk to animals, and read thoughts at great distances. And so on and so forth. Through the film I was wondering what is the meaning of the film (except for showing beautiful pictures of mountains, log cabins, forests, animal assortment, free things). witty climbers and miraculous people in the church). The action has covered a whole series of questions, but none of them has been thoroughly explored. This was not a story of growing up during depression, not being an orphan, or fighting for identity. He tried to do it all the more, making him superficial and unsatisfactory. Although the film should be about the education of the Little Tree, we do not learn about it almost anything. He received a brief overview of the history of his people (who was brave and stoic) and distillery demonstrations; he tried to chop wood (which he did not succeed) and whiskey (literally); I learned to read (and perhaps write) with the help of Grandma and her vocabulary - and that's it. Apparently he did not learn much during his stay in the boardroom because he was locked in the attic. However, grandparents and character Graham Greene made sure that eventually Little Tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - afterwards, and I paraphrase here, "riding with Navajos" and "caught in several wars" - was to "grab" Grandma and Grandpa and Graham Greene's figure in the sky (instead of, say, entertaining girls, marrying, having children or other such nonsense). And last, but not least, I must say that I found my grandfather's trade offensive. Why did all this have to be whiskey? To counter the stereotype of "drunk Indian"?
