So, the idea of ​​a movie that invites people to click on a name is just the same old thing - there's actually a website called Horrorvision which is a porn site - but this kills people who enter his portals. The story, however, is so fragmented that it's boring and does not come to an end. A definitive film about this issue of destroying Internet providers has yet to be made, but it is obvious that many have to destroy it because it will not be closed when it is necessary to make money.
