The terrible acting, the poor plot, the stupid story and all the horror of the terrible film summarize this piece of garbage. It was painful to pass. Just terrible. Do not spend any penny on this. Cinema should feel bad because this movie is where people watch. This "horror" movie was not the least terrible, creepy or disturbing. It was by no means attractive. The acting was so horrific of all actors that every attempt to get you into a movie through a dialogue was completely destroyed in moments when the actor / actress opened his mouth. Plus the whole story, I do not know why anyone would film a movie with this story READY. Do not waste your time and money. Even if it's a free ticket you do not lose even a moment watching this movie. You'll feel dumb to watch.
