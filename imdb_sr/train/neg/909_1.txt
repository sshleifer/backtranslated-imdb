Never think about watching this sad excuse for a movie. the way it was shot, lit up, acted, etc. It simply does not make sense. It's all so bad it's hard to watch. Piles of pistons are repeated behind boredom. there seems to be no 'normal' person in the whole film, and the existence of the 'outside world' is, well, it simply does not exist. And why this bald guy suddenly becomes invincible? this film is beyond stupidity. zero.
