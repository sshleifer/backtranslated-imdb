The 1990s began to have daily broadcasts that spread to the left and right. Each network had one, and everyone lacked one reality. Riki Lake was just another show that entertained the mother of an over-stocked park with a marlboro cigarette that hung from her mouth while she was breastfing one of her dozens of bitchy, illiterate children. The English language and other stone foundations of humanity, where it is destroyed, show existence. Titltes ranges from Girl Iou to Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone be able to watch this clean and full garbage? Has our society really become anything more than a bunch of hills and dead dads? The people who appeared in this show were Wastes. The people who watched this show were Trash. Anyone who wants to watch this show or set up on DVD is TRASH. People are wondering why Americans are becoming huge piles of fat and too fat to get even a job, having such shows tell them it's OK to be 500 pounds heavier, and girls 12 years of age behaving like prostitutes. To have such trash on television has destroyed morale.
