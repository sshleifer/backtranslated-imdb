Real disappointment with the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of the first female who has ever been through hell-out training in naval SEALs. The training is hardest and hardest because the instructor says in the movie O'Neil's main character in the performance of Demi Moore. There is no particular message or point in this film, or I could not get it right. Perhaps this is some sort of statement about women's rights and abilities, but it all sinks under tired scenes and stupid fight with pistols at the end of the movie. Really can not understand why Ridley uses so much zooms in this last gun battle in the desert?! It looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateur so I really would like to know what the director saw in that technique. When I look at his latest film, Black Havk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing bad in battle scenes (which are enough) and very intense and focused. The entire final in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing but stupid and foolish shooting and killing. This is Ridley Scott's worst film in my opinion and there are no significant contacts from which this great director is known. Still, I'm glad to see it in Videscreen format because there are still some great scenes and Scott's abilities, but they are very small in this movie. Disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on ..) of this talented director. So I'm forced to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
