"Step For Hollywood Veterans?" (your brothers asked) is what Holliveird demanded and that's what she got. However, like many of its recent decisions, this was a huge mistake. The director is so absent from today's audience, trying to restore physical moves and jokes to a place of funny dialogue is just a disaster. I knew that, the audience knew it, and CAST knew it. What is the damage, why have they ever thought about changing directors? Not only that, but two Vaian brothers played as two of the four primary characters, without them only farce and sad.
