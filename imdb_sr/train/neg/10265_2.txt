Kirstie Allei, looks a bit slim, but only a little, in this mess together with a man who is MacGuiver's look, white blond hair and all that. The premise of the film is about an older woman (50 !!!) who can not make a script due to age discrimination, and sends her younger nephew to present himself as a writer. It's not an original idea, not a very good movie with stupid acting, meaningless dialogue and funny complication. There is another complication about a writer with sympathy or admiration of Kirstie's character and why this is involved is a mystery. The actor who portrays Kirstie's brother is so wooden and wrong that torture was to watch their scene. What he has to say about this movie. Avoid this.
