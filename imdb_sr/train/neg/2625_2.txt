This movie acts terribly, writes, directs and produces. But it's such a camping, it's actually semi-visible. It's SEMI vatchable. The story (the little thing that exists) practically makes no sense. The Barnei Drum character is the only real comedy relief in a film that is dying after 30 seconds. Many Canadian supporters can be found in TV commercials. None of them went to anything else I was aware of. And of course, Sli Stallone is even less talented brother good ..... = Trivia: It was shot almost entirely in the small village of Claremont, Ont. (about 20 miles to N. Toasto) I have recognized many local attractions / intersections / buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was shot at the now-devastated "Oshawa Drive" just before it was demolished.
