A senseless boring film with charismatic Mercury is completely lost. Released Thursday for a maybe a local cinema and avoided by the entire Sidney population apart from me and four other BACK OF BEIOND is a project that was apparently created by the manufacturer who seeks compensation. Local actors such as John Polson and Terri Serio deserve better (Polson turned into a director of hefty thrillers like SVIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terri Serio seems to never get guernseys other than stupid roles. However, Paul Mercurio should have become one of the largest exporters in Australia. Such roles are great disappointments, and films like this are just a waste of talent and time.
