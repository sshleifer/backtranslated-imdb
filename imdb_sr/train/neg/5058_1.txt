(When will I ever learn?) An extreme critic at the NPR told me that I think this Turkey is another citizen of Kane. Please allow me to throw out my spear ... I admit: the item, probably New York City, has never been so ugly and unattractive. I recall that the 70s were a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And all the smoking! If the plan was to get cheaper characters, it worked. To make the film work (at least in my simple estimate), there must be at least one sympathetic character. Only Beaton was close, and I could not wait for him to finish Nicky. If the missed shot hit Mikey, well, maybe it caused most of the lack of interest. I can not remember when I badly despised the movie. I guess I'm ruby ​​that does not dig "art". Oh well.
