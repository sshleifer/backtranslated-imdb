You must admire the director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to making the film: from 1985 to 2000 he made an incredible 34 films. Unfortunately, if his trilogy of Zombie Bloodbath is something to be done, they are probably all crap (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seem to confirm my contempt). Part 3 sees a group of disgusting students who find detention a little more than ever after being attacked by hordes of living dead, who escaped from the secret military base located just below their school. Working on the terrible scenario of Brian Eclund (who relies heavily on the liberal use of f-bombs), the director Sheets brings another shameful amateur effort that includes some mental and horrible performances from his talentless, terrible visual effects (some CGI shit and what which looks like the front of the giant cardboard space shuttle) and its trademark (a hand from crayons extracted from the clothes of its victims). Finally, after what looks like eternity watching the irritating characters that run for their lives and the unconquerable undead people who caress the animal intangibles, Zombie Armageddon ends with a time travel / paradox that turns viewers to look back a few painful minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly ... once it was enough, Mr. Sheets, what did we do to deserve to see him again?
