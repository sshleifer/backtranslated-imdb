This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice, and the story is bullshit! There may be a funny joke, stupid and boring. Throughout the whole short film, I fell asleep and wondered when it would end. Nobody acts human, and everyone behaves stupidly and funny. Rob Schneider, who acts like an animal, is not something I would pay to see. It looked funny, but the ultimate result: DO NOT STAY TO BE A TIME ON ANY RIDER AND STOPID FILM. I was wondering when this would end, although it was short. Movie. At first we thought it would be better; but it's getting worse. Stupid, all the way to the end. I got out of the theater and I remembered this film as extremely bad forever. The writer and co-producer of this film is a TV writer of Simpson, but it's nothing like Simpsons (this movie sucks !!!)
