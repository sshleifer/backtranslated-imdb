This film was boring! Yes, there are a few funny moments and a joke, but you can not build a whole movie on it! The characters are too stereotyped, there is no real story - but short episodes with strange side characters, which are not strange enough to make the action true. Shame, because most actors are recognized in Hungary, the mystery why they took over the roles. This is not * a new hope for the Hungarian movie. It was boring, though it should have been original or unique. They could have tried a lot harder than this ... 2 out of 10
