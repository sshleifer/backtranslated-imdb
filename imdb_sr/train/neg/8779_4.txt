As a cinema fan, Vhite Noise was an utter disappointment because the filmmaker was pretty good, beautifully lit, good camera work, a reasonable direction. But it seemed predictable as a movie, like all the other 'so-called' horror films that the market recently flooded. Although he had little chill factors, the whole concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did not seem convincing. This film did not explain the reasons for certain phenomena, but continued with them. The act was far from memorable, because the main character is depicted without emotion, like many recent thrillers / horror films. .
