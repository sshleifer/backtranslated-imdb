I actually hoped this movie since I saw Kari in a few other things and I think she has some talent. Wow, this failure is a case study in which you do not have to work in the script. Totally undefined characters with no bits of sympathy, without any complication. Is it a way / friend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no idea, and neither do we.
