Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny-it summarizes this film in one word. What shit was that "thing", because it could kill me to use the word movie!?!?! I hope the director, writer and scientist turned his son into a shark hammer, and the shark killed a crowd of people whom a scientist called on an island! I hate this movie so much that I watched it laughing at all serious parts because they were so banal and unprofessional ... and they could not make the shark seem unreal, even though this "thing" had a slightly higher budget than most low-budget films . All I have to say is watch this movie, expecting it to laugh at all the bad acting and stupid wacky dialogue, because if you expect a good movie, I will be very disappointed.
