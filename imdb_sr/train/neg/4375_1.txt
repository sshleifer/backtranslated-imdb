Less self-conscious and much less pretentious than GUTS OF A BEAUTI, this movie Kazuo Komiza is worth a look (at least once). Sleased snapshotters escort vanna-be actresses / models to remote house \ t in the forest to sexually abuse them. Unfortunately (for the frightened boys), a long-standing demon, who lives in the forest, has already targeted the girls for fun. The thing is even ending with fun with the boys - it's you to consider the removal of heads, breaking and masturbating cut off limbs with "fun." Once again, everything sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on the movie. Just like Komiza was stolen LIFE DEAD ON TOKYO with his inability, he also manages this effort and only saves himself with some daring violence and some big white panties. Do not buy hyper, but or you. I'll be very disappointed.
