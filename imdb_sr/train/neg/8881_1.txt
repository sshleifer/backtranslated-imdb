The acting of the actors is a little stiff, as if it was the first time an actor appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the better actresses, Jean Simmons (she has played many important roles on TV, as in Star Trek LPG and in the heat of the night), is quickly dying and after that her acting behavior can be greatly missed. The main role is the g. Ballard, as described by Cliff Robertson. Cliff most of the time is forced to wear this film with his own body language. He does not do a bad job, but it's a bit over-demanding from an actor to turn the oceans into an empty screen time during which characters spend their time NOT saying or playing. Robertson's most impressive role might have been Ben Parker in the last three Spider Man films (starring Tobei Maguire). The action is predictable. A husband kills his wealthy wife for her money. after that the woman appears to be returning and persecuting her husband to crazy until he jumps from a high window (fearing that his dead wife is approaching) on ​​the day he predicts he will die no less. Other Chauffeur g. Ballard hires much like the English brand Hamill. Really real! The only thing that points out is the utter neglect of the dialogue. For many minutes she is in silence, no one speaks and does not behave. It's a shame that the guys from MST3K have never caught this movie. It could have been much better, if not only predictably, with more dialogues, or shorter scenes of 'zeroing'. I always expected that G'Mork's red eyes would appear from the shadows and declare that he was working for "nothing" that settles this film.
