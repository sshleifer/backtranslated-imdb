Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! He was written and acted by Silvester Stallone, which should have been enough and contained too many climbing scenes, dizziness, falls, and villains chewing the scene and unsuccessful robbery in the air. There are two plots, both weak. One implies a traumatic unsuccessful rescue, and the second includes bad people who break the prey plane and kill various harmless people whenever possible. Usually a reliable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the horror of the product itself, is reduced to a mocking and named one for whom he did not care "Bostid!" in an unclear approximation of English accent. Janine Turner, who was happy and puzzling when playing Maggie at Northern Exposure, was unfortunately lost in climbers and pilots. Stallone is sturdy and muscular. There are no immortal lines in this. There are no live lines.
