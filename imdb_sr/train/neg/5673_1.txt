I quote Oedipus Rex because it is a tragedy that this film was even shot! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! In no way do I like Uwe Boll like most humorous people on IMDb! Uve Boll movies like Mail and Tunnel Rats are hilariously bad and hence fun. But honestly, this film was horrible. I hated him so much that I would give her a zero rating if I could. The story is just bullshit! She spends four fifths of a movie on a movie and then has an environment that just screams a horrible horror scene! Finally, it ended with the "Viljanski victory that ends" which is completely acceptable, but it certainly could have been more delicious than this! I am not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier) nor against violent films! King I love violent movies! I loved movies like Sav, movies at the hostel, Tokyo Police, The Nev Iork Ripper, 28 films, dog soldiers, my bloody Valentine, Last House on the left, Vatchmen, Volf Creek, every Tarantino movie, each Sam Peckinpah Kanibal f ** king of the Holocaust! But this! OMFG !!! It was cruel, sadistic and perverse! And look at the movies I just mentioned! If I liked Cannibal Holocaust, and not this, then it must be bad! Uve, do not go again dark! You're funny when you're lit up, like Ed Vood. This was just a terrific experience! I felt terrible after I saw this! DO NOT WATCH !!! AVOID AT ALL COST !!!!!
