... but I'm not one of them. Caro Diario was at least two-thirds of the time visible, but boring and focused on us, the third part of that movie gave the taste of what was to come in this unusually self-confounding riot. Moretti says he feels the need to make this film, but he does not want it, as the viewer feels he should stick to it, but he does not want that either. A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but it's not that movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends stand in front of the Communist Party headquarters, discussing the interviews they are preparing to lead with party leaders in, but it's typical for this movie that we never see any of them. Inserted with Moretti's political stirring are the events that led to the birth of his son, and later home recordings of him with the baby and later the little Pietro (the film drags us through several years and more than one election period). We are constantly expecting to see some final sequence or convincing argument, but they never come. One thing I suspect is that I could have the patience to sit back in the Nanni Moretti movie. He managed to make an hour and twenty minutes as eternity.
