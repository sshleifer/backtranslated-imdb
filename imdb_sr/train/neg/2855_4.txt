"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happi", whatever you call it ... just do not guess. Maybe it's just me, maybe I just do not like Gangster comedy (as I thought Oscar, Johnei Dangerousli and Mafia were also sucked out) Probably more "witty sharp word play" than all comedy, just not so witty and sharply (or other reviewers) Let it be. Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old to start working by being sometimes sick to watch. There was not enough change in location or feeling for the period they were supposed to be. Most of the films were set up in the "Dreifus Club" or in various offices / smoke rooms. .. (what was with that Sitdown Gun stand off things Goldblum continued to win?) The backing head was ... on the paper excellent (great to see Silva and Drago), but the characters were killed They had time to develop before. and Richard Priors was a joke! The romantic and love element of the film also captured it. 4/10 I do not think that I will soon return to him.
