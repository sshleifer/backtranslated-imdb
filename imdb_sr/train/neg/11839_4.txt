The "Cat Mia" contains several scenes that can boast of intelligent dialogue and some fine performances, some of which surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more efficient than I expected as Chaplin (partly thanks to a great hair and makeup job by some talented designer); Joanna Lumley is convincing as a novelist Elinor Glin; and Kirsten Dunst wins as Marion Davies (although she's hard to explain films she never uses in real life). But these elements do not contribute to a successful whole. It seems that the scriptwriter worked very hard on certain scenes - meetings between Davies and Chaplin were especially well made - but not so difficult in a wide picture. Several smaller characters do not have to be there, and they do not act consistently. The basic action is full of illogicality (for example, why Thomas Ince thinks it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he really does not want to hear?), And party scenes are repetitive and tired. I would like to think that the trip on Hearst's yacht was more entertaining than the film shows. Davis is characterized as a standard type of champagne, which is not very accurate, and the writer's ideas about ÄŒaplin and love are incredible. Strange, Bogdanovich, who looked so connected with the thirties in the "Paper Month", does not have a similar affinity for the twenties. He insisted that an excellent costume designer uses only black and creamy colors, which gives the guests a very artificial look and play only the stereotypical songs of the period (eg, "We do not have bananas"). When Hearst insists on everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" It seems that the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. The life of a silent movie star can make fascinating movies, I'm sure, but not this time too.
