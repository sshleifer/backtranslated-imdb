Perfectly stupid weapons. I think the guys who danced at the beginning of one of Steven Segala's films intended to make fun of Jeff by working out his dance music forms at the beginning of this stupid movie. The action is predictable, the struggles were fair, and Jeff behaved like a couch that fights with some kind of weapon in one scene.
