urgh! 3 things that a movie needs: a good scenario, a good plot and good casting. I watched this film, expecting it to be hilariously terrible and unfortunately disappointed when it was simply horrible. I lost the will to live halfway. The only thing that prevented me from stabbing my eyes was Rose Birne (which was the reason I was watching it at all). She did a good job like Rastus and her appearance has not changed much since her 13th year, which was a fantastic first attempt in the movie. The dog was also very good. Both have done a great job with such a terrible material. I think Sandra Bernhard is the biggest mistake in the film. she was completely wrong, and I do not think she got her character. I gave the movie 2 out of 10 - and it's just because of Rose.
