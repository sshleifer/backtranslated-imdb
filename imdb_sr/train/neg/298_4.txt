Dara'ar started pretty well. The first scene really left me at the edge of the seat wondering what would happen next. In addition, the first half of the film is BORE. In the first half of the film is Rishi Kapoor who falls in love with Juhi Chavla. By the way, do not you think she's a little old for her? Things finally begin to spice towards the middle of the film when Juhi tells us about his previous husband; and wow he is crazy! He was overworked, neat-freak with really hot temper! He was wasting the poor Juhija for no reason! One of the reasons why this movie really does not like me is that I can not stand that Juhi (my favorite actress) is so abused. This film generally has too much abuse and bloodshed; Anyway, all I'm trying to say is that if you are considering renting Daraars, you should return it to the shelf where you found it and chose it. something else!
