The explosion of television channels must always be grateful to the production line of Randolph Scott Western, because at any moment there must be one hundred of Randolph Scott films that play at least one budget station. The "man behind the pistol" is a typical melodrama from the early 1950s with production values ​​before the Second World War relying on the historically-actual plot of the murder mystery made up of action scenes to conceal the complete absence of development character, and thus the lack of uncertainty. In the coming years, the role of these films would be taken by TV shows such as 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', etc. Randolph Scott, who is particularly sensitive in this regard, is a good guy who fights against bad guys, which will ultimately prevail. There is no more interest in what goes through emotions than in what his horse feels, unless you are wondering if the initial misunderstanding with the female leadership will be resolved to the end. Music is a stronger indicator of the emotional state of the 'characters' than the acting. But it's okay if it floats in a boat; and I would not ask you to enjoy 'Diagnosis, Murder,' too. Workers, pedestrian and fast aging. 3 stars for competent mergers; 0 for artistic work.
