It seems everyone in this film is channeled by Voody Allen. They stutter and stop and stutter more. Only for REALI die-hard DeNero fans! He tries to appear as sharp and artistic - but it looks like a very, very low budget film made by students. The most commonly used word in the whole movie is "hum". The film, however, attracted the atmosphere of the late sixties / early seventies. If you love movies where people keep talking about each other, horrible lighting (even if it's because of "art"), and you feel like sitting in a silly political meeting, then you may like it - it should be really boring. I found this CD in the bucket for the dollar and now I know why.
