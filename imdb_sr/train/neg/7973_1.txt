I'm going to many movies, I often bring my five-year-old son, so I'm glad I did not bring him to this one. Much is mentioned about the sex and skinny immersion scene, however, this is not the main reason why I would not take it to him. Trailers lead you to believe that it is a comedy without worry; however, almost all the fun moments are in the reviews. I waited for it to be interesting, fun or anything else but seriously; However, I almost fell asleep while talking about the disappearance of the drainage operation. I understand that dogs can be a great company, but as they say, the whole story was focused on a bad dog, that the owners were not smart enough to train. If a man caused such harm and disorder, that person would be forbidden. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jennifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, the loss of their talent. The best way to summarize this movie is, the couple gets a disobedient dog, the couple falls in love with the dog, the dog dies, a couple sad. The end.
