In the past year, there have been some heavy blows in the local and regional film and television scene. Still, they can not save this movie. There are so many things against it - over the act, overly melodramatic, bad scenario, inconsistent direction; and too little things to do - decent music, good cinematography. This comment is mainly for anyone who throws all of the local movies into one basket after watching this movie and says that all local movies are bad. Please, do not judge the rest of this film. This is a television soap that turns into a romantic feature film. My hopes were high when I bought a ticket and my hopes flew five minutes.
