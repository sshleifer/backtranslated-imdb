"Pandemonium" is a hoax with a horror movie that's more funny than funny. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedy. Especially comedy. "Airplane", "The Naked Gun" trilogy, "Blazing Saddles", "High Ankieti", and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that underline a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not up with these movies. Most of the scenes in this film sat in amazed silence, because the movie was not so funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that's all that this movie has to do with it. Jesus, "Scream" had more laughter than this movie and it was more a horror movie. How bizarre it is? 1/2 (out of four)
