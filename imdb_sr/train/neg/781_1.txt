This performance was absolutely terrible. For George one is not ridiculous, and his children are snobbery little brats. He also treats his mother with disrespect. As a Latin American, I'm very offended by this show and the way the characters are shown. Once, I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other shows have done this one million times? I thought ABC would feel and extract this piece of garbage from the air, but unfortunately, we will have to empty this until we "jump on the shark". They already are.
