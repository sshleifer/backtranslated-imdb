This is like the 6th film. The movie is really bad. He does not offer anything in the death department. One-liners are bad and something that should not be in the NOES movie. Freddie comes out as a happy kid in the whole movie. Lisa Vilcock is still the only thing that's worth this. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the sixth, but still one of the worst movies in the series. My rating 2/10
