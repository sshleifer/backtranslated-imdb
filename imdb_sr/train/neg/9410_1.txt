As long as you suffer! If you like to watch people wake up, get up, dress up, take a shower, prepare dinner, watch each other, have sex in the dark, then you go back to bed to sleep ... kitchen, long minutes of silence ... if you love To bother you for two hours, feeling the excitement of "real intimate fake art", then you will like it. But if not, just try to see a good movie, there are thousands of them. "As long as you're here," but do we want to stay?

No matter what? Or maybe just to look at some directors?
