Sometimes I do not understand what the directors think about filming a movie ... I had a trauma after watching Velcome (2007) and I thought it would not be repeated. But after many incredible promotions, Tashan finally ended up as a heart attack. Such incredible 3 songs in promotion - Dil Haara, Chhaliia and Tashan Mein ..... and what do you get in the movie? Zero story, predictable plot, lots of Akshai Kumar acrobatics and nothing interesting except watching Kareena after her great loss of weight ... !!! Music-the second major catastrophe ... in the music album, they spent time on giving the poor little dialogues of these 4 jockeys and did not think they were giving a back-up song about scenes when Akshai Kumar was working on acrobatics ... ! this song is so beautiful, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and it's not recorded in a music album !!! :-( If you are planning to watch this movie, I would say, watch it to listen to that background song that goes something like ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandei ...' Even very disappointed with the way to which Bhaiiiaji tried to speak bad English! Depart, man, I have to vomit!
