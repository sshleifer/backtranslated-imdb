There seems to be a huge response to this film, but no one with an insight into the critique of his methodology, which is extremely scarce. It simply continues to propagate the analysis of the journalistic style, that is, the viewers have a lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to cause emotional humiliation and the emergence of a negative fabrication. some facts only to pre-empt them in making conclusions that are predictable. for example, the idea of ​​a civil war, chaos, robbery, etc. were supposedly unexpected answers to the collapse of government infrastructure after Hussein's death: were not all symptomatic of a culture that was already poor? Doctrinal fighting as a symptom of these veins of Islam itself, and not the failure to curb and secure the police? Would you prefer the US to declare the Marshal Law? I am sure that the documents here would explode with charges for the police state and fascist forces. Apart from analytical idiocy of the film, it takes several sidelineers and leave the rest to say "so-and-so refused to be interviewed ..." but the questions they asked no doubt have already answered hundreds of inquiries which individuals have already received. Would you, as vice-president, agree to be interviewed by the first writer / producer who must have been able to do your own words. they could not remove the Condi tape to actually show her opinion and answer some logistical questions, maybe they never watched her hear. This is far from a neutral view of the situation on there. This is another biased, dark access to journalists - which are, to a large extent, reckless packets. and CNN's comment. these interpretations strike on the same vitriol, which simply creates further bias between those who want to think and those who want them to say what they think.
