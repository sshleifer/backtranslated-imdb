Nacho Vigalondo is well known in Spain. He's a kind of bad shoeman that can make you feel sick ... Very unpleasant. Nacho made some commercials on TV, I remember those in which Nacho was looking for Paula Mc Carney around Madrid (a commercial on the Mc Carnei CD collection). This little movie resembles Nach's commercials: bad story, bad directing and horrible performances. I can not believe that such a disgusting movie is in the Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... Nacho could record this film because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman who is very well connected with Spanish TV businessmen.
