Each movie with a title that is as funny as "The Bagman" should automatically attract the attention of every bad movie lover, but the plot is far different from what can be expected after watching DVD covers. Bagman is by no means a good movie. It belongs to the category of films that appear to have been filmed (and likely to be) on a home video camera. The acting is terrible. I have not heard and seen such a woody act since Troll 2. There are many scenes with nudity and sex, but they obviously jumped in speed. The characters are morons and completely forgotten. The ending (which I will not break) can easily be predicted after watching the first scene. Because of the raw nature of the film, nothing but terrible production values ​​is not really scary (horrible attempts at realistic capture, a driving scene in which the car is clearly immobile, etc.). Recommended only for lovers of bad films.
