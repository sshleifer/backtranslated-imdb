So what can I say about this disaster? I watched him because he was broadcast on a cable. I'm sorry I was wasting my time, but at least I did not waste my money. The creature is the safest you can get! Please, you must be very generous not to be angry about cheap Halloween costumes. Well, there are also images of terrible acting, f / k, and dialogue. The conflict with the creature is incredible, you can not get a more pathetic scene. This is the worst thing you can get from direct to video. "Creature Unfinished" makes movies FULL MOON PICTURES like "Halloween". Avoid this at any cost, please. The only "positive" thing about this garbage is a sexy woman.
