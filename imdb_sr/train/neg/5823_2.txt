"Retaining Drawings 9" is a type of film that either loves or hates; fortunately or not, I left it with a strong sense of lost time and I was thoroughly charged with "killing whales is a bad" propaganda. Aesthetically, the film could be pleasing, especially its first half, until it is clear that each action shown serves as an allegory of various aspects of hunting whales. By then, it might be a little fun to watch the daily work of Japanese workers, but later it becomes apparent that everything appears on the propaganda screen, and no box is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the film basically uses an old morale device, where "good" and "bad" are not performed during the action, but are stones. I'm probably just me, but I think that this type of art is shallow and pre-designed, even when it comes to noble (without sarcasm) the task of protecting the environment. when film material is released without any justification, it is only for stretching. In my opinion, "Draving Restraint 9" can easily fit in 75 minutes, but has a painful duration of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting footage, but it was not enough to leave the 15-minute void of nothingness without notice. The film does not have a standard scenario and there is no evolution of characters, but it is not a documentary, but rather a kind of conceptual installation. It's an unusual form for a movie, but it can still be regarded as art, even when the concept is simple and naive as it is here. OTOH I also believe that the director should have sincerity and did not pretend that it can be delivered in less than 135 minutes. How surprising. 2/10.
