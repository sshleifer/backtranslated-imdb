I've been following this movie for some time, so I might have expected a bit too much. I think that both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dier are good at what they do and that he is interested in seeing what Dan Reed could think of, but unfortunately it did not help me. The problem is that the film really does not understand which genre intrudes into it and as such does not manage to impress the elements of drama, horror, and thriller, because instead of focusing on one of them and doing it Well, that's a bit of all the craftsmanship and master of none. The premise (like most revenge movies) is simple, the couple meet and exit, something bad happens and they get their revenge is a simple formula and that many skills managers have dealt with over the years. Unfortunately, in this case, it's as if Dan Reed thought: "It would be great to make one of those revenge movies that goes a little deeper by showing the human side to all the characters and getting more into their mental state ..." Wrong! There are also a few key elements missing, there is generally some type of warning in this type of movie. And let's not do this or this may be an add-on element, but there's nothing like this here. It just happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens, and then it ends. In this genre there are a lot of really strong competition and hats from Dan Reed for an attempt, I have no problems with his directing skills, but in terms of writing ... I would say that the next time should be followed by the formula for the type of film he says, instead of trying to be too smart and have a good movie about his film. hands.
