This is a typical example of technically highly qualified filmmakers / advertisers who are trying to make their first feature film. On the one hand, images, cameras, lighting, CGI, and even sound are very polished and have a really "expensive" look and feel. Even actors show a certain amount of potential - to the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad conspiracy. In this case it's not a bad plot but hardly it's a complication. So, 50% of the dialogue consists of "What was it?", "What was that?" and "What was that?". In no case is there any single character or audience given the slightest hint of response. In most other dialogues there is a feeling that there never existed any form of dialogue and that the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that was never explained to them. The only reason why Performance Skie Bennet might be so good is that her character as an autistic girlfriend does not allow her to provide the tragically horrible lines of dialogue that other actors have to deal with. In this way, she managed to show her acting talent, which the rest of the actors could not even approximate. I do not think there is one actor in the world that can make up for this kind of dialogue: Ben: Is this really, huh? Emili: Stop it. Ben: Mass psychosis, huh? Jon: Somebody has to take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not from you, nor from anybody. Emili: Not from you. Ben: No. But not for horror, more for a terrible attempt. At some moments I was ashamed that the actors added this to their vita. 2 stars for excellent technical work.
