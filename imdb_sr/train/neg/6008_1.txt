If you make a mistake watching a movie before reading a book, do not give up the series. I bought my first copy of any book in May this year, and I've almost finished with the book 10. I dare say that the movie is a piece of garbage that does not make a series even by snooping on justice. While "Left Behind: the movie" only vaguely follows the story of "Left Behind" (the book), the characters are not nearly accurate. Several examples: Raiford never acts on his feelings for Hattie (he is on the road to get information about disappearances); Buck Villiams is a blond, newspaper writer, not a TV reporter; Chloe is at Stanford, and many details of Raiford's book are wondering if she's 'survived'; Buck and Chloe do not meet much later, at a meeting in New York, set by Hattie; Irena and Raimie are never "in the book," but only in Raiford's thoughts of reflection; the roads are so jam-packed with wrecks after the enthusiasm that Raiford and Hattie have to return to the helicopter in the suburbs ... etc., etc., etc. ... And that's only from the first movie; they are preparing to release the third. Please, even if you do not like movies, give a chance to a series of books.
