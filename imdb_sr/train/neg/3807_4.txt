Do not misunderstand me, I'm a big fan of many Voodi movies, apparently his masterpieces from the late '70s (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his late 80s / early 90s drama (Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners , Husbands). and women), in fact, I even liked some of his more recent efforts (Melinda, Anithing Else, Small Time Crooks), but this was hopeless, although I could not be worse than last year's Match Point, but how wrong I was. False is plotted - essentially a cross between the Match Point, the Manhattan Murder Mystery and the Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes pulled out - Voody seems to be on the way to the exit, following most of his lines and dropping 'hilarious' phrases 'I think with all due respect ...' over and over again until all of this gets bare. I know that most actors are waiting to work with him, but first they should read the script - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are much better than this - and Voody in the future should take a little more than the role of the camera, if it has any meaning about 20 miles behind it. It would not be so tragic that we did not have so great Voodoo movies compare this with - but it's clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort, Voodo should call him the day before it becomes a joke in the industry. Annoyingly bad
