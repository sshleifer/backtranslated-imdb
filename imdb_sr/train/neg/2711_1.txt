Even if you could go through the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the sixties (ok, so Katie did not join Manson's family and no one died in Altamont), this film was still incredibly horrible. I had the impression that the "writers" just locked in the room and watched "Forrest Gump," "Wonderful Years," and Oliver Stone's 60s over and over again called it research. A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode of "head spinning". He was right.
