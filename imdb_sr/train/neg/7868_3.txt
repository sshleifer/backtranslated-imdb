I've seen many Gui Maddin's films, and most of them liked me, but this one literally gave me a headache. The editing of John Gurdebeke is too frenetic, and, apart from the sequence of the tour that shows the line of heads banging to watch an object, nothing affects the actors' ability to communicate with the audience. Another thing I did not like about this movie was that it looked more brutal than Maddin's previous works - although his films always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave films the dominant feeling of mankind. This seemed more like rudeness over roughness. Since I need to add more lines of text before IMDb accepts my review, I will mention that the actor playing "Gui Maddin" manages to pronounce his face expressions well.
