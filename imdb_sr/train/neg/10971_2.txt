How Irish critics are pissing about this film is beyond me. The over-ridden ordinary band of Irish actors pulled out for every Irish film. A terrible letter, with forced characters (brown sauce). It's romanticizing everything that's bad in Dublin. The attitude of 'ah, it's a hole, but it's certainly not the same thing.' A lot of sweets for the American audience (supermarket boss and his terribly forced phrase). And the nail in the suitcase was the figure of Colma Meaneia. A great actor who had to play this part that a five-year-old could write. Cringevorthi stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrel, and it's bad when you have to say it. Well, at least he did not put his terrible American accent. International audiences should be warned: stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You'll have a better time. Intermission is a walk-outside
