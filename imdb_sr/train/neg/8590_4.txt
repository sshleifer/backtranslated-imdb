Funny. An angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns into a chattering 19-year-old Annakin, which somehow seems appealing to Amidali, 5 years old. Now, the 22-year-old war hero Annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and he deals with the slaughter of children, his friends, and the entire framework of his existence, because a crazy old man convinced him that his precious wife could die, and b) can prevent. Ludacrositi skuared. I think people who love this movie are not paying attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are incredible (literally not a perverted feeling "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.). Obi-van Kenobi was a wise and friendly anchor for the whole series, but at its peak, he hammers Anakin's legs, letting him burn in the lava and leaving him to suffer. Does not anyone think that this is a bit out of character? Not to mention that it was pretty stupid to risk him living, as it turned out. I was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with convincing motives. Nothing here. A 10-year-old could write the story. About yes, CGI is pretty cool.
