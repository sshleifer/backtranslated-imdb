Do not try to spend money on this movie. Do not even enter your car and think that you could see this movie if you do not like others.

The act was terrible, and the characters were incredible - Borat was more convincing than this. *** *** Spoiler *** and can anyone tell me how a butcher's vest can make a stepping-stone from a person after being shot, even if the person who shot it does not hit. ???
