Do not be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reinolds, James Voods, and Anne Archer. They are just celebrated extra. Their scenes are probably shot in one day. Whatever their motives to be in this movie, if you have an actor like James Voods, take it better. For me this is a sign of a bad direction through and through. The shop itself was not so bad. And the acting of most actors was above average. However, Cuba Gooding Jr. she was terrible. He was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since this meant a serious movie that can not be a good thing. Action scenes were not bad, but they missed that special blow to be more exciting. Again, a better direction was needed. Also, pacing was wrong for such a movie. The main character took almost half an hour to get involved in the action. For an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is too slow. The only redeemable factor is Angie Harmon. She does everything in her power to do everything. It's a shame that the director left it hanging. Yes, this movie could have been much better with the big director. Andi Cheng is too inexperienced as a director to do it. And for the action / stunt coordinator of his caliber you expect at least a more exciting action scene. Do not waste time with this. Avoid!
