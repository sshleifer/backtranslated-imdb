A slammed housewife (the boring crazy Angie Dickinson, whose body dually treats / harasses extreme circles of her delicacies) sexually bows to her husband and decides to divorce. This directly leads to a series of killings that soon involve a high-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, apparently in the wrong business if the NSA can bring home $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you're going to watch De Palme to shake off (sorry, "resign") Hitchcock, watch Sisters instead of this. "Trained for killing", full of styles and technical skills, is one of the most beautiful thrillers I've had to discontinue. The action is absurd and tired. There are some surprisingly effective jumps and unpleasant graphic sequences of killings that should be satisfied by any of the fans of horror, as long as they can go through a crazy story, which must have been dated even in 1980.
