Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film enthusiasts from outside, have often proclaimed the largest Chinese film ever, and, frankly, I do not understand at all. What I saw was one of the most comprehensive melodramas that could be imagined, politely directed and acting, with total strength for the protagonists. Vei Vei (not laughing) is this young woman, a young married woman who suffered with her husband from tuberculosis (Iu Shi) for several years. It is after the Second World War, and lives with the sister of a teenage husband (Hongmei Zhang) in a small home with little money (the man was rich when they were married). In addition, her husband is the best old friend (Vei Li), who was also a boy of a teenage girl. She thinks she's running away from her husband with this man, while her husband pretty much remains unconscious, thinking she can meet her little sister with her friend. It's a setting, and it does not go anywhere you would not expect. I really saw remake, directed by Blue Kite Director Zhuangzhuang Tian. It takes half an hour longer, and it's actually boring, but at least it was nice. This alleged classic is quite unbearable.
