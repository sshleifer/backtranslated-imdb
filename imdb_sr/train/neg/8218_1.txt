I've never finished this movie for a reason, it was horrible and it's just an act. I did not even know what a film about tbh was that made much sense, and the violence was terrible. I mean ususalli like some naked in the movie (lol), but it's just sick for what's going on. All the characters were annoyed and it was full of loud cries, and the camera was shaking in parts and it looked like a continuation of the blair with the project, but without good quality. This is one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time and I'd like to come back. I would not recommend this movie to anyone or even consider it. (N)
