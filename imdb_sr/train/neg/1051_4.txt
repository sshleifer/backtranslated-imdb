Although the songs of Frank Loeser are some of the best Broadway can offer, they are killed by the lethargic deformation of Joseph L. Mankiewicz and an uninspirational presentation - when it's over, you hardly seem to have watched a musical. Mankievicz does not seem to know how to present Loesser's challenging yet melodic melodies for the maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, "Adelaide's Lament", ends with Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) pulling out the finals while sitting a deck ; and Stubby Kaie's Fauk-Spiritual 'Sit Dove, Iou's Rockin' The Boat 'has its accompanying choir sitting in folding chairs as he simply stands there. Mankievicz entertains all the fun of everything by leaving static scenes too long, and his dialogue (adapted from the book by Abe Burrows) has nothing to do with his films like "All About Eve". Part of the blame must go on track, and everyone is wrong about this: Marlon Brando looks confused because in the musical, Frank Sinatra plays too fine and has no advantage whatsoever makes him so essential. (the songs are not adapted to his style) and Jean Simmons barely records the way Shirley Jones could. Only Blaine, as a lovely shovgirl of Adelaide, commands our attention as a professional on Broadway. The colorful artistic direction is Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol who created incredible sets.
