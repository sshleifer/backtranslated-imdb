Well ... I wanted to wait until this came to the video to see it, and I would like to have it, actually I caught the scary movie 2 on the cable some day, and that made me want to go for the same, what I got myself AIRPLANE on CRACK ... I mean, if you love Airplane or any other Leslie Nielsen vehicle, then you will probably be in paradise, but if you're used to usually VAIANS COMEDI, then you will be disappointed, there were many more Sweets in the one that will keep the young hormone rabies of a teenage boy happy, which is probably the reason why it was the first hit in the first Sunday when he came out. I enjoyed a scary movie 2 times more than this animal feed, and one part five times more. Strangely better than 3 is part 2, but then again I always liked Halloween 2 better than the original as well ... maybe it's just me. The funniest part of the movie must be the way the Aliens say goodbye. But that was not worth the $ 11 that I spent to catch a matinee with my fianc√©. Save money and catch part 2 again on the cable until it gets released on the video cassette, then rent it, do not buy it.
