I'm shocked that there were people who loved this movie. I saw him in Tribeca and most of the audience laughed through scenes that should not have been funny. I felt bad because the main actress was in the audience, but honestly, the plot in this film required a GREAT revision. the scenes are hopelessly dependent and understand how to make it? And the ending just took the cake .. I will not spoil the magnificent conclusion ... but it's pretty much connected with the rest of the horrible scenario ... watch this comedy movie if you need to
