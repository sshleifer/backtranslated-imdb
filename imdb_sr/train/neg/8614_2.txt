I must admit immediately that I was never a Rodney Dangerfield fan. Indeed, he "does not respect" me. I watched it just because my wife wanted to see it, and I found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without real humor. It's full of lumpy, rude jokes and a totally funny plot to turn around Dangerfield's plans to build a ski resort in Utah that just did not attract my attention. The movie played a poor role, including those like Andrea Dice Claia and totally across the hill John Biner (I did not even know he was still there until I saw his name in the points for this.) <br /> This is really a Dangerfield disaster. 2/10
