VVF Survivor Series 2001 It was among the worst events since 2001. Perhaps his biggest fault was the fact that he did not fit most previous Survivor series. There was only one series of survivors. And that Survivor Series match lasted 45 minutes. Moreover, anyone with a working brain would know that it would end up with Rock on Austin and The Rock that prevailed for his team. And do not start with an overview before the event. No matter who won, it was obvious that nobody would die. There was no need for all these absurd hips. Regardless of the story, it was just a wrestling event. As for other matches: the first match was a Christian who defended his European title from Al Snezha. He was a good fast-paced sword and it's good to see that the heel won the match. Villiam Regal against Tiriyya was boring and we saw him 2 or 3 times before. Edge versus Test was good, but nothing special. The competition in the steel cage with headlines was the best match for the evening. The Royal Battle lasted 10 minutes and nobody cares for victory. The female title of the match was not excellent. No, not least. The main event must have been the most legendary match in history. The alliance lost, but guess what, after 5 months each star of the Alliance returned. The game itself was bad. Rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho eliminated 2. Rock was too preoccupied with his acting to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one who jeopardized the whole match. If I wanted any 2 to be eliminated at an early stage, that would be her. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Shov and Undertaker were just guys. 7 games is not enough for the Series of Survivors. If ever, the Survivor Series is as bad as it will be again
