The best thing about camping movies is to know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling sword or a daytime soap opera or Jerry Springer shaw: you can immediately track the scarce plot, identify the cartons and watch it pleasantly as all clich√©s meet. However, occasionally the director does something really unexpected. It can be something extraordinary stupid, or something weird, or something insightful. Director Makinen is there with the best camp directors, and this is his best film. In Ion saalistajat, it seems to all be united. There is nothing good about it, but it still manages to be a coherent whole. The film does not slow down anymore - the action runs, and the blows continue to come. The strangest thing is that it does not make sense for time: some characters seem to be doing something for months while other characters have just spent one hour at the bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer where the sun never sets, so you will not experience a day that will turn into the night. Finally, there is a plot, somewhere. You may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it.
