This is the worst Ridley Scott film. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this film is a black spot on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both of them completely disappeared into an exaggerated film about a girlfriend going to the army. Glup. And there is never any scene that would be convincing in any way. It's really not hard to make such a movie. All that the team did, it could have been an idea for anyone. The writers did not have much inspiration; a lot of stupid dialogues that did not make any sense; and some actions without a brain. I recommend you stay away from this garbage. I hope that many talented people involved in this project will realize that this type of film does not deserve their attention, and that in the future they will work on more honest and more intelligent films than this useless mess.
