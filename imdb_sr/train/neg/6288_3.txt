After reading many comments here, I am surprised by the fact that nobody recognized it as the essential remake of the 1960s Tvilight Zone episode "Mirror Image", starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky story in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis did in 88 minutes with this boring dope. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplainable ending, but in the feature film it should be a bit more content and the story should make sense. Unfortunately, the essence and the sense are the two things missing in "Broken". Yes, there are moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some additional observations: although this is an obviously modern story, no characters in the movie have a mobile phone! And although a traffic accident is an event that leads to a story, it never refers to the insurance company, the person who drove the other car, or the police that would be obliged to do the report. My advice: skip this boredom and look at the original!
