This will be brief. Let me first say that I am agnostic, and not very crazy for the Knights, especially those who are fanatics. However, this documentary had a tone similar to a teenager angry at his mother, because he did not allow him to play video games. I simply could not understand it seriously. Recalling how Charles Manson thought Christ was to illustrate the point that China could cultivate evil? I do not know that it was cheap and childish - it made the opposition seem ignorant. Moreover, the narrator looked snobbish and pretentious. Delivery was complete. I can not seriously grasp this documentary. He could address an angry teenage girl who was pissing with her mother, because he did not allow him to play video games.
