This movie made me very angry. I was desperate to quench "scientists" and unprecedented filmmakers during it. It's very, very painful to sit. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. A little good information about brain functions / chemistry and quantum theory has been lost in the sea of ​​a new old horse. The worst offenders were charlatans Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead the life of a central and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, lives on a higher level. Even the ideas and attitudes with which I essentially agree are presented in such a difficult, clumsy, superior, pretentious, preacher manner that I felt the desire to refuse them. I think that's what made me so angry, the fact that they took what is really a deep aspect of the established scientific thought and stunned them with their hockey of the new age. Much of this is based on the misconception of the application of the concept of quantum theory to the macro world. Corresponding, dramatic pieces with Marlee Matlin are amateur and clichéd. Instead, I would direct people to Bria Brison's excellent research on science: "A brief history of almost everything." There is a very deep question about life and the universe in the current, established science.
