That's what I was constantly exhibiting in the unusually incompetent third act of this sad pronunciation for the film. First, the computer effects are absolutely stunning! These computer wizards really deserve to pull their backs. The rest of the movie, although ... None of the characters are acting in a realistic way, especially in the above, scorned by a third act (I promise not to give it, but believe it is not worth keeping a secret!). Many laughter in the film comes unintentionally, as when trying to explain that invisible eyelids do not work. Please, give viewers more credit than that !!! Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What, after all, would you have been invisible? Nobody could have caught you! These questions were much more intelligently processed in the classic "Invisible Man" from 1933. There is one scene of violence that is especially vague and not mentioned later. If more attention was paid to him, the crazy scientist Kevin Salt could make a little more sense. The movie would actually be much more successful than pornography, because the room could be conducted in a unique and interesting way. But this job ... go see something else. Or do not live with the consequences! 3/10
