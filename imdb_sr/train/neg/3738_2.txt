In any case, it should be the title. This film combines weapons, explosives and mindless killing to make a "movie". Let me point out a series of questions: answer the type of work. What happens in the movie? People are dying. Is this it? Yes. What it is? What plan? What is the meaning of the film? Killing is the only solution. What are the characters? Extremely wrong and contradictory to their personality. Is there anything good in this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras in the shoot. If you love constant killing and greed, then watch a movie. If you happen to be disapproved of such "standard entertainment" then "Made Men" is not for you. , the story is completely resilient, and nothing fits. It proves one thing: actors, directors and everyone who helped make this film surely not "made".
