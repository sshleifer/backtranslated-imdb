This was the worst movie I've ever seen in Billy Zane. I understand that this film was mostly showing new users, who were pretty good for beginners, but above all, the film was not convincing. With all those shootings, you think the police would intervene. Even the coin like Bean on Sean was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes that he was a bugger was not realistic. It looks like this film hit quickly. Bad job. Get a better writer. Counting to the end was not consistent with anything. It took more time to fight. And what a coincidence that every time Billy wanted to blow Sean off, he would have no bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. In fact, Billy's character was stupid. It was so stupid when Sean hit him in the end. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
