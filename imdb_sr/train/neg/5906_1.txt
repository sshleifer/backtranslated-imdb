This film was terrible. The action was exhausted, the performance was bad, the installation was incompetent, and this film has forced me to throw out my eyes. I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie. The balloon scene was stupid, the Mormon jokes were really old, the soundtrack was exhausted, I did not see any chemistry between the two tracks, it was full of stereotypes, the stupid local "celeb" cameo's. The most precious part was "I'll drive as fast as I can I want .. "a computer idiot. The worst is that these actors had to play on the spiritual side, even if they had fucked it up. This film helps to create a long series of tireless efforts to introduce LDS belief in Hollywood. И.Е. RM, Church ball, etc. Etc. I would have given up watching this film and instead I first went to the brick wall. You'll be more entertaining than watching this bad excuse for the show.
