Michael Callan plays a smiling photographer who, however, can be considered a perfect "catch" by any woman who overcomes him; Could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film? He is a "hero" to whom it is very difficult to sympathize, so the film is in trouble from the very beginning. However, problems do not end. It has the production value of a TV movie (see a head made of clay or something like that), and final cheating in a way that can not be detected, in case someone wants to see the movie unlikely). Let's just say that the killer knows more than we knew he knew. (* 1/2)
