I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to get through 74 famous videos that are banned in Britain. This was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a full 10-second cut. There are some creepy characters lurking along with four children. Which of them is the killer? Real killings are not really bloody, so this video nastie is not very nasty. There is a necessary flash, but it has nothing to do with college kids. I had a suspect very quickly and it turned out that I was right. Maybe I saw them too. The end was smart; I have to give the authors credit for this originality.
