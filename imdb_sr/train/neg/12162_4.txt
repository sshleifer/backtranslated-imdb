This is not a horror, as the first part was: This is ("camp") light and humorous. As in many sequels, the action immediately begins without explanation. Does it have a sucker, but I do not regret it. And that's a real sucker. If I understand correctly, these are quite rare among teenagers in the United States today. What counts me is the fact that the main actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen. I thought without the first movie, so I compared it to that. Again, there are too few clothes (mostly trousers) and funny hair, it's not hard to say in which decade this film was made. There are again really strange characters again, this time even more visible "pathological". Special camp staff. It's like some summer camp for psychiatric rehabilitation. People are older: most actors must have at least 25, but I think they should be 16 or something. Some "methods" used by Zli Dike are quite unpleasant. In fact, this film does not have much in common with the first part, which is worse than in any way.
