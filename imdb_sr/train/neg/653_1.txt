If I could give this movie the right rating, it would probably be in the minus. Although I respect the fact that somebody has to make these terrible "horror" films, seriously, people buying tickets for this movie is a loss of money that you can spend on something much more valuable than your time. In spite of being a horror movie, there is nothing terrifying about it unless you imagine seeing how many horror clich√©s you can fit into a single movie. If the rating is higher, it would probably make a better movie in the long run. Whoever made this version of "Prom Night", you screwed up. The actors would probably be able to do a decent job if there were no questionable scenarios. This was a terrible loss of cinema. I would soon again look at "One Missed Call", at least it had a complication.
