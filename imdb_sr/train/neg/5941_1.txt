As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I rejoiced in this film. Unfortunately, I see it's a horrible movie. Jamal Voodward is not convincing enough or realistic to show Notorious B.I.G. Many stories are watched by the real son Notorious B.I.G., Christopher Jordan Vallace as Notorious B.I.G. as a child. Unfortunately, he is not convinced enough to honor his father. Derek Luke is as unconvincing as Sean "Puffi" Combs. In short, no one is convinced enough to play their role here. The big problem with this is the real people they play. It was bored and did not give any information about Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans did not know. I was especially disappointed with Angel Bassett, a very good actress who was lost here as Voleta Vallace. The film and snails think together that Notorious B.I.G. The fans will spend tons of money on it. I'm sorry to say that it happened. It's not near a good movie. I expected so much from it, but unfortunately I did not get any of it. I think this should certainly be skipped.
