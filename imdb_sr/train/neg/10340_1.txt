This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I looked at it mostly from morbid curiosity because I loved the novel and I wish I was not. I turned it off after a little less than an hour, although I wanted to shut it off after five minutes. I wish I had it. It does not look at the novel and changes all sorts of factors. Unless the movie failed to redeem in the last 50 minutes (which would be impossible), I would not recommend it in any way. It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I do not mean, as many people say, that "The Bell Jar" is necessarily unfilterable, but this particular performance could have been done without. I would almost like to see that this is one day in the hands of directors and scriptwriters who can do justice.
