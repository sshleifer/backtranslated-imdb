Lauren Bacall and Charles Boier here do not give real chemistry in this 1945 film. Here is a good story about how Akis is trying to get coal that will be used for the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we are dealing with allegedly disrupted Boer. By the way, Bacall is British as well as Vladimir Putin. Real acting actress was veteran Oscar Katini Pakinou. As was the case with her unforgettable Oscar Pilaro in 1943, "For Whom Bells Bells", Pakinou is playing the Spanish Revolutionary again but this time is a counter-spy for the pro-Franco group. She is quite an evil person here, especially when she throws a 14-year-old child out of the window. She believed that Boier had given the child an important material for hiding.
