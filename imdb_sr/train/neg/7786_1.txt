I should not have seen this movie. The style of shooting may be considered artistic, but it is thought to cause migraines. I think he had an interesting plot, but since I could not watch him long, I missed a lot. The blinking images and stopping the recording of the movies signified my brain. I stopped looking through the middle and I will not go back to the second attempt. I guess I was home in my lighthouse some dark and turbulent evening, it could only be a ticket ... PS I'm not sure if the thing of a lighthouse / movie can be considered a spoiler, but I do not want it on the blacklist at my first review;)
