A horrible movie. These lines are just filling. The film was bad. Why I have to expand this I do not know. This is already the loss of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The acting is shit and writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only good thing in the film is the chest Deniz Akkaia. Even this was destroyed by a terrible and unnecessary rape scene. The film is a poorly invented and completely incredible piece of garbage. Well, now I'm just going to put cloths on the IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text at a minimum. First I lost my time watching these crayons. Then I feel compelled to warn others to make an IMDb account only to find that I have to write a frigging essay about a movie just to say how bad it is. Totally unnecessary.
