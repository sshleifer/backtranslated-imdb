There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And WHY HOW HOW TO REMOVE THE FILMS? The premise is absurd. Thre act is one-dimensional. Special effects are exaggerated. And the film is an endless pistol battle among the worst record Hollivood ever made. But then, if they were good, everyone would be dead in the first five minutes and there would be no film. It's a shame that it did not happen like that. In the temptation to exclude him several times, I stuck with her to see how badly it is. I'm glad to do this because it is (SPOILER?) The last line is the crown of stupidity of the entire suspicious scenario. He is not even worthy of another status in the third run in the out-of-season. Apart from the general horror of the film, I am deeply concerned about its impact on the young audience. The Americans extract this shit and then wonder why they are happening like Columbine. This is truly a banal cinema on the Brobding Nguyen scale!
