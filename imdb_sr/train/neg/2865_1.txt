Mostly I'm not doing a minus, and if this site could give this movie -3 out of 10, it means I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Boll was the worst in the dark that I had seen yet, but at least I gave him 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorff shot at me and he laughed me up a bit so I ran a bit of the rating). Hell if it was compared to the bloodraine, Bloodraine would win the Oscars for the best film if they compete. Now for the movie, this movie is about the BTK killer who is fine, but they could have done better. The start looked good, but that's what I had to speed up the majority because death was boring. I love movies of the killer, and even if they come down, I can still get some cool deaths. I'm not a film expert, but believe me to shoot if I see it. I'm sorry about wandering, but there's nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone took a camcorder and recorded this .. this .. thing is a disaster. Uwe Boll, your movies are no longer on my list of the worst movies ever since he took this cake. I'm sorry I could not explain the plot (if any), but that was the best I could. Now, if you do not mind, I'll crawl into the corner and move back and forth and remind me how frightened this film was for me ... OK not for life
