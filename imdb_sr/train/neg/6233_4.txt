An unheard of trash karate / horror thriller with a multitude of graphically violent violence and free nudity, and a totally meaningless and bizarre "plot". This is a game that is low and low, which will only appeal to viewers with special tastes, but this is somehow frustrating and I must admit that I was not bored while I was watching it .... (* 1/2)
