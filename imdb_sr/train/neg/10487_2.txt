OMG! The only reason I gave this film 2 instead of 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as Elvis-u-hook. Besides, how was half a time a good contribution to doing such a chrome film? Perhaps at that time it seemed like a good idea ... There is no laughing matter to mention, stereotypes are pathetic, actors are futile, direction amateur. Now that I'm thinking about it, most of the guilt probably lies with the director Joel Zvick. He pulled out nothing but the straight performance of all involved. Do not waste your time like me; but then, I enjoy the good wreck of the train. Jesus, now the system tells me I need more lines - go here: This film should be called Return Sender. Okay, now it was smoother than anything in the movie ...
