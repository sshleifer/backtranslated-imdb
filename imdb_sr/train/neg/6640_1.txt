I think it's pretty useless to comment on this "movie" for the simplest reason that there is nothing to comment on. It is similar to broken eggs that have nothing good to show the world an excerpt from the fact that the hull, like the other endless number of eggs it was before it. But since the comment is obligatory for such grandiose insignificance ... Filth is definitely the right thing to describe this film made in the same way as any other Romanian "film" directed by Luciano Pintilie who insists on showing the so-called "Romanian reality" after the communist era (1990 to the present). Under no circumstances is it recommended to people outside of Romania as well as others (who have recently found an amateur camera, lack of complication, lack of quality of directors / actors, etc., noise, etc., as trends and even artistic) : Watch and enjoy this "movie" (as you know you will), but do other well-liked IMDb members service, do not write an online review because it will error, irritate, and eventually spend your time. On the other hand, this film (among other things) has some value, educational for him sets an example for: "How not to film a movie."
