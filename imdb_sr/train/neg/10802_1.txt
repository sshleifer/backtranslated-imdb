Allow me to give you a short movie about a movie: A broken, rough kid named Mak encounters a radio containing Kazaam: a wild spirit. Like all geniuses, he gives 3 wishes, but, since he is benign, he also helps Maku in his personal life, because he has to deal with the thugs and the father who interferes with organized crime. During all this, Kazaam occasionally pulls (also shows Shak's poor skills). This film proves what we all know: Athletes have to keep sporting. I admit he never looked like a movie worthy of the Oscars, but ALL of this scattering of the movie is terrible. The characters are either inconspicuous or stupid, the plot is not worth it, the dialogue is a joke, and Shak is only a quarter of the problem. Even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam, this film would still be a joke. I know that the film just drew BUT HOW it was because Shak was so big at that time (without a boring intention). Frankly, I can not think of any positive things to say about this loss of time. Shak was supposed to take the time to make this film to practice free throws.
