I stopped watching the lost episode because I thought that Ana-Lucia and Libbive's death were unnecessary and really depressing. Then I found out that Libby was just about to die in the next episode! Gah! I can not stand it. I liked this show for the first season, but it definitely fell in the second season, I discovered that Jack and Locke had little religious quarrels to be bored. The death of Rodriguez & Vatros characters was the last straw! This episode I give 4/10 because I was ending my review of this once-great series created by Alias ​​legend J.J. Abrams. I hope his series will improve in the future.
