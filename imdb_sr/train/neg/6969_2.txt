Blue Monkei (1987) or 'Invasion of the BodiSuckers', as it is known in the United Kingdom, was a pretty boring film about the horror of an old man bite into the greenhouse of some mysterious toxic plant !!!! The man hurried into the hospital, where this creature, like a worm, emerges from his mouth, of course it turns into this monster insect and continues on the rampage !! Despite the fact that Steve Railsback and John Vernon were in the movie, I discovered it was boring, with a straightforward predictable story, uninteresting characters, inexpensive special effects and a lack of action !!!! Fans of horror do not have to follow this rare movie, you will not miss me much! I'm giving this movie 2/10.
