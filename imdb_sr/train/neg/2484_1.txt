I still can not believe that Ves Craven was responsible for this piece of shit. This film is worse than "Deadli Friend". The action is stupid, the acting is central and the film is deadly boring. I do not know why Ves Craven hates his debut "Last House on the left" - the absolute masterpiece of this genre and likes (probably) this party. This.
