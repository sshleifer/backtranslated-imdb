Despite his impressive actors and pedigrees, Gingerbread Man is early and often crashes. The action is unrealistically complicated, the actors play bad accents, and the participation of the director Robert Altman is the collection of a payment check. Once again he composed an impressive actor (Like Voody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman) that this time around the letter is wrong. But that's just part of the problem. Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a great lawyer from Georgia, who in the movies sharply opens with incredible seduction. is in grave danger from the ex-husband and the crazy father. With red flags everywhere, the discerning lawyer tries to even manage to bring his children to danger. Fighting the guns and fists follow the necessary pursuit of the car and if that is not enough, the hurricane has been thrown away for a meaningless finale. Running around in a coat in all weather conditions, he is blind for obvious things to keep the story. Hipster Bob Dovnei Jr. is as bad as P.I. but with a little more stress on the bad accent. Robert Duvall as an old man is Boo Radelli who grew up crazy from a bed that serves some thick slices of ham, but at least his cove is acceptable. The female traces (Embeth Davidtz, Darril Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are slender and insensitive. Even the attorneys of celebrities who make kameyas (Vernon Jordan) are wooden with several discarded lines they have. In addition to devoting little attention to actors, the Altman mice scene that drips with Spanish moss is gloomy and shapeless, its action comic strip scene. He has unusual touches and observations (he notifies the viewer that stars and bars continue to flicker in Georgia), which makes Altman's well-designed and unique one. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man is Altman in its worst condition, even if the salary is the same.
