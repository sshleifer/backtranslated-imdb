No story! The plot is hopeless! A car-based video clip with a stuck accelerator, no brakes and stuck gearbox can not be good! I would stop that car within one minute whether I was in it or in a police car that was constantly following it. I'm sorry for the actors who had to suffer such bad scenarios. Several scenes that have some similarities to action have been over dramatized, and far from reality, you can get. In addition, there were many mistakes, for example, the hood of a fugitive car, which worked 100mph. At first he only switched over the windshield, as in reality, but then, after that, he exploded. The car was later seen in the movie with a hood on .... </ br>> This film was nothing but boring, turn it off!
