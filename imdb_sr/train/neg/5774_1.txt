This film is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He's capable of much more than this movie. Get on the bus while anti-racist, do nothing but robbery and degrade the black status of the house. The film's action is about a group of blacks who travel by march by Luis Farrakhan. The bus has all kinds of people you can imagine: gay, muslim, gangbanger and uncle Tom (although he was thrown off the bus). There was only one white person on the bus. He is accused of being a racist at the time he entered the bus to drive. Despite being a Jew and the fact that he explained the situation, he ended up as a racist and left the bus. This should not be understood as a triumph, but as a sad disappointment. Maybe you think I'm racist about what I'm writing, but I think well. More luck next time Spike.
