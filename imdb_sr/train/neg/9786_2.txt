OK, I bought this movie from Voolvorths for my friend for a joke on his birthday, because the front side had sexual allusions in it. But we still decided to watch it. Just for joy. I'm sorry, but this must be one of the worst movies in history. It started well, and we thought "Okay, this can be okay." But after 10 minutes, we were unfortunately delusional. which can not be identified), who behaves, I can only say, it was horrible. Then it came to an end and by that time we all lost the will to live. Finals for the color ball. The only thing I liked about this plot is that they actually did not win, but they were bored enough to beat by default. This has nothing to do with it, but the name given to the team was just terrible. Critical Damage. I mean, they could have chosen a more terrible name, such as "Anti-Christ Destroyers" or something like that. Either that was to be called a movie at all.
