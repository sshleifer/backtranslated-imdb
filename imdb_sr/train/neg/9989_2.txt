I had an accident to watch this trash on Ski Cinema Maku on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror films, because most of them are just trash. This is even worse: it's one of the stupid pieces of shit I've ever seen in my life. A horror movie? Yes, there are terrible things in it: acting, script and special effects - God, I laughed at this funny attempt to make a blow in 90 minutes. Actually, if it was a comic, I would give it 5. Do not think about renting, unless you want to mock the producers. Vote: 2 out of 10 - I did not vote because I was constantly laughing ;-)
