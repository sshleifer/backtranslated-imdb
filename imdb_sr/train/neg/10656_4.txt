What can I say? Kamal Hasana movie is terrible. He behaves very well, but it's a terrible story, along with a terrible direction. In my opinion, director Gautham Menon has to give up on directing. There are many tragedies during the film. In addition, you can not simply believe how horrible these horrible crimes were. There was no practicality in the film. Gautham is just a run-down story. But Kamal Hasan and Jiothika act very well. The criminals look too ugly, although their performance is not bad. I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padaiappa that you can see with your family. You will not be able to watch this movie !! However, Harris Jaiaray did a great job again, and that's why I gave 4 to 10 to this film. In addition, excellent cinema. All in all, this is just a bad, bad movie. Kamal Hasan, I think, should have rejected this film.
