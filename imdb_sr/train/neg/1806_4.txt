Antonioni's movies are not old. What always surprised me is, in addition to unquestionable plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic "psychology" of characters and situations. Remember, for example, the conversations between Mastroianni and the "slander of capitalists" who want to sing in "La notte", or Monica Vitti laughs at the villagers flirting in a train at "La aventura" or Ferzetti throws a glass of ink at the end of the same film. <br /> I reviewed yesterday "Zabriskie Point". In this film, there are many beautiful and elaborate recordings of Rod Tailor, LA streets and highways, commercials, deserts, etc., which show the fascination of the author on his American journey, at the same time Vim Venders a few years later. Unfortunately, there are too many hippie-leaf clich√©s that spoil the movie: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals an airplane, and flying over the desert to get rid of himself and find "something else". - Directors in gray apartments are constantly talking about speculation. - The girl looks at the "objects of the woman" in the pool and leaves because she does not want to be like them. - A couple of middle-class cars in the caravan speak, in front of the beauty of nature, about building a hotel and earning a lot of money. - Last but not least, many couples who lead love in the desert. What a hippie poster! I'm sorry, today, half a century after the "Revolution" "La Aventure" we can see that the king is naked, and his films (except "Le amiche" and maybe "Il grido") are just a handful aesthetics and common places.
