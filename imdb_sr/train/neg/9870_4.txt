I had several problems with the movie: (1) Scenario - specifically, voice Kim Basinger: Movies are not books; They should * show * action instead of having a voice over * tell * what is happening. Occasionally I find a movie with a voice that works, but here it seemed more like a lazy way of writing scenarios. In fact, it sounded like it was practically reading the excerpts from the novel in my voice. (2) I did not feel the emotions in relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and also felt that Alex Carter was playing pretty bad. This is a significant failure for me in defining Jesse's and Thomas's characters - without any connection between them, it seemed to me that she just wanted a paste and that it was a matter of sexual deprivation for him. If this was done correctly, the relationship between them would give much more context to the story. (3) With the book I realized Jessie's middle-aged crisis. In the movie, it looked more like just boring. On the plus side, I did not think that the movie was so bad that I turned off the TV. . . even though that thought occurred to me.
