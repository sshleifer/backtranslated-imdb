"Cut" is a film about some filmmakers who make a movie. This is largely in the Scream mold, an ironic, autoreferential horror that, at least for me, falls, because for all its ironies it's just a bad horror movie, just like the film it refers to. br /> But it was not without its charms. Well, one charm. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as a spoiled, stupid American actress who hates every minute of work with an amateur Australian film crew. She was so convincing that it was tempting to believe that it was not an act, although everyone involved in the Cut said she was wonderful to work. :-) Seriously, every scene of her pouting, sulking or snapping is great. However, everyone else was struggling between being okay and terribly wooden. In any case, "Cut" has some laugh, a few bins up (some of them are surprisingly creepy), and in the end it's another bad horor movie.
