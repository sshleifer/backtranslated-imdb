I will not approach and criticize RAV's theories. I mean, this is a site about movies and whether the movie brings or is well made, and not the philosophy that discusses the site. By saying this, this video is really expanding. That's one RAV recording after another. Some of them are archival videos, so you can see how it has grown over the years, and it's pretty cool. But, otherwise, the viewing experience is mercilessly monotonous. It's a weird comparison, but I was constantly thinking about the Sunday afternoon when I watched some of the stars Barbra Streisand * Funny Ladi * (another really bad) movie). After a while, I turned away from Barbra, and I still wanted to have a scene in which she would not appear: you know, "in the meantime, other characters in the film were on something else ..." moment. But everything was for Barbara. Well this video is RAV's * Funni Ladi *. So if your idea of ​​a good time is to look at the multiple taking and corners of the RAV face, while he is dealing with his theories, composed in a chromatic structure that does not add any interest or insight, then please guest. For me, I could not take it after 20 minutes.
