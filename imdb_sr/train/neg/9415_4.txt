The largely modified and often confusing, original screen version of Man On Fire was at least ten years old, when it was made, and the passing years did not improve it. It's a movie that producers have too much money and insufficient experience to attract attention, and everyone else is just paying their extraordinary alimony or drug dealers, and bodyguard Scott Glenn comes to his feet to save his 12-year-old daughter, the daughter of a wealthy Italian family. Interesting plaster - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Price - all the better, the action is the triumph and scanty and only exceptionally fine result of John Scott (part that appeared in the last mold of Die Hard) positive impression. One case when a remake (made by Toni Scott, the original director's choice for this version) is an improvement.
