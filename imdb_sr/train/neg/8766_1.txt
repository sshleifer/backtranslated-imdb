I should warn everyone that the film should not be watched. She does not manage to adapt in such a magnificent way that it is almost an insult to remember those brave men. The special effect was terrible, I did not expect the CEO's complete failure to appreciate military technology. How does a machine that normally fires at a speed of 600 rpm per minute at 1/10 speed? How can soldiers fall forward when the shell explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells that fall near 20 feet? How come artillery shells fall only on both sides of the road, not on the road itself? I screamed the murder. There were standard dialogues such as Ie bhi kisi to bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan are miaalmaan on Hindustaan ​​me hai and LOC cross mat karo vi mera hukum hai. It's stupid to say the least. What Shobha De wrote is the truth. The director worked without scripts and it shows. No flow into the movie. There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It's just one shot after another, without any connection to the overall war pattern. Scene explanations are terrible. The chief of the military personnel seems unconvincing. To make things worse, theater people indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four-hour film in 3 hours.
