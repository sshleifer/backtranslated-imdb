My dad is a fan of Columba and I always liked the show. I always say disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he continues to look at him. That's his right as an American. But my senses were adjusted to the series when I learned that Spielberg directed the premiere. Then I was grateful that my dad bought this show, which I really can not stand. I went through his DVD collection and dug up this thing when I came home to college. My opinion of the series as a whole was not stiff, but I gained respect for Spielberg knowing that he started as most of the low ranks. And that's making a little hat until a big fish comes in (take the punishment, HA, HA, as Spielberg did.) It's like Jesus before he became a man, a fan of Columba than he most likely liked, even though he contained little Peter Falk is guilty of a crime instead of a Columbine investigation, as many later episodes would do.
