Like some other people who reviewed this film, I also took a nostalgic lead on him ... before I was unhappy to look at him again. Unfortunately, my memory of this childhood film was completely unreliable, and now it is revealed that Paul's hazards are a shameful exercise in a banal, racist and boring movie. Even the presence of old professionals Edward Everett Horton and Terri-Thomas can not overcome the buzziness of the script, the terrible thematic song and some poor "special effects". In addition, stereotypical displays of African and Arab characters are painful observations, especially if it is taken into account that this was done immediately after the civil rights movement. The original Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Michael Weldon reports that Perlin's hazards were originally produced for television, but unexplainedly received a theater show. Judging by the results, this is a very convincing (and confusing) scenario.
