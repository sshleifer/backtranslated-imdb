Appointing the absolutely dumbest shit in cinema history is not an easy task, the candidates are so abundant, but Nemesis 2 is my personal favorite since I've seen it. It was so funny that we rented him the next day, and again I laughed so much that I was literally rolling on the floor. (This usually happens only when I see "Scott of the Antarctic" from Monty Python.) Throughout the film, the feeling of a strong feeling that incredibly retrieves the viewer. I'm completely confused that this clumsy home video has ever come to production. It should be a sequel, but it has nothing to do with the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alek" is female, although it took half a time to stop speculating, what about all the muscles and barbaric-nomadic equipment! It's not a plot at all, it's just an extended shot scene, just so slow and meaningless that calling on the catching scene makes the sound much more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue, which is equally good with regard to its quality, and then the film suddenly comes to a sudden ending after an apparent action scene with lots of gasoline explosions, without any explanation of what it is doing. Luckily, it's never bored, because something stupid and fake happens all the time! Horrible movies are usually just tired, but Nemesis 2 is the perfect blend of exaggerated seriousness and utterly unintentional clumsiness. It's really fun. Rent this movie, or buy it, you will not be disappointed!
