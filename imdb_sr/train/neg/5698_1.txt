I almost drowned in the cheese watching this movie. In fact, I could not even finish it. I want my money back. Another Hollywood bad attempt to make a new idea. It's good to keep a bowl of lemon in the fridge. Just in case. They should have given Nic Cage a hat and whip. Svashbucklin '. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas fights this "lemon". People who are fully and fully marketed (and most of them) should love this movie. If this film was animated, I would understand it more seriously. I'd rather pay to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, this was an incredibly stupid film and made it even more incredibly sad attempt to hide this fact.
