I went into this movie after watching 82 minutes of "Borat" tonight and I went pretty disappointed. I was a big fan of Vallace and Gromit and I'm going routinely to watch animated films. In view of this, I discovered that I was nodding my head and that I almost came out at some point, but I was still waiting to make this movie better. It never happened. Visual effects are stunning, and the work with voice is top-notch, especially in my opinion, Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself several times that the bulbous head of the lizard of the villain was Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this film for me is that it is one of those animated features for the ADD set. He registers after the fact that one routine is routine for another, burdened with a complication filled with a patrol and pulls out any stop in an attempt to pass the "Important Message". It looks very similar to breaking the Oscars for an animated category, and given the way criticism is criticized, I would not be surprised that the Academy has failed and offered its hardware. But if you are looking for a fun animated film about rats, listen to my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
