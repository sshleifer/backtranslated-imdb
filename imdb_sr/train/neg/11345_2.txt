I mean the word "pedestrian". It seems that movie producers have forgotten that something interesting happens. Vera Domergue can do better than this. It is assumed that the mysterious, vindictive Goddess Cobra is torn by love for Marshall Thompson (there is an idea, eh?). Instead, she is a common housewife of the fifties, and the unique, flat expression that she wears during the movie seems to me that they shot everything early in the morning before Faith drank coffee. As far as the rest of the actors are concerned, they are all so sincere "all-American" that the result is ridiculous. This is a country that is more productively covered in Val Levton in The Cat People. I think that the "cult of the Cobra" should be called the "Contractual Obligation Cult." Why else would there be so many talented people sleeping their way even though this slow down, predictable, derivative failure?
