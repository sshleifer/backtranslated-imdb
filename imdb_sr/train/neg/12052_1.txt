What happens when you give a free man enough money to catch him in a dog race and watches how he spins? Homeless people do not answer. They do not have mortgages, rent or idiotic bosses. Homeless people do not have to worry about the IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments. But give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and, at once, have to worry about entering the dog race, buying gas for transportation, paying for insurance on your car and working for someone else. They get a chance to be "productive citizens". This film was just as explosive as the movie. It's a way for the rich and the middle class to say "see what happens when you try to help the poor?" and this confirms the capitalist arrogance. Why not a film that asks: "What happens when you take away everything that a rich man has?"
