Varner Bros. he made many potboilers in the thirties of the last century and most of them are fast, economical and very fun. I really like how the studio used less glamorous elements of our everyday life. This is one of Varner's few sharp melodies that just do not work. Edward G. Robinson is playing the ruthless editor of the newspaper, who is raising the 20-year-old story of a killer with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively performance, but is surrounded by actors who do not cut off the mustard. H.B. Varner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but poor acting Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second run really hurt the movie. Starr is particularly bad on his big dramatic scene at the end of the film. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of the pre-code Hollivood. The Leroy direction is full of innovative visual touches, but bad behavior and unintentionally funny situations can not prevail. Sol Politov's work on the camera is strong. Somehow, this piece of shit got the Oscar nomination for the best picture (in the year that gave us "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
