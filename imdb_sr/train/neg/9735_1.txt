I tried how much I could sit to the end of this irritating riot, but I just could not. Brad Dourif was absolutely exhausted as leadership, and everyone supported only marginally up. The whole thing is ridiculous, from terrible acting to ridiculous FKS to stupid complication. Totally wasted time; do not disturb. Therapy of the root canal would be more pleasant. Bamboo bands under the nails would be much more pleasant. Watching the movie Uve Bolla would be just a little worse than this. You got an idea?
