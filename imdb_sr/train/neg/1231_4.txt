Della Miers (Kim Basinger) is a higher-class housewife living in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twins and her husband, Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della gives all the attention to the twins, neglecting their house and its appearance and disturbing Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, she rides to a local shopping mall during the night to buy paper for gifts, and she does not find any parking space. When he sees an old car parked in two places, he leaves a message to the owner to call him a "selfish jerk". When the mall is closed, the old car driver is holding Dell's car, and is threatened with four punks? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), African American Huei (Jamie Starr), Sino-American Wingh (Leonard Vu) and Latin Chavez (Luis Chavez). When the patrons protect the mall, Chuckie hit him in the head, Della speeds up the car trying to escape the criminals. However, she ruins her truck near the woods while pursuing her gang. She takes a toolbox and hides in the woods, fighting the gang to survive. A few days ago, I saw a trailer "While Outside" and I was eager to watch a DVD. Unfortunately, the trailer is better than film, and I'm completely disappointed with this boring and amazing collection of clichés. Della Miers has been portrayed as an insecure and negligent housewife and does not exist as a woman; Motherhood is her only interest in the concept of family. She hunt four criminals, but she wins them with a toolbox that looks like Batman's belt. So the plot is so absurd that it irritates. The gang of criminals is formed from a favorite cliché of American films, and an African-American, Chinese-American and Latin together with the American lord are politically correct. Kim Basinger has a decent acting, but their children are too young for a fifty-five-year-old woman. My voice is four. Address (Brazil): "Encuanto Ela Esta Fora" ("While Missing")
