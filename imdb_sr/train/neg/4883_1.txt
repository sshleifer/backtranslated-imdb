During the cheap movie Crazi Fat Ethel II, I wondered if it was the same movie that was on the front page. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is foolishly simple. Ethel, a killer maniac with nutritional disorder, was released into the house for overcrowding. She is by far the richest resident who watches while a man puts dead flies in another's soup. Ethel was then teased by one of the house's employees halfway with the bar after hitting the cost of reducing feeding costs for dogs. Ethel returns by pushing him with a wire loop on the stairs, and then ... well, understand. If all this sounds funny, it's not. This film is poorly derived with cheap effects and even worse acting. The characters are so wooden when they deliver their lines that they should stand in front of the cigar store. To make things worse, half of the movie consists of flashback in the first Ethel movie, Criminalli Insane, which is a bit better. A very bad effort.
