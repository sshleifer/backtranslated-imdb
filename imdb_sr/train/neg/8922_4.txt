Two old people sit on the bench in the park. I really do not have problems with this scene - The only problem is that it's not a scene - it's a whole movie IUP movies do not get a lower concept than this. Also, they do not get bored or boring, but it's worse because these two old people are chalk and cheese. One is Nat Moier, who is a Younger Communist, while the other Midge Carter is the former champion of golden gloves, which is also black. To see now, the Jew and the Negro sit on the bench in the park and agree well. Well, I suppose it is possible, though unlikely, but if this film has such a harmless scenario, why deal with the Jewish stereotype? Why do they make them loud tribal nobles who take Hebrew oaths? It's a bit ironic that the Jews at the beginning of the film are exactly the type of Jews seen in the Nazi propaganda films of the 1930s. He is written for a completely different honey from the film, based on the stage play and shows. Valter Matthau sleeps in his role as Nat while this commentary has almost slept the entire film
