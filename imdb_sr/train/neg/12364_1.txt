God, I'm so sick of the shit coming from America called "Cartoons"! the style of drawing (Kappa Mikei) or some cheap Japanese animated film. (Usually, classic characters are messed up) No wonder the anime bites American cartoons! Do not try anymore! Oh, I just heard about this last night; I live in the UK and when I discovered that this show first came out in 2005, well, I did not know that UK is so topical with current shows.
