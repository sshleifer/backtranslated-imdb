At the end of the film, I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in the classroom watching our navy rescue the sea. I loved to see that the engines had fire extinguishers. I guess I had to figure it out before, but I never thought about it. The use of 747 to transport precious old paintings with very little safety is strange and not realistic. The acting was pretty good, because they are mostly experienced professionals, but if you stretch yourself so far from what would most likely have happened, it should be more like a fantasy, a comic, and so on. Everything is taken too seriously. At least the film had Feliks Ungara as a pilot, with Buck Rogers, night stalkers, and Dracula also on board. The film was filled with familiar faces. I understand that Hollywood must a little exaggerate the drama, but it damages the quality of the film when a serious topic turns into a cartoon. That's why I said it was supposed to be more comical. My pet with films about air travel is that they all move occasionally. They walk around with drinks, drop them down and slaughter 5 minutes later, as if they are in the building or something, and behave as though turbulence simply do not exist. Also, I know it's a catastrophe film, but uncertainty does not have to include a 30-second drop after hitting something. In any case, skilled actors and actors keep this bad script from being made in a movie that got a can of tin after its first showing. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic person dress ... :)
