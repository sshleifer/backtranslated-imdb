Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment for me. While the actors did a pretty good job, especially Smith, once there was no cure for a poor script once in production. The film really had a "continuation" of feelings, playing partial events of the first movie. The story is, in one word ... bad, at best. It was not well thought out, and sometimes it seemed very upset and incoherent. In the first move, the MIB organization had some sort of "elite" power. You had several special agents and it had a "mysterious" feeling. Below, MIB organization has a vibe of the Summer Camp of JROTC. The movie was not terrible or anything like that. Movie. Much of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second, and did not add any originality to the MIB Universe. Perfect analogy would be episode 1 for the first 3 films. Was it decent? Yes. Is it worth the title? Not really.
