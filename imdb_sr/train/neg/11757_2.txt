Hey, Arnold! is a slow and lightly boring film. The action is not very creative. Character Paul Sorvina (Shenk) buys all ornate, cheap buildings to build a gigantic shopping mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This action comes to many films from the 1960s. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting, so the idea of ​​him as a bad guy is not very scary. Gramps remembers something of a historical document, and the rest of the film is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal have to find a secret Helge document, whose father hopes to become rich with Shenk's Mall. Children have to move around in the city on buses, so the exciting scene on the bus is not just funny, but it stresses that this film is written for very young children. Hey Arnold, TV cartoon is usually very funny, and it's enough humor to like adults. Cartoon is usually faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold movie, it's about five times more sedated, and a good way to get anyone, including kiddies to sleep. Hey, Arnold was trying to stay awake to a predictable and completely boring ending. If you want to send your children into a completely non-attack movie, that's it. I have the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90-minute movie, the producers started with a 30-minute cartoon script and tried to expand it for 90 minutes. This Mall Story could definitely be covered in a cartoon. I hope Arnold bet will be a better writer if he ever continues.
