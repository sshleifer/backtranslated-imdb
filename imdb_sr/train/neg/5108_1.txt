I can not laugh at people who praise this show as cordial and tired. First, it's completely unrealistic that these people will have a perfect life after their new homes. How can these families afford the maintenance of these new mega-houses? And what about their poor neighbors? Property taxes must certainly increase after this. Besides, the noise would irritate me. Second, how exaggerated can you become a TV show? It's practically the same repetitive Sunday after week. We met with the family who suffered, renovated the home, and then surprised the family and all threw boxes of wipes. Let's not mention how boring it is to renovate. The only interesting part of the show is to see how the house looks, but even this segment destroys false confessions and constant weeping. "Extreme Transformation: Home Edition" is a play to be honest, but it falls. Skip this. If you like to make television, Survivor is far superior and moving.
