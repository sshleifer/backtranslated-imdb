I've heard so much about this movie as it was a great slasher and one of those films in the early 80's which hardly loses fans of most slasher movies. Well, I rented it and I have to say that although he kept my attention as far as uncertainty for most slasher movies such as "April Fools Dai", "Fridai 13th" and "Prom Night", this movie could have been right there The above with the above mentioned only lacked the true enthusiasm and potential of the characters, as well as the story that flowed. The characters I thought were unfortunate in this film was a freak with a curly hair that was constantly crawling around the student dormitory and, of course, led to his true climactic role in the end with a face to the killer. The other would be the dirty looks of the guy with the jeans, he could have played more roles in this movie, which may have made the film more interesting, instead, the film acted like this as another loser who makes strange calls while sleeping with his girlfriend, then dropping his part and cut it to the end that was waste, I was disappointed in his work at the end. As for the real identity of the killer, when identity was released about who he was, I was just laughing, but everything was obvious, and he really made a true jerk of himself, and the boring character after his true intentions were discovered. This movie should be one that will at least once look for all fans of the slasher, but do not waste your hard-earned money on it in some rare inventories that are hard to find.
