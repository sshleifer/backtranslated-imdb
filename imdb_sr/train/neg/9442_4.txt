I tried to enjoy this slasher, as if I were trying to enjoy all the movies. I mean foolish murders mixed with a little nudity and some uncertainty, how can you make a mistake. But Unhinged, I think, is an example of this formula that goes wrong. The main question is the terrible acting of the top three girls who came to the house. It was as though they were sedated, and that prevented me from ever being interested in their condition. The film aims at tension and creepiness, but the direction of the numbers jumps from them, and the film remains quite boring. Too bad, because if the film is better, it would be as. The story and characters are quite creepy and there are some dark and bizarre humors in the interaction between mother, girls and daughters in the old house. There are some good nudity and occasional spraying of blood, but it's not enough that the movie gets a blow. The finale is pretty weird and scary, and it gives a great deal to the film, but unfortunately it's too late. So, in my opinion, to avoid, unless you really love vague slasher movies. There is a lot of potential, but the film does not give too much to pay off.
