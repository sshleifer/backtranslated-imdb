I went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget this movie ... for the wrong reasons. This film should be funny, there is not a laugh at the theater (perhaps for Josh Garcia and Gerard Depardie), and it's bored, boring, boring. It was sometimes difficult to understand what they were saying. They just talk fast and do not open enough to understand them. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I caught myself talking about a line that was supposed to be funny "what he said" and I am French. I hate to say it, because I think that good movies are being made here, but I apologize in advance to all foreigners who will watch the movie (if they have ever been shown outside France). I am deeply sorry for the cr @ p. 2/10
