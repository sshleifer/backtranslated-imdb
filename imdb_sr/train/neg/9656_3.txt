This film was made for TV smells. Nevertheless, it started with great intentions, with great sets and authentic accessories and costumes. The film quickly degenerated into a horrible nose dialogue, and hurried to TV-melodramatic acting. The characters were so sweet that they sometimes thought they were getting ready to turn into a gallbladder, and the action was so intricate and poorly cut out that it seemed like the soldiers just stood around and turned to each other. The Germans were so unrealistic that it was painful to watch. The only thing the German officers did was how great the Americans were. Please, take my word for this. I'm a big fan of the war genre, and this movie is bullshit. However, this DVD has an extraordinary feature that covers letters from the front lines of the First World War, which makes this rental not a complete waste of my time.
