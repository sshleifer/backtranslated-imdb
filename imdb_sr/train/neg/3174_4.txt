Jeff Lovell wrote and directed 'Over Her Dead Bodi' bad. First of all, the idea stagnated like my jokes, and the execution is just a cherry on a cake. Eva looks great as ever and offers cute performances. Paul Rudd looks outrageous and least interested. Lake Bell is completely wrong. It looks masculine and delivers strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is lost, like Lindsay Sloane. I expected more fun than this movie. Unfortunately, I did not have fun.
