I did not really like the idea of ​​a female turtle since 1987 when we knew that TMNT was a four-brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies, and each of the four brothers got the name of a great artist such as Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus does not have any meaning or play any important part here and I believe that the old TMNT series was much better than the new one containing Venus. As a female tortoise will not add any action to the story we love the story of TMNT that we knew in 1987 that we have new enemies in every part is a good thing we have some action, but that the female tortoise would be a very weak point for some actions, we want to we see new TMNT series, but also the same characters we knew in 1987 without this female turtle.
