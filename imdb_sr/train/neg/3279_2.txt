Oh Geez ... There are so many other movies I want to see there ... I got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and that's what he wanted - Yes ... I used to watch this the show when I was at college ... it was foolish, somehow fun, and somewhat oriented to action. The show had a good heart ... and the characters were cute; No one has ever died, nor is it seriously injured ... as if the cartoon is reviving. Until 2005 ... What happened? This one does not work. As others have said, there is simply no cohesive story, and performances are weird ... almost boring - definitely not true to original characters ... the whole thing is like a crazy television skit and lasts over 100 minutes! This was one of a few times when I watched a movie. What did they think? The best I can say, it must have been for the marketing of products, toys, etc. All I can say is, let this die fast. It seems that the original princes of Hazzard look like a masterpiece ... I think the only remake that is left of the television is Gilligan's Island ... Good luck!
