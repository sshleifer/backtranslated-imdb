I watched the film just because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez at SVAT. But this is not SVAT. SVAT had a plot and some nice characters and it made sense. Bullfighter did not have any of that. I should have realized that this could not be good, after all, always painfully bad Michelle Forbes played the main role. unconnected. Another called him the worst film ever. Both gave the film too much credit. I'm so glad I got it from the library for free, but I still feel frightened. one.
