I joined this site to see what people are commenting on this absolute catastrophe of the movie. I was not retracted for a second. The characters were one-dimensional. They dropped every topic they could imagine in the hope that something would be kept. I could bet (and hopefully) that everyone involved in teachers reconsider with shame. There are some great actors here, but you would never know that. Thank God that he did not destroy the career of Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsh or Nick Nolte or Laure Dern. There was no vision, no work of love, only a terrible effort went wrong. BTV I think the writer never made it to the right school.
