Like the early Horror movie The Boogens, an envious invisible killer is pretty disappointed when he finally sees it. Although Steven Furst of the Animal House is obviously entertaining in the role of the incest product, its performance is more comedy than horror. The action, extremely tired, has three sexy women (Bach, Lamm and Lois Ioung) not able to find the hotel for the evening, so they willingly agreed to stay with the seemingly kind kustos museum, which was exceptionally played late Sidney Lassick. If you've ever seen a horror movie, you know that it's a sympathetic IL Sidney disorderly psycho, so you know what will happen to beautiful ladies. All three women are very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Ioung (clone Helen Hunt) is the only one who goes naked, while Sydney watches how to bathe.
