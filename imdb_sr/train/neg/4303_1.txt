The previous comment made me write this. It is said that the Muslims are blondes, and the Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment only says that this opinion can bring racism. Look, the race is nothing. I'm a color for my eyes. I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not an Irishman. Can I add that I am not 100% Serb, that I have an Austrian and Croatian blood in me, but what is the point. I'm a dark, half-breed? Everyone who uses racial prejudice with such bad intentions as Lantos (the director and director is racist for me. Karadzic, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, Tudjman are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yugoslavia. all in hell, but that will not bring back our dead relatives back. I am proud to be a Serb and I am proud of my relatives, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (I am from Serbia and I have a multi-ethnic family). It does not show the suffering of Serbs or Croats inside Sarajevo, the terrible terror of street gangs, m slimanskog extremism. Added: kneel and pray for all the innocent sisters and brothers, Muslim, Catholic or Orthodox, were killed in this war. Our accidents, false humanitarianism that does not help. It helps Lantos to fill their pockets with more deer, all right!
