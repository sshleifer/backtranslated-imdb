I had a fascination with a cartoon back to college when it was made. He had a lot of charm "Get Smart". Although, of course, he had his own faults, it was quite comfortable. Of course I was very interested in watching movie versions. That was before I saw him. After that, I wanted it never to be done. Except that it all misinterpreted (who is on Earth, even though Broderick was close to the role?), he simply did not make a mark. The effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing I liked in the movie; you see the version of the live gadget in action! What was missing was a story and treatment that made him funny or charming or interesting. The original was a silly cartoon with a very cool attitude. It was fun. The film became mutilated and took it too seriously. Had she seriously had a big plot or she was crazy enough to look like a "cartoon movie", it might be pleasant. As there is, it does not deserve to be considered as part of the "Legat Gadget".
