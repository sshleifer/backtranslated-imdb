This film was shot and thrown out of my hometown. I remember wondering about this and the whole talk about the fact that Molly Ringwald was in the city ... Story ... </ i> <BR> <BR> 20 years after the film was laid to be breaks "without ending, a group of film students went to finish it - with dire consequences. It seems that someone does not want the film to end. The story is weak. taken in a tiny tongue in the face, but it did not have any real tone. The characters are mostly transperantic and the little information you received about them only does not care, it seems ire It's strange to hear Kilie's accent as an Australian, and it's nice to see the boy with whom I went to school in the main role, but it does not buy a movie at all.God knows why the producers thought they would come to Molly Ringwald, perhaps because of the nature of the film it's somehow paying tribute to the movies of the 80's / bad horror films), but really Aussie's actor would do a good job. Regarding casting, it was a lot of prison. Some of these children especially the two main chicks - played by "directors" and "producers") seemed to be trying to act. It's never a good look. Also, the recordings had a rough feeling about them. Maybe through the light? Just not as smooth as it used to be. Killer. Lord. Can it be less scary? However, there are some shock factors and a couple of rough scenes. I liked the movie, but that was not great. It's been 90 minutes, but it could have gone for less. Perhaps, they would have tightened the script, it was better. They had many characters who were killed - but no actual construction for them was killed. Perhaps it would have been better to kill fewer people and concentrate on the terrible atmosphere. Now I know that this comedy and elements were fun. Or so incredible that they were funny. But I'm not convinced. LM.
