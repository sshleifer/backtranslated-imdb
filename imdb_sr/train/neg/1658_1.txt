This is probably the most boring film in history. I really rejoiced to see this film with regard to actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I'd rather watch the Three Amigos than ever again watch this movie. He immediately moved from the DVD player to the trash. My apology to those of you who obviously liked this movie, you probably liked Nev Coke too. I'm at a loss to see why someone would enjoy this movie, it was slow, boring, and there is no real plot. Wait 105 minutes to start the movie. As far as I understood, this was done in 1976, but this was the era of bad television everywhere around. Thank God's disco and Three's Companions went along with signs of stop signs and Bai Citi Rollers. Oh well only my thoughts.
