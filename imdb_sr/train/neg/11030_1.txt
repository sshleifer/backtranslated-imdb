Recently I watched this movie at the Gothenburg film festival, and to be honest, I was on the worst movies that I had an accident to watch. Do not misunderstand me, there are funny and fun bad films (for example, "Manos? Hand of Destiny"), and there are terribly bad films. (This is in the second category). Cinema was incredible, not in a good way. It seemed that the cameraman was deliberately holding everything out of focus (with the exception of a free nipple), lighting was something between "one guy running around with a bulb" and "nonexistent". Actors were as bad as soap opera actors, but not as bad as porn actors, and left the impression that each line was a complete surprise to them. The only redeemable feature is the look of the masked killer, the classic look and Jason Vorhees of "Fridai the 13'Th". The plot was extremely poor, and the end was even worse. I would recommend this film only to those who need an example of how the film about the horrors should not look or perhaps the insomnia that needs a dream.
