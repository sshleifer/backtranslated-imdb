The famous Japanese director Takashi Miike can not start the wheels with this sharp thriller, by adapting Iasushi Akimoto's book on the evil old woman (and abusers of children!) What is part of the new urban legend: if your cell phone is ringing with a strange tone - and you see the message ' One missed call '- you will only repeat the message to hear your last words before your death. The most successful part of the movie is the sharp satire Realitate TV cameras that fall into the future victims, but not so complex deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) Are disappointing and disrespectful. Frequent images of devastated dead bodies are actually quite discreet, and this overall courtesy can be the reason why the film is so stable at the end. Hollywood predictably jumped to a far-reaching action in 2008, but the US version did not go better. NO STARS from ****
