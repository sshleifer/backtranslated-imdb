Just what we need! Another remake of a vintage Hollywood movie, with Eddie Murphy again in the second after THE NUTTI PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we are running out of special ideas in making a quality movie, ladies and gentlemen! There are some signs of hope for a cute and wonderful picture of animals that can act and talk to people. Unfortunately, things can only get worse. Bath jokes and sexual references immediately kill this piece of "family" entertainment. Even parents and children saw a trailer on the Family Channel, followed by extreme fear and disgust at the cinema. It is sad to say that this is a more progressive era before millennia, but to enjoy it as it lasts, because things can only worsen over time. It was more and more wrong with a brand new DR. DOLITTLE. It's absolutely meaningless, it feels too straight. I also hate Chris Rocco's irritating voice !!! We need more talented voice from a crowd of overpaid celebrities who do not want to declare bankruptcy. I will have to agree with my local newspaper that will give this one among the top five worst films of 1998. Murphy's next project could be Patton if he is not cautious!
