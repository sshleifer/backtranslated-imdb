Sure, we all love bad movies at one time or another, and we actually enjoy them, but this was not even a pleasure, just bullshit. Some guy, Vince, who was sufficiently trained to become the main character while he was probably drunk / tall - probably both, and he thought it was a great idea to make a movie. Then he continued to show his scenario to equally high / drunk people. All in all, this film was so bad, predictable and unoriginal that I could not pass 20 minutes before I turned it off. Looks like you looked like a citizen of Kane. Bat Man? VTF ... Some guy walking around with a stick, a real original. Almost as good as I call it The Fat Man, and that a fat man is walking in clothes of superheroes.
