This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I've got it off the road, I feel better. This film is bad from start to finish. The story is poor. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is the worst in his cartoon character. Thank God they killed him. And who wants to see Roseanne and Tom Arnold? The only good thing in the movie is a little minor performance given to us by Freddie. We see that he once had a family, and to see his violent father (Alice Cooper). Besides, everything is bad. There are some quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Iaphet Kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is so bad. I spent one and a half hours watching this movie and I can not return for an hour and a half.
