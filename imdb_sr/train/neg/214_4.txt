Given that this film had a serious and quite successful campaign, I would expect something to be worth fuzza ... from the introductory scene (in which two brothers "sensually" stroking each other, lying in bed) quickly goes down. nothing to attract attention, and not a striking thing in the whole store, acting baaad baad (a few minor exceptions, but art is at best). Incest and lesbians are promising themes, but the depth of none of the two is analyzed in the script (given the possible excuses of the creators, saying that the goal of the subtle movie was funny, unless the subtle and superficial mean the same ...). Too curious spectators will not get any interesting scene ... at this moment, which could have saved part of the movie ... so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things could be said ... but please watch a movie ... I am an egoist and I would like to spend as many as 1 / 2h of their lives ... as I did :(
