I chose to see this movie because it got a good result here on the IMDb. But many people have either a very bad taste or someone has corrected the result. Anyway, it was a real disappointment. The film is just as dumb and unbelievable as the title suggests. There is really no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here it goes: it felt as if someone was thinking: "Would not it be cool to make a movie in which the snakes were on the plane? The reason would have gone crazy and started to bite things?!? And that's it! The action is skinny and non-original: Snakes are bad CGIs (but it makes sense to cut corners in a movie that nobody in the right mind will recommend to anyone!) The acting is bad, and all people are incredible stereo types. Yes Summarizing: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - get off!
