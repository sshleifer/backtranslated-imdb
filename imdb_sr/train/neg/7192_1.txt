I was hyperventilating for 5 minutes in this film, shaking and shaking with pain. And not in a good way. The story is about a group of idiotic children who make telephone conversations with a psychologist, which is always a good idea. It turned out that psychologists do not like phone calls, because in 2 minutes he is at their door and killed poor Villiams mom and dad. So skip 15 years and guess what? I'm still on the phone. Would you think that a terrible murder would have deterred them from doing it, but not. So after about two hours later and too many shouts of screams realized that this film gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a serious drive to take my life. This piece of crap is not worth even laughing at a bad production, "starring", or Rutger's career. I love shitty horror films, but this is the most unfavorable piece I've ever seen. Just do not.
