I saw this DVD in my friend's house and thought it was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood - not the big names in it. I am sufficiently interested to decide to kill him later. It was hard for me to bear the experience. Then, after I finally looked at the sound of the loan, I thought, "We Turks are really sucking in a Hollywood movie. This is an insult to the genre of robbery of hostages ... "but then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, it was not a Turkish film; on the contrary, literally shot in America with an American director and a team! That's why I've been thinking again - How can you convince names such as Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in such a project? Probably with money. That's what kept me thinking. How can you raise such an amount of money to offer them and allegedly an international actor? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer. You can find the cheapest equipment and crew. And if you still have trouble adjusting your budget: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to make - or vice versa, I do not have any information about it -. So, the ultimate outcome is not a bad movie, because they are all so impatient to present themselves as .. This brings you to thinking - in my case, even meditate - and there are many movies that do not even give out what hits. This one you think; Looks like you're wondering .. He leaves you with disbelief ... and then he makes you wondering again.
