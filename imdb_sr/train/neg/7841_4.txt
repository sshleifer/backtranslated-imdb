I enjoyed the A Man Called Horse when it came out in 1970, but Return was played as a typical sequel. All about it - budget, script, plot, casting and acting - was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Voman, an elderly tribe of yellow hands, does not look like an Indian, like half of the other "Indians", played by Italians, Mexicans and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the boss was more like a fat old wings than a fierce leader of a warrior. He even used the bow as a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who has done such an extraordinary job in the original, seems to be around this time. I suppose he could not resist the easy pay he received for re-examining his role as a horse. To be honest, there are some interesting moments in the movie, as the horse passes through a painful ritual of purification Find his vision and gather the yellow hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but in general, the return is uneven , boring, torn and predictable - just like most of the sequels.
