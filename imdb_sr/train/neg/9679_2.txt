This film was terrible in the worst way: you simply did not care. You did not care what happened to complication; You did not care about the characters. All were deprived of their hearts. In the end I went for 45 minutes because I simply did not want to subject him to my mind. There's too much sex in the movie. Sex can be ok; can even make a movie (hence Karma Sutra), but the relationship here was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. I do not see this movie.
