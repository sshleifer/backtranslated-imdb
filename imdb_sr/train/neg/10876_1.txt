What was that D-movie? Bad acting, bad special effects and the worst dialogues / stories I've encountered. The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a nice riffle like a broken cop. However, the rest of the film is terrible and boring. It's not even so bad, you can laugh. Simple shit. And whoever compare this to the Evil Dead series, he could compare Tomb Raider with Indian Jones (well, fine, at least Angelina Jolie at Tomb Raider)! 1 of 10
