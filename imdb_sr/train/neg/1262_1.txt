This film has a weak plot, poor characterization, and really bad special effects, which I have been asking why I lost my precious life by watching it. There are random characters that do not add anything in the story and look like the excuses that the director gets his girlfriend in the movie. The robots are sad and the main "hero" of the bot is included with a huge knife switch. If this film was not so bad, it would be ridiculous, but there is nothing ridiculous about it. The main antagonist is one of the only redemption figures and he was killed. It's sad when you fall in love with a bad guy because he's the best one he's looking for. When everything is said and done, this film is better left on the floor of the cutting room, or not at all.
