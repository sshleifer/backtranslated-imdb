I had the pleasure of looking at this movie early and I must say that I thought it would be boring and wondered how they could ever improve the 1984 Bachelor Parti version of Tom Hanks, which I thought was pretty good. .. I was right ... Honestly, I thought it might be better ... There must have been some funny moments, but it did not seem to hit me ... The show was fine, and the story is pretty well followed by the original, but I think it could have been much better ... I would say this film to teenagers and young people from the heart; full of women's bodies, alcohol and sex ... This is just another typical movie film series that has been performed over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this.
