I've heard of this movie for many years and finally I have the opportunity to see it. The mass killing of cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 ultimately led to the closing of the camp for cheerleaders. Fast forward to 1982, and Bambi, a former student, opens her with new recruits, including Candi (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandra (Debralee Scott). One by one, they kill them, until only one is left. Then we found out who did it and why. In the movie, Tom Smothers worked a terrific accent like Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens worked his Pee-Vee Herman schtick. The action is not very well developed and pretty silly, but some funny scenes are happening, including the House of Bad Pies and strip poker scene. The ending looks like it was thrown together, which is a shame. All in all, well for a total of ten or fifteen minutes, the rest can only accelerate. Maybe catch him on TV, but it's not worth buying.
