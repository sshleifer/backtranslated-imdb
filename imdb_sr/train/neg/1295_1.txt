This is seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think there is another movie of the same director, an electric dragon of 80,000 in, a masterpiece. I really wanted to love this film - Asano is a great actor and the story was extremely appealing. but I could not find anything fun. The film lasts forever that nothing happens. and the effects that the director used-such as a constant percussion and excessive use of slow-motion recording-only added to my increasing anger over the fact that the plot was so staggeringly slow and that the actors were outrageously exaggerating. much boredom was the result of foreign supplements that were totally unnecessary-like an hour spent on the asana that visited the Buddha statue and announced that it was not protecting anything. This did not add anything to the plot. a colleague of Japanese film and I have constantly checked the time. we could not believe this film was terrible as it was. and the finale was terrible. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for being able to get through this, but unfortunately, I made a mistake.
