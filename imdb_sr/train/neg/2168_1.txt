After reading another review, I thought this film would be good. I enjoy movies "B", but it can not even be classified. The photo is probably the only semi-decent thing in the movie. However, editing left a lot of desire. It was very agitated and staccato. Who selected music and sound, he did a terrible job. The music was terrible, especially everything that was atmospheric or scenes. If the act was better, they could have taken the film. Unfortunately, I've seen better acting in porn movies. If you want to see a "B" movie about a vampire, see "Blood links". You'll be much more fun.
