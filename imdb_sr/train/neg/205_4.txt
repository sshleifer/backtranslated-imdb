I jumped on the opportunity to look at this film uncritical and uninterrupted, remembering the rah and rave for it. But wherever he seemed to reel into a really scary, he retreated and went somewhere else. The water that creeps on the house, the black rain, the prophetic substance, the wrong turn in the raw sewage system, were thrown before they could be closed. What a disappointment. Chamberlain's almost maskless facial mask offered a bit, but confused disbelief, something I found out how the mirroring as a movie wore. What could have been aboriginal aboriginal mantras and instruments in the background were instead of a cacophony that seemed to be designed to beat terror in the head. Ideas that modern humans can embody ancient gods, that the Aboriginal peoples believe that the red-haired white people were the first priests, and many other possibilities, are transferred more like a shopping list than as an indication of another dimension (dream time). In the final scene, I did not understand what the director was trying to say. Is there a great wave? So what? How big? Tsunami? Yes OK. It is devastating, but not apocalyptic. Is this the end of the world? From the wave? The last wave? It should be a pretty damn big wave. Why? Is the world such a bad place? It did not look so horrible in this movie. In fact, I did not think that the wave would go off, because the shadow left Burton's face that the wave had thrown out. Was it just Burton's apocalypse? Damn it, it happens every day to people who lose it. It was not at all interesting that he was just him. The most terrible scene, and one that gives the best indicator of Veyir Potential, was in Charlie's apartment where Burton went to face the old one. The man for fear of Burton's wife. Charlie always asks him, "Who are you?" and after a while it becomes really disturbing. Unfortunately, the film never followed.
