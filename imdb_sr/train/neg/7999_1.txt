This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I gave up watching him for an hour and complained much about that hour. acting is terrible and there is almost no complication. I suppose someone came up with a strange form of an animal and began to make a story about it. lending some ideas from movies such as Resident Evil and Aliens does not produce a movie like them. If this is going to be a top Korean movie, I'd rather not try to see even a Korean movie trailer ... By the way, these films are a good reason to believe the necessarily high rating means that the movie is promising. I think that every Korean who has internet for online games has rated this film over 8, although there is no idea what it is about.
