A lot of promises and nothing more. Every star is certainly in accordance with HK standards, but man is the one who is a stinker. No story? That's fine, the action will be reimbursed as most of the HK stocks. What? Action is terrible, rough and rare? Dragon Dynasty releases to this point are largely excellent and are generally regarded as classic in Asian cinema. This is a disease. They managed to extract a couple of actors from Infernal Affairs, but they can not bring life into an unrelated scenario. There are stages of dialogue that speak two or three lines with a cut between each and there is no continuity in what the characters say. You almost feel like each of them gives a monologue and ignores other characters. Michael Biehn is from the tree, really? Sammo Hung uses a duplicate? No way. Yes, the way. Stay away.
