A horrible and horny wolf. Young "Red" wears full makeup and extremely short panties and coats. It took about 20 minutes and realized that this could be a dream of a pedophile. "Up-beat" music sounds like something I'd heard in a strip club. In fact, I think this movie is a painful joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, I'm glad to watch this with my daughter, I do not want her to think it's normal for families to watch quasi kidie porn together. Very bad, very sadly sold as a family movie, Joe Fatone will probably be confused about what's in it. And what about advertising as "spectacular effects" ??? The effects look low budget, horrible.
