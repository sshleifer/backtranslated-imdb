I read somewhere that Kai Francis refused to pay, Varner Bros.. he returned by convicting her for weaker projects for the rest of the contract. She decided to take the money. But her career suffered accordingly. It could explain what worked for "Comet Over Broadway". (Although it does not explain why there are Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter in it). "Funny" is the word used by others for the plot of this film, and that's exactly the target. Trial for murder. Her career with the waters. Her success in London. Her final scene with her daughter. No part leads logically to the next part. Also, sets and costumes looked like things from B-movie. And her hair! Turner shows a lot and a lot of her films this month. Look at anything else and do yourself a favor.
