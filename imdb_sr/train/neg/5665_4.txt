This deliberately bizarre adaptation of the short story of Borges is a typical Coke. His powerful visual feeling is, as usual, canceled by the terrible half-acted acting of most actors. The film is definitely in the surrealist tradition of Bunuel's Mexican period and sometimes it seems that the poor take over the Elements of crime, Lars Von Trier. Chok's apparent preference for individual recordings, jumps and ambient sound recording work against the effects of the film. Worth to look, but ultimately disappointing.
