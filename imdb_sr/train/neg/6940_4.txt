When you have two tower performers set against each other, the least you can expect is top-notch friendship, and this is the case in this film where we have 64 years old Amitabh Bachchan romance of the 34-year-old Taboo. Wait! In fact, that's all in the name of the action, so instead of "cheen" the content that "Kum" in this Adman turned the first effort of the writer-director R. Balcdi ... Believe the two senior actors to let the house down with their wise cracks and bitter-sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair, and that's all you'll find in a slow but refreshing first half. London's stores trapped in the rainy season are enchanting. By the end of the first half, the romance was over and the mission was over. There is not much to be said. That is why in the second half of the strange opposition comes in the shape of a girl's father to the extent that he goes for Satiagrah is really a test of patience. There is an equally strange climax on how he is taught. The result, the other half is dry, flat without energy. There is a sublot with a girl who dies of cancer, does not affect much. Still, the film is recommended for fresh access and performance.
