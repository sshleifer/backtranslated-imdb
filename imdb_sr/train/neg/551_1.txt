I reviewed the list of 100 best AFI comedies, and I must say that this is indeed one of the worst. Not only the 90 films on the list I've seen, but about any movie I've ever seen. The drunks are sometimes ridiculous, Dudley is not. Lisa almost made it pay, but unfortunately ... just watch Arrested Development if you want to see it in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughs and drinks should be ridiculous? I would highly recommend any other film to the 100 best AFI comedies for more laughter than this. If you want to see a funnier "drunk", try Thin Man. A more entertaining movie in general, every movie Mark Brothers will kill (especially if you're drunk as Arthur).
