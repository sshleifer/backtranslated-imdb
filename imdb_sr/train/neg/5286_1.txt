I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and I ordered a movie from Amazon.UK only to be able to see it without waiting to come to the United States. What about Anna for Ventvorth? Anne Elliot's whole point of character is that she was silent and sophisticated. It is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mari, did she suffer from a stroke or something? Her speech was not normal, nor was her walking normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters, which made their whole "romance" completely incredible. On the final scene even have Salli Havkins in the same dress that Amanda Root wore on the scene with a letter. The same clothes do not make the same movie. In my opinion, they did not look at the 1995 version, which, although it had flaws, remained close to the book. The book, I do not think they read it. This is like Cliff's Notes Persuasion. Hit all the high points without explaining.
