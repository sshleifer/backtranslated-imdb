Holy sh * t this was terrible. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and I thought I'd get my eyes to Edip Rex Castle. Dear God. this film does not deserve more credit than anything the high school film lover did. please save your money, this movie can not offer you anything. unless you enjoy the parties and sleep in the movies. You know, bring the girl and make things interesting. anyway, you'll be the only one there. F @ ck this slide shov. <br /> <br /> We are warning you. I recommend you not to look at this. Hello. Enjoy this day? I am. This comment was a hundred times more entertaining than pretending to watch this movie. This is sad.
