How wonderful. Another film about America by someone who has visited here probably more than half a dozen times, one day in a piece, and believes that he is a "expert" for the country. Sheesh. I should go on a trip to Germany for a week, and then I go back and film a movie about Germany as a "country of Nazis" or something like that. Vim IL boys, you should meet Lars von Trier and make an ULTIMATE film about Americans. Of course, we all know that it is necessary pretentiously left-oriented "we are the world" Europeans to make a "real" movie about America. Yes, right. For a continent that has begun not just one, but two world wars, Europe certainly has many opinions about the wrong "foreign policy" of America. P.S. Do not worry, Vim IL boy, there are many Americans from UC Berkeley who will just love your movie. Of course, these are the same people who think that George V. Bush is the worst of Hitler, and that the picture of a can of soups is "pure genius" !!
