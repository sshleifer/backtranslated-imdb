Ah, the spirit of '68. Streets in Paris were ravaging the rebellion, the hippies were high in the spirit of love. How did Britain mark this era of radicalism and revolution? Erm, in all likelihood, dear Old Blighty focused on shooting movies about boys in boarding schools. If ... contains an evil establishment. It contains an uprising of the oppressed. What he misses, unlike the passion of Parisian and hippi headtripping, is every sense of excitement, except in his complete ending with ammunition and artillery. Lindsay Anderson's If ... the stars ever-mackerel Malcolm McDovell as one of three private school students who decorate their bedrooms with photographs of Lenin and other left-wing radicals. This is, obviously, an anti-establishment film in its overview of the evil upper classes that rule the shelter and obsolete autocratic practices of standard public schools. What makes it unusual is, however, that for all its radical sympathies, this does not explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human competence and the despotic school system, but it is just a kind of float: it lacks complication and personality is missing. Surreal bits occasionally fade and emerge, and the film reappears in black and white (due to low budget or artistic expression?), but there is little interest in talking. All we get is a painful outbreak in which young rebels take a rifle and shoot down the shadowy masters of the institution. Clock! Revolution! Finally something that requires another thought, unlike the rest of this boring exercise in dreaming in the boarding school. the feeling of direct interest in the end. Instead of being a testament to the dissident zeitgeist of the late sixties, it is only a dazzling document of British higher education. Anarchy? More like apathy, the only man the viewers will watch after watching If ... will be Lindsay Anderson.
