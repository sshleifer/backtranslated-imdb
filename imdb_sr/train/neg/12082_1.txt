Awaj, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear readers, and let me tell you, OVA VERSION SUCH! I do not know who made all the people money for this fleet, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took a classic show and turned it into the most melodramatic melody. This version is literally so bad that neither the presence of a great actor like Makimilian Schell can be saved in the title role. The only quality of this movie is that she made excellent food for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and the Rooftop had a lot of fun with this. But in any case, I'm sure that Shakespeare, if he was alive when they did this, would not want his name to be linked to it. This "Hamlet" is not so bad it's good; it's just bad. Absolutely terrible.
