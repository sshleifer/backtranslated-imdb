I am 13 and I hated this movie his worst movie on earth I totally lose my time watching him and was disappointed with her cause on the cover and on the back of the movie looks pretty good but I was wrong my bad. but when I saw the delta it was completely different and a bad actress and I really did not know how many girls tried to be so confused. the film was in some areas confusing and I did not enjoy it at all, but I watched the entire movie just to see if it would be better but not, it was boring, boring, and did I say BORING.and I do not think that many other people I liked it, and I was bored dull
