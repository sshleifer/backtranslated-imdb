Like me, and my other half, the big fans of the trash horror, we could not resist the film that contained both giants who were thrilled! However, for a 2004 film with a rip off cover for Freddy Vs Jason, this is a shame! The worst movie I've ever seen, but it's worth a look at the laugh if you're able to live it! Acting is terrible for effects ... I could do better on my camcorder. It's so bad that they just tried to invent the face of zombies and omit the neck, hands, and so on. No story, weird flashbacks that do not make sense and horrible script! "from one vampire" you broke my cigar "was the answer of a man who looked like an uncle Jessie from Duchess who crossed with Santa!
