I'm usually a little fan of a bad movie from the '80s and early' 90s that now has beens ... but this film is so incredibly awesome that it was a real test of endurance. Boys dressed as girls are made to death - but never so pathetic. The performance of Corey Haim was insignificant as usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better. This does not have the quality to buy, even if you're a fan of number one actor / actress in this piece of garbage - go away!
