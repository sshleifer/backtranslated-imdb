The action of the "House of Games" is the strongest thing: a successful author and psychologist deceives a gang of genders, but revealing the evil part of oneself who enjoys the excitement of what they do, finally gets revenge. It's about the field: but somebody has to take responsibility for what appears as puppets. It must be director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse had a diverse and fairly stable television and film career, so she can not do this all the time. She should go from an upset, cold, controlled professional to calculating, a wicked, fast-paced lady having fun, as shown by a change from beige trousers (which looks to be three-day straight, including underwear) to a floral sundress floppy. But it seems that everyone speaks the same lines with the same sharp and precise way; I suppose Mamet wants to make sure he does not miss the style of his scintillating script. The effect is disturbing and spoils the atmosphere of the mystery and uncertainty that it's probably trying to create. Sometimes the "House of Games" loses any connection with how human beings really behave or speak, and it becomes only a mechanism for completing the plot. Accidental vibe'n'oboe fauk-jazz soundtrack does not help. The end result is that the only fun thing is to guess the outcome, and as soon as you do it, it will get bored faster with robotic two-dimensional performance. And they smoke too much!
