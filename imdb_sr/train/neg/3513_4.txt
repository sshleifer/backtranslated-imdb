Jeremy Nortam is fighting against the clone of the "Total Recall" clone script and romantic one-time game that brings life to a confused character. Luci Liu graduates with his acting from wood to finish. You can not laugh when watching her interviews on a DVD when she uses the term "Femme fatal" and "Romance". French film-noir actress she is not and they lack chemistry together. This film fails, not in the plot or action sequences, but in the lack of attention to detail in film photography and fists. an overview of technology technology that surrounds the main protagonists. There are few attempts to dress the landscape to represent any neighboring film landscape or period. Cars are very nineties, and architecture is barely modern with open plans that suggest a limited budget, but not aware of dressing techniques. The technology is positively hilarious. Massive "2001: A Space Odyssey" mainframes powered by portable CD-ROMs with data collected for some inexplicable reason, despite the multiplying communication network that even the weakest technologist would obviously have been aware of today. There is an obvious lack of research done here and given the nature of the open source cyber community, the research would cost slightly more than the notice board and personal time. DVD interviews also reveal the original name of the movie was "Compani Man", but it probably fell out to get rid of the Matrix Hype. The title "Cipher" has only the slightest link to the movie. Terri Gilliam would do wonders with this concept; and completely copied the Decalogue. This is the quality of the television and extremely disappointing for the production of the film. Maybe he made a good sub-plan for Alias.
