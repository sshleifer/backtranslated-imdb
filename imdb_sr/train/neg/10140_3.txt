This film has never been filmed. What a shame for the budget. Please hire convincing actors and make a real movie. Very thin parcels and untouched lines. Almost ridiculous, and it's a disgrace to an action movie ... It's definitely not worth watching. far. You saw him, and this was not worth repeating 3 or 4 times. It's time to get Steven Seagal out of film production. Black Dawn and Submerged were already bad, but this film is even worse.
