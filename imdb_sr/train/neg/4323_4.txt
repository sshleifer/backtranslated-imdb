The European holiday (known as European Lampoon's European Vacation) is the weakest of holiday films (first and third highest quality film). While Chevi Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Grisvold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue. This leads to suffering suffering, and jokes are not ridiculous at all. To be more precise, what really causes the suffering of this movie is the fact that "jokes" are what they are, just glued together in a paved scenario, instead of serving as a central embarrassment like the rest of the 3 Holiday Movies. Oh well, I can not win them all. 4 of 10
