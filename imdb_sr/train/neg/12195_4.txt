The action is not so original. If someone saw "L'ultimo Bacio", there is nothing new. The rich family in Rome living everyday life is boring and false, and everyone is asking others what they think of them. It's really boring after half an hour because it's easy to understand where the story will end. This is because in this movie it's easy to see a moral view of Muccino, and even the hardest parts look normal. To sum up in the first two minutes of the movie, it would be enough and the film's goal was already said. the family has seen it for 30 years, I do not like to watch a movie that wants to show reality, but to be coherent with its thoughts it has to push more than normal situations. It's really good how Muccino put the camera in the right place with the carathers, and that's the only reason I will not sleep in the cinema, even though I'm always in the movie scream from the beginning. Perhaps it would be good to see the family as they are in reality, not to blame anything from it. Morante was intense and great as usual, but unfortunately on a bad movie!
