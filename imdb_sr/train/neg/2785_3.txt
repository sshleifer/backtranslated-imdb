I know that some movies (I mean European films), which are very bad films, some "critics" consider a big movie, just because they are not American. I saw 8.1 IMDB for this movie and noticed the fact that this was selected for some great festivals. Do not let it fool you! Unless you are one of those people who love such films that disturb the mind, and later call it great art, skip! The film contains one hilarious scene for the other (a similar, Italian film came to my mind, the horrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these films is that they are not only boring, like some other weirdly praised films, but also almost like camping. I mean, let's face it, the acting is terrible (I mean, the soap opera), there is no surprise story (this has been done countless times before, linking several stories: SHORT CUTS, MAGNOLIA, PLAY WITH SIGHT, just much better), not one realistic figure in it (some real freaks on the road, notice hilarious zombies), and so on and so on. As if this is not enough, the movie is 135 min. (count!) for a long time, and in the end the director opens his sentimental room. After a film with such a harshly bad dialogue and scenes that showed the audience on the screen, so much incompetence is laughing, so ... This is an insult to the cinema, and it gets high marks just because it's in the "other" language, in this case Spanish . The odd world we live in ... 3/10
