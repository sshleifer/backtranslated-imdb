I do not know ... maybe it's because I'm a Brazilian, but all those things were too many. Too much love for music, too much party, too much contrast between the beautiful lives of the main characters (come on, not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director. Everything seems too fake to me: family, relationships, music, "happiness". He simply sells a little taste of false Latin American culture. I have to be honest: it has seduced me a little, but who would not have betrayed this false life made of beautiful music, sex and fun? I'm not so stupid: what is this world in which people do not suffer from diarrhea, deep sorrow and sexually transmitted diseases? I liked the scene with Caridad's parenting call and talk about contract with all the musicians and Spanish people.
