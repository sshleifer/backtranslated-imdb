I can not believe, IMDb really has a famous TV show! I have not seen this show for more than 20 years. I only remember two episodes and I can hardly remember it. I remember that Tony may not have been at the very beginning, because one of the episodes I remember is where everyone is trying to get Tony to join, but he rejects them, but usually at the end of the show he becomes a member of the Pover House, with all the fans. Another one I remember is the one in which Lolo pretends to be dead for some reason (along with funeral and grieving). I do not remember why he acted dead, or how the show ends. This is one of those indications that I was convinced that I had to dream because no one else had heard of him.
