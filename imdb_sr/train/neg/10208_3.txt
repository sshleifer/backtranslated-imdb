Something is frustrating when you watch a movie like 'Murder Number', because somewhere in that Hollywood formula is a good movie that tries to jump out. However, by the time the loans turn, there is no savings. The whole thing is overwhelmed by the "police side" of the story, in which detectives Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin run through an unpleasant sexual affair that becomes more and more trivial as the film lasts longer. Although Bullock is strong in his role, it's not enough to save an obscure script and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplin's talent is lost in an unforgettable role (much better last year in the underrated "Birthdai Girl"), as well as Chris Penn, who is a role film so reluctant to have a real jokes like him. In any case, the action is not a factor in this film at all. The two teenage killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only reasons to watch this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty well and play well. Too bad they were not in a much better movie. Barbet Schroeder is a safe place for such an experienced filmmaker here. Conclusion: It's worth hiring if you're a fan of the genre, but everyone else will live a fulfilling life without any sight, except perhaps on a networked television with favorable commercials.
