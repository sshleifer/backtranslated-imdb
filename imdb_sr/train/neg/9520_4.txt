[*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***] The reputation of this film was preceded by him, so I waited to watch in the mailbox at TCM. What a great disappointment. The actors are excellent, and the production values ​​are top-notch, but the characters are without depth, the action is lean, and it takes too long. For a film dealing with alcoholism, family divisions, unbelief, gambling and sexual repression, the film is unusually flat, prosaic, lifeless, and cliché. One example is the display of Frank Hirsch's unbelief: his rather demanding request for his wife to "go upstairs and relax a little", and then predictable a request for headache, leads - even more predictable - to his evening relationship with a secretary ("hey Nancy, tonight I have blues. We go on a ride "), all on a well-worn formula. We do not feel that these are the right people, but the cardboard cutouts that play in the puppet show. Also, the source of obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch has never been really explored or explained. Dave's fall in on-again / off-again Gwen is inexplicable in the light of her relentless inability to get rid of or pulling out of the pot. His later marriage of despair with the character Shirley Maclaine / Ginni, from the moment he was introduced to this viewer, was obviously condemned to ruin, and it was clear - the conventions of this type of soap opera - that only someone could have been killed. The moment a jealous lover began to run around with a pistol, I started to bet that Dave or Ginny would be killed. The whole thing was fake with the main 'P'. Saying this, Maclaine's performance and that of Dean Martin are a feature here. But on the whole, I think that the interest of the film is purely that it is a piece of Hollywood history.
