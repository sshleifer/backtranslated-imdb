The longer this film lasted - and it seemed to be bored continuing forever - it was more annoying, I became, quite honestly, how much time I've been wasting through this total stupidity. How, for God's sakes, can people make such films or get finances for such garbage? Do not be fooled by relatively high ratings on the IMDb because it just proves that you can be some people all the time. And in this picture, the main players have an obsession with weapons, so it's not difficult to elaborate how this movie will eventually develop. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre that the US society has such an obscene and fatal 'gun culture'. Anyway: The main actor shows the loser who escapes into the fantasy world that the cowboy is in the urban cave. He came across a family with two spoiled children, a teenager and a boy; he was worried by a strict solitary parent who could barely be worn. The cowboy is seduced by a teenager or vice versa, and a striking boy is apparently drawn into the madness of the loser. Cowboy is spending all the time in a state of unreality and depression. A complete loser who prefers to go to the beach then works for life, and then commits a break to his family because he is a lazy person to legally earn. <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who wants to watch or a sad losing loser in a fantasy world that has a desire for death, or to watch a poor family that is not really much better than white garbage? This film is pointless It only saves you from getting the lowest possible level thanks to some half of the listening music: 2/10.
