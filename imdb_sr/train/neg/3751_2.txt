I'm a big fan of David Linch. This film, however, was a rather disappointing experience. Except ambient music? What really determines the mood of the movie? he misses almost all the features I have come to link with Linch's work. Visual displays are boring, at a minimum, and the dialogue is unclear and monotonous to be of any interest. experienced director. I've seen many amateur movies with far superior performance on camera, set design, sound and writing. This film has almost all artistic qualities. I feel like I'm looking at one of Davids' home videos, produced over the weekend with some friends.
