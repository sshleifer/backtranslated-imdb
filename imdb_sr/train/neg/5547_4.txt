REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (2 outta 5 stars) No, this is not a long-lost ancestor of the classic George Romero zombie shift. This is a low budget pretender of 1936 that probably looked very cool for the audience of that time ... but these days it looks terribly routine. There is actually a fairly good scene at the beginning of a soldier who shot from a gun to the hordes of approaching zombie soldiers ... and a large plan of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them. The effect seems hopelessly fake these days, but in 1936, I'm sure the audience was breathing. The story refers to the search for a secret control of the mind ... allegedly to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a means for one character to capture the woman he loves. The film lasts only an hour, but it moves at the speed of the snail so it looks like a feature, believe me! There is really not much to be recommended ... you may have fun from the fake studio footage of the star that "pushes" through the "swamp". The ending is interesting ... so I would say that the movie is worth at least once. You will probably see it as an additional feature on the compilation of cheap "4 movies on 1 DVD" in Val-Mart for five dollars. Hey, it's worth the money ...
