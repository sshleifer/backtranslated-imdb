First, we agree that Lorenzo Lamas can never be considered a skilled actor, barely decent, sometimes just ordinary. However, in this piece @ *! ^ Named SnakeEater, the film industry sank completely. First, let's start with a complication. A Vietnamese veteran named Jack Kelli, called Soldier (who should be firm as a leather belt, and then some, which you can trust when pushing a palate of his nails through 2 children's feet and knocking them on the floor) gets information that his family was killed, and his sister was kidnapped. That's why he goes on an independent mission to save his sister. He had some potential, but he was still pretty thin to start. Now, acting. As an actor, I am able to say that it was some of the BEST performances in the history of art !!!!! Lamas is, well, he himself. Donors playing Clampets / Deliverance refuse to be bound and recorded for their so-called performances that insult actors everywhere, and especially talented ones who never get a big break! Finally, the action. The shooting is so-so with the BEST, and the fight for the fist is sad. I saw more real battles at the Renaissance Festival (and they were pretty fake)! Readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS PIECE CACE AT ALL COSTS! IF ANY FILM WAS IN THE EVENT, IT WOULD MAKE REJECTS! Because of the number of your brain cells, DO NOT watch this thing!
