A reasonable effort is a summary for this film. A good movie from the sixties, but without any sense of accomplishment. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance that was convincing enough, but not as good as she could, other actors were horrible! A terrific portrait. It was not so funny and it did not really reach its genres because it was not particularly funny and it was not dramatic. The only genre reached at a satisfactory level was romance. The target audience was not hit and the film sent confusing messages. A very basic story and a very basic story are not drawn out or performed in the best way, and people are left confused about why the movie is not so good and who is the target audience, etc. OK with moments of ability. 4.
