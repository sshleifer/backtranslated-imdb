Listening to the editorial comment confirmed what I suspected while watching a movie: this is a movie made by a man who wants to play on a movie. Action is a kind of thing that teenage teenagers throw when they go through that stage "I could write a book / screenplay / award-winning sitcom". It's an interesting idea buried in it (probably because it's a sequel to somebody else's film), but it's completely buried under a signed, poorly executed and ridiculously unreasonable scenario. The lines are terrible, and the performances are uninterested, but again I tend to blame the director. He does not seem to have consulted with the actors about what is needed, but he put the letters in his hands, pointed the camera in and told them to continue with it. Who knows, with a bit of training, these actors could have better forgiven (tell them what you like about musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent at Rov Iour Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man.) As it stands, the actors do not have any chemistry. A wonderful opportunity to use parallel classical sex and vampirism is missed when, in order to infect Bon Jovi's character with vampire blood from his sick man, he gets a transfusion. She should have eaten it. Keep in mind, they should have seemed unclearly interested in one another during the rest of the film. The only real moment of sexual tension, between the two female leaders, is that the directors themselves accept it by chance. Initially, he intended to use this silent array as an excuse for a more sensible display of the plot - so I guess the finished product could have been worse. But not too much. Honestly, as the movies go, this is poorly drawn, stupid and forgetful. Even when unfriendly movies are moving, it's not sexy enough or hard enough to be fun. It could have been fun and bloody little confusion, but the director went with more comedy, for the wrong reasons.
