... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT RETURN THIS FILM. If you want to watch a documentary on "hood life" then you are in the wrong place. If you are looking for a funny piece of film, this is a real winner! The acting is like a piece of paper. The best example for this is definitely a police investigator driving. I can say that he also did the voice for the operator 911, with the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear a conversation from a cardboard box, it would probably sound like this guy. Oh Ia, and "Zombies" have made their best snake impression that is at the level of their FANTASTIC acting as a whole (note sarcasm ... HOW WOULD NOT BE A WINNER FOR THE BEST MAKE UP) Kuiroz ...... no Do any kind of direction. I felt like watching an improvisational period (the period is more like LA in the 1990s). Direction is, however, one of the worst scenes I think is ever graceful. I did not hear such beautiful lines, such as the epic word that begins with the movie "F ** k!", Because Ice Grill is another "urban" thriller. This works, of course, in combination with hip-hop music from hip-hop! All three songs! All in all, what the hell did you expect from the movie titled "Hood of the Dead Dead"? I rented this film with the full intention of laughing at each of its scenes, and the boy also delivered MORE! I would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to mingle with a bunch of guys and laugh at a horror movie (yes, right ...) for the night. Surely safe experience!
