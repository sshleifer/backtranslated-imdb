After the success of the (terrible) replay of the films on Gilligan Island, several TV films were made in the 1980s in a reunion of actors from classic shows. Most of these films completely missed the boat until the re-capture of humor made the show so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is one of the most compelling because it is a comedy with Laurel and Hardy who was not in the original series. Ivonne De Carlo, a great comedian and important for the series, is completely futile - there is less time in this 90-minute movie than in a 30-minute episode. And since the roles "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this film are nothing but cameos, what was the point to make them younger and transformed? With very few rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although some of Munster's close relatives had a nice touch, I did not enjoy Sid Caesar as a crazy scientist who was crazy, mainly because he had too much and too little maniac (ironic that year, 1981, Caesar's old partner in comedy, Imogene Coca , is also inadequately thrown in the main part in the reunion of TV films RETURN BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another odd inexplicable battle at the beginning of the film is the Munster family presented as wax figures in the local horror museum. Why would they be there when they should be "typical" (if it's strange) the American family, not the famous monsters? This was the last Munsters project with the original acting in their roles, there was a terrible revival of the late 1980s series with a whole new acting and TV from the 1990s that included DeCarlo, Levis, Priest and Patrick in the cameo roles as family table.
