I can not think of any redemptive features of this utterly depicting Asimov's artistic direction. Forget the product placement catastrophe, the incredible performance of Villa Smith and the huge holes. This was not only funny but also painful to watch. Even the action was boring. The MTV mix inspired production values ​​and an extremely bad dialogue was probably directed at very young children. to a lesser extent Dark Citi (from the same director). This is really one of the top 100 list. It's really terrible.
