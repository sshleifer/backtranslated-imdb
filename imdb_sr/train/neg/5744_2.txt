This film was horrible, simply said. It was so bad that I registered with IMDb to alert you to the dangers. I am an expert in horror movie films. I watched "Zmaj peasants", "House of psychotic women", "Massacre in sleep" and many others. I know my shlock. And I know this film is bullshit. Three quarters of the film consists of frightened individuals moving from one side of the screen to another. When they do not start, they release non-sequential lines, deprived of emotions or motivation. When actors begin to be acceptable, the direction falls to parts. There were so many disturbing low-angle shots; I thought Leif Jonker had a tripod tripod. He used what I call "Leif Manever" several million times: that is, zooming out of an object of interest as an amateur. Obviously, the film crew could not get up early enough to burn the sunrise, so they recorded the sunset ... and played it vice versa. With the direction of this slumber, you are actually impressed with the final scene. The only thing you can understand is that the last five minutes were recorded before the first eighty five minutes. If you want a good (bad) bloody movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or the basic movie "Dead Alive." If you are a fan of shlocks and are looking for a challenge, show "Darkness". Quotation about the film - Vampire: Time for Dying!
