Another violent, angry fantasy by Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it's hard to say whether he seriously understands his dirty impulses, with anarchic intentions, or works completely in oblivion. It also seems to be a totally unknown fact that all the brilliant characters in the world (and there are some extraordinary ones) can not hide the neglect of the story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Beckon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to take moral moral bust. Bekon is usually a nice actor who occasionally shows his dark side ('River Vild') in an attempt to make up for his boyish appearance; With regard to the material, however, Bekon is not too faint to force. Other principles are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, none of whom is gifted enough to leave a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver a dishonest dialogue, embroiled themselves. The highlight is a study that prevails, and unbelief must be truly stopped.
