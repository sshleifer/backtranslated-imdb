The beginning of this film is great with huge sound and nice humor, but when the film changes into animation, it quickly loses its appeal. One of the reasons that was so, at least for me, was that the colors in most animations are too dim, with too little contrast. It does not look good, at least on VHS. Occasionally it appears and looks great, but not often. And the characters come in and go too fast. For example, I would like to see more than "Mobi Dick". However, when the film begins to pull, it re-assembles with the dragon's entrance and then the film ends up powerful. All in all, it's not enough to remember or able to compete with big animated films for the last ten years.
