De Niro Scorsese's worst co-operation in this terrible agony of violent, long-standing disorder. Scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with a horror that suddenly aroused by the loud buzzing of the phone and the tricks that seemed ridiculous and embarrassing to the masters. The actors are completely lost, and the southern accents are very boring and forced. Nick Noltie plays the vimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend everyone! De Niro's psychotic Bovden is nothing more than a typical film killer of the 90's. The scene with De Niroom and Levis at the beginning is very inconvenient and the pinnacle continues and continues and everyone should be more than tired of a psychological stalker who never dies. One of my most terrible film experiences. Rent the original is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
