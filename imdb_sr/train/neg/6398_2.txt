Richard Prior in the early 1980s ran down the street for a fire incident. In his ascent, he was joking about how he laughed. He seemed to have done something that involved the projects he chose. The toy is the weakest one you chose, except I suppose the other one is yours. Film in which a white man buys a son of a black man? A nice little political innocence before you was such a thing. I see that Richard becomes all sentimental and finally leaves me before the end. I wanted to see Priora equalize with this guy, instead of becoming the wrong child on the go! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore this and watch Priora with Gene Wilder or one of his' 70s. This is a waste of time for every movie viewer!
