I've never heard of this film until I played Robert Mitchum's retrospective at the National Film Theater in London. Almost for 60 years on the list of actors seemed delicious, with at least seven names - in addition to the top Mitchum - in the public domain; Charles McGrav, not far from The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and probably even better known as the daughter of designer Norman, Valter Brennan, who did not need an introduction, Frank Failen, sadist male sister of The Lost Veekend and much more beautiful little town house in It's A Vonderful Life, Robert Preston ten years away from Harold Hill in The Music Man, and Tom Tully and Phillis Thakter make up the numbers. Wow, most of them spent their time. In vain, I asked for any "signing" scenes since it was Robert Vise on the megaphone. By then he had recorded about half a dozen movies and had to find a style. The story is our old friend, the war span, and Mitchum must have thought that it was barely cut above the Hopalong Cassidy Oater on which he had cut his teeth. No new plants - if you do not count the incredible scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thakter to get information about her father's plans to move her cattle. This is perfectly true, but how did Mitchum know? We have seen or heard nothing that would indicate how he discovered it. Basically there is not much to say.
