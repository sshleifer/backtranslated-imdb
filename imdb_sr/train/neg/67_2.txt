From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and difficult that the outcome is completely predictable. Every good textbook on writing scenarios will advise the layering of characters, matching character arches and structure with three acts. In this movie, you will not find any of this. The police are a criminal and accordingly they are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. It seems that the creators of this film never come to mind that the police could be honorable citizens who see the approach to the police as a good way to contribute to the well-being of society. his or her mind about whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or merciless villain. The film begins with the arrest of theft of the horse, but we have no idea of ​​his guilt or innocence. We see him walking through the prison gate, but he only knows that he has been in there for three years when we hear it much later in a dialogue. This film contains many of Ned's videos that look at the camera with a serious expression. I found the movie as a real job to watch. It's a direction for modern films, and this one refuses me to watch.
