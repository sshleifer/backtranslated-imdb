Wow, the worst thing in this episode was the price of a house 40 years ago. I'll foretell that I'm not a fan of tale episodes. If the story / actors / etc. their salt is worth, they should be able to convey the majority of the story without reading it, they reminded me of people who can not think of a cuff, but rely on teleprompters. Psychobabble was boring and boring, but some enjoy such things, it's just not my O. tea. They could keep the story, but at least they made it more convincing and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or perhaps a news reporter, or the like. The swaying of small things like Peugeot in a house, which has a unique semi-circle, nevertheless seems to have parked its car on the tree under which it stood, because nowhere is it seen on the road or on the property. Disorderly editing, while pulling on a wheel drive approach (for what seems to be the hundredth way) are exactly who these two guys are seeing at 24m30s walking towards the car while dragging to the aisles near the abandoned house? Prison close plans were also exaggerated, like some Jr. a high drama that first discovered the zoom function on its camera. I could continue to break apart, but that could become almost as boring as this episode. It was constantly retreating and it seemed that the true purpose was to use absolutely all the footage taken by Elaine riding a convertible at Nevport. I fully expected that I would see the Chrisler logo and a nice jingle game, while our voice told us about the 8-way track, the automatic top, etc. The only good thing I have to say about him is that it just ends, suddenly. No free end is bound, nothing is explained or interrupted. It's not that many noticed, I suppose the majority has already changed the channel or that it has staggered to the end.
