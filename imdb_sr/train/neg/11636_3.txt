I will not waste my time writing essays and wasting my time. I want to say, however, that all those who are persistent about this film are even made totally absurd. Johnnimacbest, you can not play this card, and I mean the nationalistic patriotic card, that people do not watch this movie. this is a film that expresses my free will in this country (oh, that I played this card) although the director is German and deserves a slap on his hand every time he comes to the camera, but the world is full of controversy, and that's the same thing you've heard Earlier, like GTA controversy. It's comedy, laughter and horror, we do not disagree all together, its dark humor and obviously you do not have the heart to take it, the past has passed, that people remember those who are lost, but it's time to move on, 7 !!! many years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. Besides, I'm crazy and who needs souls?
