This film has a very difficult assumption, even according to the standards of this genre. We are asked to accept not only that the record that is played back can lead a dead man to life, but that the record also contains hidden messages specifically for a child, when the singer had nothing to do with the boy when he was alive, neither in which way they would not know on whose hands the minutes will end. In any case, the movie is fun for some time, but in the end, madness and nonsense rule. If they were really trying to create a new Freddy's icon of horror, they were far away: the villain has no personality, motivation and variety. (* 1/2)
