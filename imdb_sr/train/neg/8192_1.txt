Well, I have to say, this film was so bad that I would not have to look at it because of work. And the worst is that I wanted to see him so bad that I was driving around the city, I paid a parking fee of $ 10 twice, because newspaper ads were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always works - the only time I saw him playing someone else was in that movie with John Travolt. In any case, the shop has the potential - it sounded great in the review, but it was filled with totally ridiculous, predictable, weak points of reversal. And I hoped this would be a Christmas movie where Christmas does not have to be saved, and that Santa does not need a replacement, but not. The only cool thing was riding sleepers, and a little kid I was sure this movie would be great for little children, but for adults it's so poor that it's a tiny job.
