I watched a movie, and I was horrified when I said that the film could not communicate with me as an audience. The language would embarrass the street moccasins. Complication; The father, who did not force any son to marry, seems incredible. The idea that a grandmother asks of her big kid to fight the enemy would only attract the attention of the impaired people. laugh, and laugh at my stupidity to lose 3 hours to make sure that the film is not worth the first look.
