Unfortunately, realism is boring. This film, I thought it would never end, it would be better if all the characters were nuked in the first five minutes. Where's Blade when you need it? Although sad as COMBAT SHOCK, REKUIEM FOR DREAM and as a nightmare like BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES is not nearly as entertaining as any of the aforementioned films. While unreasonable cannibalism can make the heartbeat of Jeffrey Dalglish run faster, it was not as interesting as RAVENOUS. Indeed, I found it interesting as a late night ad, and exciting as a dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you may be able to withstand this, otherwise, for no one. I was really surprised that this was not made by people in Brain Damage, as it was the quality of dead creatures.
