Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to judge judges lower than 1. What is the damage. This horrible movie is so bad that I actually turned the damn thing before the end. The script had some great moments, but directing, editing, acting, sound quality, and especially timing on the delivery line was so disgusting that the judges became completely unbearable. day in the style of comics west, but in reality there was nothing like that. What looks most like a dog on the bottom of a shoe. You can try to pretend that it's okay, but he just keeps on smelling. Why video stores think it's ok to carry this kind of crap with constant voids in the sound and worse than the classic drama acting is beyond me. We rent movies to see something better than what's on TV. But the judges are worse than the most original original SciFi channel. I intend to refund the money from Hollivood Video.
