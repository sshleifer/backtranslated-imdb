With Bo Derek's film, the audience gets exactly what they expect. Slim plot and a few shots of Mrs. Derek without clothes. 'Spirits can not do it' is exactly that. The first fifteen minutes is an ordinary TV drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Kuinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with many years of experience in many different roles, but it seems that even the famous actor sometimes only works for money. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes. The film is a total waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lavrens from Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see naked women or bad acting, rent some porn movie.
