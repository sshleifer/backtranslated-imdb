From the creator Shrek ... Okay, that attracted my attention. Well and the creators of Shrek were made by Madagascar. The Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. Now, Flushed Avai is half as good as Madagascar. This means that Flushed Avai is not good. Animation and all special effects were exceptionally good, but the film was not. The story of this film was intended only for children. It's really not possible for adults to really love this movie. But there was a lot of jokes for adults. I bet kids understand jokes. In spite of that, like this movie. I am completely disappointed. 4/10
