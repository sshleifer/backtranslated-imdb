This was a horrible movie. There was no story. In the end, when they could not explain blood and blood (the only good part) ... they threw out a few aliens! I hate when directors (or anything else) run out of ideas and then blame aliens! Watch this movie if you like. But do not say I did not warn you. Two things: How did Winnie say "welcome" when he had no tongue? It's a shame that Mr. Jones did not play a bigger role. The other thing that eavesdropped on me, why we showed that Vinnie Jones's statues, and he cut them off and put them in a blue liquid, then they have no further role. Why not? I do not like to show anything to me and it has nothing to do with the story. In short. Bad do it. I would not waste my time - I would like to see mirrors.
