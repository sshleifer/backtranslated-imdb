Movie of the underground comedy, probably the worst ship wreck I've ever seen. Fortunately, I did not pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly agreed to look at him again at the place where it was so terrible, but I had to prove to me how terrible it was. I love the comedy in color. I thought it would at least have a lot of fun. No, instead of acting so scary, "jokes" were extremely naughty, and the plot was not where to find it. Maybe it should not have been complicated, so I can not hold it against this movie. It's pretty sad when the funniest thing in a comedy is the old woman who hit her head with a bat ... Batman ... A man dressed in a baseball uniform that holds a stick. Hilarious. Simply genius. I had the feeling that I watched this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically to their friends about it. Maybe it was a lot of jokes that we did not understand. Or it may be the worst piece of garbage ever made and should be locked in a vault and thrown into the Arctic Ocean. P.S. Do not buy this movie!
