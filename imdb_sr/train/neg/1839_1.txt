I could not wait to put this movie in my DVD payer when I rented it. Then after I started it, I could not wait to get it out of my DVD player. I actually watched the whole movie. My wife and I waited and waited for something funny to happen, but nothing funny never works. The box read as if it's really funny. The premise of the film sounds good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is ridiculous. How can this movie be missed? Well ... that's missing! This is a meaningless "comedy" I've ever seen. No one I talked with was ridiculous. It's just a really chromatic movie. Trust me. Avoide it .... AVOIDE IT !!
