If you like an occasional nudity with junior high school, then do not look for further. Starting from half way, the beautiful and erotic Arielle Dombasle begins to be removed at every opportunity. It's the only thing that made this movie worth watching. The story is silly and meaningless, humor is rugged, and character development essentially does not exist.
