Until this moment, Gentle Rain was the movie I found the worst in history. It was replaced by this "blocker" from Asia. He has one "star" and that's John Rhis Davies. He's out of shape to be a crazy, magical flying baddie that's thrown in here. The rest of these people could not get out of high school. No cliches were missed in the dialogue, and special effects were reported as often as possible. It's easy to see that someone in Asia had some money and that he was supposed to create a vehicle for some actors. They wanted to throw money. Or maybe it was a director or a writer. My guess is that every career with this film in her credentials does a great service and do not watch this movie. A hundred of gratitude could not have consumed this party. One funny scene was unintentional. The king's brother appeared on the scene. King? A handsome, older, short Asian actor. (Poor actor.) Brother? Sixth European. (Also a bad actor.) No excuses were made for this. They just expected not to notice that Brother Jet Li of this poor man was the winner of Pierce Brosnan in the cheap "Injun" wig that came out of the old Western film from the 1940s.
