I went to watch this movie at our theater in college thirty years ago, because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Famili Plot. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson), it's still the deepest movie I've ever seen. It simply continued without a visible point, and then it ended. The lights were on, and I watched everyone get confused. Has the projection missed a reel? I never had the need to find out. I remember everything about the movie that it was a drama about some boring basketball players and their coach. The funniest part of the movie was watching a completely mysterious audience. Luckily, this was just an exception for Jack, Bruce, and Karen Black.
