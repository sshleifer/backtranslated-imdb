Forward, but is it really important? Have you ever read a review of movies that consists solely of questions? Is that possible? Why is ancient civilization buried artifacts around the world? Why is this question never answered? Why is opening text unconnected? Why would a nun (she surely looked great!) Shed 20 orphans crazy? Was it always a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why is one of the mines of gold mine coming out in the front yard of the orphanage? Why did the character Tara Reid suddenly appear in Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my question?) Why would even the near-healers open an obviously valuable solid gold box with a little one? Why would modern computers continue to display green objects before the Tron-era, along with small "bleeps"? And do all explosive timers have digital displays? Why nothing in this movie makes sense?
