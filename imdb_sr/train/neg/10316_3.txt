To be honest at the time I first heard about this show, although it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes on it, but that's the opposite. I realized that a play that can help people realize that if a Muslim uses such a word in real life, that does not mean that it is a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype, seeing that ordinary people will realize that everyone, although having bad Muslims, does not mean that we are all bad, we are just trying to live one day, as it was difficult for Amira to enter in the airplane and how he used words like "Blov up" or Iaser saying that we will take away the competition, and people misunderstood it. Since I am a Muslim, I know that such things usually do not happen, but they do it, and many people think bad about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, its defective things are not like that. people will see that we are treated badly by watching this show and may be forced to think about how it does. I'm glad that such a show came out. Much shows that the Muslims Piotr as terrorists, many people find them funny for my opioid, it's okay to do it now, and then because there is a lot of ridicule from who we say we can not do it unfairly, but that's it often works and really gives people Muslin a bad name.
