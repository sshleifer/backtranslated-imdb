It was nice to see all the famous characters again, but the story bothered me. We loved Ariel in the first movie - so why is the other focused on her daughter? The new characters were boring and I did not like the plot. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not return as Eric's voice! Disney, please stop processing classic movies with these bad imitations.
