If you want to see an intelligent, philosophical discussion of human opportunities and potentials, watch "Vaking Life", which is brilliant. "What we know" is everywhere in its focus, poorly oriented, poorly written, poorly acting, completely deprived of any artistic direction and completely boring. It was not the least challenging or fun. The inclusion of this crazy freak "Ramtha" in this movie is a sufficient reason to avoid it. Is not it strange how the film's authors look at the fact that this woman adores some 2,000 years old Atlantic God or something? What kind of shell is an old fish, and how much was the total loss of my time and money this movie was. People who are responsible for this film should not be allowed to film the film again.
