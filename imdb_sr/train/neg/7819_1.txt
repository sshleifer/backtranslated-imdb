... This would be the worst movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, ok maybe tied to Boogeiman. Terrible, really terrible. I had low expectations and I could not meet them! I honestly can not imagine one good thing. so here are the worst spots ... 1. ACTIVITY 2. PLOT 3. CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. PLOT 5. DIALOG and finally .... 6. PLOT There are so many unanswered questions, whether they made a movie lasting 2: 32h, and then realized that Lek Luthor and Superman were not on the scene and were forced to meet for 3 or did they think that nobody would notice that the main hero and the criminal had less time to screen than Superman's son and the one who killed him? Is half of the budget spent on convincing Kevin Spaceia to do it? When Superman went to the hospital, why doctors do not ask him: "What F *** do you want to do?! He is F *** ing a foreigner! We do not know about his anatomy!"? What happened in 5 years when Superman was absent for technology to improve for 28 years? Where are the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie? And finally, why? Just, why? CTV, for those of you who are wondering how Superman could lift the entire continent of the crypto, I think I understood ... <br /> ... of the supermenas does not affect to the kryptonite until he sees something green in the walls, obviously everything is in his head. that's why the thing is on the continent only that suppresses the fear of a shining green rock ... Anyway, either the writers are half-inflated crazies who did not think it's a pretty obvious mistake.
