Incredibly! This film gets 7 from 0 to 10. This must be one of the worst movies I've seen for years. Not only was the performance incredibly bad, but the story (if you could call it) was equally bad. Of course, everyone knows what will happen in the first 5 minutes. Which is not a bad thing if you can capture the audience while driving up to that moment. However, this is not the case. There is no action, no tension, no spark between the two main players. Unfortunately, it was the loss of my time and certainly the loss of my money. And 2 from just to try
