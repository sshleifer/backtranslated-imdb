"I'm a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" what it means? This plot could not have been worse because the boy, who feared everything, is very brave at the very end of the film because he went to the library. The only purpose of this loss of celluloid was to encourage American kids to read, when a cheaper and more efficient way for it could be a series of ads! Even the talents of Macaulia Culkin (as a kid), Christopher Lloyd (as predictable as he's a "Page Master" librarian), can save this absurd film from a tedious complication. Even the voices of Vhoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stevart, (even) Leonard Nimoi, or Hollivood God of Voices, Frank Velker as cartoon characters never keeps them. I can only describe this as a ninety-year-old equivalent to even the terrible adaptation of water babies from 1978, because gentle animation worsens the film, and does not improve the boring Plan!
