What, for the name of the world, has become our dear Ramu? Is this the same man who made Sarkar, Sati and Comapny? I refuse to believe. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he obviously jumped from the high cliff he raised to give the industry some of the greatest pieces of time. This film is made to fall like a brick. I tried to leave the theater, but I had to sit, because I could not get my car out of the parking lot before the others left. After all, nothing would force me to sit outside the interval. This film is not even close to Sholaia. Not even a kilometer is approaching. I believe Rama certainly loves Kuma more than Sholai, since Sarkar was a classical job. I read Ramou's interview a few days earlier, in which the examiner said that Rama does not sleep longer than 4 hours a day, which is also not in progress. Now I totally agree with this, because his lack of sleep probably took his mark on the film. In the show there is no strength. Amitabh Bachchan does not seem even scary. He looked scary in several posters and wallpaper I had seen before. Ramus' favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she did not have much dialogue (in fact, none, if I clearly remember). She opened her mouth in this film and found a place in history. It seems that the new guy playing Jai's role has that stupid look, but he did not manage Jai's role at all. I can not continue ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big to be able to manage right now. that he is still there. Bottom line: a horrible movie. Media and critics will be preparing Ramu's goose. And just to remind all readers once again, I'm one of the biggest ram fans, and I can not even spare it for this act.
