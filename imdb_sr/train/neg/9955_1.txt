The whole thing is very nice to watch. European recording location was a good idea. The main actors are attractive. The result is servicable. OR ANY WILL BE PROVIDED! And an unplanned thing has developed! And from there it was all downhill. Pacino is mourning, and Keller keeps talking about how boring she is ... well, dear, you're not alone. When you do the imitation of Mae West, you may have to hide your face, it's painful to watch. I can not imagine how either the actor or director Sidney Pollack included in this, or better the Question, why ended so stinkly so badly? Since death is represented in almost every scene, in one way or another, you may need to have low enjoyment here. Maybe she should feel empty and cold like death. But I still can not recommend it.
