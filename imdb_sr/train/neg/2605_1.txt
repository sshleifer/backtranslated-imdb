Although I have recently placed this on my list of the 10 worst films, I must say that this is probably no worse than Burt Reinolds in "The Maddening" or some of the "Look Vho's Talking" sequels. Still, it's pretty sad, even with sexy Drew Barriorem playing some of Holly Golightly's horror movie, moving from New York to Los Angeles, but discovering that the pursuit is killer is similar. The poor Salli Kellerman, a strange actress of great praise in the 1970s, has been reduced to a hopeless role here, and Barrimore's leading man George Nevbern is the worst type of actor, who always stops laughing after each line. The picture is full, but the bloody show of the shower can be praised by visualization, and the identity of the psycho (although it is only from the episode "Scooby Doo") is interesting. But for the finals ... be real! Who had to clear that mess? * from the ****
