OK, this movie was really "unique". Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the film, although she was said to have had a problem with the chick during the film. but she said she can not remember much. Well, that excuse, but what is it for everyone else? I can not imagine that everyone had a problem with cocaine. Whatever it was that was not so bad, I think the plot was fine and it had quite fun moments. although the part in which this man put that thing in the head was a bit too violent for my taste. Oh well I guess I was disappointed because Carrie Fisher was so terrible and this movie did not do anything for her.
