I suppose I know the answer to that question. For the money! We were bombarded with the Cat In The Hat commercial and the merchandise that we almost believe it must be something good in this movie. I admit, I thought that the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well, I should have gone with my instincts. It was a complete piece of Hollywood garbage. To prove once again that an average person can be programmed to believe in everything they say is good, it must be good. In addition to the insulting fact that the film is only 80 minutes long, it is obvious that he started with a hidden moth. It's full of unsuccessful attempts at pointless humor and terrible pastel landscapes. Scramble through the universe without a destination or direction. This then increases even more, ............................ yes, I will say it, BAD ACTING! I could not help but feel like looking at the "Coffee Talk" at the SNL every time Mike Miers opened his mouth. Did the Cat intend to be a Jewish middle-aged woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were no prize, but Mr. Miers should be gone beneath the stone until he was ready for another film about Austin Povers. F-, no star, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save money!
