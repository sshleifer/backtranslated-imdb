This film was one of the biggest films ever made ..., he had everything to make the movie great. Incredible acting, great special effects ... oh wait, I have to think of a good movie. Well, this was not one of them, it was just exhausted. What I want to know is what the bonehead would think this film was 10. When I voted there was 206 there, God knows what's going on in their head. As for any other vote, 8 or 9 was even too high, but 10? Come on, what did this movie do sooooo good to give him 10? I know that these are the same ones that thinks Jean Claude Van Damme is a great drama actor.
