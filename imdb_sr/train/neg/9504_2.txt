The only reason I was watching this movie was because I recently read less than the perfect, but interesting, fictionalized presentation by Robert Hough about the life of the coach of the great cat Mabel Stark. Beati appears as a character in a book, in a less flattering light. I have not understood yet until I later look at the IMD movie that was originally serial. Whoever edited the original 233 minutes to the 68-minute version available on DVD, did a great job. The shortened version plays the same as any B movie of that period despite many 'ghosts-what?' moments. For example, do we really expect to believe that our hero has dug up this tiger trap at 20 feet in the morning, and that he would not even be dirty? Looking at the headings of the chapter, I see that the number five is called "Gorilla Warfare," and the number eleven is called "Gorilla". There was no gorilla in the movie at all. I suppose there were some cuts there. Historically interesting.
