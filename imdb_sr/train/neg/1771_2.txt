This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen without a doubt. The only thing that is interesting in this movie is the humorous performances of some of the great directors of the genre and the King himself. The film has a great premise, but it falls apart for about 15 minutes. I loved Madchen Amick in the film and I think that she could have a very good career in the film.
