I think Elisabeth Rohm, although he is trying, is not very good. I suppose that because of the budget she could be the only one she could get for that price. Mostly I watched him for the performance of Miron Natvic, whose work I know well. He was most likely and undoubtedly the most interesting to watch. When it was not on the screen, the thing died. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me the dam, but be sure that in real life he is a kind, witty man. He even said that he played the role of playing a muck. I will watch everything with him in it, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. It was just as exciting as it was on Law and Order. Maybe a very nice person, but not an actress.
