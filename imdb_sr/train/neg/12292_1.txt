We brought this film as a joke for a friend, and that could have been our worst joke. The film is barely visible, and the acting is terrible. The worst boy ever used and Hasslehoff gives unusual performance. The plot is shameful and in the places where we were so boring we wondered what the hell is going on. He tries to be terrible in places, but he's just funny. Just terrible
