So, the wife and I ended up in spite of several threats from us both to exclude him. It was mostly the worst part of this film, there was only a little excitement. The acting was terrible, to the extent that we were laughing several times in several bad scenes (eg Church lady). The dead sister used paranormal means to contact her living twin, although she rather sent useful information that she focused on trying to scare her, which looked like a Ring. Instead, turn on the police - which I'm sure the ear plugs it has found to have DNA all over the body - it instead makes a terrible plan to "get" the man who concealed the accidental death of her sister. I call it a terrible plan, because in the end it allows him to kill her, which film then fades. Bad dialogue, bad behavior, bad ending.
