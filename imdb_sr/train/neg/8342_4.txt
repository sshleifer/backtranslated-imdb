Saving: 4 out of 10. Dan Groundhog meets the horror film of the Christian coalition. Maybe it's not that bad. But it's close. Claire (played by Alicia Silverstoneskue Lauren Currie Levis) has been persecuted and maybe killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, who is pretty dangerous and brutal). I say maybe because it wakes up and it was all a dream? Is that it? (Cue music) The main problem with the movie is that these fifteen minute complications (Almost good for the first time) are repeated over and over again. And as Claire wakes up every time and every scene is obviously a dream or an alternative reality, I just stopped worrying about what happened to Claire and I started wondering what a bumpy turn would be in the end. I was a cheerleading for the session (which would sincerely make more sense), but instead had one of those who had an obvious half of the surprise (Think the Village or below) Iup film collapses faster than the director Donnie Darka. All the big turns ended in horror films The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion Snatchers, Happy Birthday I worked for because the audience did not expect an explanation of the left field. (Even when the canoe was finished in the original Friday 13th it was worth a jerk) On the other hand, the rescue spins and ends with each change of scene. Other puzzling mistakes are the piano soundtrack with a note (although the real songs were decent) obvious time (Claire for cooking, Clare's mother's subplots), the way Claire says "hello was anyone there" every time she thinks there's a series of killers around. Also, some of the roles in middle acting (especially Claire's mother played by Maureen Olander, which resembles Mary Kaye's zombies) is playing a low budget for the first time. I'm too smart for half and not enough smart enough to rescue your interest only to see how it will fix this mess. The problem is they do not really do it.
