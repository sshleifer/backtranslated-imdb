Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a motion picture. Why did I watch such films when I was younger? Who knows? Perhaps I was the one who punished me by watching a horrible movie after another. I do not know, I suppose I needed a hobby during my teens. The teenager (Rainbov Harvest) is looking for comfort in the old mirror. Soon he learns about the terrible power this antique mirror has and uses it to get out against those who hurt her. Films like these, the energy provider has a nasty side effect. She changes from inside and outside if she likes it or not. The disorder of the film that is for some reason returned to d.v.d. a few years ago. I do not know why. They should have left him on the shelf and collect dust. People love this movie for some reason. If you want, I want to know why. Until then I do not like this movie and I have no reason to look at it again. It is not recommended in general.
