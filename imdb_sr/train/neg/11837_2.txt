Can somebody do good CGI movies except Pikar? I mean, the animation seemed to be outdated according to the standards of 2006 and even 1995 in the Toi Story standards. Or they may have spent all of their budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever their story, the story was really bad. Hugh Jackman is somehow a rat - a rats that is washed in toilets. Yes, I know, it looks stereotypical. But then the sewage mimicked the roads of London - to some extent. Throw away the promise of gems (???) and evil (??) frogs and get a pathetic attempt to entertain. I would like to say that something entertains me. Maybe a movie clone? Or maybe happy-forever after the rats. But nothing. He had talent, but he exploded. D-
