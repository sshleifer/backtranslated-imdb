There is no doubt that Frank Sinatra was a talented actor, as well as a talented singer. After all, very few actors today can get the scene in just one move, and that's pretty much the Sinatrin modus operandi on the set. movies really started to fill. Detective series Tony Rome was no less than an attempt to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series that came out at the same time. Maybe even James Bond's competition, but Frank did not succeed in these years. His personal life in ruins, his music disappears ... Sinatra seemed more like a return to the 1950s. The last great Sinatra movie from that period was probably Von Rian's Express in 1965.
