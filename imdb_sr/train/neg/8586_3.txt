What a disappointment ... the best of the previous performances, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of pieces, poorly realized and connected amateur. There are many continuing mistakes that are arguing strongly with original movies, and the appearance of Darth Vader was so horrendous that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema, now instead of a candy that will make fun of the years. I will not complain about the diamond dialogue, because this is Star Vars ... the original three films had a style, a cult feeling and a crackling story, and a strange dialogue added charm. Prequalifications were shallow attempts to get more money, and this lack of love is shown in peaks. Totally disappointing.
