Was there any positive on this movie? Critics who did not know anything about video games could find errors in the game. No damage was done with clearly visible damage initially as a primary case. And I might have missed something, but I was not Super Mario Bros. So if that's the case, and I did not miss anything ... how did the figure of Fred Savage, and even a girl, already know so much about the game? We are talking about things that some people do not know with their second or third paycheck. Apart from factual and gaming mistakes, there is generally poor quality of the film itself. Nothing here is truly unforgettable. The kid was not so good at playing video games on the footage they showed. Many children I knew at that time were much more experienced. Above all, acting and story are just central in their strongest points. The characters are mild and completely uninteresting, "The Wizard" (the youngest child) is a very quiet, completely dry baby clich√© of a little kid who almost never talks about the trauma. It's not that this is unrealistic, but the fact that he had to be thrown into a movie so he could even start making a complication that would go over 30 minutes. Honestly, the only value that is here is the nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie, you liked it whether it was good or not. It's about children who played video games, and at the time you saw it, you probably had an obsession with the NES. But if you do not like the kid, there is simply nothing to keep you in the interest, and very few will stop you from turning it off. No, sir, I did not like it.
