Dan Durie, the perfectly decent actor of B-film, who made many shades in his 40s, can not do much with this: a young man is accused of killing an unhappily married singer; When sentenced to death, his wife decides to solve her case alone with the help of a dead woman's husband. After a glittering shot, the film fits quickly in the B-film formula. It certainly looks good, but the finish is colorfully worked and the actors (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Cravford) are just a little stiff. Based on the Cornell Voolrich novel, and passed for one viewing. ** from ****
