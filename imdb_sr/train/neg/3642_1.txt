Unfortunately, the film is more concerned with making lively social comments about a real event, but there are no gaps to legitimately document what happened. The constant rhetoric about how violent video games are not to blame (I get the impression that Ben Coccio is a passionate player), or how media and music are completely devoid of influence is an obvious message (even we have a funny scene of two boys) burn ALL their CDs, about subtlety!), but the film just gets out of it because it's 'fiction'. Good attempt. Yes, it's a great idea to get rid of the media of influence, but how do we know the children who planned and carried out school shooting under the influence of the media? or video games? We do not do this and we will not watch this movie, because these children are smart enough to completely deny the media, yet again stupid enough to burn the Nazi symbol on earth? haha I kinda do not think so. The film hits you with your head by showing your family normality, and it's almost a bad thing to think that there was no serious disability in the family The dynamics of children who really went out and shot their schoolmates. Why are they all so worried that the killers look "normal" when they are so obvious? A totally false and false picture.
