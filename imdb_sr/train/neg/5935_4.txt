The most sad thing about this "day" is that almost all singers (including otherwise incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have missed the whole point in which Cohen's intensity lies: delivering his lines in a nearly useless balance, Cohen transmits his full extent poetry, its irony, its versatile humanity, laughter and tears in one. To see some of these singing upstarts, you made tremendous suffering, they started their pathetic skueals in a pathetic effort to scream "I'm a singer!", It's real pain. It's the same feeling that many of you probably listened to some horrible opera versions of simple songs such as Lenon's "Imagine." Nothing, simply comes close to the simplicity and directness of the original If there is a form of art that does not need decorating, it's Cohen's art. On the street, it looks like an unpleasant makeup sex for sale. In this Cohen's respect, I found myself suffering and suffering through sorrowful praise and terrible reinterpretations, which completely lacked the original irony of the master, and, if it was said, several of those singers sounded as if they were recruited at an asylum talent fair.This is Cohen who gives them the honor of allowing them to sing his material, really, and not the other way around: maybe they were friends, or his daughter, he could become very gentle and kind . It's a shame that she did not stay in the family. Fortunately, only at the very end, Cohen carried out his magnificent "Tower of the Songs", but even that flower was ruined by a completely unconnected background. U2, they all carry an expression that bores children when they visit their poor grandfather in the nursing home. Sorrowful performance, really, and sadder if you really love Cohen like me.
