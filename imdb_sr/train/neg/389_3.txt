I bet you Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore have agreed in advance how long the episode will be ready to appear. Is not it too excessive that Gene moves to the women's team and then throws on his sword? And Big Pussi? What was it? "Look at me, I'm a rat!" double shit? All this clich√© mafia joke - COME ON! The big names that voted have already received the money for their charity and get a customized exit. Hmm ... This is not a reality, it's a dramatic drama! The second issue of Mark Burnett, Survivor, also asked questions for me when Johnny Fairplai told her his departure when he apparently had a short time before his baby was born.
