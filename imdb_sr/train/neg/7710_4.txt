"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" consists mainly of wandering, poorly composed images in search of a movie. The action does not make sense, and different characters enter and exit the picture without any explanation. Looking at this stupid pad, you get the feeling that many other comments have shot so accurately: it's easy to make a cheap, inexpensive movie and then use the "parody" angle as an excuse for its cheap and low quality One scene, the swimmers are scared of the tomatoes that float in the vicinity of them, how far can they "stop the unbelief" - even in parody?). The title song is great. (* 1/2)
