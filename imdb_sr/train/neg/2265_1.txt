I like to watch Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this mischief for a soft porn movie is unnecessarily insulting, lacks any similar wit and serves as a self-promotion tool for Springer. Although it lasts for a quick 90 minutes, the film gets wiped out terribly, and I needed to have a good sense to get out. Simply awful.
