Okay, though as an Orthodox woman who lives in Boro Park, I will be a bit biased towards this movie. However, it seemed that the only purpose of Boaz Iakin in making this film was Orthodoxy. With our wigs, modest clothes and separate seats, we are already a fairly easy target. Iakin never crossed the surface. The result is a film with more holes of Swiss cheese: 1. Iosi says Sonia loves him more than G-d or their parents. Then deliberately defies his father's order not to swim due to poor health. 2. Sonia turns around her son. Why would the Hasidic woman in Monseio have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe she never attended before. Let's face it, even the Reforming Jews today are holding the milestone of the ceremony. 3. Did Mendel sleep during his classes? He had to satisfy his wife's passion in bed and refrain from kissing on the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to be married for more than a year, and he just noticed that they were not meant for each other? A little agreed marriage does not mean that the girl must take the first boyfriend with whom her parents have placed it. Neither will it be rejected by the community if the marriage does not pass. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business so badly, she did not have to go through her humorous chicken. There are Orthodox doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Instead of taking control of her life, she leaned forward and waited for things to happen, then complained that she did not like the outcome. This is not contrary to the environment; It's disturbing stereotypes. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved.
