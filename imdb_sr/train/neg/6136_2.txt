Buck's role as Kahn leads Bob Barker (from Price to the right) to lead the country in the same way that he runs his show. But in this party there's a lot more to giggle. Kurt Thomas, as the "hero" of the baby, shows some significant acrobatic skills, but not an actor's talent. There are a few nasty moments (mostly in the village of Crazies) and some mildly impressive sequences of martial arts. But each "Ninja" movie will give you much more fun and you will not feel guilty for laughing.
