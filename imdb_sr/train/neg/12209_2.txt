Many years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother had a policy that the person choosing a movie should pay. And while I would never pay to see the shit they took me, I could not resist a free trip to the cinema! So I came to see shit as the second Conan movie and NEVER REPEAT again! Now, in spite of being a poor film, in places that are fun to watch - in the dead brain. And, technical, cascades and cameras are good, so this raises my rating up to 2! Why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo film, this one has practically no complication, Rambo himself says only about 3 words (except grunts and iells), there is an unnecessary and completely unimportant and undeveloped "romance" and the movie is a div Special Effect. And what STUPIFIING AVFUL special effects. While bullets and rockets fired at Rambo, none had any effect on him, and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots to his mark! And while bad guys use AK-47, helicopters and rockets, Rambo in some scenes had bow and arrows with what looks like a nuclear nap! A scene in which a bad guy shoots at him while slowly and calmly starts one of these exploding arrows is especially made for stupid spectators! It was beautifully parodied at UHF with Veird Al. In addition, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUKS also makes a funny parody of this genre - not just this stupid scene. Overall, the film is so stupid and meaningless that it's almost like a parody!
