Me and a group of friends are renting terrible videos so we can laugh at them, believe me, it has led to horrible spending of money and some great laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the best horror films we've hired. The action is exaggerated, it takes you all to the woods and never returns. The worst part of the movie seems to be that you have visited a local butcher shop, in addition to a little dirtier and bloody meat in the game. And if someone has ever been scared of this movie at any time, they should keep Cartoon Netvork for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are quite hot, one better than the other, and you see them both naked in the film. Another good aspect is that this movie is sometimes so bad that you will laugh until you cry. I do not like watching horrible acting or renting these terrible videos, I do not think it's fun, but seeing the amount of effort that those people have put into it and still coming out so bad, funny and worthwhile renting. I laugh at someone's falls I would recommend him. If you rent it / buy it to laugh, I would give it 8.5.
