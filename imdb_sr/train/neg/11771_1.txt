This is shown at the 59th International Festival in Edinburgh, but for the reasons best left to the authorities. It seems that much has been done from the fact that it was the first film in Thai, shot with Thai actors and a team, but directed by the Westerners. I should not be honest, because this film is boring, boring, boring. Why are you suggesting something, why wrap an idea into a mystery, why subtly recite a feeling, when you can hit a house with a terrible voice, obvious footage and top-quality scenes. Spurrier awkwardly throws out endless clich√©s. There is no hint, speculation, everything is on the screen, there is no need to use our imagination. I wonder when the 'awesome' part comes? No, you will not, because the sound surface will be more and more intimidating, rising to the crescendo of the evil one. Damn, I'm inventing words to describe how bad this is. I wonder if the demon is real or fictional? Why you are taxing - it's actually a snake, and it's really biting its bumps, and blood is everywhere. It's a strange, uncomfortable movie for several reasons. It should be a horror movie, but it's not scary - the bumps are marked and obvious. It could be a sharp attack on the stronger side of Thailand, but the director has a sleazy, cunning style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teenagers. Perhaps he threw himself on a Westerner who took innocence and who planted the seed of doubt in my head. Or maybe it's just pants. Uninspired, insidious, repetitive, hacked - all candidates for the best description, but bored looks most suitable and honest. All this was seen earlier, probably better, often with more thought, rarely with less imagination or flare. Sorry. Thumb on every number. Truli dire.
