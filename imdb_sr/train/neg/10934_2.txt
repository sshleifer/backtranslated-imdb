First, let me say that I am the LDS or rather I am a Mormon. So, when I was watching this movie, I automatically gave him the benefit of suspicion. In every movie I watch, I can usually find something. And this was no exception. He has his moments of redemption. But few are far away. One of the first things that I noticed that made me very upset was that Halestorm was ashamed of our Church! In the LDS Church, congregations are called "residents", and the basketball court is in the "cultural hall". NEITHER one of these two names is not mentioned. The church is never mentioned by name, and "standards" referring to the mention of what our Church believes. I wonder if the directors really are LDS or LDSs? This movie had so much potential! She could really show our Church in a positive light and help the public to see not only what we offer, but also what we believe in. Instead, it was just a little fun and left a lot to wish. If I were not LDS, I would still have to think that the Mormons are stupid, idiotic, and that they are ashamed of their beliefs. br> Sorry, Halestorm. You can do better than this!
