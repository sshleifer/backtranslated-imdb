At the end of this thriller, a skinny picture of the last days Alli Sheedi is creatively used to create more than one terribly evil picture. She assures that, if the unpleasant role of Bette Davis could come to her, she could do it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can not find many other reasons for this. If you've wondered how Sheedi looks like a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why would anyone?) Then here's your answer. For all the rest, Salli Kirkland's crazy woman who is hungry for sex is really tired, and even if you like these things more than me, you will have to admit that tension is falling greatly during these scenes. Savage's drunken beast of an insurance agent is equally unsuccessful, but at least it's a small role. Of the leading actors, Nicholas Valker does not inspire Paul Keller's grief at all, and his acting is wooden. Dara Tomanovic is better and her level increases slightly during her stage with Sheidi. Sheidi's pedantic, underestimated performance (though it seems to be often on an automatic pilot) is beautiful in itself, but out of context with others. The sets are shiny, the camera does not work.
