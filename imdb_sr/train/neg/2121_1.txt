Quite sincerely, it looked like seven hours of boredom. What is that? What is it that Vill Smith can not stand it anymore? I guess it seems to be too disgusting to take it seriously and get an Oscar. I understand how this is bias, but if there are no new lessons from the acting, I can never see how it wins. He is a huge name and is therefore generally confused by being a talented and diverse actor. It's just not. I give him the merit of doing so much and I can cry on the hat's cap. That is all. Seven pounds for me were some kind of eieroller, from the very beginning. The call for suicide did not intrigue me in any way. I was not curious to know why he called for his suicide. There were no surprises. The best thing to say is that Vill Smith and Rosario Davson had some decent chemistry on the screen. Likewise, I do not know her name, but the Hispanic woman did a great job with her role as a frightened and beaten woman. Voody Harrelson had a very limited time on the screen, but I would say that he stole the show whenever he was on it. I could not help wondering how I was worried about any of these people. Never once did he find pity for "Team / Ben." He killed jellyfish? Was the only survivor in an accident of 8 people? Geeviz .. did not see any of it ... 5/10 is pretty generous.
