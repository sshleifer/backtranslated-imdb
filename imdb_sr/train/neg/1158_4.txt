Tenants Two writers are struggling to complete their books in an almost empty dwelling house. Initially they help one another, and then the tension between them begins to build up slowly. Very few dialogues are natural, violet and full of nuances of meaning. It's like a college master with a full pretension writing a script. It was terrible and I found myself immediately immune to everything the film had to say, which is a shame because the film is filled with great performance from top to bottom. Snoop Dog is a good form, unfortunately, none of them can get the fake of words and premises. I can not really recommend this movie. Although not very bad, very confident and pretentious to the extent that you want to go. I lost interest for less than a third of times and I had to fight to come to an end. If you are interested, I would try to use it with a cable, but I would not give a good money to see it.
