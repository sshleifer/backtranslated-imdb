Like most people, I love the "Christmas Story". I've never heard of this movie and maybe for good reason - it's terrible. The same language, the same narrator, the same director, but lacked the warm blur of the original. Charles Grodin was a bad choice to replace Darryn McGavin, but I can not imagine anyone else replacing him. The story looks forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. Interaction with neighbors, Bumpus, is ridiculous. In the "Christmas Story", Ralphie's obsession with a BB pistol looks sweet, but his obsession in this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the original neighborhood bully, was replaced in this film by another kid with braces and a strange hat, but with little of the Scud Farkus threat. It would be quite difficult to equalize the original, even if this film was recorded with the original team.
