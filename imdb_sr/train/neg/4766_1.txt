You can say that they spent $ 5 on this. It's the loss of your time ... uh .. there's nothing good about this movie ... ... I do not know why I watched it ... the fish is not hot. horrible acting .. you could do anything and make better use of your time .. like watching TV playing shitti video games .. I feel looted. simply robbed .. of my time. I've never made a movie review before you probably can say it, but I felt this film as if I had to save the poor souls who would watch it and look at the IMDb before seeing if it was decent and looking at the comments. - there was no action - there were no hot chicks - there was no budget - acting - sweet, - screaming a bad movie. **** The whole movie is in the room. ***
