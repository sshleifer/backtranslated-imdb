I did not expect much when I saw this on the Palm Springs Film Festival this weekend. It was an alternative choice when two other films were sold out. Still, I was hoping. It sounded a bit like "Bride and Prejudice" (type L.A. falls on Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah). The B & P was not perfect, but it was a nice movie with good laughter and nice characters. My "My Bolivian Bride" had none of it. It seemed to be stupid and led to numbers. The characters were so clich√©d that the story looked like it could have been written by a high school student of the first year. Technically, the sound really bothered me. It seemed like there was a lot of overriding dialogue. I think so much. I know it is sometimes necessary, but it sounded as if half the film was shot in the closet and it became very disturbing.
