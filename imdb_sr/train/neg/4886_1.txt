Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janovski (again Priscilla Alden) was released from a mental institution (although she killed six people) and handed over to Hope Bartholomov's house. When she arrives there, she immediately returns to her criminal crazy ways and kills anyone who finds herself between her and her food. <br /> <br /> SVETI MOLI! Is this movie bullshit! You know that you are in trouble when open credits are started and they are only credits from the first movie, apparently taken from the TV screen. Nick Millard (nicknamed Nick Phillips) decided to return to the Crazi Fat Ethel world over ten years later and with a budget likely to cover the cost of an empty tape and renting a video camera for the weekend. Let's just say that Milard's unique style can not be properly transmitted to the video. Seriously, I made home movies with more productivity than this. And Milard tries to pull the SILENT NIGHT, DEADLI NIGHT 2 by filling half the time with the first movie (which looks like it was taken off from the worn VHS copy). Alden is again as good as Ethel, but the movie is so incapable of starting to complain about what she was doing in this garbage. I mean, at least the first movie I tried. We do not have music here, we have lesser effects (if at all possible), clumsy work, horrible sound and editing that seems to have been done with two connected video recorders. Avoid this at all costs!
