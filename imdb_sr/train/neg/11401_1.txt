The scenario is VERY weak, with no sufficiently character arcs to you to take care of a little about the characters or what's happening to them. The script is too talkative and it's not enough blood or action to even call a slow pace. The story comes to the point that you just want everyone to silence and die as quickly as possible, so you do not have to listen to them as they say this very muffled, rigid dialogue. In a technical note, the music mix is ​​a way to a high level and it's hard to understand what is most often said. Again, this could be called a blessing. All in all, this same story could be better told in a short film, for 30 minutes. The obvious "face-to-face" honors of Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" would be good to be more subtle, but here it seems to be more like a bald face. Come on, this 35mm budget and this is the best thing to do? However, cinema, lighting design and footage are really well made.
