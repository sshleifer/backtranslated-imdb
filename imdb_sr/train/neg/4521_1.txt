The whole genre of the Biker Movie must be made up of the worst movies ever recorded. This brings a lot of struggle, generous quantities of blood, bikers fighting against the Indians, and a city from a barracks that is inflated in the air and demolished in a barrack. The acting is beyond fear. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point he was in some great studio productions, and then he just disappeared. This movie really blows, but if you have not seen a biker movie for a long time, it's good to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a little bit of disturbance that you watched!
