What did the director mean? All who read the biography of Artemisia were left impressed by her courage to face a public trial for rape in the Renaissance and even endure torture to show Tashi's guilt. This fact shows true independence and emancipation - in its most terrible moment it stands on its MANU. Why are movies that show the Renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid to see the raw side of life or Hollivood's lucky-happy-mood has won? Until I always defend the freedom of the director that I am creating my reality in the film, I can not think of transforming Artimisije's life story into the head. A very disappointing choice for the author of this film.
