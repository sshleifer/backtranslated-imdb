Well, let me start by telling how HILARIOUS is this movie, I just could not stop laughing for pure nonsense. Do not misunderstand me, Bassinger did it well, but the script is just fine, and the mind is really true. The premise is good and as long as Della does not actually be a witness to the murder, it's interesting but after that it just goes downhill. Halfway through the protagonist, the protagonist pulls out a toolbox and, of course, instead of pushing it into the head, decides to take out a screwdriver, a jack for a car and finally a torch (like a sinking boat), that is, to kill its victims. Then there is the ultimate line I promise, if you are not in the seams, then I will eat my left leg. I would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old-fashioned, terrible film creations. Can I suggest that you watch the scene in the backyard with a guy falling from one leg on the tree, each time.
