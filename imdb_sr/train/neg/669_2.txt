I'm the guy who usually keeps thinking for myself, but I just came back from this movie, and I felt I had to express my opinion. Let me begin by saying that I am a great fan of horror. But what does a horror movie do? I certainly like to see some good scripts and character development. I know that they often lack horror films, but Prom Night seemed to have made no effort at all at that department. Next, we all love uncertainty. It's on the edge of your seat with unpredictable surprises. Yes, Prom Night did not have any of that! Of course, we love the scary killer. Prom Night has this? No, he has a nice boy with a sweet knife. And when all else collapses ... at least horror has its own pleasure to make it pleasing as upstairs upstairs and occasional naked scenes! Yes, so when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 as Prom Night, they leave it. So, with all these missing elements, I ask ... is this still considered a horror? Nope. I would call it more like a comedy. The people in my theater laughed more in this than when they saw "Semi-Pro", which was supposed to be a comedy (which was also exhausted, but that's another story!). I think I will have to give up the new horror. All good horror films from old days have been converted into rubbish so that film studios can earn. The people I went with to see them did not know it was a remake! What aroused me! I wonder what will happen when there are no remake films anymore? Where's the next horror?
