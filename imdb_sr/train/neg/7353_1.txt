Seeing him now is still a scandal and sexist as far as I can remember. comes from a time when the girls were Dolly Birds and mostly male toys. It's hard to realize that this is from the Hammer Studio and the fact that it's available on DVD when it's not good movies. Our nations are shameful when the working class is shown as labor shy or worse! The problem is that you can not feel nostalgic for Clippie on the bus. Try to keep the contents of the stomach when you see Olive in the flakes? A blue "souci" nightgown or something like Shirley Bassei wore a concert in 1972. The warning on this film shows the illegal practice of pulling a moto combo with a red two-seater bus, which I'm informed of is not Routemaster Bristol. Just do not look at something similar, like a porridge or daddy army ... or a fly that crawls to the wall.
