I used to be a passionate viewer until I personally spent long hours with the help of building a home for the White family, only to make it difficult for me to see a house a year later. All beautiful landscapes were removed, a beautiful stone sidewalk and a front fountain were removed, all pine trees and nuts were cut off, and the sprinkler system was torn away. Now it looks like a disaster area. They do not live anymore there ... they live "in the city" and come out only for the weekend. It's a tough time to think of all the hours that the great Oklahoma people donated to these people and see the result. The story we all saw on television was not entirely true ... do not believe everything you see and hear.
