Although many people praise this film, I have to warn you. There is no logic. I think Basinger has a decent job in acting, but you can not make a thriller if there is a big lack of realism. This scene pictures a good picture for you in the movie: while Basinger is haunted by the killer silder, she decided to sit down and look at the picture she finds out of her pocket. She is a picture of her daughter and says "we love you mom". Who does something like that? What is that? And believe me when I say it's not nearly as stupid as some other movie scenes. Someone said this is a "hidden gem". Well, I do not agree, this film has remained hidden for a reason. And it's not a jewel. Oh, and I beg you, I do not even want to comment on the red tool. It hurts my brain: D Normally I do not mind the lack of logic if it is in small quantities, but this film is basically possible only because of lack of logic. But I still give him 4 because, in logic, it is shamefully defective, she has a certain mood that kept me to the end. So if you decide to watch this, you know that you have been warned.
