The problem I find in this title is that I'm not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or a movie. The mixture of two genres simply does not work and it leaves the whole thing in the middle of the night. This is much more because the director chose the extreme extreme of what should be happening in our everyday life, making it unpredictable documentaries. If he's meant to be a thriller / drama, it's too boring and monotonous. In both cases, what is the morale or message the editor tries to convey to the audience? Are there people around us who abuse others who are willing to be abused? That there are many crazy people around us? So .......... so what?
