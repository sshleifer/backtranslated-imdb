It's not unusual to see American re-directing foreign films falling on their face, but here's the other side !!! This is a horrible transformation of the British video Vide Avake by the British! "Vide Avake" is weird but fun and fun! "Liam", on the other hand, is just strange. I have to confess "Liam" for one thing, and it's clear that I made the right choice in changing my religion!
