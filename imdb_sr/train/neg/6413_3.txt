My friends and I entered this film without knowing what to expect, but we were hoping for the best. When we got out, we were just a bit more informed about what was actually the plot of the movie. Although not the worst movie I've ever seen, I certainly do not recommend spending your money in cinemas. You may have a friend who is renting you (not even worth the rental price) if you really want to see him. When the film is so intricate that you have no idea what's going on in the last five minutes, there really is not much that can be said in the defense. The acting was decent, more than you would expect from this movie, and some of the recordings were good, but everything was captured by a bloody plan and a bad scenario. This film is actually, it's so bad that, as soon as it's gone, I went and bought a card to see a good movie just to clear my mind. I recommend that you all skip the first step and go to see a good movie.
