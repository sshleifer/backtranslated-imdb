Marvin (Rob Schneider) has no ingredients to be a cop who is his lifelong dream. But his happiness changes when car breaks (very bad) and is found by a doctor. The doctor must use the animal organs to rebuild it. After this moment, he unconsciously starts to have wild behavior and becomes the best cop who can be. By the time, he understands the changes and his animal instinct begins to take over his human side. In the meantime, he finds a beautiful girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman, which means he has to control himself and act in a civilized way. I'm not having fun of Rob Schneider. In fact, this is his first film I saw. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play loser (see his part in Allie Mcbeal, pretty funny). In such films, the biggest problem is that the script makes the viewer feel less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is okay to watch until we understand it too seriously. But it's very sad that such films were very good at checkout. The animal is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it does not get more than *.
