Where do you start ... Oh yeah, Message to bad guys: When you first find the person you were tracking (to kill) who witnessed the crime you committed, do not spend time talking to her so she would have another chance to escape . Message to the victim: When the robbers talk to each other and argue, take the opportunity to "PUT", do not sit there and watch them until you hear the noise. Message to the Director: If someone has 5 or 10 minutes of startup in a vehicle or on foot, you can not immediately have bad guys on their heels or bumper! Time and movement do not work that way. It would also be nice to think that a woman does not have to brutally kill (4) men in order to empower her to leave an offensive relationship at home.
