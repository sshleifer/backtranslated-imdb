... this is this! Very cool space, right behind the roof. It has an excellent first scene, you have to give credit wherever it is. It has solid characters and a decent enough scenario for the story of ghosts. but here are the things that bothered me: whenever the ghosts appeared, I really liked it; how it was done, what it looked like ... the only thing was the connection of the spirit. Because of the way things went down in the first scene, you would think that their dynamics would be different. Things were a little slower in the middle when I felt, and scrab crabs / spiders was just not good. But then the end is really good! Of course, 'The Grudge' essentially told the same story with a polished lens, but not a samurai, and that's what I like about this film relatively. /> <br /> The fans of 'Silent Rage' would absolutely love this film.
