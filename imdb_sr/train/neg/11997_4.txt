this film has many drawbacks and that's all I could see. It is painfully long and horribly directed. I could see that the whole audience is impatient and waiting for it to end. The operating time is over 3 hours which could be arranged in less than 2 hours. The transition between the story is average. Most people have admitted that they are expecting something better on the table. It's ridiculous only in pockets. ambitious project and execution below the money. govinda doing a fair job, Anil Capoor disappointed me, we rested as we expected. If u expect anything close to babel or love, in fact, then there is no.
