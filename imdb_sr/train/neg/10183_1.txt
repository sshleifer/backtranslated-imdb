This is a very terrible production. The general consensus was always that while Princess Margaret might have been spoiled and spoiled and that she might have enjoyed a lot of luxuries at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here is the weakest point of production, the actress did not manage to cross it. It also seemed that the production budget could not extend to a hairdresser - from the very beginning, the hair on the face of Princess Margaret had persistent birds nesting in a mess and seemed to be dragged through the bush. The actor who played the duke of Edinburgh seems to be preparing for his role, watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and he was farsal. I think that all Daili Mail readers deserve a free copy of the DVD for Christmas!
