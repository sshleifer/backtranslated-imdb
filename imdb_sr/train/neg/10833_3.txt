I wanted to love Magnolia. The store reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories that came to an end in the end, but Magnolia turned half way through the wrong turn and I lost myself. I almost quit it immediately and there, but I felt I had to stay there until the end, I knew little that it would be another painful 1 1/2 hour. Thank God I rented, instead of watching him in the theater. I almost screamed in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest blow in the pants was the end of the frog. My DVD player has not forgiven me yet, and I do not blame him for a bit. It was a unique film, but a bad, boring and senseless movie.
