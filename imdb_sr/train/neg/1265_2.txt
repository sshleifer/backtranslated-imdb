The first time I did not want to watch this movie because the trailer impression too common and expected the movie ... but as I recently had the pleasure to discover amazing "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affine '' which was nice and directed by Laurent Tirard (screenwriter "Pret-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that the "Prete-moi ta main" as good as "mensonges ..." the script is not bad, but not as well targeted as "mensonges. .. "People are not so generous (especially Charlotte, boring as usual) as Edouard Baer and Clovis Cornillac., And also be honest, I still do not understand how that shit can have such success, even with such casting ... In any case, the story could be an excuse to create so many interesting plot, but it as well as Tirardov "mensonges ..." although he wrote. Easy, is not surprising and lazy work.
