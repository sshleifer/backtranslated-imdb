I've seen this movie recently because a friend from New York brought it. After 30 minutes, I told him, "You must be kidding. Is it some kind of joke?" He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it was probably one of the funniest movies ever recorded. "What was it supposed to be?" I asked. "A propaganda movie made for children?" The action is stupid. The act is the worst ever for most directors and sincere people who look at this kind of bustle and think that it has anything to do with life, love or even a deadly life, of which it offers an incredibly idiotic look ... they need psychiatric help. Please, if someone tries to ask you to put this in your DVD or video player, consider how the virus enters your computer ... it will not destroy your player, but will destroy your evening. If they made Razzies in the 40s, it would have won in each category. (PS also goes under the dubious syllable "Stairway to Heaven").
