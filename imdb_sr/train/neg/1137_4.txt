I tried to go through this film twice, for the first time - and it was like dragging my teeth - and the second time I failed in spite of a large DVD transfer. Issue? It's just too boring. If you can get to the dramatic scene in the courtroom, which occupies most of the second half of the movie, you made it, but it's difficult to get to that point. There are some interesting conversations between "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The ending touches while Lincoln leaves and they place his Memorable Statue on the screen. It's a nice story, it's been a good one and it's ... but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging there. I guess true Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than this movie.
