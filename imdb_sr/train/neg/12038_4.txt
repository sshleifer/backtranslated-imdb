Is anything happening in this movie? There are only bizarre short scenes in which I did not know what was going on, so it does not count. This film is sooo boring pain, and it comes from a person who loves movies about filming. Confused? I watched this shit well. What was Donald Sutherland, because he missed it with this. And what about the "pedophile" scene at the beginning of the movie. Can somebody sleep! 4/10
