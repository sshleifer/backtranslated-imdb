This is not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies ever. It's so bad that I found it to be pretty comfortable. acting, God, the scenario, you have to joke. how can you imagine that the writer comes with things like: - a kid who makes fireworks at school, a fireworks so powerful that when someone hits him, they fly a hundred meters back and explode. The girl is trapped in the basement, the killer is trying to open the door. gets a drill, but the wire is not long enough. she first makes the extension cable, oh, horror, and then, when it's over, it breaks through the door and drills through the killer's head. VOV - and there are many more such examples. Oh yes, and what happened to George Kennedy, he was great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
