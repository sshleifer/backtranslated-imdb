one of the worst movies I've ever seen in a theater. I saw this film at the Austrian Film Festival in 2004 and it occurred to me that this film was admitted to the festival. it was an interesting premise, and it seemed that she could go somewhere, but she only split up every time she tried to do anything. First of all, if you want to do a musical, find someone with a musical talent. the music consisted of the loud piano playing that sounded like playing it on the stereo in the room they were recording. the verses were terribly written, and when there were no obvious rhymes, there were rhymes that provoked sighs and showed how much they stretched to try to do this film. and you think you'll find people who could sing when they make a musical, right? not in this case. Fortunately, most of the time they were in half conversation / half singing in the rhyme, but when they sang it made me. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. and this only applies to music. some of the actors were pretty good, but a lot of dialogue was terrible, like most scenes. they obviously did not have enough coverage on the scene, or they only had a bad editor because they consistently jumped on the line and used terrible choices while cutting the movie. even if the director was willing to admit that no one wanted a script until he added a hook to make a musical. I hope that investors will be sure that someone can write music before making the same mistake again.
