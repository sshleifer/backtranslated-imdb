please do not rent or even think about buying this movie. They do not even have a red box for rent, which would cost $ 1 and I think its value is lower than that. The main reason I rented this movie is because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 minutes and will give credit that the movie had hot chickens and quite a bit of nudity, but in addition you can buy another horror movie that has the same The thing with Ginger Linn has more acting time in this movie than Jenna and she is not even on the title page of the film nor her name. this film is a big disappointment and so great a waste of time.
