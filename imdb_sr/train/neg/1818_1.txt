Connie Hoffman is very beautiful and sometimes attractive toples. It's that, folks. The only reason to think about whether to watch this movie or not. These pieces from the sex dating of the 1970s are sometimes fun due to their very old age (widespread pants, big hair, Zapata mustache, etc.). This is not. The script is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea that an older citizen romantic leading man is extremely bad. The title, which suggests sexual comedy, is grossly misleading. I sincerely recommend that you avoid this plague.
