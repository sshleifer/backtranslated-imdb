Even if it was fun, this plagued movie wax would still be a sobering disregard. Stopping only to not dig out the corpses of the boys and repeat the "Weekend in Berne"? but just just ?? producer Larry Harmon and film director Ernest use copyright as an excuse to cope with Stan and Ollie's legacy. Gailard Sartain makes a false representation of Ollie, but Bronson Pinchot would not reach the tenth place in the Stan Lookalike competition; Even if both of them were on the movie, they would not be less disgusting. The less talked about the environmental catastrophe is the better. "Utopia" looks like a dignified swan song.
