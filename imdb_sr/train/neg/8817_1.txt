No, I've never seen a single "Santa Slasher" series, i.e. "Silent Night, Deadly Night", original "Black Christmas" or this, "Christmas Evil". I've heard everything about their reputation, or, MADS (Mother of the Disorderly Santas). I thought I would rent this because I heard it appeared as a reference to the 'Fat Guis At the Movies' segment. Mothers should be against it, but not for the ooooohhh "killer" of Santa Claus, but because this film was just plain shit. Bored, long? even for only 92 minutes, shit. The little boy sees the Santa Claus come down the chimney in 1947, gives gifts, eats some chocolate and miraculously floats along the chimney. The boy goes to bed, but returns to the living room to see how Mom and Santa are returning. Apparently, this was a mess of that kid for the rest of his life, even though the scene was as full as when Ralphie's dad got a "leg light" in the "Christmas Story". He was so upset, went to the attic, and cut off his arm well. Bring to the Future! Now, it's 1980's and a confused boy works in a toy factory. We got a gash that he was a little incompetent, and he caught both children and parents. When it's wrong, it's fine, blah blah. Two thirds of the movie is needed to finally extinguish it? as if it was not foreseen from the box. NO MOVIE should not last so long. I admit, this film had its own building tension, but only because I expected him to do something, anything. When he finally finishes, then, punishing "who is wrong", he is graphically similar to the "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I did not mention the completion of the VTF. I think it was a metaphor, but in reality, it's just as strange as the rest of the movie. (Take brother who is upset by his brother, he kills, and his solution is ... uh, killing.) Do not open this mess, not even Easter, or Evil. Again, I did not watch other "Santa-Slashers", but this was bad. She was creating uncertainty about the nature of the film and she never gave a decent gift.
