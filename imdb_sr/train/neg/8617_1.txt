Watching 10 minutes of this film, I was confused, I watched 30 minutes while my fingers were wrapped - I just could not believe it: the movie is really awesome. In fact, it is so terrible that I had to watch all this only to be convinced (!). During this, I realized that it reminded me of a bunch of Danish so-called comedies from the 60's and 70's. This form is as follows: Take an extremely popular comic book, make a script to put this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially one-liner), and spice it with a couple of pretty girls shoot it and you have success! I would not know if this film was successful, but unlike the Danish tradition that quietly died (with a few great comedians), it seems that there is a market for this type of film in the US.
