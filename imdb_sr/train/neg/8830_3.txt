Too many holes in this movie are fun and ALL the bizarre virtually Hollywood ending is completely out of context with the rest of the movie (this is not a spoiler because you will never guess how it ends!). You will also need to be obese to all types of politically correct subunits. The conflict between whites and blacks was very fictitious and unilateral. I did not understand why the author behaved in such an unacceptable way, is he / she trying to be a racist? Truly bizarre movie. Watch only if you love to be really angry about the hole in the plot and you like to discuss all the things that could or could not have happened. But on the positive side, shooting and acting is great.
