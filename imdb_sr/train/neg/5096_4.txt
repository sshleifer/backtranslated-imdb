Kurt Russell (like Steven Post) works as a boy to fight the UBC TV station (it's the United Broadcasting Corporation); He does not go anywhere, offering funny projects like Doctor's Dog Abraham Lincoln to study leaders - because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Director Joe Flinn (as Francis K. Vilbanks) wisely rejects Mr. Russell's proposals, but has no idea how to choose a hit TV show. His secretary, Heather North (like Jennifer Scott), who works double as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimp that curses Russell when she wants to watch TV. It turns out that the monkey watches all popular shows and can easily pick hits. Russell reveals the talent of the chimpanzee and uses it to improve his career. Understandably, things get HAIRI for Russell and cast! Raffles Chimp (operated by Frank Lamping) works well; Raffles looks bored and / or interrupted in several scenes, when the chimpanzee should look interested; they could be corrected by re-downloading or editing. A mild satirical edge is present - imagine the monkey pick up TV shows! And it's a monkey who gets beer in commercials (he drinks in Disney movie)! A glimpse of the actors will reveal to you a bunch of entertaining TV actors to recognize and try to place a place. You can make a drink game, in honor of the rapture of Raffles beer, guessing the actors and where you've seen them before. Here's the start - Hey, is not it Dr. Bellovs from "I Dream of Jeannie"? Bottoms Up! **** Barefoot Etiquette (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flinn, John Ritter
