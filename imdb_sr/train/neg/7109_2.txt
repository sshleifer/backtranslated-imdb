Now I understand. The title refers to the immediate post reaction of each member of the audience after 68 minutes of mental torture. Trying too hard to be scary, without good dialogue, even any fear for this thing, makes The Screaming Skull more like snoring. Although, house and property set in black-and-white technique set a dark tone for the film, but that's all. The only terrible thing about this flop is that people actually made money on this! Remember the guarantee on the coffin at the beginning? It's perhaps the funniest thing I've ever seen on the screen. It's sad that the viewers probably hoped that director Alek Nichol would be forcibly placed in a suitcase, locked, buried, and buried alive for his loud efforts. Jenni was put in this unhappy horrible situation, she never really sympathized with a woman whose anxiety was blamed by a fake cranial dish. Likewise, her husband John appears as a shameful speaker, but it does not work and he ends up proving how hard he is by hitting a helpless rich! Ah, Mickey, it's been a day before you could get a prohibition against an asset keeper like him. Access to this type is not very good or maybe too glue for an airplane. However, despite his unusual personality, Micky is probably the only good thing that goes for this movie, providing a light sense of fun and I can not get enough of a guy saying, "It was Mary!" and digging in pots in a greenhouse.
