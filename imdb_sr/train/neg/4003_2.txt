Great disappointment. This was one of the best British criminal drama / detective shows from the 90's that developed a fascinating title character played by Scottish Robbie Coltrane. However, this one-time addition has little to add and may suffer from an inevitable descent because of increased expectations when a favored shoah returns after a long break. Coltrane is not given much work, much more attention is paid to the uninvited killer, and in what must act, it does not appear to be involved, almost boring. The story of a former soldier is written in books and an attempt to inform us about Coltrane's family life looks light. Perhaps, if the writers had a whole series before them instead of just this two-hour performance, they would write this with much more depth. As it is, skip this and watch the old Cracer from the 90's that's far superior.
