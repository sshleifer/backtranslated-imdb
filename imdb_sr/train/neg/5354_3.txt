Absence of good location, absence of decent work, absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, absence of a decent appearance SPECIAL EFFECTS ... I have to continue? A review may contain SPOILERS. The actors seem to read their lines, and that's not very good. Most "actors" acted as if they were playing in SECOND CLASS. It seems that the story was written by one of the two second-class students mentioned above ... it's not all that is intricate ... it's just SIMPLE and DUMB, that a person thinks that something is missing them and they think it is intricate. No, it's not, it's as SIMPLE as you think it is. WE ARE RESULTING A "movie", that's how I KNOW it's STUNK! Most of the movies just spoke (reading their lines), trying to look evil. The narrator was ANNOIING. "Special effects" were LAUGHABLE. I love movies with a low budget. I also like Carolin Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarri and Michael Berrimore ... just not in this movie ... you can say they were not paid, or they were not paid a lot, because neither their hearts nor talents were in it. I love Tony Todd ... however, he was only adequate in this film. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the only reason I gave him a 3 star instead of 1 ... and Tony was only two minutes in it (seriously)! I suggest that the DVD rewind for two minutes to the Toni Todd segment. If I went to the theater and paid more than DOLAR to see this "movie," I would be P.O.'D and asked for money back. I hope that the people who did this will be better next time.
