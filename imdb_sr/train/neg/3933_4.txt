A huge hit for the Australian public can still be ridiculous, but his political inaccuracy and dullness, intolerable humor can make it a little turning around. It takes too long; Some of the content could have been preserved for continuation, Barrie McKenzie is holding his, who desperately needed some new things anyway. However, his stance on the Aussie is ridiculous, but it also gets boring until the film is retiring. Some say that Crocker's poems are the best parts and that they are certainly original, but "hilarious"? Barry McKenzie's adventures will fall as a landmark in Australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to ensure that most Australians do not see themselves as Barri McKenzies (or, Mick Dundees!) Abroad. Rating: 5/10
