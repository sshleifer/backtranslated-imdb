I do not know what's with these Brad's children. First, Barrie Villiams publicly praises her having sex with her TV sister, Maureen McCormick, and then about getting to know her TV mum, Florence Hederson. Then, Susan (Cindi) Olsen is playing music for a bunch of porn movies. Then Mike (Bobbi) Lookinland gets into trouble for driving in a drunken state. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum may have had the same half on the side. Now, Christopher (Peter) Knight has been persecuted by a beautiful young model in his early twenties during his stay at "The Surreal Life", which was initially entertaining to watch, now married and in very unstable and hostile relationships. The last episode, in which she posed for a bunch of naked photos with another naked girl for the album for Christopher for his birthday, was not a good move on her part. And he dealt with this in a very mature way, just picking up and going to clear his head. I think he always showed up to everybody's needs and now he finally takes a stand. And I hate to say it, but I think it abuses him, verbally. The way he tortured him for the bargain ring and the way he was eating it for every little thing. Also, she openly talks about having flirting with other women, and it is obvious that she still sleeps with him and with women and men, which is not something that any human being who respects himself should work when she already married someone. If this is a man who speaks so to his wife, and comes out every night for fun and sex with other people, everyone will gather behind a woman to leave him. Why this would be different. What started as a cute little fall in the second reality shov, was a huge catastrophe. Adrianne, as beautiful as she, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, apparently needed some therapy because she cries like a baby for so stupid things. I'm sorry, but Chris needs to get rid of her, because he's a good man who can not afford to be humiliated like this.
