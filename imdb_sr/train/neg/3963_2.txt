How many times do we have to see the spy walking in the background and spinning through the mirror reflection? It was done in twenty films in recent memory and forty times in this horrified, poorly-recorded movie. There were only two strange moments to spot ... when the ghosts attacked the personal space of two characters. Speaking of characters, acting was as good as Diet Coke in 64 oz. I took a glass out of it. The characters on the side could be drawn from various Scooby Doo cartoons. He was a friendly, old sheriff. There was a weird freak who lived in the back of Alabama. Many characters without development. The picture of the killed child at the beginning was the most important. But instead of investigating the murder of a child, which would be interesting, they just told us that she was dead and that her parents had problems to reconcile her death with the community and each other. When they reached the hut, the scenes rarely flowed together ... with the flickering images of a dead daughter who intervened there and there. Oh ... and creepy sounds have also been exaggerated. You know what I mean ... the creaking doors that open themselves, the crickets in the woods, even though iada iada. Ooooohhhh. I did not see it before. Again, you will again see the stunning doors that open in the movie. NOTE TO DIRECTOR: The scari scene is just scary if it does not repeat every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think about these things before you call "it's a wrapper!"
