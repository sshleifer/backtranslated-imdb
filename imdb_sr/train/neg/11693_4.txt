Fun concept, but poorly implemented. Except pretty good effects of makeup, there is really not much to do. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what looks like a week and a week to get from fat to a normal size, the main character seems to go from a normal size to a deadly thin in days ... and when the deadly skinny remains fairly just mortally skinny for Everyone Case, the movie has many burning problems - cinema is definitely low-budget-TV-quality and, above all, the acting is pretty horrible everywhere around. It seems that Robert John Burke is always trying to make some kind of weird imitation of Charlton Heston and it's literally painful to watch ... the only terrible thing is that Lucinda Jennei and Kara Vuhrer are worse. The only reason I gave this film as high as I did when the film entered the last 1/3 or so, and the figure of Joe Mantegne took over the role, the film develops a fun, campsite "culinary march" , and crazy gangster schemes to torture totally disgusting gypsies are fun to watch. Completion, if predictable, also means good. Avoid unless you are a king-o-phile or are you really excited about the idea of ​​the thick Tony of the Simpson who is terrorizing a Gypsy camp.
