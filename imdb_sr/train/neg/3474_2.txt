This thing is terrible. Character Ben Affleck is focused on himself and a fairly sadistic - sadistic fetboy for drilling in the nose. And he is romantic HERO!

This is not magic. I do not know what it is. It's horrible. And it's a terrible loss of talent. O'Hara laughed me hysterically since the late 1970's. Gandolfini. Applegate. All these people were underutilized. If Ben came out of the equation, those people may have dreamed of something great.
