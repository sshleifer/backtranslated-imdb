Whether you want to spend almost 2 hours of your life watching it depends on how you like your horror movies. If you love them so fucking horribly they are hysterical, watch out. Jigsaw is no doubt the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen 'Long Time Dead'), and I say it as a fan of low-budget genre horor / up and after I've seen a few to compare it. I will not even go into the specificity of what makes this film bad, because the only good thing is that it's so horrible that this is one of the happiest things I've seen for years. If you can find that this is a cheap rent, it's worth watching, if you were involved in it - I am ashamed of you. : o) IMDb should introduce a 0/10 ranking specifically for this movie, it deserves it.
