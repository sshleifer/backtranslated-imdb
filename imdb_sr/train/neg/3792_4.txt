I've seen many, many productions of The Nutcracker. Perhaps I looked at this film from the viewpoint of the theater director, but I was disappointed. I am sure that people in the specific work of ballet choreography think that this production is impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective I have found everything from design to choreography, to be uncomfortable and unsuitable for "film". None of the traditionally "weird" and impressive costumes did not look like what they should be (ie sweets did not look like sweets, the rats did not look like rats but chocolate kisses), the acting was weak, maybe it was too much for the screen, and choreography has not done anything to me. This makes the entire show very satisfactory (at best), as if it was intended not to stand out from any other production. But remember, again, it's from the artistic perspective of a theater director, not a dancer or choreographer, but a direct male theater director.
