This is much worse than those terrible Lora and Hardy from the 60s. They were terrible, but at least they were simple ripoffs since then Stan and Ollie Revival. The new audience re-discovered the comical genius of this couple, and cartoons were a deadly rubbish directed at earning the interest of children. That could be expected. But, as even trying to try to rationalize this work ... I can not even think about the word. I'm sure the producers hoped to in some way inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can not inspire interest in the past by the shallow and meaningless cartoon of what the original has made so appealing. Impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) make a Vegas act and it belongs to him. The action is even weaker than that used in the old days, trying to test ideas with two reels. If this film was someone's first exposure to REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure the viewer would have rejected the reputation of the original duo as a senile that disappeared. The only movie I hate above this is SPIT ON THE GRAVE. And, you know, these filmmakers in essence did the same thing to Stan and Ollie.
