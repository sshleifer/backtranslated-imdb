Perhaps I was a former Moslem and an eloquent sense of humor that prevented me from throwing this film into a rubbish bin "arthouse / festival shit". It's not the biggest movie of 2005, nor is it a complete rubbish. It just has a lot of problems. And I sincerely doubt that this film is banned from any "ideological fears" or "conservative taboos" or any other reason why this film could be called "brave" and "uncompromising" abroad. It is forbidden because the censors knew that 99% of Russian filmmakers would be considered offensive because of poor taste during the shooting and installation of this otherwise boring film. So we have a strong opening shot. A wonderful sound design, a great premise - loaded with meaning and symbolism. The use and setting of symbols will always be the strongest aspect of the film (not that number 4 is a daunting visual challenge). In the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setting. A funny and well-written bar conversation between the three (main?) Characters and we feel the path for these people, the great country of Russia, the human condition and all that. Then the film starts to slow down. We are beginning to wonder what is ahead. The rest is pretty boring, simply put it. Of course, the guy in the village pulls his heart, and there are also some fun moments. Good sound, of course. But enjoying this film, not to mention the action, are seriously endangered by pacing problems. And this, this lack of payment for passing through all (beautiful) miserable suffering and gloominess, is what ultimately will anger people to 'offensive' things (personally, the main offensive scene borders with a gentle, in this pathetic way of harmless drunkards. /> If you want to watch a pleasant film in which the Russians spend a longer time period (the whole movie), look at the details of the national hunting. Much more rewarding post-Soviet things: So, 4 out of 10 for 4, nice and symbolically my condition after mediocrity.
