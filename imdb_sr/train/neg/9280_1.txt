Honestly, I do not know what is funny, this horrible remake, or comments on this forum. Revision of my masterpiece was in tears, it's so funny. In any case, this film is one of the worst films ever, and certainly the bottom of the boards for sequels. The name "Omen" at the title forced me to stop and watch this morning on HBO, but it's a rage for the other three, especially for the original. There are so many classic bad moments, but my favorite guy who catches a juggler at a psychic fair !! good times ! This film is for the Omen series what is "Scari Movie" for the whole genre. Avoid unless you are looking for a good laugh.
