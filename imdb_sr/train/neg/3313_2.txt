How can anyone say that this film is a comedy? If I had not gone with my finace, I would fall asleep and ask for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was as if he was on the wrong set. I like most chickens, but I hated this. This is the only time I've seen so many looseness and I was not involved. These clothes were exaggerated. Nobody speaks like that again, and I do not think they're even then. The dance part was terrible. My ex-girlfriend later asked me ... "Did not you like that part?" I said, just to spare her feelings. Now I know why we did not get married, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
