The film addresses the public because of the charisma of Ben Stiller and the famous J. Aniston. It seems that we have a recipe for a successful title here, but there is nothing successful in this movie. Poly is very well played by Aniston, no doubt. It's a character that suits her perfectly. Bem Stiller is the same problematic guy as in "Meet Parents", but in this comedy scene they are a bit over the above mentioned title. very poor with nothing special. With these two well-paid actors things could be much better - but what can they do when there is such a bad story and script? 4 of 10.
