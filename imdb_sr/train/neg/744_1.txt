Holy God damn all-evil-powerful. This film was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way ... Acting is the poorest thing I've seen for some time. This film was more like Lord G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the movies appeared on a terrible green screen. My favorite part was when they were in a carriage, and you can say there are no horses. They flee from extraterrestrial monsters and move at the same speed as fast jog. Then he switches to a distant shot with a funny CG horse. It seems that the CG is generally parallel with the "Eye of the Eyes" from 1992. I mean, come on, really. He felt like a horrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorb to save the day. The worst. Movie. Ever.
