When his cousins ​​were wickedly murdered by a gang of robbers, the young deputy is ordered to rush off his dumb friend, forced to deal with the gang, Tucson on trial, and in the end he has to face real killers along the way. Decoi is the real bait that is sent to the video store to get you out of the better movies! It's cunning, illogical, slow, and in the end very boring. There are some good bones, sets and photos, but nothing else is good about this vanity project from writer / director / producer / star Justin Kreinbrink, who obviously had too much money on his hands. They made such a Western, which were under one hour. Cut this from half the length and you may have something to look at.
