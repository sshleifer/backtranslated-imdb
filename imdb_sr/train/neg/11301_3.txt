Nothing will destroy the movie as a combination of bad scenarios and bad directions. This is the case with The Mummi's Tomb. The script is the rest of the ideas from older, better Universal Horrors like "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The direction is banal and stagnant. The acting is central. Even Chanei's Kharis is weak compared to Tom Tyler in The Mummy's Hand, and the producers are crazy enough to add shots from Christy Cabanne that are much better and point to the weakness of their movie! he realized how bad this film was, and essentially edited it from zero two years later as "The Mummi's Ghost" with a much better script and better director. The result was probably the best movie in their four Mummy films, although it was not nearly as good as the original Karl Karl Freund from 1932. Cabanne's record lifted this film to the 3rd "new" stuff 2 at best. Dick Foran and Vallace Ford were probably happy that their characters jumped out that they would no longer have to appear in this.
