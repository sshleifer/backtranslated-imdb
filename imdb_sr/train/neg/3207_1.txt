God, this was so bad! The story was poor - at best - and the animation was straight and lifeless - even childish. This film is taken too seriously ... unless they naturally wanted to be funny. I saw this last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the whole audience laughed at each scene. I think my favorite was 'should not you be studying medicine at Oopsalof'! And I also think that they were trying to see how many times they could sink into the unique line of Nical's character 'we will be together ... it's our destiny.' I'm sorry, but after the first time, the words have lost meaning. And what about the apple? I recommend this as a lesson to Americans: You can not animate, so please do not try. Just be embarrassed.
