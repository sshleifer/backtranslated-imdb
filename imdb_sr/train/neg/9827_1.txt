First of all, this film reminded me of the old movies I had to watch in school at the school. It's not a good thing. Basically, it's just a preoccupied and pretentious piece of dirt, just like the terrible series "Left behind you". I'm not offended by religious films ... but I am insulted when these religious films are extremely terrible. I wish I could say nice things about a Christian movie, but it does not seem like this will happen sooner. I bet that if you gave the biblical blows a decent budget, they would still not be able to make any sense. Just avoid this. Also, the fact that the "American Family Association" (essentially, Missing Reverend Vildmon's) wore this film on their website is another reason I hate it. In fact, after I looked at this, I went home and watched my copy of the NC-17 David Cronenberg, who received the Crash rating. Forgive me, Father, for I've missed it. Hahahahaha!
