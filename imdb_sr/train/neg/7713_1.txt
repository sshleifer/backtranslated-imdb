I knew this film should be so bad that it was funny, so I got into it with those expectations. I just found it so bad that it was murderously bored. A gritty thematic song is funny about 10 seconds, until you realize that there is nothing smart with it except deliberately irritating quality. Watching things sprinkled with tomatoes old in about 30 seconds. About the movie there is nothing smart or fun except premise. Maybe he could endure a comedy for 3-4 minutes, but it's not just a feature film.
