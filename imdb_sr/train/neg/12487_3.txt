This film was a great disappointment. I'm looking at the opposite view of critics. This is not the case that the material is not up to the level of the actor; Here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagnei) are simply not at the material level. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were as big as Davis and Cagnei, and they looked at how it turned out that this had happened one night - a classic that was all the time. With a very similar story, Davis proves she has no talent for comedy (for her, it's a good thing for her to be the only comedy she has ever tried!). Davis's performance with one note exudes silliness, but none of Colbert's shades of nuance and It Happened One Night. Cagnei, who was a great actor in comedy, seems to disagree with his costume, Davis. The scenario provides some decent lines and jokes, but the delivery seems to be better suited to drama than comedy. Part of the problem is a soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more convenient for a light drama than comedy. Jack Carson, who played similar roles during his career, is more capable of handling very similar material. In a rather typical accompanying role, Eugene Palette delivers respectable performance. In a slightly different role as an old western remnant, Harry Davenport is very good. But in one of his poorest plays, Villiam Fravlei is quite irritating. The constant references of his character to fictional cops are bad efforts of irony. I really love each of these performers, and it is a shame that, as an ensemble, they do not achieve more chemistry and do not have a better score than The Bride Came C.O.D.
