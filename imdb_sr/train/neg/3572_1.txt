Divan "Z" channel in Los Angeles showed this film Pie Zadore about six months after "Butterfly". I had such great hopes for an actress, then from a bad to obviously worse movie in this movie. Again, it was in the '80s and I have to tell you that the works of Harold Robbins have been pushed by smarter writers. Jackwell's Susan broke into him (she hated her way of writing women); Irvine Shaw's work was engulfed by many women, and of course, Sidney Sheldon had her kingdom at the end of the 1970s in the early 80's and then came Jackie Collins who did women stronger and equal people in every way in her books, even more. Why this work smelled. The work of Harold Robbins in the 80's just did not catch the audience. Pia Zadora, who acted in one of Robbin's works, was like throwing kerosene on fire. Support was not even help. Oooooh ... this was horrible to watch then, and even 20 years later, it looks even worse. I had hope for Pia as an actress and everything was shot when this was done. It would be hard for Pia to redeem himself as an actress (although John Waters threw her into Hairsprai was a spark) although she had a nice voice of singing. Hey, Pia, wherever you are. ..Hairsprai can go on tour! Join the show. You may be the biggest story of return. Just hope that you will record this movie for you if you do so.
