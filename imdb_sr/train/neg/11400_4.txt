Hazing is a confused mumbo-jumbo that so hardly wants The Evil Dead to even call Bruce Campbell a few times. The problem is that it's simply not in the same league as that great movie. This film is not nearly original. He used the action before, Kevin Tennei at Night of the Demons, and it was much more fun. This throw takes too much time with complicated exposure before the children enter the ghostly villa and start demonic events. a screen that puts another top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As far as the behavior of children is concerned, it is passing, but not at all good. The unpredictable operation of the camera is more boring than smart or atmospheric. There are several good moments when the first man is obsessed and throws some deadly liners as he sends out his victims, but that was never scary. The level of bloodyness is medium to low, but the director tries to compensate him by showing several times to the actresses of Toples. All in all, it's okay if you have 87 minutes to lose.
