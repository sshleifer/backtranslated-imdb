If you're a fan of really bad movies, and you think it's funny, you'll have a great Shako act. First, playing professional players in movies hardly ever works. Shak had to be the worst actor I've ever seen next to Dennis Rodman who made a few bad films. Still, this movie is bad for a bad kid. I would give this a zero but it is impossible.
