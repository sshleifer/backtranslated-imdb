My wife and I love to rent really stupid horror / sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends laughing. We saw this at fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflik list. Now, when I say this film is horrible, I think in a good way. All about this, acting, working on a camera, a story, a costume, is just so cheap and cheap, but it makes it good. I think that in one scene the actors seemed to actually walk in the place. I really hope that the one who made this movie was not serious when they made it, because if they were, then it would be sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them, then I recommend this.
