I saw this film a few years ago in the group tradition of Fast Forward movie festivals, where we decided to rent a bunch of B-films and vote for those who chose the worst. The night we watched, was declared the best, due to the similarity of complications and fun bones. This is certainly a silly, brilliant movie, which can be seen under the full understanding that you are looking at low-budget hair. Personally, however, I would not recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave its mark on you. Made made enough impression on me that I was actually trying to get my hands on the copy for several years. Good choice if you choose to watch bad movies. This is fun, and I remember lush music ...
