I went to this film expecting a concise film about the effects that Sam's son had on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to feed me more rash on racial tension, mob justice, or the inability of an ordinary citizen to make a choice under peer pressure. Lee introduced an extreme view. The whole movie could be more effective if it is in a 90-minute format with more focus, less tangential subassemblies. Don 't even try to rent video if you do not enjoy Spike Lee; In such a case, the theater is worth it. This is not an escapist movie.
