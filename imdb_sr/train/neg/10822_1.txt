Jane Eire is one of the greatest novels in English and this scriptwriter should read. I hate when writers use Spark's notes for what is a novel. This movie is unbearable to watch if you read the book. The whole 'red room' is so weak that I wonder why they are trying to insert it at all. 'predicts the whole story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is so badly in the movie. I'm sure she was happy to die and go earlier. The book is one of the most powerful characters and was not a red head. The whole Christian theme is missing in her life and the rest of the film. Make yourself a service and miss this movie and read the story like Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece said.
