Oh, God ... I thought CBS's broadcasts were the worst thing Gerald McRanei showed up in ... Four people were experimented with crazy mind control. Computer. That's it, do not rent it. I saw this under one of its many titles - "Gray matter", and that may be one of the worst movies. recent memories. Other reviews are right, that's terrible. Never had so many shots on the screen ever come up, NEVER. The head is terrible, the direction is terrible, and the scenario is terrible. I can not say this is terrible. Avoid it as if you had big goddesses. This is rated (PG) for physical violence, for violence in arms, for mild aches, some curses and some situations for adults
