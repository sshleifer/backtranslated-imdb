The word sums up the dime; Five girls are missing trying to find their way home when they stop at the store to get directions that hit the parked car, breaking one front light on it. to get into trouble, but suddenly they see behind them one front light (ooooh). From there all scream, cry and violence when they try to escape from this crazy person who lost him because of the headlights;), good screaming and crying mostly stays through the whole movie (very embarrassing) The film was filmed, with A cheap camera that tries to look "real" or "shocking", I suppose, is just embarrassing and useless. In the absence of anything better than that, "Blair artificial style". Screaming and crying for almost the entire film with banging sound was embarrassing, you literally got a headache :) I'm sorry, but this was not scary, just an unpleasant painful act film.
