A heavy Texas budget that's been filmed well, but it's a little consolation. Poor acting, or, to put it, a bad act, a fairly leaking story, no new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. It looks like a bunch of young people are preparing a haunted house for Halloween, which is done every year, but this year things are different. It has a long lesbian theme that is not only boring but definitely fulfilling empty spaces, which have many. Poor, childish, definitely can be avoided at all costs.
