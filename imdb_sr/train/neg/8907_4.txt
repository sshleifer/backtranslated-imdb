I rented this yesterday on a DVD and I did not realize it was a "study of character" movie, so I tried to watch about an hour before I pressed the stop button. Theme, I just could not get into this movie. Maybe it was my mood to want to look something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but putting it aside, I tried my best to keep on looking, but I gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the global combination did not come together to maintain my interest. The only interesting thing was the theft of the sergeant, and he hurried to buy another, and the spray painted it black to appear as a police question. I think this film should have been titled "Who Stole the Sergeant?" The scenes were well made, but I reconnected them. Again, I felt robbed of something cohesive to watch me. .. Maybe. To me it was a waste of good effort and time. I'll leave you to try it, but I would not recommend it.
