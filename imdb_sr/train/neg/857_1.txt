Many fans of the king hate it because they have deviated from the book, but the film is a different medium and the books should change when they make a leap. Nevertheless, the film is completely gone, but it fails completely on film terms. I'd like to hit people who tell me it's the most horrible movie ever made. I always follow the question "Really ... who scared you?" Every fan I asked is silent. Occasionally, someone, at the loss of a decent fear (There are no ...), calls it "grape-juice-shooting-out-lifts." If you are afraid of that, I do not know what to say to you, except perhaps you are scared of it. I just kissed my eyes watching these horror ideas of the z-stages that are played in this humorous, unconscious movie. Halloran to Overlooking just to kill him; with the dumbest members of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the hallway and that Hallorl forever needs to descend. It's really one of the dumbest sequences ever filmed on the movie. Oh, and a nice selection for the artwork of Mr. Halloran Stanley! The black light of Afro-Nymphomaniacs really contributes to the mood and development of the character of the horror film. Has any film ever made an off-site shot in any movie? I consider it a miracle that I eventually managed to bypass this shit and I agree that Kubricks 2001 is really an important movie, given the enormous "bad will" created by this stupid, stupid film, and a cult of fake but unarticulated Kubrick fans who could not describe the idea of ​​work in any film resource Congress Library in front of them. Throwing into the grotesque exaggeration of Jack Nicholson, introducing dumb lines in tense moments, and Razzie nominated the performance Shelley Duvall and you have a very shy movie.
