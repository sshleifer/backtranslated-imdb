I recently grabbed a part of GEORGE 2 on TV, but I could not look it up to the end. Just avful! I can not even remember complications. All I know is that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula from the first movie, which was bad enough. There is a lot of pushing around, but the direction and editing were so bad and flying, it was like watching outtakes or erased scenes. To have the original voice Ape the Ape back was not close enough to warm up. GEORGE 2 is probably the worst continuation I've ever seen, and it says something. Jesus, because of the IMDb rule line 10, I have to keep on knocking on when I have nothing more to say about this crapulic movie made for the TV extension. Disney, shame his head.
