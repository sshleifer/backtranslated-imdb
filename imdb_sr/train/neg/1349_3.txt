I got this DVD more than 2 years ago and decided to watch it yesterday. I do not know why it took me as much time as me as inspector Gadget, and even the new Gadget and Gadgetini. Although it can have a bright color palette and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, there are some old things that are missing that this gadget goes down to the toilet. song and music is completely absent. The composer tries to make a compromise by sounding like that, but still not good enough. Gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. In addition, it looks much easier and more complex than it is simple. Penny no longer has a computer book, and she and Brain do not even appear. The parcel does not exist. There is something in the transformation formula, and Dr. Claw uses it for some never to discover evil, but that's all I have. What was the deal with a short / huge Italian guy I would never know. Nothing had anything to do with it. And if the title is something to be passed, his last case has not been completed in any way. And he remains in effect, so and why is it called the "last case" is also a mystery. I was not impressed at all. This is an insult to a large animated show that is unusually absent on DVD, but do not let it trigger you to buy any DVD of the Inspector Gadget. I only sold a few seconds after I finally looked at it. No child will love or appreciate this, and no fan of the old shoe does not tolerate it.
