He had never made me write a review earlier, but this was just dire. And he stumbled with him trying to find what he did about this movie to pick him up as his first serious role, but honestly, that was a bad choice. she made a good book, but it certainly did not work for me because she felt she was amazing, she lacked the atmosphere and I found many stunningly stylish scenes. A music maestro maybe, but a serious actor is sniffing. Dylan Mcdermott and Rose Birn were passable but insufficient to carry a poor conspiracy with poor dialogue. Perhaps I completely missed the point, but it did not fit into any genre, did not cause any empathy towards the characters, nor did it create any uncertainty, in fact, I found myself praying for the end and pushing deep The desire to shame all three major lika!
