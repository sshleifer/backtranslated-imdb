Devil Hunter became famous for the fact that he was on the DPP 'Video Nasti' list, but it really should not have been. Many movies on the list, where they are for God (and DPP), are only known for reasons, and although this is not a bounty of the crowd; there is not much to justify the ban ... which is as embarrassing I would never sit where it is not due to the fact that it is on the 'shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least a decent base from most Cannibal movies - and follows the actress who was kidnapped and dragged into the jungle of Amazon. Then the hunter was hired to find it, but on the road must be courageous natives, headed by a man who calls himself "Devil" (hence the title). The film basically lasts eighty-five minutes and there are really not many interesting scenes. It is a real disadvantage that Jess Franco has finished filming such films because man obviously has talent; as seen in films such as Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in fur, without face and it kills in ecstasy, but unfortunately, his good films are just gems among the bunch of shit, and Devil Hunter is largely a part of the shit. I watched this film solely because I want to say that I have seen everything on the DPP list (only two more!), And I suppose that is why most other people who saw it. But if you're not looking for Nasties; There is really no reason to worry about this.
