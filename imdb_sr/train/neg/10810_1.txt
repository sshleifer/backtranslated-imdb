There is only one thing I want to say about this film - the scene in which Shak is in the music number with the character of Francis Capra about wanting to be a ghost; I'm never watching this movie. The story is terrible, the acting is terrible (come on, it's Shak!) And I prefer that Capra in Free Villa (equally terrible) double this movie.
