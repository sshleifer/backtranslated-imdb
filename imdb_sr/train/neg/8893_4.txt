Celia Johnson is good as a sister. Michael Hordern is as good as Capulet, although his usual enjoyment and vhinniing, and not cloth on his King Lir. John O'Connor reads the verse as Fr. Lawrence, although he never takes it. Alan Rickman is as good as Tibalt, in his first "reel" role that would make him famous. Benvolio Christophera Stravia is sympathetic. The sets are beautiful, if not stunning as in some other BBC's Shakespeare's. And that's it. The rest is bad to terrible. Rebecca Saire has been in production for 15 years and has no idea how Juliet behaves - she opens her eyes wide and snaps every line in exactly the same way. Patrick Riecart disagrees with her, but his self-esteem is inexplicable. Balcony scenes run smoothly and effortlessly with zero emotional or erotic influence. Their death comes as a relief. If I had a dagger, I would have offered them for hours earlier. Anthony Andrevs is inexpressible as Mercutio, a great shock if you remember his fine work in "Brideshead Revisited". He breaks the Shakespeare's mirror into a thousand pieces of two to three words, and then shakes the fragments as far as possible in an unconnected and incomprehensible way. In this production, Kueen Mab gave up. Terrible. The director, Alvin Rakoff, shows only the occasional gift of setting the camera to a place where it will show us what we want to see. The original fight is particularly inconsistent. However, when in a later battle humor, Romeo obviously kneels Tibalta straight into shoemakers. Tibalt then grabs the injured region. However, did it pass? R & J is a long game. This version is not recommended for use in the classroom, nor for many others.
