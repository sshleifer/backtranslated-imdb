Lovers of Goremeister Herschell Gordon Levis should look somewhere else if they collect this film for his usual bucket of blood around him, because in this film he has little value in the bloodshed. Instead, Levis decides to try to tell a bizarre story, relying on special effects in cheap basements on a budget that could have doubled that actors fired pockets for one day. It's weird, although it's cheap and very badly treated (especially with McCabe like Mitchell), a total unusual action is gaining attention. Imagine how this movie could be with a decent budget! All in all, the tension for champagne has the taste of beer.
