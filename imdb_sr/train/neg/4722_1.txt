do not look at this Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda watch this documentary and you will see the facts and the truth http: //imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ Documentary series Death of Yugoslavia (five episodes) was a painstakingly compiled and researched display of an expanded mass bloodshed that marked the end of the old federal Yugoslavia, and it stretched for almost the entire first half of the nineties. This includes a huge wealth of news and interviews with involved parties and "Yugoslav" and others. The only real "progress" that could be made on this incredible achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the Balkans since the program was made. This was actually done at the end of the nineties for repeated broadcasts on BBC television, but the addition of some recent events would help complete this beautiful, detailed and fulfilled job. Maybe another episode might be justified? The very short title of this documentary film was even more convenient because the current Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro abandoned the term "Yugoslavia" - a much late and formal acknowledgment of what happened a few years earlier. /> Do not fiction like in "Yugoslavia: Avoid War (1999)"
