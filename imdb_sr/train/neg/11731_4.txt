As far as I'm concerned, this quiet version of The Merri Vidov is the worst version ever made. About this version there is no gentleness, love or spirituality, it's all creepy, Germanic, stupid stupidity. It reminded me that the Nazis fell in love; Who cares? This quiet version of von Stroheim is not a true adaptation of the original story. In this we listened to John Gilbert and his close relative Prince who crave this stupid American actress, played by Mae Murray, obsessed with a modern hairstyle and incredible feminist manipulation that has repeatedly rejected me again. I like my romance, bright and beautiful, with slow construction; not rude and sadistic like this. And come on, these bees are licking their lips, they're getting rid of them, girls! Take a look at the live show if you want to get a true idea of ​​the sweetness of the original opera by Franz. Lehar. Otherwise, wait until TCM displays the sound version of Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier. It's much better.
