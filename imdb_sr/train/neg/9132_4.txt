Fiendish Plot Dr. Fu Manchua, starring Peter Sellers in cheating the characters created by Sak Rohmer, is unrighteous until the end of his career. The plot was very simple, and if done in the right way, it was nice to work, but instead it was badly done. Part of the reasons why this film was not so good was a bad dialogue, a cheap laugh, an awkward direction and an unpleasant feeling that the movie is somewhat incomplete. Acting, on the other hand, it was the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed picture. I found that Sellers were displaying devious Manchu brilliantly done, with occasional lines to be remembered. For example, there is a scene in which Fu Manchu is confused, and he is a supporter in which he says: "Ah, you all look the same." I hate to admit this, but I laughed loudly through that line. Then, of course, full of powerful auxiliary characters really attracted my attention with people like Helen Mirren as a cop in the background, David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his last movie, too, is not the way to ending his career), and Sid Ceasar (who gives a pretty capricious performance of Al Capone's cousin who works for the FBI). These characters also followed me. The sets were also good. Oriental designs and English society in 1933 show the elegance in this film. Honestly, my advice is to watch a movie if you are Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan. Otherwise, it is better to place it on an aluminum foil.
