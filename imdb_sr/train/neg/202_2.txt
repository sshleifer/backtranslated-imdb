This is not the sound of bees, it is an effect caused by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, bad acting film. As I've always managed to cross all three and a half hours, without falling asleep, I will never know. The action is simple ... 3 completely inaccessible morons talk about sex for 3 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. This is even worse, if possible. > I really need to be a masochist if I can watch this whole movie without turning it off ... or to kill somebody.
