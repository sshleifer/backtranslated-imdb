I really can not understand how anyone could give this disgusting movie more than 1 star ... How can you love such a retarded film, where all the scenes of animal abuse are real? I do not even want to imagine the painful pain that these innocent and helpless living beings felt in those terrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "man" would torture them for no reason, or just for money? I tell you, this director is either mentally behind, or it's just a monster with a "heart" of stone. Or both. He really deserves his hands to cut off and burn alive. It contains various terrible barbaric scenes that can cause shock, especially vulnerable persons and children: the frog's rights are lively, the fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, the dog is beaten, the birds thrown into the water ... <br /> < > This movie is more than horrible; it must be the worst and most demanding film ever made, along with another, called "Cannibal Holocaust" or something like that. I will never watch or buy a movie directed by this soulless monster. No one should waste his time watching him, especially when he has many truly great films, in which all scenes of animal abuse are set. Fortunately, only a few people like this - it's natural, because it's the worst movie ever - so it was not successful. I hope this will lead to the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence against real animals will NEVER be praised, and that all scenes of animal abuse will be organized in the following films. I honestly believe everyone receives, but what they give! It will be a day when all the retarded and cruel "people" will feel the same pain that they have sometimes inflicted on others. It is, however, probably my only "negative" overview. I do not usually comment on a movie if I do not like it, but this time I could not feel it. I had to tell the truth, because the abuse of animals must stop!
