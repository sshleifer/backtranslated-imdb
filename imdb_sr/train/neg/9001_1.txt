When I watch a movie, I am aware that this is "just a movie," but I still like to allow myself to become more occupied in these circumstances. I think that's what makes us cry, scream, laugh, or otherwise emotionally react as members of the audience, although, deep down in ourselves, we know it's just a movie. What I do not want is that the film reminds me that it's just a movie, so I can not get into the film regardless of the quality of the movie. The director of this film has decided to frequently use shots with multiple camera angles at the same time on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I think it's terribly disturbing and really irritating. They could also run a continuous flag at the bottom of the screen: 'Attention: This is just a movie. Do not allow yourself to be too interested or preoccupied. If I want 'image-in-picture', I will activate it from the remote control on the TV, but never during the movie I want to enjoy.
