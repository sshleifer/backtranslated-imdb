Claustrophobic angle cams that do not help the movie: Too long only when you shoot when in most cases you have the feeling that the bottom half of the movie is missing (that the screen is cut off) because it seems that important actions are on it, but you can not see them. There is already too much confusion in the film, so these viewing angles worsen the situation and do not contribute to skilled images. I love artistic films and unconventional work with cameras. I can handle deep and slow movies. But this is trying too hard to be something skilled and can not be painful in my opinion. Nothing can be tied to any character, because they are not well developed. It is necessary to work more characters than just short footage, at least with this set of scenarios + directors + actors. I wonder if there are some of the not-so-good acting scenarios and directors or actors. In the future, I will keep away from the films I wrote and directed by Le Iou. What a boring film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history, and for someone who spent time in Shanghai.
