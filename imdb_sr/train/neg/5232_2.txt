Becky Harris plays a female buyer whose misfortune is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously THE ONLY purpose of being in this movie is to give a reason to get rid of the remote control! It seems to me that Miss Harris is in her fifties or older when she first comes to the scene. When a red-haired bandit ends up with her, it becomes clear that this is not the AARP queen. If these are not some of the best resources ever shown on the celluloid, I want someone to meet me. I want to know if this movie is available on DVD. The rest of this movie is really not worth the significance. I was hoping to see something pretty convincingly and intelligently, but I was disappointed at both points. God bless Becky Harris!
