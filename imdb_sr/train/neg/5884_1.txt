I'm a big movie lover. I love movies of all kinds. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I realized that he carefully follows the book, which raises the point that he does not need to do everything in the movie. Especially because the authenticity of the experiences from the book has been challenged many times. These figures are not strange, they are mentally ill. Things that are happening are not ridiculous; they are disturbing; This movie had a feeling like The Roial Tenenbaums, another movie I hated, only Running Vith Scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny. I will never get you that hour back. I wanted to wash my brain after watching.
