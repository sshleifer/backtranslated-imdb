OK, the box looks promising. Vhoopi Goldberg stands by Dannie Glover, parodying the famous farmer and his wife. Then you will raise this baby into a DVD player and all hopes will be lost in less than five minutes. It should be a comedy. And I must admit that I laughed about ten minutes before the end. This film has the following elements: beaten and abused neighbor, boring court proceedings, racism, the story of lynching, death and burning. Hilarious, huh? No, please, if you never listen to someone's criticism, please do it here. You can not even force yourself to watch this shit. CRAP! I said, CRAP! Whoever put his name on this should really sue.
