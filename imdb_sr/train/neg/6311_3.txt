It's a bad, very bad movie. Well, for real movie people is a good thing. It's not for me. Life is also predictable, bad, nasty, trivial, meaningless, sometimes. Perhaps this is why people say this film is real. Too commonplace places: you are black, you are a criminal, you are condemned and cursed, whatever you do you end up shooting or shooting by someone; Do not allow children to play with weapons; this can be dangerous; and then there are those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... Before this, I did not see such a bad movie. This is perhaps the reason why I never noticed how important photography is in the movie itself. In this, every scene taken during the day, outdoors, is clear and boring blue. They did not even care about correcting the color balance. Oh! So far, I've rated more than 300 movies in this database, and this (3/10) is my lowest ever.
