not your typical story of a vampire, not a stoker or Anne rink here. a true original vampire story. These vampires are genetic mutants that do not bother the sun. They are pure evil. The film is not perfect. many actors are obviously amateurs. Two trains that play outside the helsing and ralli vampire chick are pretty good. the film is intensely violent, which can disturb some people. It is also filled with scientific details that many will find hard to understand and may be bored. I am sold to a smart story and a couple of good performances. we do not know how much this movie could be successful if they had a higher budget and mass distribution
