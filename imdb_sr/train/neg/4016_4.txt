There is a DVD published in the United Kingdom in 2002. With the HRGD002 on the front page, without ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disc, without IFPI code in the inner edge. It does not make much sense to comment on an adult movie. But this contains a minimal plot, and the characters are convincing. It's shown in the US in normal cinemas. I saw him in Pennsylvania in 1975. As such it deserves a place in the encyclopaedia of films. . DVD has no special function and no subtitles and is probably made with VHS tape as a source
