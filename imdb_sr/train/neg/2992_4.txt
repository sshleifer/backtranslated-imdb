In addition to the slasher films of the 1970s and '80s, those of dead dead were probably the second most popular horror sub-genre. While the slasher films had Black Christmas and Halloween to make it all, zombie movements had George Romero's Dead films. And it is not surprising that soon after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to cash in. , known as 'Zombie' in Italy and some other countries, and there Fulci's movie was known as 'Zombie 2'. Except for the dead who walk, it has nothing to do with Romer's film, but it's a good movie in his own right. It was a great success in Europe and nine years later there was a continuation. Pros: Many beautiful, lush landscapes. Avesome score. The acting is not very good, but the acting is a game and it seems to be enjoying the experience. After a slow start, the pace moves as well as the movement movement. A lot of cheese and unintentional pleasure for bad movie lovers. Good work on the effects of makeup. A lot of blood and decent bloody. Lack: Practically less planning. Nothing you've seen before. Blatantly discovers some of the first couple of "Return of the Living Dead" movies. Cartographic signs. It did not grow old due to bad rock music from the 1980s (not to say that all the rock music of that period was bad), clothes and the overall feeling of the film. First of all, this is not a true extension of Fulci's classic classics. In fact, I do not know if she should ever pick up where the movie stopped. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill during the production and eventually left and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Matte films are pretty funny, but like this movie, many are good for entertainment. And that's all that this movie really is, just something to watch from the party. 3.5 / 5 (So-bad-it's good rating) 2/5 (Serious score)
