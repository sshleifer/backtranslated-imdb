I caught this tonight at Shovtime and I was amazed that a movie with such an interesting premise could become so incredibly terrible. WHO IS YOUR DAD? starring Brandon Davis as adopted senior college student Chris Hughes, a geek who inherits the successor of a pornographic empire left by his biological parents. Although the premise sounds like a movie could be fun, it was destroyed by inappropriate director directing Andy Fickman, clich√©s and predictable scenario and acting that even fails to meet the standards of direct video. Even the funniest Charlie Talbert turns into a surprisingly bad performance as the best friend. But Landry is the only good part of this poor and barren dumbbell. 1/10
