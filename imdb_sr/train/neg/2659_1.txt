I'm sorry, but this is horrible. I told people about this movie and some bad actors who are in it and almost do not believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, the modern Japanese troops are retreating back into the days of the Busido warriors and with their modern weapons fit for almost everything. When the troops realize that something strange happens, every person in the back of the transport must say, "Hey, my watch is over"? Imagine such lines that are repeated more than 15 times before they say anything else, and you have a film lack of size.
