Utter dreck. I came to the point of 16 minutes and gave up. I would give her a negative number, if possible (although 'pissible' is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between MacMurrai and Stanvic in the original, the chemistry between the stupid Dicky Crane and what she's just here is not there. The leg becomes an unattractive grain bracelet? No cigar-lighting on your fingers? I thought I would be sick when they had a disastrous look (and that's right, believe me) Lee J. Cobb while Keies practically bore / passed through the explanation of his "Little Man" to Mr. Garloupis. No offense for opaque, but it looks like the pursuit of blind men has gone mad with the default design and houses Dietrichson and Neff. The same goes for those horrible trousers worn by Phillis. And a scream, how much does Neff say he lives above a huge marina? This, people, again, everything takes place in the first 16 minutes. If you can go through more than that, you have a much stronger constitution than me, or you are a masochist. But please, first take Alka-Seltzer, or you will develop your little man who may never go away. Continue with caution, obviously.
