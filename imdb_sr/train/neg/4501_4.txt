True, the setting in Paris is great. Actors are good. The story is a weird game of morality. Should I say that if you want someone bad enough, it's okay to hurt everyone else along? In real romantic, you want to have fewer cliches than a man who has become lazy with his wife and is ready to leave his family, and a woman who is fine to encourage him to do so. So what if they are decent and if Karen Alen shows her body? The characters are still complacent. Maybe these stories have to "get what you deserve". I give it 4, just for the fast scanning potential through "male interest" bits.
