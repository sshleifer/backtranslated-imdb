I did not expect much to get into this, but I was still disappointed. This was my least favorite Halestorm production I saw. I thought it should be a comedy, but I just laughed at 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really funny to watch a fat guy eating a donut and falling over and over again? What about the hostess in the heavenly scene? Fred Villard was hilarious with some of his co-operation with Christopher Guest, but that did not work out. They must have spent all the budget on the fact that the "familiar" actors appeared in this, because there was no budget for lighting. It looked like it was shot with a video camera and most of the scenes were very dark. Does it really take so much movie to show someone that actually shoots and makes a basket, unlike cutting and editing the ball that passes through the basket? I try not to be too critical of low-budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny, go to a real church basketball instead of this movie.
