There are three films with this animation style that I remember from my youth. This film, "The Last Unicorn", "The Dragon Year" and "Hobbit". I own copies of both "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and I have not seen "The Last Unicorn" in more than a decade. It was until today and now I would like to be not. What tortured me most was a script. It was incredibly thrilled and often nervous. Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation. Not here we are talking only about small things; we are talking about the key points of the plot! The story itself is not so great that it could start, but it could have worked that the script was decent. Not even close. On top of that, music was terrible! I know that music in films such as this rarely has what could be called classic parts, but the music in this movie made me pass through by bowling. It was one of those movies I wanted to show to my children one day, but it just got a cut. I do not think I could ever sit over that shit anymore. He's disappointed with the mild words.
