This is a really horrible movie. What they did was record a TV show that never focused on young children and who received the treatment of George Lucas (ie, it got her upset by allowing her to like the younger audience). OK so the TV show Thunderbirds was not the most versatile of the shows, it was actually pretty formal, but it was always fun to watch (especially when the models were blowing in the air) and the voice was bad. This is due to bad casting and bad acting (with the exception of Sophia Miles as Lena Penelope and Ron Cooka as Parker, who seem to be the only team members who have the idea of ​​how their characters should be played) And after this travesty I would not allow direct traffic to Frakes. The whole point of Thunderbird's was that it was the whole family of Traci and how they worked as a team, preventing disasters or rescue. Avoid this trash like a plague. I give only 1 out of 10 because the zero score is not supported.
