From the lonely rows of the already saturated sub-genre 'Hillibilli Horror' comes this sad story about a family on a holiday that is horrified inbred by the Nuns. Sounds familiar? Well, it certainly needs everyone with even lethargic knowledge of the horror genre. Here is absolutely new. The film seems to be satisfactory for recycling all the old exhausted clich√©s (deformed peasants, a peaceful family that killed the killers when it came out, a rebellious daughter, a 'freak' that's good at heart, etc.), but it does even enough half-hearted to make this the ultimate waste of time. This is an unforgettable dreck, but it's witty enough to lead J.D. Hart, who used to play in a film called "Films That Suck" earlier in his career, is a pretty ironic prediction. <br /> <br /> My Rating: D-
