It seems that the Sarafine concept sounded, which is exempt from the music perspective. He tries to combine optimistic African music with a story that describes the terrible conditions and atmosphere that black people have to endure at the time of setting up the movie. The contradictions of each of these two elements are too obvious and the film never justifies the rapid changes between celebrity and terror. If it was simply a drama that reflects these conditions, it might have been a good movie, but the scores of school children that the soldiers had demolished did not sit well next to the songs. Apart from a bad premise, acting is not the best, Goldberg gives a central performance as well as the rest of the acting team. All in all, disappointment. 3/10
