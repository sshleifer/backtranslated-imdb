So I wanted to believe in this film because it is the only form of mainstream comedy that this country recognizes slapstick and stereotypes. Of course, this has gone completely completely otherwise - let's be cool and nervous - and come out. on the other hand, with little to show for it. I bet a little seed has gone crazy for this. I know that SL did. None of the main characters has a comedy to pull it out. Even Danny K had a better timing. I'm really serious. Every time they introduced a bit of character, I thought, "Darn, that person should have been a leader!" Independent does not mean that the camera's work must be terrible. Black and whites did not do anything for this movie - in fact, with such a straightforward dialogue, it was even more hurt by boredom made sharp relief. Black and White were also not clear. The composition was terrible. The use of music was terrible. It's strange that I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this film and the composition on which it was great - maybe that's why the shortcomings in this movie are in my head. before he said anything) spoke to this film, not to David - see it and you will understand. I bet the guys who organized Oppikoppi were upset. A man would have thought that nothing was happening. I have the feeling that he could have been shot in somebody's garden. I know regular guys who have much more fun, louder and funny conversations than any of these "comics". The guy who connected with the end is still fine. I guess the comedy SA will stay in the Stone Age for a little longer. Good guys.
