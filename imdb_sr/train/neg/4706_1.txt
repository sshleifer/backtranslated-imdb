That's right, you heard me this film was a fucking abomination. First, the band, who, damn, will go to see or listen to a band called "NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! Not only is the name terrible, it's also musicians, I can not even play it! Also, the singer sounds like a girlfriend of Geddy Li, and even more his voice is terrible! Not only are they horrible musicians, but horrible actors. Guided by a disgusting director and a tricky plot, this must be the thinnest movie ever. I wish this website enabled you to use ZERO OR LOWER from 10, because giving this dirt 1/10 is too generous. comedy movie. If you are looking for a comedy with music, go to this "Veird Al" Iankovic guy, because he does it much better than these non-aligned tweens.
