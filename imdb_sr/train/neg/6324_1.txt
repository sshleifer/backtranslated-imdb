I spent eight years in the movies of the '80s and' 90s. It was by far the worst movie I ever showed to the public. One thing that made him so bad was that she put into the air an attempt to be an excellent, inspiring movie. Even the great Grgur Peck could not preserve this horrible piece from being far less than the central one. Jamie Lee Curtis, in the early non-horror film role, has clearly shown that she has not yet learned to act (she's still trying, but that does not get much better). I'm sorry, and here's the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament will never happen just because it makes kids scared to play a little baseball league! Even the broadcasts of Nick and the Disney Channel are not stupid enough to try to force us to believe in that duck. It's not worth the movie rental cost; Your dollar would be better spent on an additional microwave popcorn package to go with another movie you chose (because it can only be better than this).
