It makes sense to get this film from Hollywood, because it's just a popular competition in Hollivood. It also makes sense when you think that people who love the movie may only react to countless songs that are being spit upon you, not the content of the story. However, this film is overrated and exaggerated. Eddie Murphi looks funny. There is no way that Jeniffer Hudson and Beionce Knovles give Oscar performance so many have gone too far ahead of the movie. I can not even believe that Kondon was appointed to be nominated for the Oscars, when all he did was compose the album. Glitz does not replace anything. A bunch of songs do not make a movie.
