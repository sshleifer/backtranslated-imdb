I would usually never rent a movie like this, because you know it will be bad just by looking in the box. I rented seven movies at the same time, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Ves Craven's Nev Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I came home, I learned that the video-video gave me the wrong tape. In this box of Ves Craven's New Nightmares I found this lame movie. This film is incredibly boring, the acting is bad and the plot does not make sense. It's difficult to write a good review because I have no idea what it's actually about. At the end of the movie you have more questions and answers. On a scale of 1 to 10 'I Rate This Movie: 1 PS I want to correct Corinthian's review (right below my). He says Robert Englund is scratching his underwear, riding horses, etc. The guy who did this was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not Robert Englund.
