Sometimes the film is so comprehensive that it has a destructive effect on your morale. You start really asking yourself, what does that mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can I honestly expect that we will endure these numerous clich√©s and that we will still be entertained? conflicts and film resolutions. The character needs a gun. He's got a gun. I can not, because he has a gun. First put the gun down. My God, what are we going to do? He's got a gun! He waves it, it acts more malevolently than human beings do. He pushed him into his face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The hallmark of each conclusion will be the comforting sound of the police sirens. It's a real challenge to recreate such a tired formula; the film must be very smart and well executed. This is neither one nor the other. She has no life and no personality, and she will suck these components out of you. It will make you feel FRESH when you live in the time and space you are working on. Really, who needs it? So, yes, I'll say: I think this is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Anyone who has participated in the creation of this garbage dump should be a public disgrace for the harm that they have done to all of us.
