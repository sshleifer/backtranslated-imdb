I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more, because it was a Yashraj movie. Jimmy manages the call center and one day he calls Pooja Singh to teach his boss, Lakhan Singh, English. The two of them fall in love and decide to escape, but Pooja tells Jimmy that she can not do it because she owes Lanaan Singh, also known as Bhaiiiaji. But they decide and steal money from him, and only then Jimmy finds out that Bhaiiiaji / Lakhan Singh Don. In the meantime, Bhaiiii hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to find Jimmy and Pooja. In the main role of Saif Ali Ali Khan, Kareene Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaie Kumar, the film was directed for the first time by director Viai Krishna Acharia was also produced by Aditia Chopra and Iash Chopra. "Tashan" must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes! The scenario is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her great weight loss) looks good. But the plot is a very thin story and sometimes it does not make sense from one scene to another - that's why I initially said that I expected more of this film because it was the production of Yashraj. When it comes to songs, unfortunately, there is no song I can remember now. There are moments in which you can laugh, which is largely thanks to Aksha Kumar and Saif definitely better, while Kareena Kapor has played a good role. But this can not be said about Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain. And last but not least, Aditia Chopra, who in the past produced and directed good films such as "Mohabbatein", what did Iash Chopra do by producing such a movie? Conclusion: A bad movie, it's not worth wasting time, and that's my first and last impression.
