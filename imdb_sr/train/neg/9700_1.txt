I agree with most other guys. Losing photons and precious time. It's almost not worth the joke on which the paper is written. The only accent in my bandage is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Valdsterben") This is reminiscent of the old times with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe the appearances of actors, as it seems that most of them do not enjoy production and only "do their thing". The camera is fine, the plot is ridiculous, I think it would be a shame even if you talk about this with a lot of beer. Besides, I was constantly yelling, I wondered how such a script might be My nine year old son was pleased, but then he is satisfied so little in this age :-) <br /> <br /> In any case, score 1 points here is almost 1 point too ...
