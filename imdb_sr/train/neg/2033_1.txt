If I could give less than that. Do not bother to rent; If somebody gave you a DVD. This is terrible filming movies. A complete waste of even a digital "movie." I've seen better at Ioutube since 12 years. Lommel claims that he wrote this, if this is the case, it is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The story line does not exist, the dialogue is mostly screaming, camera work is some sort of attempts by artistic flyers with meaningless cutting of completely unrelated jumps with any industrial transport scenes or some strange angry breakup of a young woman. I can usually follow a less obvious plot or see the purpose in a "creative" movie - I like David Linch. This is either far above my limited power of understanding that I missed or is it totally meaningless. I think this is "to see if we can soon win a title that will appear soon and make a strange split on it and see if we can catch a piece of work." I can not see why Lionsgate generally worried about it. It's totally worthless, it's so bad that I will not rent any other of this same director.
