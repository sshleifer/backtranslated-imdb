Sometimes I rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killers of sharks and / or crocodiles are still made. They've been making these crappy copies since the '70s, it's not like they like it any more. The idea is still the same. We have an animal that starts killing people. Firstly, some secondary characters are taken off, and then they begin to attack the main characters, who usually play several of the titans, except for someone who was once a little more familiar, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before others kill an animal in some way, usually an explosion. Then, we usually get the last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc. Unless you count on the fact that a "specialist" is a captain in this variation, in that case your standards are quite low. It's funny that he played Duncan Regehr, but he was totally Zorro. Give him a bonus point for it.
