I have to admit that you saw a few sweets in your time, but this is worse with the worst. It's troubling to follow. Sex and violence are embedded in disoriented and disgusting with a really bad movie. I can only imagine that the actors will look at the end product and want to collect dust on the shelf not be disturbed for a generation or two. Unfortunately, in my case, I have a DVD. He'll sit on the shelf and watch me from time to time.
