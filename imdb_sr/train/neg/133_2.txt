The reason I saw it in the movie was that it was a brief overview, otherwise I would never see this horrible teenage movie. I mean, do not we have enough of this yet? Scream and Scari Movie at least did not take them seriously! Action is bullshit, and acting is the worst I've ever seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only film that compete in what's the worst I've ever seen in a movie with this.) The girls are so similar that you are not killed now, and who is not. The only thing I knew in advance was Denise, and she was the most talented little actress I've ever seen in this bad pronunciation for the film. Stay as far away from this movie. (2/10)
