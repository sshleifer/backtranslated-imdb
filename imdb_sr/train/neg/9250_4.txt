A disappointing, predictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she can not maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre 'Anywhere but here' in the lead role, Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better insight into the relationship between mother and daughter. She's acting better.
