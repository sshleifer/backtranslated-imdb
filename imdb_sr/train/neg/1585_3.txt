::: SPOILER ALERT ::: Okay, Arnie is a really good guy, but after an incident with some combat in a helicopter and some disobedience orders, he was sent to a prison (or rather a working camp) . He ran away, but after a short time he was caught again. This time ends in a strange reality in which it should run for a while from a bunch of hard guys with different topics, and eventually dies. But we all know Arnie, and we all know he's stronger than even the toughest of the rough guys. I really wanted to love this movie, like Arnie-fan and all that. However, the "Runner" contains too much flaw that really nerves me. E.g. Reconstruction of Arnie's battle inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience showed a brief summary of the incident, along with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie was flying was equipped with almost 10 cameras that recorded crew members, one of which was in the eyes of one of the Arnie crew members. There are other flaws and complications that seem to be very interesting and innovative in theory, acting for some time, and then in some ways creates a pool of stupidity and unrealism in which it dips. The act can not really be said to be a bit better than a couple, with Arnie's leading role, doing an average Arnie performance. The rest of the actors pass without being particularly good or bad. Special effects are fine and not impressive. RATING: 3/10
