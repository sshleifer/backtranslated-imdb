If you really want to spend two hours of your life, do the following: 1) Check the TV listings. 2) Find the movie 'People in White'. 3) When 'People in White' appear, sit and watch. And that's it. After you pass through two hours of bad games, terrible (and not so funny) references in the movie, and experience something with the lowest possible production values ​​ever made in recent history, you've lost two hours of your life and wondering why. / / Why I did it? I was stupid enough to think this movie could be good. But, on the other hand, if you are old enough to remember the Power Rangers, you may see some familiar faces in the film. Probably to save on production costs, Shaban (who also makes Powers Rangers) decided to freely spray old monster costumes from the favorite toys franchises during the film. I noticed a lot of old monsters from the episodes I've seen from a little, so I guess at least it can be said to have some nostalgic value. But if you want to see the real power of the Rangers Monster, watch Power Rangers. It's much better than this piece of garbage. (And it says something!)
