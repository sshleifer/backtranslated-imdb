This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I can not really remember when I saw a worse movie. I thought it would be related to the investigation of a plane crash. What actually was a soap opera, and it's bad in that. They overrun the extreme 'conflict' map. The first hour seems to match, and some incredible scenes are inserted. Possible spoiler * 40-minute 'memorial' scenes (with the needed black umbrellas and rain) fictitious collision victims was chrome, and I thought it would never end . Avoid this at all costs, unless you enjoy the 'conflict'. <br /> <br />
