Come on, what's the matter with this show, Pover Rangers? I always felt that the show, originally brought from Japan in better shape, took what was great in Japan, and turned into one of the happiest and senseless pronouncements in the history of toy brands! It absolutely makes no sense in this show. Bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings, etc., All this shows what was funny in the nineties From two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to "ghosts", the main actors, Jason, Trinity, Tommy , Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: GIVE ME ME! Saban brought this from Japan, and then Disney bought the rights to this show about five years ago. Now the public has to withstand the reprise of this show on the Disney Channel and the like. Everything I can say once give me some rest!
