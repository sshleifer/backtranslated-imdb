I just rent (yes! I paid the money to see!) This movie. OMG. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As the other reviewer said, Ms. Colagrande, get out of the movies, PLEASE! Please do not make or appear in another movie! The lady has the charisma of melon. No, it's not fair to the cantaloupes, which probably has more to do. She does not know how she behaves; it affects the disgusting view of ALL TIME (he reminded me of my always disgusting young sisters in Europe). She is not charming; she's not pretty. There is no real story. And editing! It was not there that I could see! It's pretty bad when you watch a movie and just to go through it, press "forward" on the remote control, and STILL does nothing! I think! ..... I was innocent screaming, "Cut! Cut!" What did they think? Well, obviously, they thought they would make a movie together and pay to make love on the screen! Very good job for them; pretty raw for the viewer! I think I'll vomit now.
