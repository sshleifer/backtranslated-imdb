* SOILER * It's fake! The whole thing is a fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is the Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants a castle and his title for himself. So, he is putting this overly complicated and unnecessary senseless plan, like SCOOBI-DOO to trigger Alan to commit suicide. The bulk of the movie is to pick up redheads and attack them. He does not even kill them. He goes to sleep, and the girl disappears and thinks he was buried somewhere. If he looked at the so-called Evelyn spirit, he could say he was wearing gloves! My God, what a waste of time. Do not try to look, rent, and if you have bought it and have not watched it yet, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from Evelyn's Evening which came out of the grave. I'm giving this stinker CRAP-O-LANTERN.
