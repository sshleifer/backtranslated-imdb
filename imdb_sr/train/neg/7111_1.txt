- The young couple is moving into the house of a dead ex-woman's husband. Shortly thereafter, a new woman begins to feel that someone does not want to be at home. She sees the skull all over the house. But when a husband is investigating, he can not find anything. Is anyone trying to get back to the asylum from which she was recently released? Or, does the spirit of a dead woman try to get the new woman out of her house? - This is the first time I've watched the Screaming Skull without the help of MST3K crew. And it will, in all likelihood, be the last time to look at him in this way. Can you say it's boring? I'm not talking about a common dull - I'm saying I'm watching the grass getting boring. There is a big part of the film in which nothing is happening. The screen could be emptied and I would get more fun out of it. The characters run and continue with the most monotonous conversations you can imagine. The screaming skull could possibly be sold as a sleeping assistant. - The actors do not help much. Most deliver them with convincing lines that are usually reserved for school play. I did not look at it, but I would be shocked to discover that anyone associated with this movie has ever appeared in any movie value. I will not even enter the script with which the actors are made. Let's just say that the characters got some of the idiotic lines that were ever spoken on the film. - You are warned! Or avoid this at all costs or, at least, look for the MST3K version.
