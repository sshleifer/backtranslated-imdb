At the beginning of the film, beautiful photos and fox scenes were amazing. However, the story was so slow and boring. And then the girl begins to house a fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and we often see handcuffs. One thing everyone should know is to leave wild animals wild and enjoy them from afar. This film is a terrific example for children to watch, trying to create a wild creature in a pet. I do not know what the purpose of the story was. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the girl still wanted to play with the sets. Does not he ever teach his lesson? There are other scenes that show animals to the fox's predators, which only increases the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie. What a disappointment is this film. And what a terrible story it is. The final dialogue was so stupid, when my wife and I screamed on TV! I absolutely hated this movie and I would never recommend it to anyone!
