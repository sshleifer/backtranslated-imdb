One of the worst films I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, Fan is a meaningless cliche of exercise in racing. He tries to turn or execute a genre with a senseless plot of crazy fans who have become psychotic - the movie bubbles into nothing. We must believe that an idiot who has a knife has access to and kills a baseball player in a luxurious hotel without witnesses, security or cameras? The film is nonsense trying to drag us into the heart of a wire through a baseball game that ends with a mockingly unsophisticated and deceptive one. I'm not sure what all the actors thought when they came to this show. This is a big thing as they come. Stay away if you like it in movies
