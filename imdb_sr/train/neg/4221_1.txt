As Francis Veber, one of the best comedian directors in the world (at least when he keeps his native France), succeeded in turning a movie that is so inconspicuous, it is beyond the mere fact that a deadly man can recognize. It's not just about the fact that the characters are so unsuitable or that the film is so completely devoid of even the lowest form of humor: it's genuinely physically painful to watch, the endless parade of incompetent writing, acting and filming a movie that you can not believe is the work of experienced and talented film makers. She once spent almost eternity in the cutting room and on the shelf before her theater play was blinking and flawed. What did they think?
