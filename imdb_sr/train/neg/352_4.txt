It seems that actors should provide at least an average film. And so I sat for 102 minutes of unbelief. In addition to Ed Harris, no one seems to own the acting skills. Even Sean Conneri, whom I usually adore, had to have a free day during the entire recording of Just Case. No film actor could convince me once during the whole movie. This made this film cheap and unreal. It's exciting, and the action is unexpected. Conclusion Just watch this movie if you really do not have anything more useful.
