I love movies at the end of the day. I love B-movies. I was hoping to love this movie. I could ignore the bad effects, often terrible music, the lines that cause the bruising. I could ignore unexplained events, and the fact that the film is constantly relying on a deux ek machina can be justified, given the topic. I could ignore the fact that people who are struggling to starve and try to get to the world peace are bad guys. None of these things kill a movie. What kills this movie is that it's easy and simply boring. Nothing really happens; almost all the scenes in the movie are designed to push the viewers' moral to viewers, at the cost of a real coherent story, or any uncertainty. If you are looking for fun B-film, look somewhere else. This movie is just boring.
