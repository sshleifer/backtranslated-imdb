This film is the worst movie, but it's very tall for me. So it should be a movie. This is happening at a university where there seems to be only a handful of students. The teachers are stupid than the hammer bag. It's full of a good Catholic priest, sexually suppressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialog was so cliched that it was hard to believe that I was able to predict the lines in the quotation marks. The hair has the creativity and it seems that they are turning around the sting of people in the genitals. The lack of continuity in the soundtrack and the characters that deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for fun. Get a cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh.
