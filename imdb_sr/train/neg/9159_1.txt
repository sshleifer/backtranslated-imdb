If the author gives 2 credits before the main title and another 15 credits before the movie starts, and the first shot shows that the author is moving on a bed in short pants for a bike, there will be no surprise to see that the author has that kind of body that is never can not see in the spandex. A type of look that could be useful to a homosexual repulsion therapist. Others have given this thing what they deserve. For me, the saddest moment came when the trip from LA was marked with an airplane that landed on what looked like LAKS; and return is marked with a photo of Fedek's cargo plane.
