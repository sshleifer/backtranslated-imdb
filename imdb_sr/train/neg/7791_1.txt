I saw the original German version and I was not surprised how bad this movie really was. Thinking that I saw my share of bad films like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake, and so on, could not prepare me for this! It was really pain to try through this movie, as there is no complication, no good acting, even special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies, wearing nothing more than white makeup and their old clothes, so their good set will not be destroyed stains from ketchup and marmalade. If you really want to spend 90 minutes of your life, then watch it, for everyone else, do not do it, because you will regret it!
