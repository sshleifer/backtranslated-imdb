Disney? What happened? I really want the movie to be set in the sixties, like the book. And I could really deal with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for more precise adaptation ... I'm glad that someone may be under the influence of reading books ... A man with red eyes who can be replaced as an IT? And what about volcanic uprisings? Where is this in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! In the long run (1978) I heard that there is a European version of this film. I wish I could identify it. I can only imagine that this could be closer to the real story of this poor adaptation. This movie should be CSD.
