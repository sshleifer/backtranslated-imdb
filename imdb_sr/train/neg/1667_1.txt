I actually loved this movie to the end. Certainly, it was syrusly and quite incredible, but it still kept my attention to the rainy afternoon. To the end, that is. For her final appearance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she struggled to compensate other classically trained students, what's the main character doing? With their understanding and performance of this time, their vocal musical traditions? She is struggling with the collapse of the great sensational Habanera of Carmen and turns her into a completely forgotten Brittany Spears-vannabe pop song. My ears bleed! And, at the height of the moment of horror, her teachers stood ovation! Any teacher who was not in Spears' fantasy would not have succeeded on the spot. Save time, save your ears - skip this movie!
