Interestingly, the season 6 in the Columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two scenarios, based on this exit for "man-in-the-mac" and "Fade in Murder". Moreover, it is no coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman wrote both scenarios (accidentally playing the role of the killed guard here). This adventure is very seldom convincing and many artists seem uninterested in the material. The story is rather poorly developed with some long periods of boring conversation. Columbo is also overshadowed by colleagues here (similar to "Last Salute on Commodore"), but the fun value is minimal. Additionally, Celesta's Holma characteristic, which is intended to provide comedy, provokes shame, and must not. The scenario takes place to deal with a family history and the killer makes enough to give the Columbo case. Although she can never talk about the motives of her crime. Ironically, what turns out, undoubtedly, Columbus's worst adventure produces the most amusing moment in the series. He is examining a male hairdresser and has a hairstyle / manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes is hilarious - it's just that Columb's hair is so perfectly nurtured, then it can not afford to pay the bill, and then, when asked in goldsmiths, he constantly looks into the mirror to admire his hairstyle! /> Unfortunately, this is the only decent moment from the script that looks like it was collected in ten minutes. Only for Columbo.
