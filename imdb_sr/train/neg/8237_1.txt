How, in the name of everything that is sacred, did this film ever get distribution? It looks like it was shot on someone's cell phone and takes a scenario of screaming a girl's victim to a completely new depth. They literally scream for a full 90 minutes of film. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no characters, no much acting. Just screaming and screaming. I quit after fifteen minutes and quickly ran over to see if anything had happened. Of course - do not scream. It is enough that the act of passing through this accelerated forward emphasizes another problem - there is no work on the camera. Every shot looks like every other bullet - medium distance, one angle, blunt, blunt, DULL. Not so bad that it is good. It's just bad.
