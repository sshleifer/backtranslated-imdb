If I have to give this film a linear scale, then I have to give a low score of 3/10. But it was fun, and there are several good things to say about Psychiatrist Candidate James Bishop was assigned to St. Andrevs for his tenant, and he abandoned himself and eager to "change the world". From the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital hides the evil truth, but James thinks he can make a difference and does not recognize this evil. The story builds pretty well, you know all the time that there is a truth in what patients are talking about about some evil apartment, and wonder when and how James will discover this. Also, when a break comes, James is in some way hunted by evil, and you feel some uncertainty until the "fight" is over. other standard elements of horror, and you get the picture. Creating a character is actually pretty good, you are familiar with the majority of people who are killed, some of them "get to know you". Br /> Film sets an unpleasant scene, and it's pretty good. There are mysteries that have been discovered - in an acceptable way. The main character, James is very convincing - the story of a eager student who starts working is good in this environment. <br /> <br> What kills this movie is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of "Plan 9 from the Universe" - a type of bad (evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad acting (or probably very little film taking) The main characters sometimes behave badly and sometimes good. * The sound is sometimes very cheap. I constantly thought "I could make a movie like this with my home video camera" during the whole movie.
