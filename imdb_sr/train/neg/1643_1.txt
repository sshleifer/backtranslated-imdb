"Vhipped" is one of the most terrible films of all time. It's a nasty, disgusting garbage that made me stay in the theater more than any other 2000 film, except perhaps "Grincha". It's not, as people called it, an insightful portrait of modern relationships. It would be a small movie called "High Fidelity". While the film was honest and sympathetic, "whipped cream" is an enigmatic, cynical, misanthropic kinematic poison. Avoid this as a lot of monsters, unless you want to see that it's really a bad "comedy."
