This is a really horrible movie. I write this only for some people to postpone watching. If I stopped one person from losing their precious life by watching this movie, I will die happy. Undoubtedly boring, though since Al Pacino was playing, I was cheated thinking that at any moment something interesting would happen. Then the loans turned, and I realized that I was totally deceived by watching this incredible nonsense. I can not believe that this film achieved such a high score as it was on the IMDb (over 5 stars when I last voted video). Did you ironically vote? Please, please do not watch this movie!
