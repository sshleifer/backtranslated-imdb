or anyone who's been praying to see Al Cliver wrestling a naked, 7ft tall black man in full Nelson, your movie has arrived! Film starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) was kidnapped by a group seeking a $ 6 million redemption for their shelter on the island. What they do not count is that the wind Peter Weston (Cliver) is engaged by the producer to save the girl. And what they really did not count on was a local tribe that likes to offer young women their own monstrous Cannibal god with bloody eyes of bugs. Almost the same recording set as CANNIBALS, this is a bit better when it comes to fun value, thanks, above all, to the hilarious dub of the song and the impossible stupid monster with a prominent eye (Franco confirms that ping pong balls are divided on an interview on a disc). Franco gets strong support in the EuroCult, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Verner Pochath (whose death is one of the toughest things I've ever seen as a guy who is not completely shown) - in an attempt to be him). The film contains nudges of nudity, and there is also color (variety Tempra colors). The climax for me was the slow clash between Clive and Antonio de Cabo in spraying waves. Unfortunately, the old Jess pulled this one into an astonishing (and sometimes, painful) one hour and 40 minutes when it should have exceeded 80 minutes. By and large, Severin DVD looks pretty nice, but there are some weird images that happen during some darker scenes. Also, a long part of the dialogue is in Spanish without any sub (they are an option, but only when you listen to the French numeral). Franco gives a nice 16-minute film interview and has much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.
