This film is about a cop (Ching Van Lau) who is trying to catch a super-smart thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmailing an insurance company headed by Kelly Lin. In essence, regardless of the plans that a policeman tries with a thief, he knows them in advance. This film, covered by handsome actors, the beautiful main actress and good recordings of cameras in Hong Kong, does not really have any substance. Everything is flashing, and the flash quickly becomes blunt. I lost all my interests for a third of the time in the movie, and after that there is no quality to buy, except cinema, which looks good. Think about watching this movie only if you can do it for free. Also, consider stopping watching the movie for 20 minutes in the movie because it's all the way: BORING. 6/10
