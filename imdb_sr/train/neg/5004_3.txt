This is ironic because this movie was out for a while I think someone just JUST examined it a few days ago. Anyway, I watched this movie simply because it was Nick Stahl, for recording. / / The movie was ridiculous. The characters brought me INSANA, they were SO Cliche and STEREOTIPED. This film had some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard. And that was too complicated. In the film there is a scene worth seeing, but the scene: "Warm heart, cold pistol" where Nick Stahl kills an unpleasant girl in the shower. (Well, in fact, they were all disgusting.) But his acting in that scene was great. The expression on his face, he reminded me of my American psyche (good movie). The scene is worth a look, but it's not worth watching the rest of the movie, do yourself a favor and do not look at it.
