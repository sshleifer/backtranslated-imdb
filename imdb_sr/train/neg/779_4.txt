Seriously, I think very seriously, when I first started watching the show, I thought it was good. But the plots only worsened. The story was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes stupid. His jokes are exaggerated. His mom is the dumbest figure of the show. As a mother can do so with her son, it's okay that she is a daughter-in-law, but that was her son. I'm giving this show 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny. Actors Constance Marie and Masiel Lusha are doing a great job. I do not know how these shows are played so long. If you are really bored like me and have nothing else to look at, I suggest you look at this.
