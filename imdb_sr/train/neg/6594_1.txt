I've seen most, if not all, Laurel & Hardy classic movies. I always enjoyed comically stupid there, even after I looked over and over again. This new film is trying to return a classic with two new Lorel and Hardy actors, but unsuccessfully for various reasons. One of them is that their cloths (even in the early 20th century) are unreasonable, but both are shown in the environment of the nineties. Some of the previous dialogues have been restored, but also unsuccessfully approaching the classic series. This movie could be the worst movie I've ever seen and should be taken off the shelf and locked forever. True Laurel and Hardy are hesitant in their graves on such a bad imitation.
