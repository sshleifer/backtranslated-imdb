Be warned: Neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play the main role as a poster would like to believe. Their roles are essentially smaller. The film stumbles between an exaggerated comedy and a realistic drama, none of which is really interesting. It is especially impossible for me to get a lot of sympathy for the main protagonist, not to mention his silly friends and sexually obsessed fianc√©e. The action is drastically retreating, and I turned this after 2/3 - unusual for me, because I like to finish what I'm starting. Good acting and a nice item from 1 to 2 stars. 2/10
