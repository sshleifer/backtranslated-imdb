I have great tolerance towards strange, but honestly speaking, some movies that go far, far from weird - so far they have made your brain hurt. This is such a movie. Trying to understand this or even explain it is impossible, and I think the film is best understood as we take drugs - that's incomprehensible. The film begins with a very sweet Japanese animation that includes a cat. However, from the blue there are tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things - why am I wondering if I lose something in translation? However, even if this is so, why did we have to deal with the images of a magic trick that involves clearing the ladies with smart, defective, shooting, burning animals, etc. Strange, and I do not know why, some see it as a genius job. I just do not understand.
