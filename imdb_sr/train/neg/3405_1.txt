I can not believe how this film is uneducated. It's like watching a police academy, except that it's with people who have no idea what they're talking about, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot to be an assistant. I can understand the suspension of disbelief, but this is just a complete nonsense. Not only does there have been complications for this movie. It's like looking at someone who pretends to be a doctor, throwing non-medical words as if they were the chief of staff in a large medical institution. Plus, people wear clothes that are not suitable for the space program. I feel like watching movie "b" in the valley-girlfriend, in the universe.
