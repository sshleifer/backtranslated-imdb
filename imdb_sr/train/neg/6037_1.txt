Moron and the girl spend a ritual in order to resurrect the dead, in an attempt to prove that the dead can not be restored to life. It is not surprising that they resurrect the dead soul that starts them with an ax, and the next day some people in high school tell the story about the camp fire. The guy with the ax appears and begins to hack idiots telling the story. The group calls the cops, the policeman sees that the blood is spattered and thinks it is a mountain lion (!?), And soon afterwards some deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost. Moronic small film that was shot in the middle of a white day, but several characters carry lamps and a story like it is in the middle of the night, and wanting to send a signal torch to attract attention. One guy has a pistol in one hand and bullets in the other, but he does not bother to insert it, and after he finally fills it, he has several opportunities to kill the killer, but he does not bother, because that would end the movie too soon. Then he throws a gun! They are also harmful characters that do not show emotions and do not look the least worried after their friends are chopped to pieces and bad effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, a car that was blown eventually was clearly a car model) and a terrible dialogue and some really ugly female nudes do not help. And in the end, he tries to get out with his inconsistency, saying that it was all the invention of the same people from the college who talked about the campfire at the beginning of this film. Then the killer appeared in the real situation in the last scene that smashed them to pieces. Again. Medium is kind, good just for some unwanted laughs. 1/2 of ****
