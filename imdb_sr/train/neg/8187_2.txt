I went to this film, expecting it to be really divine. And that's it. Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... before she filmed this movie - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual, but Miranda Richardson could not put one of the great performances I know and love her. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (including, among others, Dillie's Vicar), had about one line. The action was predictable and everywhere, and the humor was ... missed. (However, there was a part of the film in which Santa Claus enters the house of the Jewish family ... because of which I laughed only because their expressions were classical). a collision with a train (in fact - maybe the train would be better ...)
