Everything about this movie was terrible. To begin with, this film had a pretty good role and it seems impossible to make such a great role in the greatest disaster of the genre of gangster film ever. The soundtrack was one of the very bad comedies. She had this music through the whole movie and she started to be pretty irritating. <br /> <br />
