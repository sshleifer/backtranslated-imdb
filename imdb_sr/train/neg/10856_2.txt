Look, I will not lie to you, but I received this film for only $ 3.99 from my friend because he had Danny Filth, lead singer of the popular death metal band "Cradle Of Filth". Of course, I expected violence and blood in the best edition, because that's what Mr. Filth can display as one of the lines of complication. But dear God, I was oh so wrong. This film seriously bites. Since a low-budget movie (haha, wait, make a ZERO BUDGET), this obviously does not have a beautiful orchestra Hovard Stern orchestra and Spielberg special effects. No, it's all one camera, bad corners and bad blood stages. Take, for example, when our star and violent fellow, Mr Filth, violently kills the robber. He caught his throat, and the blood spilled, but oh, it seems that the packing of juice is filled with false blood in a man's shirt. For you cradle lovers: You will feel. two songs during the film, but with the corners of the camera and bad recording, draw the overall pleasure of the song DOVN. My last comment: Get far away from it. It's blood, blood, breasts, and hey, even a bad story to go with her. So, if you love terrible violence, with no votes (yes, there are almost no words in this movie), then be sure to buy. But if bad movies are not your thing, then avoid it. Do not spend money.
