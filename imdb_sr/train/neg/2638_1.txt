Good. It is bad. And then their "Sentinel", a political "thriller" that is among the worst movies I've ever seen. The mole plot in the Secret Service is good, but never had a movie with so much potential that was so scandalous. Directed by Clark Johnson's "dirty", every actor in this movie seems to be working on an autopilot. Even the big Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say that NEVER, during my entire life, I have not watched yet another movie with so many hideous holes in riddles. The inspiration is predictable from the square, and the character's motives are so absurd that the audience inspired the laughter. Avoid this at all costs. This is a catastrophe of the film without any value.
