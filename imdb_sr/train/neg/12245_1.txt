Why, why? ... did I pick up this? Well ... I needed a light heat, and the lid looked cool. Of course I should know better. This is a really, really bad movie. And it becomes worrying when manufacturers know it's bad, and try to hide it by adding some sexy / beautiful women and some sex scenes. Well, folks ... it did not cut him, did he? If you would like a cool movie about a great reptile that is actually very, very good, well-played and fun: rent Lake Placid! (this is an order)
