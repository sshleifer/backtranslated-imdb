This performance is boring, lame, and essentially discredits all kinds of things to be "original". First: the animation is so ugly ... Johnny is disgusting ... and they're all boring. The twins look like Girls Dectors from Decker's Laboratory, and Johnny is a more intelligent man Dee Dee (also from Decker's Laboratory). The gags are runny, and nothing really makes me laugh a little ... especially when it's trying to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but they turned me off. Third: The whole song begins with ripping melody at Green Dai's "American Idiot". And while I'm not a big fan of this band, I think it's really stupid to take the same opening tone and then subtly change, to make it their own. Case in fact ... it's a big thick ugly borehole. 1/10
