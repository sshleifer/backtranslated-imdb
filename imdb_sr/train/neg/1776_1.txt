This film has its negative comments and I have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst films ever recorded. True, most films based on royal works are pretty bad, but this goes beyond the horrors of the kingdom. There is no terrible moment in it, unless you think stupidity is scary. It's a typical royal garbage - myths that turn around without any sense, blended with obvious and so-called "fears" that are shocking as PeeVee's Plaihouse (which is at least funny). There are a lot of funny moments, of which the smallest figure is Alice Krige. When he goes to the rampage and begins to boast as a criminal in an old television show Batman, it's so absurd that it is troubling. All the people who have comedy (including John Landis) in this have the luck that they still have a career. But the absurd part must be a costume for cats to the end, which looks like cheap rubber clothes someone bought in K-Mart. The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats that actually cast people in the movie.
