I do not know about you, but I've always felt attractive for the "ART" cinema. The first 'art' film I managed to get was Peter Greenavai's "Cook, thief, his wife and her lover," who took my mind and creative spirit into the hustle and bustle. The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque ... it was about "an artistic film," exploring the intellectual ideas and the purpose of bringing visceral to the screen. Life, real life, can be like living in a madness, and the pronounced art shows it for what it is. I love movies of all kinds, but especially those that both entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with his attitude or not ... "8 1/2 WOMEN" is a dry, clinical ' comedy 'where father and son are gathering harem to fulfill their numerous sexual fantasies. There is only a very brief allusion to Fellini in the film, unlike what templates have suggested. The main focus of the film is on the 'close' relationship between father and son, gathered after his mother's death. In the early stages of the film, the father's sadness is convincing, you can feel his pain. What is happening later is according to the Greenavai standards, gathering harems, observations of love and death, and meat shown in the name of meat ... It might be argued about it, but I think the film is shallow and meaningless. And the idea that this could be a comedy is confusing me. Most of the acting, if good, ... Polly Valker and Amanda Plummer are particularly well-off (although the poor Mandi should return) What is missing is a convincing story, and the usual Greenavai surplus touches that made his other films so beautiful to watch. While filled with moments of insight and occasional taboo, the "8 1/2 Women" is too cut and glued to be considered art, too stupid to be considered "ridiculous" and simply too boring Save my money ... I can recommend this movie as a sleeping assistant. 4 of 10
