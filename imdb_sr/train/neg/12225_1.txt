My personal hell of hell is locked in the room without the possibility of closing my eyes or blocking my ears and watching this film forever on all the available surfaces in that room. The whole idea that the Streisand play of a boy / boy begins to scratch the surface of the silly premise of this film. The most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of "willing suspicion of unbelief". . . it's impossible to do this in this movie.
