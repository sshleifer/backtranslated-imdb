I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would be working on such a movie. I could not believe other reviews and I thought it would not be bad to watch it at least once ... but believe me, it is. I did not see the old movie. or why they would like to re-create a movie like this one. The basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is whether it should have an extremely intelligent scenario or be extremely graphic. This film does not belong to any of them and just remains stupid. I just watched the movie hoping to be interesting at some point, but it never does. So, this movie is great not, not only for Horror Filmmakers, but for lovers of Cage. He could probably appear on television.
