I think this film should be shocking. But the only way it's really shocking is that it's shockingly made ... and it's simple. It's an hour and a lot of trouble. Even more for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (five girls). Surely the main characters got their bloody piece in a bad way, which is essentially fine, because it's horror - a movie. And I (I usually) love horror films. I have no problem with violence in such films per se. However, all violence in this film makes no sense. It's not a spectacle except that it's just grotesque. It's so miserable that it's even boring, and very fast. The worst thing (if the above is not enough for you) regarding this movie is that they tried to copy Blair Vhitch. Project, shooting with cheap handheld cameras. But (again, this also has no end). In "Blair who", of course, there is an explanation, namely, that those with a camera are looking for a witch. In this film there is no other explanation than: "Hey, we wanted this to look like Blair Vhitch!" Sound in the movie is something to be done about. Girls scream so hysterically that you can not understand what they say many times. Also, there is no effort to do anything better, audibly or otherwise. Then, there is also a soundtrack, which is as bad as the rest, and varies from a cheap euro house to the worst grungi hard-rock ... My advice: Do not look at this under PRIVATE circumstances.
