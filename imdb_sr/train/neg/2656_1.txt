(Very light spoilers, maybe.) Usually the fan is Diane Keaton, I tried to watch this tonight. I had to turn it off before the second hour because I found myself without absolute sympathy for my daughter or mother. They both came to complacency with a little respect for others, and her daughter added rude, dishonest and ruthlessly to the mix. When my daughter died, the only thing I thought was: "At least we will not have to watch her at all." Keaton did a good job of moving to his amazement and sadness, but by then it was far too far for me. I just did not enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want to take care of the protagonist, you have to worry about the characters much earlier - if it's almost an hour in and I do not care, it's too late. The cast was honest and well-played - I felt towards them! * - and the best gay friend was wonderful, but even combined, it was not enough to take a movie for me.
