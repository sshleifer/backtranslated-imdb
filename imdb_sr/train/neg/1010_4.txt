I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman, so it looked promising. And it was, until Justin Timberlake did not come to the scene. He's a really bad actor and should not be allowed to film the film again. I mean, he's one of the lonely actors I've ever seen. He does not put absolutely any emotion into any of his lines. Why the hell did he cast Josh Pollack's role? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice. Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so boring that he looks like a bad combination of his character in American Beauti and John Doe in Se7en. It may sound cool, but believe me, it's not. Now, the acting Dylan McDermott is very good. It's one of a few good things about this movie. It's just inspired. Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. Although it has some really cool lines. About this story, although it was a little obvious and sometimes excessive, it was good. I expected a big turn when Dylan McDermott was killed, but nothing happened.
