There is a reason why this went directly to the video - the story is frivolous, Nick Cage plays Johnny in the midsummer way of chapel sex, and other scenes that borders with a devious (as a scene in the laundry) this film. Judge Reinhold as a craggy is fine, but the film with the issues of degradation and revenge is not well done. But it's a good movie for the quiz - because so few people saw it.
