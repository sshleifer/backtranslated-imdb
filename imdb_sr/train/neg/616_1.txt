Let's be realistic; some lame kid who dies and turns his soul into a scarecrow. There will be no neva! OMFG This stupid kid loser who can not stand for himself, gets his ass from a drunk bastard who cheats on his mother. Just as he dies, he looks at the scarecrow and let his spirit enter the scarecrow. Drunk guy hid his death by making him suicidal and he thought he got out. Later we see that he was thrown out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with a scarecrow. They had a brief meeting involving a drunkard who called him a loser, and the scarecrow refused from "He takes one to know one, the loser!" The scarecrow is removed from the building, called it "Daddy", and then attacks the poor man. We can see how this horrible movie unfolds from it. Then he kills many people. He mostly kills people who gave him tough moments in RL and goes to kill some random people, just for some laughter. Do not laugh here. Each murder adds a line of punches. Every time he killed someone, he would do some karate flip-flops and finish everything with one of his signature. In the case of someone who was hard to listen, he would say "Here, have EAR corn!" then put them in your ass. Or we can take an example from a movie! He just killed a policeman and is on his way to killing the only person who ever got up. Her father, the sheriff, cried out to the crazy to stop, and he said, "Hey, stay a little bit!" and threw a dagger threw his chest and hit him on a tree. At the end of the film, he killed two guys and threw into the punchline "Gotta split!" and killed two guys by shoving their hair into their heads. Vovzors, this film forced me to put on my trousers so badly. Perhaps the next time this movie is made, it will not be gay.
