... And I never thought the film deserves the prize 1! But this is truly the worst movie I've ever seen. My wife picked it up for acting, but the story happened since the DVD box looked pretty predictable. It's not a mystery, nor a movie about minors. This does not include any sensuality, if that is what a title can suggest to any of you. This is just no-no. Do not waste your time and money unless you want to watch a crowd of young people in a gothic ambience where the killer moves behind them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth watching. Mak Makovski makes the worst of Nick Stahl.
