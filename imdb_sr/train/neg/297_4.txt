For the film, this film is intriguing, but hardly original. In 1998, the film that starred Talia Shire, The Landlady, had almost the same plot, but with younger characters. She was finally released from a happy home led by her distorted doctor ... whom she abused and killed a poor man. (Now it's original) The doctor financed the villa before killing him and burial in the yard in the yard. After moving, he falls in love with a stallion named Richard, who only married the blues singer. If you've seen a Gazdarica you know, she kills or tries to kill anyone who enters between her and Richard (including the car). Many ideas came from the previous film, the same idiot, the assistant who hit his nose, the same spying boy with a popcorn, the same flying body. He had some original material, the beer was brutal. The highlight of the film was Amanda's beautiful breasts in the top-top scene. Some of the ripoff, but not the total loss of time. 4 of 10
