Then why is this show bullshit? Unfortunately, this is really the only question, because there is no doubt that this is happening. For those who are not familiar with the premise of the show, the Cavemen series, condemned to shortening, focuses on the number of Neanderthals and their fighting to exist in modern America and is based on characters from a series of television ads for Geico Insurance. The concept is solid and has reason to be successful. I had to think about it for a while, but then the ad tag - something like an effect "It's not that different from you", it gave me the shit key. Although Cave People / Neanderthals are actually a different kind of humanity, the main characters of this show, they turn out to be exactly the same as those who are annoying assholes. Perhaps my background as a game writer - rather than a soulless, hack, a Californian writer - but this show had so much potential, and none of it was accomplished. To begin with, manufacturers should focus on fun things that would make cavalry people different from us. , when they would get used to things like underground utility workers and guides in cave parks? Why would they play prose games such as skuash, if the entire episode could be dedicated to trying to get hunting permissions after a spear? Such a show could be written by itself, and it is necessary to have some deliberately bad writing that it would be so shy and boring. number of stereotypes related to different human minorities. Iavn! This has been done many times before, and never more than that. And, as mentioned earlier, Neanderthals are a really different kind, and their use as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is uncompleted and incomparable. why am I wrong? I would like to enjoy this show and I'm just sorry that until now I was not able to. Michael J. Varhola, the online casino online magazine
