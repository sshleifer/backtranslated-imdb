Stortebeker is truly one of the worst television mini-series ever made on this planet. . Instead, it was a great city at this time, the best days were gone. Secondly, Hamburg would never be a city that takes care of pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg did not have access to the Baltic Sea, the capital at that time was Lubeck. But worse than all that: Directing! How can a diletant like this guy let him direct such a film? Not possible! There were no convincing scenes, the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter in most of the strict scenes.
