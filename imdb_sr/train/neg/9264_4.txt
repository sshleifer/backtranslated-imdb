This inferior sequel is based on characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) about a marriage named Gene (Michael Voods) and Karen Iork (Faie Grant). They adopted a little girl named Delia from the monastery. Gene Iork re-elected the congressman and he presides over the Finance Committee. In the meantime, Delia seems to be there when an unexplained death occurs. It creates a waste of time when a metaphysical fair takes place, as supplies of numerology, therapy, treatment, yoga, tarot are destroyed. Karen Iork hired a private eye (Michael Lerner) to investigate strange and bizarre events. This television sequel displays excitement, fever, creepy events, and bloody killing. Delia, such as Damien, seems to send new, horrible murders every few minutes of the film, terrible killings occur. The main excitement lies in the observation that new and innocent victims can make a central special effect. Moreover, the central protagonists, Faie Grant and Michael Voods, though they were pretty actors, such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and recently deceased Don Davis, he was the captain of the army who turned into acting. As always, a great music score taken by Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is exclusive to hardcore followers Omen saga. The film was poorly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominicus Othenin Girard. The previous and much better versions are as follows: Incredibly superior original 'Omen' (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) Richard Donner; 'Damien' (Villiam Holden, Lee Grant) by Don Tailor; "The Final Conflict" (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Graham Baker. Rating: Below average.
