It was so exciting about the game with Bill Shatner ... and especially right after Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So, of course, everyone had to get involved to see what was all that noise on the gameplay shov. What a disappointment! As Stoin stoically and nasally says, "voovv". The only thing that is cute about this performance was the fact that you knew it would eventually be over. Sitting for an hour, it was as if I was going to the dentist ... you are looking at an hour in what you think are 10-minute intervals, only to find out that it's only a minute (but it looked like eternity) because the last You looked at the clock. Well, why did not I simply switch the channel? Well, probably for the same reason that most people are not ... out of pure optimism. I mean, nobody really * wants to think that the performance with Bill Shatner could really be so bad. Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought it was a type of vehicle to show the talents of Villiam Shatner. My main complaint was that the set was so dark. I watched how I felt depressed. You went on to want to get some excitement, but there was no one. There was not enough light on the set to feel the energy of the audience (which you could not even see). Dear Network: People do not watch games to cure insomnia. ... watching the game shows that they are excited and have a good time. Please do us a favor and lose this in the vault.
