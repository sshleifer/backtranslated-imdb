I do not know why this has fans and I do not know why I even gave him the grade I have. This is pointless. There are many giallas in which the disbelief must cease, let the picture be turned and caught somewhere before it becomes delirious, and some poor cop must finally explain what we have seen. But it relates very little to him and has long sequences in which nothing happens and has nothing to do with anything as long as we have to listen to the most prominent sound record, even according to Italian standards. It's not giallo, this is a complete mish of porridge from the horror idea, in which Klaus Kinski is in one of his most prominent 'telephone' performances. I guess he showed up, he did one day's work and got rid of the g. D'Amata to instruct others to fill in. Eva is, of course, beautiful but not enough, and in the end we saw too many of her shooting. until the end, long after we completely lost interest in this absurd and pretentious twin. Maybe I was not in the right mood!
