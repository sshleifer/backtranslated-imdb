For romantic comedies, I often evaluate the quality of the film based on the fog of my eyes to the end of the experience. Unfortunately, the "The Vedding Date" film can be rated only with 4 out of 10 possible tears. I apologize to the fans Debra Messing and Dermot Mulronei, but I have not seen much chemistry between their two signs. The premise of the film is the reverse "Beautiful Woman", with Dermot, who played the role of Nike, a costly male companion hired by Debrin's person Kat to accompany her to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship is likely to develop between the sponsor and the client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there were not enough romantic sparks that flew over Nick and Cat. In support, Amy Adams was a great one as Katina's sister. Whenever Amy came to the screen, she served as a spark plug and a catalyst for film energy. Perhaps, if Amy Adams was Kat's role, the film might have more dynamism. But, as it turned out, instead of reaching Kleenek, I asked Visine in an attempt to at least pretend that this film has a true feeling and romance.
