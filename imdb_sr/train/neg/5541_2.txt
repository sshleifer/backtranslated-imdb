Ever since the movie that loves the cinema, he met a man named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" automatically connects with bloody images of horror and non-stop acting sequences. It can be said with certainty that his "Night of the Living Dead" set up a film about zombies as we know it now. Nevertheless, in the earliest years of cinema, the premise of revived corpses was only used in slow, almost non-action psychological thrillers. Jackues Tourneur "I Walked With a Zombie" is a perfect example, as well as "White Zombie", in the main role is Bela Lugosi. This "Revolt of the Zombies" could have been another example, but unfortunately this is a failure all over the line and one of the earliest films I've ever seen. Terrible acting, a very bad script and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts only 65 minutes, and the first half hour is completely lost on the stupid intrigue of love story and ineffective monologues. Setting up in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor could surely lead to a more convincing story, but everything we see is internal recordings. The main actress (Dorothy Stone, blonde blonde with curly hair and ugly nose) was very irritated and I was hoping that the hungry undead would suddenly appear from nothing to swallow. Again unhappy?. If you manage to fight for 60 minutes of sleep, you will be rewarded with a fairly decent ending. However, this is too little to give this film a positive rating, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! This is the kind of movie you should see only if you've already seen everything else.
