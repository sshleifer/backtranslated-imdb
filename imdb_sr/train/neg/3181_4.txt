This movie is not made by those who love. Most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour Tommy's mallay are simply missed or deleted: in Christmas they did not show Daltri's screams after the line "Tommy does not know what day ...", they showed almost * no * Tovnsend guitar in Pinball Wizard, there were too many hits in the best moments Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the Ve Ve Gonna Take It, they robbed almost all of Pete's burning string guitar chords. The huge pieces of the film were taken from the background of the band. It's a very frustrating movie to watch and does not deliver goods. I do not know if director Murri Lerner is just a fan, or even worse, at least for him, if he is * a fan, and they are all * eight * cameras that could provide him with. According to him, before Tommy there are some rare numbers, as well as some faves, which are very well recorded, and sometimes the installation is brilliant. This might be enough for some viewers to be satisfied, as long as you do not expect Tommy. The sound was central to the transmission I watched from DirecTV; It can be different on video or DVD.
