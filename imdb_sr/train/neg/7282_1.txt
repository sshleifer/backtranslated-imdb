The National Lampoon was once a funny magazine. Whether you like the stoner of the days of hippies in the late sixties or self-inflicted and daring days of cocaine in the 1970s (when the comedy was enriched with many naked babies) is very much dependent on the date of birth, but everyone agrees that the early eighties, the Middle Ages, killed all remaining sparks the anarchic humor that drugs did not have, and offers like this film and all the scariest minor records hit further holes in the hull. Beyond the well illustrated title sequence, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this especially depressing stench. If you manage to get through the staggering opening segment, 'Groving Miself', hoping things will be better, hard luck - they do not. Whoever thought that a woman was brutally raped by a butter stalk, a golden comedy deserves that his head be surrendered to a tray of dog confusion. If ever there is a global lack of rice for the guitar, the negatives of these unrelated, unrelated rush of intricate ideas and horrible performances can serve well for some purpose.
