At least I was able to enjoy a mocking film, which was surprising, as I hardly managed to sit through it. To be honest, I suppose the DVD cover cost more than the entire movie. And saying that the same director as The Boogeiman, when the new version came out ... nice touch, it was enough to introduce me. The only thing that frustrated me more than the unbearable action copicat is his hair. Usually you see only that kind of hair on a ten-year-old boy, and the character behaved like that. The film seems to have been shot by a student of the D + class of a film school, excited to use every film technique he learned while attending classes ... sometimes, he is less a friend. Through her, I would have lost myself by accidental complications that were not leading anywhere or were unexplained. All this makes a bad movie, but when the ending does not get close, then it makes it a very bad movie. Undoubtedly, this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and this includes a final video for friends of my French high school, but maybe I'm a bit biased. P.S. I do not think it deserves a star ... not half. NONE FOR IOU !!
