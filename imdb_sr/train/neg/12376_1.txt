This collection is really shit! I rented it, thinking that I would really enjoy a good fight. Man, this is bullshit! Fast unusual cuts, an extremely unpleasant speaker, and the fights that were played were altered and shaken a lot (I think especially of Jeta Li's struggles in the Shakam legend and the fight of Jackie Chan from drunken masters 2). > <br /> And what about those street fighters?! What's so cool about it? I've seen more interesting fighting in the military law! This stupid collection of cuts for stupid people. Never buy this movie! Do not encourage people who have made this shit to do more than this shit! Instead, go to buy movies from which they fought and fight in uncircumcised fame!
