Mt is a younger sister and I are self-proclaimed horror lovers. We only saw SVE, especially zombie shifts. We've seen many good zombie movies and many bad ones. This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Not only was the acting horrible, but also special effects, graphics and ever "zombie" makeup were the worst I've ever seen. If you can even call it lipstick (black eye shadow eye) This is a complete proof that you should never judge the book by its cover. Because the cover of the movie is the only sweet thing. Do your service and do not watch this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so intransigent about this movie. I came so far as to put a sticky note in the movie before I returned it, saying: "This movie is bullshit, do not waste your time, come back now" hahahhaa I do not want anyone else to lose a good movie night at this POS film! I do not even know how he got the grades he had, he should be negative
