This film is an apparent Hollywood attempt to portray Reagan's administration as incompetent and confused. Some mistakes may have been made in times of crisis, but I'm sure not to the extent that it is shown in this chrome movie. My first reaction was that this film had to be directed by Oliver Stone, but this time I was wrong. Obviously there are many others.
