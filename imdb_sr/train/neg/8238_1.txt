This film was the positively worst movie I ever watched. I could not sit through the whole thing. I also think the writer must have some strange fetish for women who are sneaking and cheating ... I mean what it's all about! I can not believe it's even made and I'm scared that # ingvasted Â£ 4 rentals. The quality of picture and sound is terrible, acting ... does not exist well. It was a bad excuse for the movie, and scenes of pissing, shit and vomiting reminded 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh ....... AVOID AT ALL PRICES! The girls looked as though they were buried out of the street and got only a part because they would be willing to take their peaks ... While these girls had beautiful bodies, they certainly did not overlook the fact that their screaming was terribly incredible and painful to their ears. It was (maybe worse) than amateur school production without the right direction and there is no need for a set because everything seems to be around the car ?! Definite does not buy people. Sorry if my first comment was terribly negative, but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think that I can save someone else by spending their money like me.
