It seems that many people liked the movie, so I feel kind of bad giving it a bad rating. But after 96 minutes, I feel I have to do it. Where is the plot in this movie?! I must have missed it, I waited for the story to be revealed and nothing happened. Of course, the ending was "a bit shocking," but they were not upgraded. I forgot who was half of the time, so they did not really develop characters. The acting was so-so, most of the time it was convincing, but I was able to look through it most of the time. So ... without giving anything, I must say that if you do not like the actors in the movie, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could be wrong, but I simply did not understand why there was so little or too much movie. I can not decide which one will be, so I say that you judge yourself. I do not even know if it would be a good idea, price and everything ... Plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Actor: 2/10 Total: 3/10 I feel like it's Too high, I stay with my voice at the top.
