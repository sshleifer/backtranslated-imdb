This must be the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. In the first 15 minutes there was nothing to keep my interest in this film. Then I was on vacation and I had enough time to dedicate myself to a movie that was fun. The condom we were in was in possession of this film - it was certainly received from a $ 1 store or similar. This started with a bad assumption, and then only worsened. There is nothing ridiculous about it. I watched lots of movies, including some that I do not care about. But if you decide to spend time on this movie, do not say I did not warn you.
