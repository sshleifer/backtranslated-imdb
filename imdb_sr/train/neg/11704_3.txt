One of them, "Why is it made?" movies. Romanticism is very hard to swallow. It's one of those romances, that they are suddenly "clicked" - in love. The movie is filled with long pauses and unpleasant moments - the restaurant you drive is the most prominent. Charles Grodin does a credible job, but for most of the films, it's just he and Luiz Laser. Ask yourself, Do you want to watch Grodzin with his neurosis, and Lasser with her neuroses together for an hour and a half?
