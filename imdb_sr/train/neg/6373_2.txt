Oh, this is a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is fine, but I think she plays in the movie, not because her organs are raining her at night, but because she is thinking to fire her agent for putting her in this shit. Faie Dunavai is acting as if she is processing her mom's favorite and the ending is completely stupid. I really can not recommend this film at all, although as an admirer of Edgar Allen Poe I was a little intrigued by references to his work (Ravens, House of Usher, family curse, and buried alive) he would probably have turned to grave that he knew about this film.
