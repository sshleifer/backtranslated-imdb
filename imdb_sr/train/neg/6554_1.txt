I would not give this movie a rating, it's not worth it. I watched it just because I'm a fan of Pfieffer. I love her and I'll watch everything she does. She did not even disappoint in this dude. Every scene with her in her, she watched the viewer ... waiting ... something happened, but nothing did. He had some good stories, but they ended up suddenly as soon as they started. Some of the other characters had the potential, but none of it has become. The wardrobe and set were surprisingly good. I can watch mostly anything and rarely find a movie that I can not find about it, but this was a failure. I do not understand. The worst thing about it, in the end, she had a big hanger on the cliff. She had the final scene that woke you up and said vow, this movie finally goes to some place, and then the credits turn. Good sadness. I agree with the review he said .99 I would buy 3 cans of cats and watch my cat eat more exciting. Well said. In fact, this comment was more fun than the movie, because it is so concise. And I lost .99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
