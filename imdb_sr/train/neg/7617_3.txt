It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but Hostel is definitely much worse. This film is more funny and funny than frightening. I laughed most of the time I watched it. Low quality effects (when you watch, you understand what I'm talking about and how it's LOV quality), bad actors (I hear them for the first time), and it seems that the amateur camcorder was shot (so it looks more like a TV show than on a TV show Movie). But at least I had the patience to look at it all the way. Like comedy? Watch. Vanna horror? Go look at Ju-On: Grudge or some other good horror movie. If I talk about the Diablo Legend, I do not even know if I can classify it in the Horror genre. Just a little budget. I estimate it 3 out of 10
