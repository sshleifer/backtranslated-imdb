A very stupid movie, filled with stupid lines and Jewish references. It was a serious film, but it could not be taken seriously. A famous film story ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. A terrible subplot, with Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and over-regulated. I noticed Al Pacino's acting capabilities go downhill. Troubleshooting tool with problems, but nothing more disturbing than Pacinos' terrible accent in Atlanta. The damage control must correct this damage to the film. OK, my lines are bad, but not as bad as those in this movie. This movie succeeds not only to be boring but also disgusting. Usually a disgusting movie can be viewed for the wrong reasons. This film is incalculable. I managed to get through this. The action, if it was written a bit better, with, maybe a little better acting and eliminating a terrible background, and even duller jokes, could get this thriller out of the ghost. What we have left is a boring, stupid film that ensured that in our heads, Eli Vurman was Jewish. Shame on all good Jewish people everywhere.
