So do not even think about renting this out of stores, because this is one of the bad films. He would have thought that JJ Abrahams had written this film. Basically, the rat is washed in the toilet and somehow it has to be returned. Lovers of the completely terrible "Shrek" can enjoy, but fans of "Vallace & Gromit" will probably turn disgustingly. Also, why did not they do it in plastic or clay? I mean, CGI animation? For Aardman movie ?? !! Apparently, Aardman was lying around as they let Dreamvorks do the whole thing. Wrong, wrong, wrong !!! Almost every single character is terrible, except for that strange type of frog, which is just for the movie villain. But everything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep with a boredom watching this movie. No, wait, actually, I fell asleep with a boredom watching this movie. It's horrible. But, fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek."
