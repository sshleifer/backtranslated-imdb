I saw that this happened before the last year's prize season, he did not know why they were betrayed after the vote was over, but whatever, perhaps due to the exposure, at least, the film was a mess. Of course, some parts were ridiculous in black humor, but none of the characters seemed to me at all. There was not a single person with whom I could connect, and I think it was the place where it fell for me. Of course, the shop is somewhat interesting and very subversive to the scienceology, VOV! What a great idea ... to see if it's already mined to the point that it's pointless. The whole temptation feels fake, from lighting, casting, scenarios to terrible visual effects (which should be intentional, I can say, and everyone else can, no one can laugh with you). Anyway, I hope that it will be for sale on DVD at least, I would not want a project that many people obviously are putting a lot of effort into completely seamlessly. But anyway. It's boring trips.
