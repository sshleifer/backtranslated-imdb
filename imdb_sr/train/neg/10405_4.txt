The fourth feature of "Tremors" dates back to 1889. "The Legend Begins" in the small town of Perfection, which was then "Refusal, Nevada". As the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the horrible "Grabowes". Some of the characters in the films of today's "trembling" in the past have ancestors, figurative and literal. The most obvious is ever returned Michael Gross (like Hiram Gummer). Unlike his offspring, Mr. Gross is incapable of firearms; So, he hires gunman Billy Dear (as "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot them "Dirt Dragons". . It's like a Westerner with a miniature version of the monsters of the original movie "Graboids". These "Dirt Dragons" defenders are not even close to terrorism as their colleagues "Tremors" (1990). So, in this movie, the characters spend a lot of time on the field, which would not have happened in the original movie. And it was strange that citizens would give up the fight so quickly, when Gross temporarily decided to leave the city. Why so helpless? Why did Brent Roam (like Juan Pedilla) not immediately gather people to fight without Gross? Frustrating. **** Tremors 4: Legend Begins (2004) S.S. Vilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
