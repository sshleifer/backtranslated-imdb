A steady, common thriller about a woman who seduces all those she supposedly loves to increase her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the mischievous Tracey, married to Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend Andy named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) appears as a resident surgeon, trouble is not far behind him. an effective, tempting thriller, as well as a serious lack of motivation, background and character development, leaves the whole show. None of the actors can show interest in their shallow characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose inexplicably unexplainable Andi can not be trusted. and is not able to make fun from the party. By the time you discover "secret" actions, you simply do not care. At least the Massachusetts cinema looked good. Also played by George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
