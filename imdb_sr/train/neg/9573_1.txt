Not quite from the wall in a good way, but totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is an uncomfortable mix of sci-fi, horror and alleged comedy. This is just as absurd and completely incoherent. There is very little dialogue, mainly because of the fact that the script, if it was, is a complete "pebble". I would not even call it strange, more like "total stupidity". This film will surely disappoint, and you are warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if you do, a sharp smell will be kept like a rotting fish ........................... .......... MERK
