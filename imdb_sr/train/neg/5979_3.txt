Pokemon 3 is slightly more than three or four episodes of the TV series, merged without the usual commercials. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, struggle and resolution in which everyone is happy at the end), and in animation there is nothing original or unusual. Some holes on the plot are filled (through final loans!) No explanation, and everything is a bit too sweet. Why do you see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. Both my sons enjoy Pokemon, and as I show interest in what they like, we are closer. Watching the movie in the theater is still different from watching the movie, and my sons enjoy a full movie. I gave the movie 4, mostly from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
