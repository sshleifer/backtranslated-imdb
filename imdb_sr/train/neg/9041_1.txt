Somehow I liked the film despite his frenetic rhythm. But I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was called Montana North. It's definitely not Montana North and it will never be. Americans are wondering why in the rest of the world they are perceived as arrogant and that is one of the reasons why. Stop teaching the children of the United States to think they are the planet's owners. Such a centrist view of the world does not become one of the great world nations. Even in a joke. The US would never call 'Alberta South'. Volt would never let us down, so why start now. Except for the film to be fairly silly, more luck next time.
