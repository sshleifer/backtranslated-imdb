My husband and I just finished watching Busu AKA Booth. She fell asleep during some parts of the film. I really would like to have separated from her, but the unfortunate fact is that the voice of the protagonist is so loud and that it is impossible to sleep. When our protagonist talks, I think I want to hear Regis Philbine and William Shatner singing karaoke. He also has no redeeming quality. I was hoping that the bus would hit him for five minutes. Do not misunderstand me, I love cinema in Asian horror, but Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really does not have any damn sense. If you want a good Asian cinema, look at the story of two sisters or a mirror. Avoid Booth as a plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
