"A Gentleman's Game" uses a golf game in a countri club environment to illustrate the discovery of adolescents about honesty, prejudice and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this movie was going to be, just to prove it was wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that filmmakers ever knew where to go. The decisive moment in this film is probably a scene in which Gary Sinise is mocked by "Karate Kidu" and debunks any representations that he will become a mentor to an adolescent golfer. It is refreshing, in a way, that this film refuses to follow most of the simple and exaggerated movie formulas. However, too much remains to be seen. In the fall of the hat, people reject every threat of civility, or fail to hold on to the things they believe in, or are exposed to something far less respectable than their place in society. Unfortunately, there is often no solution for these moments. And besides that their club serves as a background, there is no real continuity or connection. It's a shame that writers and directors could not save a better movie, especially with regard to some of the talented actors and potentials in setting up.
