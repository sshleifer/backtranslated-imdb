I was horrified by this film. No, it was not because of graphic sex scenes, it was because it destroyed the image of Artemisije Gentileschi. This film does not contain much truth about her and her art. She shows an artwork she did (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but she shows that filing as a testimony to the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith a year after the trial. I do not know if you understood this from the film, probably not, Tasi was not a noble character. On RAPED Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to have accepted false charges of rape to prevent him from suffering while being tortured. According to transcripts of rape, he continued to claim that he never knew Artemisia (with whom he had sex), while repeatedly declaring "The truth is". and find the right Artemisy and see what she really is. Do not base all your knowledge on this fictional movie. I am encouraging you to do some research, Artemisia really has an interesting story behind her and some incredible artwork.
