Incorrect lies on the cover, "fun as American pie", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV and waited for a comedy ... and this is definitely not one. You probably will not laugh at one time if you're not one of those Jackass's ubiquitous minds. It's not even an erotic movie, which would be at least something, since it's about sex ... So, what is this? The impatient plot deals with a guy who wants to lose his virginity (zero in originality, I remember he "lost" for one) and his gang of friends. Other characters (ie Girls) just come and go without a reasonable reason. Come on, there are even Dwarfs (so simple: "the dwarfs are fun ho ho"). The acting is very similar to TV (like a video view through a movie) and definitely an amateur in the case of most girls ... <br /> Terrible film. Amateur, poorly produced, and above all NOTHING. Children and teens will love to watch her with friends for cursing and sexual jokes. In addition, do not even think about renting this movie.
