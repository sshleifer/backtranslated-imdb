A decent animation and some useful character development keep this animated DreamVorks hub at least adjustable for watching ... but it remains a bit slow, and the story is a bit silly. It's interesting to see the turn of typical cowboys and Indian roles, but this seems to be more than political correctness, but the correct decision about the story. GRADE: C
