One of the crowd of slashers that appeared in the early eighties, Pranks stands out only for the early performance of Daphne Zuniga (The Thing Thing, The Fli 2); her character dies pretty early, and the rest of the film is completely forgotten. During the Christmas break, a group of students volunteers to free the convicted college building of their furniture. A crazy killer, however, inserts the key into the work by methodically throwing the boys one by one in various terrible ways. The shroud delivers a boring and unimaginable horror that has begged me to be killed, so that I can continue to watch something more valuable. Most of the deaths (which we face because we generally watch this kind of film) are short but not heavy; the only really terrible picture comes at the end when the remaining survivors discover the bodies of the victims (there is a particularly bloody ruptured corpse - a film could do more). At the last moment, the film is rescuing from shame to get the lowest possible rating from me by having a fine, unexpectedly weak ending, but this is really only for slasher complete sets.
