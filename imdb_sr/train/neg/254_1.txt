Ah, bait. How I hate you? Let me count the roads. 1. You try to be humorous, but they are rude and unsuitable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, it does not cause laughter. Instead, I want to throw it away. 2. You try to be dramatic, but you are incredible; the woman is terribly embarrassing, and the "bad guy" looks like Bill Gates, and it's terrifying like ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate someone with a gun. It does not work, is it? Maybe a lawyer, but not a gun, to give a dramatic and honest dialogue is ridiculous, and it seems like he wants to throw me. 3. You try to be full of actions , but instead of being too blunt and pulling too many times. And when the action is warming up, the tripod for the camera must be lost, because the scenes rolled more than those in the Blair Vitch Project, and I feel tedious, and once again I want to 4. Trying to be a good movie, but you did not succeed, you did not succeed, you did not I'd rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a full beef full of beef, without water, no sunscreen, and only Meril Streep for the company. This hell would be more than one minute more fulfilling by watching everything in Bait to turn their path through the idiotic written a story with Bill Gates for the bad guy, and let's not even talk about a massive bomb that goes in the car in a character that is characteristic of Jamie Fokk. He just took CLIFF, but he somehow managed to escape ... just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that I'll never have to watch ilm that is such a bad ever again.
