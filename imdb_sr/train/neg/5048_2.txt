I tried. I really am. I thought maybe if I gave Joao Pedro Rodriguez another chance, I could enjoy his film. I know that after seeing O FANTASM I felt sick and almost horrified to the core, but some reviews were pretty good and I was kind to myself, so I wanted to say: "What a devil. Sometimes it's better to go to your dentist and ask a root canal without prior anesthesia to alleviate the horror of so much pain I often wonder if it would be better for me to get back to my childhood and ask my ex-thugs to give it to me really. On other occasions, I often think that the world is really flat that if I go far enough, not only will I get out of it and I will clarify myself, and that something evil will hurt me, Lovecraft will take away my 9000 tongs and squeeze my life - and some french fries from 1995 still remain in my esophagus - from me. <br /> <br /> < > Is there any reason to leave? I would say not at all ... only that perhaps its Creator thought that writing stories about her madness (which makes Alek Forrest look like a strawberry cake) looks not only creepy, but also sick to bone. She first decides to leave her current boyfriend (in screaming hysteria) because she wants a child and believes they are too young. She later destroyed the funeral of a gay man, and - to get this - to get close to her, she pretends to be pregnant while inserting into the lives of the mother and the lover of a dead man in the most painful way. Oh, of course, she screams like banshee and does not throw one, but good three times to the grave. And there's a funny thing that gradually becomes "Pedro," which sums up some bad explanation that love does not know the gender. Or something. I would say it is crazy like a can, unsalted. But again, so is the director. And me, for a chance. At least men look good. Besides ... there's not much to be seen here.
