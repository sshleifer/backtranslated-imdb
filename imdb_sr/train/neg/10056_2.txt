Well ... we get to see Brenda's footage ... interesting but not exactly Oscars. Susannah York was hardly down. A new scene in which Lois finds that Clark Superman is a bit incredible in that he does not notice that gaps are emptied out of the pistol instead of real bullets. Real bullets would penetrate into his clothes, and then they would refuse from him on the floor, but they forget to ... Let us hear that Donner laughed at the Lester version that had a more logical meaning. The president talks about Zodiac "destroying" the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Changing this scene made this line quite absurd. Superman's "press freedom line" sounded stupid in comparison with ".. Try to get out", which was better delivered and had a proper connection with Clark's earlier scene in the truck's stand. Then the end with the effect is "turn the world back in time". He returned everything in the whole movie and wondered where exactly the rocket for Hackensack, N.J. has ever gone because it no longer releases Zoda and the company.
