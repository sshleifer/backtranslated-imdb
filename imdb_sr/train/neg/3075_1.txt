Iep .. this is definitely worse with some of the worst of MSTified movies, but I definitely saw it up. I think Gremlins rated R. Nevertheless, I met Rick Sloane at some science-fiction convention, which is incredible, he taught! It was one of those very cheap conventions, where everything is going, everyone brought something (if you want to see shit, you should have seen what some friends I brought). He seemed to be a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on Hobgoblins, and he even told me I did not take it seriously, and he said he liked the version of MST3K ! Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think it should have been as bad as Mars Attacks. I suppose I stand for this film and I give it 5, and I release all my MSTi colleagues. Excuse me guys.
