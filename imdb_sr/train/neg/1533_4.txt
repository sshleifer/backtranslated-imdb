I will not waste a lot of time and energy on this commentary. I just want to add it, because all the comments were so positive that I felt like I had to say that people are not so enthusiastic, let alone intellectually challenged by this attempt to create an incredible philosophical film enigma. Some scenes looked promising, playing in visual dimensions, but the rest was unable to withstand. I felt like I was again stoned for the first time, with semifilloscopic conversations with other adolescents. What a futile attempt to lift the Dutch cinema to new heights. I would rather see Jesus as Palestine, without any pretensions and with real humor, also asking questions about the life and the things that we create ourselves. Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and it seems that he will never be.
