I rented this movie for one reason, Tom Savini, I respect his work, but this was a real downfall, I had terrible clich√©s, half of the movie were naked women so-called. there were occasional "Blair Vitch" black and white scenes with cameras. Tom's character was a horrible, terrible scenario. And you have to love these lines they use. "Is someone there, who is there, that's not funny?" No, but your acting was. I wish I could give this blow 0! Oh, the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Allie, Emilio, but left out Anthony, a breakfast club that reunited in the woods of an unstoppable acting.
