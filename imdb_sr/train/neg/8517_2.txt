The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not the one to deal with on the screen. Mystery is why this perennial disappointment is still in progress. This week marked the overthrow for Veronica Mars: ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon it will be Big 5). Yes, you read well. Veronica Mars won every show of the current SB and every show on UPN. They won all the performances at Fok and of course all appearances on ABC, CBS and NBC. Now, hip hippers will say: but this was again. But all that was on television this week was a great deal of repetition! It's incredible why the CV would choose this proven disappointment because one of the rare shows was saved from UPN. It is clear that something is happening behind the scenes. Services are exchanged and impact is penetrating. I'm sorry I'm so cynical, but what other explanation does it exist? The "Veronica Mars has the potential" line is apparently dead now when it was two years old to establish itself and did not do it. Perhaps this is the influence and influence of Joel Silver, but frankly, I'm at a loss why someone would choose to spend his influence on a bad performance that no audience is watching. Great mystery and very unfavorable debut for CV.
