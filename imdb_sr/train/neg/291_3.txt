The film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-off-Broadway show is sublimely pretentious. Sandra emphasizes bands and superstars, but her sense of irony is just interesting and funny. Her fans will say that she is honestly honest, and that can be true. But it is also pervasive, with relentless, in your face a lock that is not well adapted to the film in this genre. She does not want to fit nicely - and she certainly does not come out to make friends - and that will always get many people in the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material here is seriously missing. Director Nicolas Roeg was an executive producer and, although he did not direct, the film has its own cool, singular style of signing. Bernhard is co-author of the show with director John Boskovich; their strangest touch was that all Sandrine in-house audiences looked completely boring - a feeling that many true viewers would most likely share. * 1/2 of ****
