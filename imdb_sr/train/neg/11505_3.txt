This picture reminds me of Kennedy's image of 1957, The Admirable Crighton, "while he was a servant on the boat and became a master on the island, and after being rescued, he was returned to the slave. Madonna is fine in some films, but this if there is any picture that shows that Madonna can not play, that's this. I'm not sure if this was a subtle copy of "Wonderful Crayon", but definitely it looks like I like it and if it's the case, Hollivood has to run out of ideas and it's sad to provide a platform for actors to improve their profile curls era and just that fails in every corner and detail. <br /> <br / "The story is relaxed and the acting is mediocre. The script was to be put through the cutter before it was downloaded to the site. Although many here have made Madonna for all her acting, I think that in films such as "League of My Own" she was pretty good and comfortable, and "Who is this girl" showed the Madonna's stunning style that was not shown sooner or later. Other Madonna's movies are not so pleasant and I would like to see the Madonna Animation series with the character "Who's That Girl". I love the music from these two films, but "Svept avai" remains at the bottom of the crowd and will remain so. Everyone has a bomb?
