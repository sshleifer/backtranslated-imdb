What a stupid piece of it. I will not waste my time evaluating any point of this show. Not worth the time. The only comment I will give is: why do we get such a DUMB, an unarticulated fool to be a star?!? There are not many poor testimonies about the deterioration of the mental state of the network from the fact. that FOKS stated that he would not bring John Doe (a decent series), but would bring a return to the brain such as Joe Millionaire for another round of killing American brain cells. he lost, IMHO.
