Let me start from being able to enjoy any bad Italian horror movie or film about the exploitation of the jungle from the 1970s. Seriously. This one was terribly terrible. There are too many elements that Martino is trying to inject, and none of them works well (except in the case of croc-gone-vild). There are some ignorant Westerners, who somewhere set up a resort in the jungle. I do not even remember where this is happening ... how sad ... In fact, people come to the resort to see this tribe and its ceremonies, but in the end they upset the "Aligator God" of the river that then continues to rampage, killing both tourists and some tribes. It sounds good, is not it? Well, do not be hoping. There is minimal violence to the end, special effects are so bad that it was in the kindergarten and that the love story was thrown into laughter. Seriously, there are several scenes that appear to have been placed underwater underwater in the pool and threw a toy alligator, such as an arrow, into the water and that it should have been a gator of an attack. I'm not kidding. In yet another extraordinary special effect, the Combi Matchbok is on the target of an incredible floating plastic gator, which is five times larger than the van. (A few minutes ago, it was big enough to eat a man, but now he was riding a freight van ...) It's really pathetic. The only other shift that I can remember where the effects were so bad that I was pulled out of the story was the masterpiece by Bruno Mattei, "Rats", what with plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all those who could not be scared. /> Normally I would say that everything that Sergio Martino was a solid compulsory look, but this is a must go. Losing time and definitely not worth buying for the $ 15 + sticker from No Shame. This is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10, kids.
