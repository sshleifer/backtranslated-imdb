Okay, if you have a few hours to lose, or if you really hate your life, I'd say you're watching this movie. If anything is good for a few laughs. Not only do you have an obese, warm-blooded native, but also special effects so bad that they are probably banned in most countries. Seriously, PG's rating is pretty humorous when you see Native Porn Ektravaganza. I would not give this film my retarded nephew. It could not even be shown to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is sketchy, clich√©, stupid and stupid. The acting is terrible, and the end is so painful to watch. In fact, I began to pour in my eyes just to take away the thoughts of idiocy that fills my TV screen.
