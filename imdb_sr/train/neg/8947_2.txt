The book is fantastic, this film is not. There is no reason for this film to not accept the futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, a total recall was published a few years later and it did a good job, even an orange orange issued in the 1970s has done a good job trying to make a futuristic world. Dark German expressionist colors, black and white shots from the visuals, there is no reason for such an approach when the film was born in 1984. The main character is in a white collar that writes a job, but dresses like he does with oil and grease in the garage. This film decides on a simulated communist approach to the design of the design, the atmosphere and the theme, but the novel does not necessarily dictate the very communist, religious service. This book has to be seriously adapted in a modern context, because this book is more relevant today than ever before. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this shit. Soundtrack is boring, the lack of prediction is boring, this film seems to be designed to deny a sense of realism or conviction when it is precisely what it takes to get the messages of the novel intoxicated with the viewer.
