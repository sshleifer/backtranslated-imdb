... let me count the roads. 1. 'Remake' only for the title that extracts every clichÃ© in the textbook. 2. Land that is so predictable that it becomes fairly pathetic. 3. Fully poor performance of any uncertainties or excitement attempts. 4. PG-13 rating that does not provide any blood, violence or sex. 5. Zlikovac who is not intimidating or even mysterious. 6. The head of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we can not take care of them. 7. Lack of Effective Dangerous Atmosphere (Unlike Original Prom Night). 8. A dialogue scenario that is out of the poor - it's dying. 9. Cardboard performance series (it is not certain whether this should be blamed for the actors or the bad script mentioned). 10. A totally unsuitable remake for slashers who are not brave to try to have a fantasy - or even show a bowl of blood. /> BOMBA from ****
