This film was exhausted and simple. Okay, basically about the girl who was raped, and to get revenge, she got another guy to rape the rapist. The rapist is a robber, but the girl's victim is partially to blame. I mean, they both are in the mood and they start to love things, but when a rapist tries to have sex with her, she does not allow rape to rape her. The point is that the rape scene for a girl is very short and does not show anything, but when rape rape occurs, it's a rather long rape scene. Basically, there is nothing in the story worth watching. 3.2 / 10
