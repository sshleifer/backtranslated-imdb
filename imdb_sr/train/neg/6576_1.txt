I completely disagree with comments that said this is a good movie. This is a totally shitty movie. I think SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The development of the story is strange. Mia Kirshner has changed from an innocent girlfriend into a party-seeking party for no compelling reason. In addition, all actresses looked too old to be students - college students looked like they were about 30 years old - you understand the rest. I was only looking at the first ten minutes and I started to go quickly to look for sex scenes. All sex scenes are lame, hasty and, most importantly, there is no frontal at all. All sex scenes are ridiculous, considering how many clothes they had. Do yourself a favor - drop it and save yourself a few dollars. Conclusion: Story - 0, Sex - 0, Act - 0, Result - 0 out of 10.
