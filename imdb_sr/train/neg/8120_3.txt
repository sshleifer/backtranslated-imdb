At least among those films with 100 or more votes. Nominated for the best scenario written directly for the screen? Brenda Blethin nominated for the best actress in the leading role ?? Nominated for the best picture ?? I always disagree with many Oscars pics, but this movie could be the worst film of all time the Academy honored. Writing and acting were horrible. Especially Bleth's performance was one of the worst I've ever seen, and probably the most prominent acting performance of all time. A terrific film is not worth the big screen and is not worth any cable or television channel that ever played it, including HBO (where I saw it). I am only grateful that I did not pay to see one of the most appreciated films of all time.
