This will be best known for the Ferrari that fell when Eddie Griffin worked on the promotion. The story of racing and betting is badly made by numbers that seem to have a director who could not see the numbers. To a large extent, this is a matter of an affair with a group of actors in it for a salary. This is not a good movie, but it's not bad enough to be seen and end up as something that the movie is not worth anything, no matter how you watch it. Misogynistic, despite the fact that it is one of the guiding women, it's a film that is clearly made just to make the producer and director close to beautiful girls. Do you want proof? There are long-lasting footage of women in almost anything that does not serve differently than it might be for a large number of people who are afraid to rent pornography or sports illustrated DVD swimsuit. Avoid this film at all costs
