This was the worst movie I've ever seen for a long time. Not only does it have almost nothing to do with other American films, the story is obvious, straight and absolutely not funny. Although the girls are nice, but spend time watching a cheap soft porn movie would probably be higher than watching this movie. an ad created for an audience that is not older than 12 years. I've never visited an American college, but I would seriously doubt that anyone who could really laugh at any scene. Save time, do something else.
