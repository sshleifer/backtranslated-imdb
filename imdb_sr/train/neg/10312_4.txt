As an impressive 10-year-old, I liked the philosophy of the 70s series "Bridget Loves Bernie". I understood the controversy surrounding the romantic complications between David Birnei and Irish Catholic Teacher (Meredith Bakter) and both parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Ostervald as Bernie's parents, Audra Lindlei). and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have problems with the interreligious marriage of a young couple. Looking at the show now with years of personal life experience, I am amazed that the performance was even successful for one, even though the season is highly rated. Created by veteran TV writer Bernard Slade, who will write a successful performance "The same time, next year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" a few years after the cancellation of the show, was a very light, superficial comedy that collapsed under its own air weight. Br /> There was no denial of real-life chemistry between Birney and Bacteria. But in later years, both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (Birnei in their short-term role at St. Elsevhere and Bakter in the Families and Families Ties). Here they tried to breathe life into a show that needed a much more comical piece that could lead to complications in depth to a very controversial topic. The broadcast was broadcast on Saturday night between two CBS powers. "All in the Families" and "Marie Tyler Moore". Both shows were smart, funny and had enough edge (more on the previous one) that kept my interest in the situation and characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and only occasionally laughed. This was another example of a performance that really was not as good as I remembered.
