What else can you say about this movie, except that it's just awful. Tina Luiz and Adam West are the reasons why they see this, but that's it, but their talents are futile in this junk. some of Adam's scenes, like when he runs because you can not see his face. If Adam was confused about what is in Zombie Nightmare, just think what he felt to appear in this ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but Zombie Nightmare is a classic (see the first and last version of Misteri Science Theater 3000) compared to this. from the actors. Rip-off The Vild One with Marlon Brand, of course. Tina looks stunning. I hope that Adam and Adam got a good salary !! Pass!
