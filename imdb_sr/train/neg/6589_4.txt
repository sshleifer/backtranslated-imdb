I'm afraid this movie did not like me. Apart from a few rescue mercies, nothing is written home. J-horror has flourished for the past five or six years, but the films themselves were in more than one account were repetitive and carbon samples of previous success. This is one of them. Basically, this is a supernatural slasher movie. The beginning is promising from the frozen scenes from the morgue in which the dead girl graphically sees the eyes, but soon opens them. However, after that, he quickly descends for this film. To be polite, I will start with things that I like in "Gavi". With plus sides, the visual images are great and the movie looks great for its type. For those who love their horror films, there are several beautifully performed murders. We also got some good uncertain sequences. However, there are several disadvantages ... First and foremost, my main complaint to this film is that the shop jumps and jumps forward and back in time with an alarming intensity. Usually, this is not a problem for me, but here, where students look exactly the same regardless of age, I was confused once more. The performances are fine. It's hard to say when you do not know the language), but it looks a little stiff. And for the horror movie, I do not think it was terrible enough. For a while, I was pretty bored. Since I am a fan of giallo movies, I expected a lot of "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.
