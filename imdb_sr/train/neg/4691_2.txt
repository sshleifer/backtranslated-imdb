A real kick in the movie literally. This British film is bored. What an exciting plot! The terrorist puts bombs on the train. How could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a boring story? Of course, just as he was called, his wife, Anne Vernon, will just leave him. No wonder we never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a film, it would be enough to end her career. This elderly man who loves trains and hinders our senile dementia from 1953. I thought it was very offensive to show this man, even at the end.
