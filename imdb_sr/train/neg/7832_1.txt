I barely managed to go through a single episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was stiff and down to the right. The acting was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite his best efforts to be dramatic, remains largely flutterless. His eyebrows point to a recent treatment with botox. Claire Forlani could also easily play a girl in trouble in a silent movie. The characters were caricatures, each of which played its stereo-shaped gear on the ground, a mostly random, curvy plot. Crude special effects can be justified by the budget of the TV miniseries. However, attempts to create uncertainty and surprise through disturbing cinema contributed invisibility. I have the feeling that the end should have been witty and surprising, but it was chrome and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare its overall quality with something else, I would put this episode "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" in parallel with Hercule NBC.
