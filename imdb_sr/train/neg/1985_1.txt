costumes, dialogue, historical accuracy are terrible. For example, - Stacey Dash and a hanging scene. The scab was correct (as I could say), but this type of cunt broke the neck. Ms. Dash was left hanging at the end of the rope without any bad effects until the rope was shot. This species did not strangle the person, killed them at the end of a drop. And before they enter to rob a bank (in a flashback), they stand in the street for a group embrace - with their hide-and-seek hides - that would be obvious to people on the street. Bad editing - it's a battery underneath that shirt and it's obviously a "long ride" showing them driving and then rolling a movie. I liked the sight of the scene with a horseshoe - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was bullshit.
