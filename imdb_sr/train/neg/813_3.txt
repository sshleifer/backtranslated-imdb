The biggest that drives me is to say Zues takes the DUTCH command. But she speaks German to him. Two other people are completely different, as if he says "so he takes the French command" and starts to speak Spanish. Role does not exactly suit him, even if he corrects himself as a comedy. For many stereotyped / predictable things. A typical comment or return. If you do not look at these things, I think it could be a good movie to watch if it's ever on television. But I would not suggest renting it.
