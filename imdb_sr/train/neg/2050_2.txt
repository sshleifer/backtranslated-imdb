It's not that Ulli Lommel's film filled me hopefully, but I must admit that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink under my lowest expectations. Recently, young filmmakers have a tendency to use digital video for their early projects, which is good and good for giving these children the opportunity to create work without spending their money on a more expensive film. However, many of these young filmmakers also realized the idea of ​​filtering the finished film so it looks qualitatively more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really works only for "mockumentary" style, because it never looks like anything other than video. That's where the main problem lies with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching a movie looks like watching a daydreamer about a killer. He does not like to watch a movie. And what's even more inexpensive is that Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He should know better. You should know that it's almost impossible to create horror (or even uncertainty!) On the video. Because of love for God, this guy has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only director who failed to improve during his 40-year career in this business. Fortunately, he also wrote the script! So you can expect complicated actions that do not mean anything unjustified behavior and at least one truly pretentious plot that will leave you completely dissatisfied. Please miss this movie. You'll thank me later.
