They made me look at this at school and it was terrible. The movie is outdated. Episodes become confusing, because the fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. The teachers talked about it as a treat, but it was a painfully boring experience. From them they do what they do in a real-life movie. Also, very often the story becomes mildly exaggerated and exaggerated. I do not like how some lines are written and want to have more meaning for them. Still, it was written to be educational, funny, tense, and hip, in the end it was boring, dry, tense and old. I hope that nobody will take the time to watch this movie because it would be good not to see it.
