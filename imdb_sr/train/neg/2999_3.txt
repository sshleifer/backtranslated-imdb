Another Friday thirteenth ripoff, even with some of his music! A group of young adults gather to gather in high school and start to worship Jason Voorhees. Is it a dumb thing that tormented at school? The end is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher. MPAA: Rated for violence / blood, language, sexuality, nudity and some drug content.
