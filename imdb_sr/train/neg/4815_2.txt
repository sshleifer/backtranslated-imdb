Like most reviews, I've seen this movie called The Vitching, which is the title for reissue. Obviously, the Necromancer, which is genuine, is better but I doubt it. Most of the spells still include most of the scenes with necromancy, and they are still bad. In many ways, I think the added nudity of the witches has at least added some fun values! But do not be fooled - there are only 3 scenes with nudity, and these are people who stand around diversity. No noticeable reddish pump! This film is so inherently horrible that it's hard to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is terrible and straight out of the Trom's cabinet. At least the Troma is the language in the face. This is personified boring faces. The act is variable from Pamela Franklin (Flora, obsessed children in Nevinim would believe!) Worst with her high loud voice. Looks like Velles is just waiting for a check. The other woman's pencil has a creepy face, so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the movie! And the doctor is also pretty bad. Looks worrying as Gene Wilder. It is inadvertently captured when scenes change for no reason, and editing is variable. This is because the witch is a job of copying and gluing, not a subtle one. It's just lighting in line. The sound is also terrible and it's hard to hear with a startling new sound that never closes. The mother of 'ghosts' is equally stupid, but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that she at least gives some unintentional laughter. Indeed, this movie (at least sorceress) is just for the careless. He can not have many healthy fans because he's pretty inaccessible and actually I found him um-numbingly bored! The best thing was when the commercials moved - it's been said so simply better for this poor excuse for the movie LIKE THE PLAGUE!
