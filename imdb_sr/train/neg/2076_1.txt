Well, I must say this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen this year! Jokes were extremely rude (not expected from PG movie) (rated PG in Canada) and they were not funny! With this great acting I at least expected some good acting, but I did not get it. I am the great fan of Rainn Wilson and this is the first time that I was extremely disappointed with his performance. Both Luke Vilosn and Uma Thurman's characters are not at all cute and I really could worry about what happened to any of them. I did not expect it at all, because in the past I really liked the other films of this director (for example, six days, seven nights). . I guarantee you will be like me and I pray that this film will end.
