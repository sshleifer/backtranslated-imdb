This is the worst imaginable shit. Roman H. Rider Haggard is very fun and dramatic. The producers of this worthless film are not closely watched by him. Well, old novels are not sacred, and making free versions of them is fine if I have ideas about myself. If everything can be done, changing things and replacing them with unintelligible and diluted clich√©s, one should keep the original. If they had done this, this film would be at least twice as good as the bad actors, and if it had been filmed in a studio with cardboard cabinets. There is no imagination just about murder. This should only be purchased or watched by collectors of Victorian novels filmed in films. and what can you expect if you decide to watch this on television or - do not give God - spend money on buying this. Gagool is an old witch from the book and some of the forerunners for Golum turned into a good girl!
