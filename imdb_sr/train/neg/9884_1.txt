I was a fan of No tracking from a premiere episode. I really can not express my disappointment in this episode last week. This is the real problem that too many African-American families were facing and who continued to deal with. The lack of media coverage that is crucial in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study. The implementation of laws, including local, state and federal, is also an accomplice. What was the purpose of advertising this topic, and then the outcome in the end? Apparently, television can deal with almost any topic other than RACE. This is embarrassing. Gather it or not explore the next time.
