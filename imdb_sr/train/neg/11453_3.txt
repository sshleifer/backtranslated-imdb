This movie is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I hate these Napoleonic dynamites. They just confronted people that stupid humor was already overwhelmed. Do something new once. All these new comedies are terrible. And the departure from the SNL Andi Samberg is not yet ready for the lead. I hope she can come back from this horrible movie. And the character of Vill Arnetts is simply bad. Hey Vill, did you read the script? The plot is really the worst ever written. Now tell me if this is weird. (This is a film) Rod Kim Kiml has died, and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery so Rod plans this big jump to collect money for Frank. Only that Rod can defeat Franco in the fight and prove his masculinity. Yes, it's a movie, tell me, would you spend $ 7.00 to see that shit! 3/10 only terrible - -adam
