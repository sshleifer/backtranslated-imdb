This film is excellent, but only in a way that tells a very bad story. She stole so terribly rough and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobbish and malicious. Nothing learns better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella realizes that her daughter is ashamed of her cheerful manners and dresses, but she can not understand that she just needs to squeeze everything? I do not think so. She was a good wife and a very good mother. Abandoning yourself, so that her daughter can connect with a bunch of intolerable snobs is disgusting. Much of what we saw could be normal for a time - people have beers or two, enjoy a piano player, dance - but it's made like some sort of moral inferiority. "I can not let our child live like that!" Spare me. This story tells me one thing: an unsupervised working class can never hope to pursue the heights of the upper class. And that's just a burden of stupidity.
