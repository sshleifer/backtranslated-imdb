The Blood III camp is a huge improvement in Camp II, because the sound is mainly in the right places and rudimentary action. This time, they moved a little further away from the parking lot, while the other two films were shot, which is a good move because you can no longer hear cars passing by what should be remote wilderness. This time there is a reality TV show and a fake clown to dissuade competitors. This is not a new idea, I saw at least three other horror films with exactly the same premise where the real killer appeared, but at least this has a plot instead of people who are stabbed with a knife. > Unlike the other two in the series, this is at least good for a few laughs. I liked the sound effect when somebody sneaked early and the way the microphone boom turned around behind people like phantoms. I do not know why someone would want to make a third camp blood film, I would think it would be better to start from scratch, but at least tried this. A half-deformed woman was a bit for me, they seem to have tried to maintain continuity by hiring a freak that will take her clothes for $ 5 just like they did in another movie. They still did not realize that the machete was used for cutting, not stumbling, but oh, that's a movie from the Blood Camp what do you expect? If you love shit movies, you will get the fun of this.
