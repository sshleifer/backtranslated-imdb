It's a disgusting little production, suitable for a nightmare, as well as a headache. It's an ugly blend of live action and ugly animation stop-motion. It's weird, but it's not fun, weird journey that any optimist could expect. It's cold, inhuman, hostile, agonizing, even creepy. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. In the end, Disney did a fantastic job with the same original material. And Cosgrove-Hall has done much more attractive things with stop-motion. Interesting, this is a French production. As such, it intensifies the stereotype that the French do not have a terrible clue.
