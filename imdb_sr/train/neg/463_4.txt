Blonde and Blonde were unhappy. Basically, it was the girl version of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny, and they used too many background sounds and music. It starts immensely boring, and TOTALLI is inane. It will not accelerate anywhere soon, and I felt more frustrated as this stupidity lasted. Perhaps the only thing that saved me from giving this movie is one of 30 It's been a bit of fun and interesting things because it was the end, but it was the only part. Also, I could not but love Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard's characters a bit. Even though this film did not laugh, I would not say that I completely avoid this film, but it has thousands of better movies to which you can spend your time and money, than Blonde and Blonder.
