I watched "Eye" before I was watching this. I really liked the "Eye", it was one of the best movies of recent Asian horror. So, I chose this "Bangkok haunted" because it was the same director, and it was a popular round. But man, what a disappointment ... "Bangkok is persecuted" are three stories of love, revenge, ghosts, etc. Which are not at all intimidating, even disturbing (as was the "eye") ... nothing. I can not even fill the 10 rows required for comment ... 100% bored. My rate: 2/10
