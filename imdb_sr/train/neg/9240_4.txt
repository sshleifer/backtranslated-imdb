The idea of ​​creating a mini-series on Berlin's air transport seemed to me one of the more interesting German post-war films. It's a topic that has not yet been explored enough. However, the creators of this series were filled with clichés. It's already starting with a DVD cover, which is a direct copy of the cover 'Pearl Harbor'. Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) heard that her husband, who is a doctor, (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia after the war struggling to survive. She finds work in an American base, working for the hottest and highest officer (Heino Ferch) in town, falls in love with her, pregnant, and suddenly her husband reappears. Come on!!! We've seen this once often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play a good role; However, it seems that Bettina Zimmermann never convinced her. For some reason it always seems a little too late to give a true emotional reaction to the scene. It simply did not help me. Action scenes with airplanes and air lift, sometimes we are exciting, most often not. It seemed that nasty things always happen to the same pilot. Unless you are a great fan of World War II films, I suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice cream brings much more satisfaction! 4 of 10!
