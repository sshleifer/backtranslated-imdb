Vibrating cyborgs rule the world and use people's blood as fuel, but will be shifting power thanks to the revoked android (Chris Kristofferson) and the warrior wife (Kathlee Long) as they face Lance Henriksen and Gary. Daniels (Who plays kiborge in this funny movie) Of all the questions that have remained unanswered from this terrible film, the most exciting thing is that singer Chris Kristofferson is cast as a Kiborh warrior who is able to deliver a good result. No, do not misunderstand me, I could see Kristofferson as an avenger or something, but not as a cyborg. It's strange that this was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren had to have the wisdom not to do it. However, despite the catastrophic casting, Kristofferson is easily the most interesting thing about the film. He makes the performance far more human than the inexpressible Kathi Long. (And Kristofferson plays the robot) despite the bad thinking, Kristofferson provides a few moments of interest. Lance Henriksen fights and Gary Daniels is lost but basically Knights is a confusing failure. In fear of fear, you wonder who thought it was a good idea on paper. (This is a movie in which the crushed Kristofferson fights the robot in the ranch). The worst of all that ends below, if, fortunately, this has not yet happened, although I still have nightmares on the likelihood of such an event. br /> * From 4- (bad)
