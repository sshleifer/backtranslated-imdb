If, in the first 10 minutes of this movie, you do not realize that the main character, who writes a column with tips for life, have tables - so smartly turned and I learn valuable life lessons then it's probably something wrong with you. The setting is so predictable that it destroys the film, even if the rest of the movie was good (which is not). behavior is embarrassing, it's not funny. It's hard to believe that Binoche's character would have an interest in him. Then, in the end, everything is so wrapped up and all live happily ever after. Is not that great America!
