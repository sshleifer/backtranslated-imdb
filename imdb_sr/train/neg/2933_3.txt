If you read the book - do not place your hopes high, if you are not - go and read it and never watch a movie. It's strange to know that Tobi Young actually took a great deal of writing in the script (as claimed in the post-script book). Because the film is very different from the book. What the movie looks like is a goal - getting a pretty provocative and fun piece that combines philosophical ideas with simple funny sarcasm and simplifies it so that everyone can understand it - is achieved with perfection. The movie is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for sitcoms, and it lost any significant message it could have. It's better that you do not see it.
