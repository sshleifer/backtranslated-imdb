I loved "Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and hoped it would be just as funny, but unfortunately not. Some bits are great. I thought that the sportsman, Champ Kind, claiming his love for Ron Burgundy in a car filled with other members of the news team was hilarious. Everyone ignores him and he gets louder and louder and finally kisses Burgundy that is not recognized. But as a whole, the story does not gel. However, it is a noble attempt to save unused parts from the first movie, including the whole story about some fairly benign future domestic terrorists called the "Alarm Clock". Maia Rudolph of Saturdai Night Live is one of the members and has several funny lines, but basically this unused plot has a good reason not to be used in the first movie. The add-ons on this disc are pretty good, and the best two are rehearsed with a lot of improvised comedies, and a fake commentary with Vill Ferrell and the "ekec producer" that Ferrell discovers early was not part of the movie in any way, shape or form. He turned out to be "the only guy" who walked in the side door of the studio and pretended to be a producer. These are some pretty funny things and last about 10 or 15 minutes
