When I saw this film being shown on TV, I really enjoyed it. I grew up in the 1980s and like everyone else who grew up at that time, saw the movie of the 80's of teenagers and summer camps. So I can not wait to see this film that lies entirely on this film genre. What a disappointment !! The film was nothing more than a bunch of really bad jokes and jokes, over and over again. Attempts by filmmakers who tried to come to dark humor were completely gone - some of these so-called jokes did not come to anything except completely cruel and insulting. The only good things about this film were dressing room, music and acting. It was nice to go to nostalgia and see all the summer styles of clothes from the 80's, and the same goes for music. And the acting was superb: almost all Hollywood comedians were present. Too bad they did not have better working materials.
