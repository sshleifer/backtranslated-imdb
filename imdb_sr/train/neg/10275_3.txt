The premise is incredible, and some of the actors, especially Salli Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but this film is close to the elusive. Music sounds like it comes from some kind of free online site and lyrics as if they were written with a vocabulary rhyme on the lap. Most singing is off. I think they may have recorded with a singing acapel and put in music ... The dialogue is really dumb and banal. The movie works best when it comes to real estate, but unfortunately it often goes to a stupid Farce. I found a check of my watch after the first twenty minutes and after 40, wondering when it would ever end.
