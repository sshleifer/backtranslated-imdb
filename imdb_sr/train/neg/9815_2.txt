This film begins to represent somehow original idea, but later it becomes a big frustration. What is the point of having an original start if the rest of the film did not do much to avoid the clich√© shop? The film itself is incredible. I would like to know how exactly someone enters the clinic, takes the equipment of a nurse, kills a doctor, pulls the patient into bed, puts his Chevi pickup and leaves? I suppose no one could answer this question, so they just jumped to the other scene and hid these little details. The performances are simply bad. Zlikovac is just another "boring crazy antagonist", without depth, of a completely linear character. After 20 minutes of film, most of the scenes are incredible, it seemed as if they were set up only for 90 minutes because they were completely unnecessary. Doctor sees a woman who is clearly under strong drugs, is not allowed to examine her, throw her out of the house and simply leave her calmly? The final scene made me laugh, only Mickey Mouse could get out of reality. I give her 2 out of 10 for the first 10 minutes of the movie.
