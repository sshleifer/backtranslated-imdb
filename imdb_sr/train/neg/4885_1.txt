I should have listened. They warned me, but I paid for it after reading all the reviews, after I knew that the original was "so bad that it's good," and that the other part does not fit into that category at all, and even then then, I could not resist. What happened exactly here? The first part was Urnebesan, he had so much political inaccuracy, and other Crazi, Fat Entertainment, and this one can not easily be a continuation on God's green land, not Basket Case 2, hell, not even Troll 2. This is really the worst a continuation of history, and this really speaks something, taking into account the revolutionary, lower side of the quality of the bureaus of the original. The Criminal Insane part 2 is just a completely different brand of bad. Recorded on video, zero points, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of a flush of the original, and, above all, crazy, fat Ethel has lost some of its volume. I mean, honestly, is this some sort of sick joke?!? Thank you, Nick Milliard. 1/1
