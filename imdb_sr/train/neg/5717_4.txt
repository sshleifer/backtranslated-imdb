Vhoa nelli! I heard a ton of mixed reviews for this ... but one of my departures on hardcore horror was really disappointing. The man was on his nose! This movie was played by pure amateurs. He should have done one attempt, maybe two in each scene, the movie looked soooo hurry. The script was also bad ... they had lines that tried to be unique, but they failed. Miserable. "Get off me!" Oh, man, I hate when movies work. It's always happening with comedies ... but with horror film and under-aged actors ... the results are incredibly pathetic. Lines and scenarios were very predictable. But what made me so negative about this movie is, again, a goddamn act. It was awful. Except for the little Asians who worked on the stand. I thought it was great. The film is about 5 stupid tourists who are on vacation in Asia. They end up in the wrong place and fall into the hands of mafia sex / slaughter. Sounds like a cool story. But looking at someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and more intense for watching. The only reason this is considered horror is murder. There was no sign of tension. I love many other horror fans who have died to get their bloody gloves on this. But, unfortunately, with huge capital U, the film was incredibly disappointing. I enjoyed breaking ankle and blood effects. So skinny chickens were so. <br /> All about this movie screaming amateur. This is the first length of Ryan Nicholson, and most of all he failed. You can not deny that he has a sick sense of humor and a taste for horror. I pray that his next film does not appear as the second B horror film ... unless it tells us that it will be. Even after this disappointment, I'm ready to give Rian another opportunity. From what I saw, he is a true, dedicated man according to the genre. Good luck next time, because this is bad news.
