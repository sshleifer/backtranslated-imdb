This film is not only poorly scripted and directed, it is simply unsuccessful. A beautiful novel is horribly wrongly depicted in this film. Many changes have been made in the story, probably in order to rationalize the timeline. But what is the result is simply confusing. The act can not overcome a script that removes motifs of characters for their behavior. In addition, conversion to English does not work when everyone relates to the Esteban patriarch as ESteban. Terrible. Please, please read the beautiful novel, if possible, in Spanish. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. This will destroy what might be a wonderful experience.
