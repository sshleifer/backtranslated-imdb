I saw "Rachel's Attic," thinking that I will be viscerally pleasing, driving. However, this was not the case. Visceral, yes, but comfortable? That would be great, big, no! In fact, the only reason I gave it to "3" is the fact that Gunnar Hansen appears (ever so short) as one of the convoluted characters of the film. Since they have ever lured Mr. Hansen into this ... job, I will never know. The idea of ​​a story is interesting, but poorly derived. The direction is pedestrian and the acting is central. Only the worse are the special effects. IIKES !!! I've seen better effects at school. Cancel, g. V, it's time to change your career ... I hear they're hiring Mel's Diner! There are very few, well-made, Indian films coming from Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
