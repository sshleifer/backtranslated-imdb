I came to this high-expecting film. I was familiar with Greenavai's work and 'Storm' and I was interested in the adaptation. First, I wanted to turn off after ten minutes, but I thought it would be unfair. There was a storm representation, but where do you think you imagine a little boy pissing over a toy boat? That's symbolic for what? I continued for another ten minutes until my finger swung over the 'off' button, somewhere I would be interested in something. This is not Shakespeare, it's not a movie. There are times and places for that, but I will not waste my time and there is no room for it in my studies on Shakespeare. After twenty-five minutes I gave up and it was the end. Then I read all the comments on this website and the pretentiousness of the film coincides only with its defendants. "His picture ... then put it in a gallery", "It's a ballet ... then it keeps it on the scene." Shakespeare can be done intelligently, and performances performed for a mass audience, were available, and this version helps to wedge between Shakespeare and the general population - and I do not think Bard would be happy with it.
