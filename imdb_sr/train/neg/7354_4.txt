As complementary to Hammer, I was scared of the time when I will have to raise the courage to watch this movie and the one that follows, Holidai on the Buses. I saw One a Buses movie and I considered it one of the worst movies I've ever seen. She was full of horrific comedy that tortured British TV screens around the early 1970s. I do not know whether it was because I am now familiar with the characters and I enjoyed it in some situations, knowing how they would react. I found Blake particularly laughable, although I could not swear in the trilogy in any way if he says his sentence: "I'll bring you Batler". wear and these three films can be compared to the early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, in the fact that the second shot is the best (although that's probably the only way they can be compared). Only people who would like to watch this movie are probably fans of the TV series, who will undoubtedly enjoy this, and Hammer like me. I would say to the complicators that this film is not so bad and that I can certainly imagine even worse Hammer comedy.
