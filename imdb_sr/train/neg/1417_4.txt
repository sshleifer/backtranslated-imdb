While on holiday on the beach, the red-haired brothers Michael McGreevei and Billy Mummy (like Arthur and Petei Loomis) have a seal. The guys baptize their critique "Sammi", and spend the summer frolicking with the sandy sea lion. When the time comes to go home, boys begin to suffer from separation. Младший г. McGreevei decides not to return Sammi back to Disneyland? er, "Gatesville" - or, young g. Mummy's packing him anyway. At home, they are trying to hide the "Travel Out" from adults, and of course ?? hijacks ensue! **** Sammi - The Vai-out Seal, pt 1 (10/28/62) Norman Tokar ~ Michael McGreevei, Bill Mumi, Robert Culp
