I do not remember the film in which I was less worried about where the characters came from, what was happening to them, or where they were going. I realize that Hollywood's greatest fun is staring at the navel, but these people are either too overwhelmed or too boring to take time off. As much as it was worth, the discussion that followed the show, under the aegis of the Cinema Cinema series, made it possible that three women might have shown some redeeming features. I do not agree.
