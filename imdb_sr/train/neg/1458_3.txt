The last cover of the DVD (missed when it came out) welcomes Hitler - Rise Of Evil as "The New York Post" and "Mesmerizing" (Nevsveek). Well, it does not matter Post, but really, who ever wrote this word in Nevsveek in the same context with this peace, then, art should be released. I do not have anywhere to start. Why try to paint a picture of Hitler's evil that did not exist? He was wrong, but now his figure is depicted in a way that is often historically inaccurate (compared to his love of animals, the mild and submissive way treated by women) and so on. Actors are fine, so you have to pity them, because they are closed in their one-dimensional characters. Some kind of curse here with Peter O 'Tool: This is the second time in his honorable career when he ended up playing an old and failed leader in an unsuccessful movie (or, in this case, TV production, to be accurate). The first one, of course, was the legendary Galigula. The list of historically inexplicable scenes would fill 1000 words that allowed the IMDb, so I think I'll leave it here. This is ok if it's on TV and you have nothing else to do but believe me - it's best to leave it on the shelf at Virgin's local store.
