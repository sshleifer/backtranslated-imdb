Not as bad as it is attributed (Hooper has done much worse) ?? It disappointed me more. Such a fantastic concept, which Hooper never really used with his economic direction, and even less in smiling writing. She is so mean and overwhelming in a deadly serious tone, becomes ridiculous and irreconcilably allowing the entire pessimistic narrative of secrets / conspiracy to easily telegraph to end up with something totally abrupt. As a result, the pacing continues quite slim, and Brad Dourif (cool to see it in the leading role) appears to be struggling with unbalanced performance, despite the accumulation of an imaginary unusual intensity with his off-color character. Although cheap, there is a competent technical attitude towards it. However, it seems that he does not go anywhere with his own idea and wants to gypsy in nasty strokes (what some do) and strikingly packs special effects (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper displays some stylish frenetic images (more in relation to the other end), and camera work is quickly maneuvered and the result is brilliant. The performances went through the whole action with the performances of Villiama Princa, Cinthia Bain, Dei Ioung, Jon Cipher and Melinda Dillon. Also, Geroge Buck Flover and John Landis have a small but fun cameo ?? especially Landis. Nothing is surprising, but it is very attractive.
