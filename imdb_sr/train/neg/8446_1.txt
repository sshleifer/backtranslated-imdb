Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where I was laughing? There is no hint or shadow of the idea. The three leading actors are scary, especially she (I think Aldo) from Sicily who can make a Sicilian accent !!! Not to mention the dream of Dracula ... just another means, drawn from the worst cabaret tradition, that this "movie" takes a little longer. Massirons and Littizzetto are doing what they can, but this so-called movie was indeed too hard to rescue. I would give her "0" / 10, but the lowest score was 1/10 and I had to be overestimated with one score.
