Who ever wrote two or three great reviews was or was involved in making this movie, a term that was used loose, or a bank that threw it, and if that were the case, I'd like to return my seven dollars! Actors, who are once again called loose, are terrible, in fact almost none of them did anything that was once again a relief. Landscape and screaming about it, we had $ 7 to work and one day to do it. Is this taken in a courtyard? Everything about this project is a small budget. The best actors were D list. Do not waste your time unless you want to get it back and try to get back the hiring. The bad guy looks like that 70-year-old punker who ended up married with his grandmother dummye moore. My local video store lists this as the most frequently returned movie with attached sad comments. Even as a 99 cents lease, this film drives dust. Someone really had to owe some of the services. This is a super stink and I give him 10 turds.
