This is at least the third remake of this movie, so if you watch it, there's a feeling of deja vu, do not be surprised. All they did was change the setting of the story and tell her differently, but the differences were not significant. And it does not get better, because the plot is wrong. He never works. And like its predecessors, acting is central. The action has a unique ending that will surprise anyone who has never seen a video before, but the ending does not fit into the story. If this film had finished ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and it was very satisfactory and I would think it was more valuable. But here is the spoiler and that ultimately crime does not pay because the criminal is not caught. I never like this message that stems from the movie.
