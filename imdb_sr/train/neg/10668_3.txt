This movie had some great actors! Unfortunately, they forgot how they behave. I was hoping that the film would be better, but the acting was so robotic that from the very beginning it was doomed to failure. The actors seemed to read from the script all the time. Maybe it was a music party or a director myself, but one thing is sure that the makeup artist needs another job! Face powder was so thick that you could see it on the faces of the actors! I would not recommend this film to anyone, no wonder it never hit the Theater. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Voods shy away that you did not do your best. The plot was great, it just needed a lot more.
