Madhur gave us a powerful movie Chandni Bar in the past. His next film was one of the worst films of all time. This obviously speaks of some high-class people in India. After watching a scene in which a man forces another man for sexual reasons to act in a movie. I felt like I spit and smash the DVD. I'm accidentally. The reason why the film contained scenes of child pornography and abuse. I literally recovered and I was shocked watching a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing things, there was no need for children to be completely naked. One of the rich likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people, the British people in this movie. I am shocked to know that this film was Hit in some parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in the UK, USA and Australia. I am from the UK, and this kind of thing is troubling me, it should not be released in the UK.
