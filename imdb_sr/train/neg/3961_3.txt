What a dog movie. The performance Noni Hazelhurst is pretty good, but it is in the middle of a jungle of disgusting scenario scripting, central direction and woodwork from most actors. Many characters are sadly mistaken, especially when they were overtaken by Colin Friels. Very few papers in this pretentious smack. Much of the "character development" takes place through crazy voice and often completely contradicts the behavior of characters on the screen. In fact, it's hard to even figure out who the voice is talking about because they describe the different characters to those seen on the screen! How should we know that Colin Friels (Java) is meant to be a cunning, violent and unreliable junkie? One of those stupid voices tells us. For loud crying, the nature of its character is half the point of the movie, and the only thing that gives us knowledge is a rolling voice! The real killers are the characters. All about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the shelf, despite the fact that they keep remind us that they are intended to be artfully poor. Everyone is absurdly good for "drug addicts". No one seems to have a real understanding of life on skates or fists, and yet this is the case with most of them. The Monkey Grip does not deserve more attention than the movie movie matinee. As it is, perfectly well recorded and technically presented, but a terrible drama based on clich√©s, which shoots so broadly that it is possible and meanders for hours without going anywhere. At least Noni comes to a birthday suit at every opportunity. There is no other reasonable reason to withstand this trash.
