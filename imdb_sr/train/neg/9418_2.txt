This is a bad movie with a problematic history of cuts and reappointments. It does not work at all. First, dramaturgy is all wrong. First it moves slowly, and then it moves quickly and unsatisfactorily to the end. But there is (and this may have to do with cuts) an uncomfortable movement between genres. It begins with a thriller that is taken at a nominal value, and then degenerates into a Farce, not in a satire. The ending may be ridiculous, but it's so blunt that I almost felt it offended by my intelligence (the little bit that exists). So, the movie is trying to be everything, but it fails at any level. You can see this in a very unstable character development. You almost got the impression that Conneri plays three roles, not one.
