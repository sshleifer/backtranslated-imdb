Shecki, the damn legend, does not make a mistake. Until recently I worked for the HiFi & Video retail chain in the UK, which led their testing department. We would go through many new beginners, they would be expected to learn how to find different detritus, which in one way or another returns from stores. Now, in order to test the determination of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this movie, because whenever someone who bought a certain model of Goodman's DVD player who had this movie as a free gift, returned his DVD player back, they never managed to send Shecky back. Our new staff will be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these error machines until they find a disk or two of them to test with. Now, why is this film so bad, where to start? Adam Sandler, who can be so, very funny, like in Happi Gilmore, or Vedding Singer, must have had an incredible day. The rest of the crew smelled, and what about Billy Zane? His name appears in some of the worst movies of all time, and he's a decent actor. Crazi. Production quality is absolute zero. I would be inclined to give this zero if I could, because they did not even have the courage to call it the full name 'Indestructible Shecki Moskovitz' on release. Even so it's worth watching so you can see how much Sandler came in and how low it can go.
