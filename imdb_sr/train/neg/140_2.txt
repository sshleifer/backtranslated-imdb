Valentine is a horrible movie. That's what I thought: <br /> <br /> Actress: Very bad. Katherine Heigl can not act. Others were not much better. Story: The story was fine, but it could have been more developed. This film had the potential to be a great movie, but it failed. Music: Yes, some music was pretty cool. Name 'Paige Prescott' 'Identify Prescott? Conclusion: I do not see Valentine. It's a really stupid movie. 1/10 <br /> <br />
