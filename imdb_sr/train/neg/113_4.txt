Today I found "Everyone laughed" on VHS for sale. It was very old and very used VHS, I did not have information about this film, but I like the references listed on the covers: the names of Petar Bogdanovic, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten have attracted me, the price was very low and decided I'm risking and buying. I searched the IMDb and the User Rating of 6.0 is a great reference. I looked at the "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? vov ?? four stars! So, I decided that I can not spend more time and I can see it immediately. Indeed, I just finished watching the movie "They All Laughed" and I found it as a very boring film. The characters are badly developed and I spent many minutes to understand their roles in the story. The action should be ridiculous (private eyes that fall in love with women who persecute), but I did not laugh with the whole story. Accidents, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with women falling as if Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Cloonei is quite funny. Ultimately, the greatest attractions are certainly the presence of Plaiboi's central part and co-star of Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered by his wife after the release of this film, and whose life is featured in Star 80 and Death of a Centerfold: Dorothy Straten Story; incredible beauty of sexy Patti Hansen, future Mrs. Keith Richards; always wonderful, even fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo," Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like it, Roberto Carlos is the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 1960s and his fans call him "king". I will retain this film in my collection only because of these attractions (male Dorothy Stratten). My voice is four. Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ("A lot of laughter and much happiness")
