Reasons to watch the movie: 1) Bo Derek at 16 years looks good and occasionally naked. She does a pretty good job playing immature, insecure 16-year-old beauty, actually 2) Many photos pretty Greek island Ali: <1) Peter Hooten turns into the worst performer of the actor because Brutus played Caeser's friend in the "Roman Senate Proceedings of March 15". It delivers every line in the beautiful baritone below. Reduce the volume whenever it says. Preferably all the way to the end 2) The fantasy booms are sadly pitiful, especially according to today's standards. A few turns in the bath and as a fully trained model 3) The plot is a skimpier of Bo's costumes
