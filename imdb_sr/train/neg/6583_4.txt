An interesting idea and a story that has not completely succeeded. When you look at a movie, you may feel unhappy with the ending like myself. I did not know who to fit in the movie, Taie Diggs looked bored as a detective, the other characters look so one-dimensional and unpleasant. ) was more a beautiful girl, maybe we really enjoyed watching the action unfold and the perpetrator was brought to justice. The problem was that she was as cowardly as other girls, turning from a sweet to a shameful opportunistic cocaine. I can not understand the moral message of this film, and as a detective story and thriller does not work.
