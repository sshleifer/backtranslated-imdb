Had there been no Barrie Diamond and Art Evans performances as clueless stoners, I would not have reason to recommend this to anyone. The action takes place around a 10-year high school meeting, takes place in a presumed abandoned high school (more resembles a propeller from a low budget from the 1950s), and a disrupted student who was in the class took out a very traumatic joke. This student wants to kill the whole class for revenge. John Hughes is too in love with his characters, because only one student was killed, as was the lonely lady (Goonies' Anne Ramsei). We believe he is horny, but he never sees an explosive thing! This is a horrible movie that continued the National Lamp spiral during the 1980s and 1990s.
