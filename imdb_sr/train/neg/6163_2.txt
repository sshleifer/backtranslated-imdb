Hooper is not funny, not hungry, not romantic and not informative. No real drama. I would think that the film about the world's greatest stuntman would have some drama, it was an attempt, but it did not seem real. No character studies, no lessons learned, did not even look as if the actors really entertained, they only try to behave as if they were having fun. There is no reason to watch unless you like to watch Burt and want to look at Salli occasionally. The prancer was a wonderful horse and he did what he needed. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoki and Bandit were such a fun film I was willing to like Hooper. This film proved to be a real disappointment and a waste of time
