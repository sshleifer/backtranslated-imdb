What a horrible, awesome, film! One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I usually love movies like this one, the whole "Man realizes the eccentric woman he loves, but he already accidentally meets someone who is not for him ....". I expected something predictable and did not bother me. Films are always fun to mix the true amount of romance with comedy, but not this one! Every joke falls flat and "romance" makes me vomit. The title character is one of the "please kill me" characters I've ever seen on television, "an eccentric woman" is not very eccentric, more like weird and boring. "The Other" is the most intelligent, mature person in this film, but it's also boring. This movie is bullshit, there is no way to get around, do not waste time.
