Have I ever seen a shockingly incompetent movie? I can think of a lot that is equal to the wrap, but none that managed to outperform. Actors are all horrible stereotypes, which grew in a straightforward dialogue. I'm ashamed of all people involved in this. Each of them has an expression of fear that did not arise due to complications, but he realized that this project could easily overthrow their career. Even Diaz's many charms do not provide an adequate reason to undergo this. Avoid, this is obviously a style of film that the Americans did not really understand. Watch the final result if you need to, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DO NOT say I did not warn you ...
