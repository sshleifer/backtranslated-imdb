Young and attractive Japanese come back to the wrong side of a curse, this time it includes mobile phones. Various people are dying until the discontented ghost behind it digs out, so in essence, if you've seen more than two recent Japanese horror movies, you can shoot this movie in the dark with bound hands. The main attraction is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far, I have been impressed with his works such as "Citi of Lost Souls", but as I missed one call, I am a longing for his renowned envelope that pushed Dead or Alive or too pseudo-Cronenberg style Audition. Despite the fact that many of his films are essentially empty, at least they have merit such as these, or at least something that would keep your attention as Tadano Asano climbs in the shimmering quilts of Johnny Depp. There is none of this in one missed call; there is only a little merit: the acting is smooth and average, there is very little (nothing, honestly) on the path of fear or uncertainty, and in places it is simply quite boring. However, there are moments in which Miike's glacial sense of humor penetrates through mild commercialism; the most striking case of a TV show with the intent to record the death of one of the damned subjects, and the TV programmer is more concerned about his rating than for girls. But in addition, there is nothing to suggest that Miike is behind the camera; The most striking is his usual visual stunt that disappeared without a trace (and this includes his famous upstairs), although it is more likely that he simply did not have any enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One missed call is not offensive. It's just average frustrating. Miike obviously likes to direct. With its tremendous annual results, it is obvious that it will not be 100% worried about all of its projects. But even with that in mind, One missed call seemed to just pay bills.
