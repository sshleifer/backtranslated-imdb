I did not have huge expectations for this movie when I rented it for $ 1 in the video, but the box at least showed little promise with his "killer cut" than "more up! More sex!" You can not be wrong there! Well ... it's superfluous to say, the box is a scam. How did the actors and actresses of this caliber in the Hadas apply for a film so low? useless shit to her boyfriend (?) how to watch the camera on a bad steak. Then a guy is stalking in a transparent plastic mask and caught by another. They cut their wrists for no reason, and you can see when it's cut out that someone drew cuts with what looks like a crayfish. From here, repeat the same theme of the girl that fights The kills are unbridled by the two about 84 minutes. Add one shot. It's Soul Survivors. I would not have had a problem with this movie that the box did not deceive me to rent a movie. If I rent a bad movie that claims to have more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! One full frontal shoot is 85 minutes from a chick that is obviously androginous and upset so as not to scare the child without cutting. If this is a Killer Cut, what is a theater cut ?! Of course, I doubt that this garbage was actually put into the cinema. Shame the actors in this movie. I could see them appear on the screen because they did nothing earlier, but they were all set up before it was published. I do not know if it was shot before they were all set up, and the studio was sitting on the movie until they were half-big names or not. But what I want to know is ... that they actually spent $ 14 million on this movie?!
