The words can not simply describe how horrible this movie is. I watched him on the video last night and I just could not believe what I see. Basically, the "Snakeeater" is about a former soldier (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for a kidnaped nurse detained by Redneck in the liberation style. Acting, writing, directing, photography and film editing are sad with the song "Soldier" which must be one of the worst theme songs of all time! However, there is one treat. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Velcome Back Carter" is in a movie that plays funny bad guy. Otherwise, avoid this mess on ALL COSTS.
