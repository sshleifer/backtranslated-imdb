This is, without a doubt, the only worst movie ever created. This is not discussed here. That's it. End of story. The story is a minor and sub-moronic, it looked like it was created by a three-year-old fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is simply stupid. It's inconceivable that someone could think of something so stupid and think it's fun. Jokes are also totally lame. If you have not seen this movie before, consider yourself lucky. If your morbidly curious how bad this movie is, do not make me describe it. The words can not express how horrible this film really is. This is not just as bad as a bad movie. Even they have cohesion, if not fun, value. This. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply its level of badness with 5,000, and you still have not come close to how horrible this movie is. After Pokemon gave the film one point, giving this film one point seems like nothing less than charity. It's so bad. Did the producers and directors even go to the movies? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. It seems that some amateur high thinner made this film. If you have rented this, please return it and request a refund. And do not think about renting it again.
