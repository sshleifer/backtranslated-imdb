The film "horror" made for the TV movie began to be very interesting. I was really intrigued by the story and mystery of the film. But the end was a total disappointment. The film took place at a rapid pace and it was built up, it seemed as if it did not matter, to a very climatic end. But guess what the end is. The film is over and after almost an hour and a half the audience just wondered what happened. Why were all the unanswered questions in the film unanswered? There was no explanation for any of the key points in the plot. This movie is like watching a mystery of murder, and then you never discover who did it. Veri dissappointed. This movie seems to be as if the producers were running out of money and never finished filming. A real bomb!
