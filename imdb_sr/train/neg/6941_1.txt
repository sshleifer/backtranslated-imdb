This film is not only boring, it is also very bad. The graphics are so bad that it's not even secondary - it's terrible. The characters do not show any facial expression, the acting is empty and without the soul, and the action absolutely does not have ... and ... nothing and everything. My five-year-old likes this - but she thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
