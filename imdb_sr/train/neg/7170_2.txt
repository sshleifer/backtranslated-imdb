Iikes made this film blow. The characters were weak, the action was weaker. I thought this could not be bad because Christopher Valken, ups. He must have done this because he was bored and needed money. The characters should have been the Irish, but nobody had an Irish emphasis. I'm desperate to find something nice about it, I can not, except that Woken did a good job with a wooden figure. Find something to read or watch the discovery, never watch this movie.
