I saw this film two weeks ago at the "nouvelles images du Japon" festival in Paris. Although I did not expect much from it, I must say that I was disappointed, like many people in the audience ... if I wanted to summarize how I feel, I would say the monk and princess from the beginning to the end. Of course it's stupid. But I could not help it. The stories are quite different, but the pictures shown in the picture are very similar. And from this point of view, the "tree of palm trees" definitely can not make a comparison with Miiazaki's masterpieces. Even if technically fairly good, it remains so far ... at the end, due to the complete lack of originality, I advise you not to worry about it. I rated it 2 out of 10 (a bit rough, I suppose it deserves 3 or 4)
