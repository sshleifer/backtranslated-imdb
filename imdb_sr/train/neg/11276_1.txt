I will not waste my time writing much further on how each aspect of this film is indescribably bad. This has already been done very thoroughly, many times. The "plot" began as a very inspiring broadcaster / gangster in terms of numbers and quickly dropped into extreme ruins. Anyone who pretends to see some hidden masterpiece in this terrible mess just jokes. It's been seven or eight years since I watched it during my weekly running at the cinema, before it was withdrawn, but it's in my head that I'm the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I'm just making these comments, and indeed, the only reason I went to watch the movie is because of the fun fact that my brother Eddie appeared in him as the other 'heavy' in the pub scene. His hands were pushing a zippo lighter to Rhis Ifan's face at a bar in 'Russia' (actually he was filmed in the former Butlins vacation camp on Barri Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience - he recently joined the Statistics Agency and that was his first part. Seeing a movie, no one seemed to need any acting experience in it. I recall that in the entire cinema there were about 8 people - and that was only a few days after it was released. . I've never heard of another movie that was so unpopular and so quickly gone - and that's right. In case you are thinking about renting this movie on a DVD, I advise you to put your coins in the fire until they warm up, then stuck them in the eye. This will probably be much less painful than watching a movie.
