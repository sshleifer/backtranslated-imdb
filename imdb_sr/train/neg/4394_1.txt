John Goodman's program was pretty terrible, but this thing is just stinking. The only thing in this mess that I was laughing at was the recognition of Patrick Starfish's voice as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by someone who has distorted memories of childhood rebellion, but never got the meaning for adults in perspective in the meantime. Paranoia dominates the dark world in which these characters live. Everyone is uncomfortable and without a reason. The action is predictable, but the show is lurking from an unexplained, unrelated scene to another in such a senseless way that it's not fun to watch it. The worst thing is that nobody in the production team has ever seen snow!
