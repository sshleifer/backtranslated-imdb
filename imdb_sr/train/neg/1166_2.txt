Seeing Versus before, I had great hopes for Alive. The description of the film on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising. Life did not deliver. VERY slow development. A lot of potentials with actors and cool visuals. The premise was intriguing, but the payment did not compensate for the construction. It could have been much more done at the end. Most movies are just "sitting". Simply put, the three of us were forced to sit down and watch this movie, and for 50 minutes we were bothered to finish it all the way. It really needed more shock elements. If you're looking for an Ichi Killer or a Versus combat type, then save a little bit of a lot of disappointment.
