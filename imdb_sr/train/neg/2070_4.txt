After too many bad memories, I switched to this episode every time she appeared in season 2. I recently looked at him again just to remind me why. I always thought it was the worst episode of ST: TNG (with the exception of "Shades of Grey", which can barely be considered an episode). I constantly listen to the awkward dialogue and thinking script written by the writing master 101: "SHOV, DONT TELL!" From the statement of Deanna Troy and the constant reminders of others about how charming, dangerous Okon, Guinan's explanation of how funny her droid's joke (not), who is concerned with the solution to the conflict, is not the highlighting point that is not emphasized and triple-underlined for our teaching, and there is no compelling moment in any of them. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too much a dog-dog that can be grunted to be the center of complications. On the other hand, it might be that none of John Barrovman (Jack Harkness from "Doctor Vho") would be able to withdraw that reserved role in the role. (Zero points, by the way. While I think that Joe Piscopo has stopped to be funny a few decades ago, he and Brent Spinner had nothing to do here, although Jerry Levis was ridiculous in a dumb way. Good afternoon, you may be able to imagine this as a charming little respect for the smaller episode of the Original Series. I, rather, will skip to "Time Skuared" or "K Vho."
