There are no words to explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply defies the description. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victim's mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so weird that it's amazing. There is a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer talks through a hand-held doll !!!!!!!! I do not make these things. The computer also controls things like cars, even if nothing connects the computer to the vehicle. "Film" is a total garbage. Surreal bad trash. Spectacular, uniquely bad trash. There are many sex scenes here and there, which are not very hot or erotic. There is even one scene in which a woman seems to lead a love or wants to kiss French tarantula, which threw me on the floor. Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Up there with an equally miserable direct video BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEIMAN II (both NIGHTMARE VEEKEND and BOOGEIMAN II have toothbrush scenes!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to figure out everything that's going on.
