This film is painfully slow and there is no complication. It conveys the lives of a group of shipwrecked people. One of the elders is sincere in an attempt to get a job. There may be some social comment here, but he's messed up because no one was painted in a very nice light. I watched the whole boring thing and built the expectations for a huge redemption. No luck. IMDb rating has always been a good choice for my tastes. It was worth looking at something above 6.5. And my wife says that Havier at least does not look good in this movie either. He is not my type, so my agreement does not mean much. Sigh. I'm giving him 1.
