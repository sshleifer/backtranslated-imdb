The show echoed the 'bubbling' sound effect that used me to sleep. A very calming show. I think I may have slept through parts where there was danger or danger. I also heard some recorded footage of a sponge show recorded in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I suppose Lloyd Bridges never stops. I only remember the performances in the reprise and although this was never exciting, we would make our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother's house ... imagining the sounds that echoed and spoke about our adventures. I thought Flipper had a better underwater action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural surroundings.
