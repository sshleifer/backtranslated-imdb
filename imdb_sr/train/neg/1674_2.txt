The premise was intriguing, but unfortunately this movie simply does not make any justice. Casting was pretty good, and it was shot nice - but the stylish majority of the direction was inconsistent (excessively fast assembly was done to no effect ... I waited for Steven Bochco to run for credits that followed the advertisement), the characters were identified exclusively using a coke screen on the screen (and almost everything else left to develop the character Boogie Nights), as well as having no character characters that would attract the viewer into the story. A very forgotten movie.
