I basically enjoy Bilal's graphic novel when he came out, and I was stunned when I saw a trailer for this movie, and even more when I discovered that Bilal was directing him. The film, however, was a great disappointment. Visual images are nowhere near the rich and persistent texture of original artwork, and the story is badly told. Bilal seems to have decided to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he does not do well either. The most attractive part of the original graphic novel was the relationship between friendship and hatred between Nikopol and Horus. Both were out of their right time and place, forced together by circumstances. Most of all, they were fun and cute. Not here. Nikopol has no visible personality, and Horus is a pompous chatterer who just wants to relax. Although the film is French, Horus does not have to be! We all watched the movies we enjoyed, but we would not recommend anyone for any reason. I would not recommend anyone to Immortelle, except perhaps as a warning not to overstate your talent and resources. He was the main narrator, but obviously he is not the master of any visual medium.
