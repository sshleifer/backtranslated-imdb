When you make a whistle-blowing thrill, I believe you need to do everything you can to help the audience to stop believing in order for the film to work. Some of the pictures ("Rosemari's Babi", for example) have achieved this; Others (such as "Necromans") are not and potentially terrifying material comes as torn and stupid. This movie has some atmospheric moments, but about half of the dialogue is difficult to understand (it is sometimes poorly recorded, on other occasions it is incomprehensible), and Orson Velles, who receives the highest charge, has a role that is so much better than him to assume he is desperate for the job. Or maybe just fun ..... (* 1/2)
