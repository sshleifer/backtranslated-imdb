This movie is not funny. He only takes stereotypes about D & D stupid and boosts them. All major characters earn less than 30k a year, everyone lives with their parents, they are all socially retarded and have no luck with women. The jokes are terrible and non-immune, such as two players who beat the black dwarf, because one of them had a KKK that looked like a hood (that was his wizard's costume), and the other was warmed up by John Rocker (oh) how ridiculous , he is a stupid, so he does not know about sports. You may have to be a childish high school student to find any of these things funny. Poorly worn mugs are so painful to watch, but they are obviously extremely cheap. I'm sorry, Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I suppose these are the only opportunities available for the hotties road that has passed its peak.
