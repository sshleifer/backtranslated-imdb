I was excited to discover a comedy from the late sixties that looked at some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, very young Bob Nevchart and, of course, Peter Ustin's. I was so disappointed that I discovered that the film does not work either as a comedy or as a perfect film about robbery. Ustinov plays a small time cheater precisely from a prison that places his locations at a large US-based corporation based in London. Succeeding in the past by a small CEO Karl Malden and technician Nevhart, Ustinov surrenders as a computer expert and immediately plans the "perfect part of the robbery" of the film. To do this, a security system must be passed that prevents unauthorized opening and storage of the mainframe corporation. And here's the problem one. His perfect plan works only because everyone else in the movie is incredibly reliable and stupid. His hefty excuses are taken at nominal value and this must be the only computer center where he does not need to bother with video cameras. Another problem is the robbery (fraud) that takes place in the first 30 minutes of the film, plundering the rest of the picture in the form of dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is, unfortunately, mistakenly declared as an usty's neighbor / secretary who simply can not keep her job. I love Maggie Smith, but she seems too complicated here, too complicated, she asked for more than an awful, physical comedian. Moreover, Ustinov and Smith do not have chemistry together, maybe it's a difference in years, but later a romantic relationship, as it is actually without romance, is still a bit creepy. Ustinov is a co-writer of the script, and then it was considered good, but it seemed to me to be a meaningless, vigorous and sad waste of the great actor.
