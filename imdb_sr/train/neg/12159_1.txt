I can not believe I've been watching this, but I guess I just wanted to know if this movie will inadvertently be more funny and funny to the end. and it is. the peak was the poorest effect ever given by the defense attorney - so that even from the real life even to the fiction story was too strange. in no way can anyone act on this planet before a court like her. and probably the worst prosecutor on earth. why was he at all in court? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove his guilt. A simple search of her house would lead to finding a ring. but do not go. He preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times during the entire trial - that was it. A blond crazy girl got the truth-drugs to prove her innocence, but not Brett. The crazier had almost had the altar Brett in his house who could prove his ill obsession. but do not go again. During the court scene, I felt a silent need to pull the needle out of it and hit her head several times. even the real freaks do not look so stupidly fake as "I am innocent" like her. And what does this film tell us? she never marries a woman with life insurance: as soon as she gets down the stairs, her husband will be thrown into jail, guilty or not. evil, evil people.
