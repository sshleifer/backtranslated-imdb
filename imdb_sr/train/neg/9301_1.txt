Forward, if you want to call them ... <br /> <br /> I would almost recommend this movie so people really see 1/10. Where to start, we start from the top ... STORY: I do not believe in the premise - the film has nothing to do with the abandoned cars, and people who understand well what the mysterious events are. This is basic, go to the movie cabin without any intensity or "effort". SCENARIOS: I usually give recognition to indie scriptwriters, it's a tough job when you start ... but this is crap. The story is straight - it leaves you with no emotions the whole movie. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable with "Voah, you totally scared me" and "I was wondering if you want to ... if you would ... would you come into the cabin with me?" ? "It makes me dig up all my hair, one wire at the same time and feed it myself. CHARACTERISTICS: THE WORLD CRAP !!!! Some have described the characters as straight, I want to do this step I continue to say that they actually have a inverted character arch. They actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start behaving back ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> GLAD: I'm told that the "Voah you scared me" was so monotonous and slow - as if he was rejected. To complain about hours to the actors themselves TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: The 8-year-old would be disappointed with the lighting on this film. Too shadows in the areas are too faded in others. The director should not use light as an emotion until he learns how SOUND: How many sounding guys need to make a really good movie? 9. With so many sounds, this should sound incredible, but it happened quite the opposite. Especially is one scene that really stirs, these guys are driving in the car and the sound of the car changes with every corner of the camera .... SLABA! Learn to use it. In any case, I run out of space for regret ... I rent it - I dare ... Rent it and learn from it ... give 1 grade .. it deserves. Signing ... Amanda Christmas
