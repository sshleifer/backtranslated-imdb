When I was a kid and lived with my sister, she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them. VCRs have just become the object of the household, and we did not have, but about 150 films, and we watched them in hell. The other day I was on sale in the yard and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy any horror movie that I do not have and I knew this film looks familiar. I thought for a moment and realized that it was the one my sister bought. It was sold to him a few years ago at the yard, which I assumed - who knows. I did not remember anything about it and I watched it that night when I bought it and refreshed my memory for several scenes. I'm not sure how I felt like a child as a child, but I'm sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me, and then I would watch and enjoy all this. I am a terrible freak, but there are certain requirements that I would consider it to be "good", and this one was very short. It was one of those conversations and he was talking about deadly guys. What scenes of death begin to use the shadow on the wall followed by the spattering of blood, and if you are lucky, you will get so much. The story is good and I saw a few with similar complications. , so I think this should be buried and forgotten. Do not look at these people unless it's hard for you.
