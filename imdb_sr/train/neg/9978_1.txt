My girlfriend and I were amazed at how bad this movie was. After fifteen minutes, we would call him to a break, except that we were too curious to see if the movie could be bought. It's not. I can not understand the praise given to this movie. Writing was terribly scary and delivered by some of the worst performances I've seen for a long time. One thing that made me especially upset about this movie was that people often talked there. It was an unnatural break between the lines. I understand using a pause to create a feeling of clumsiness (as in Happiness). It was not such a kind of break - it was simply a bad directing. This movie could actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is the best for this movie, because then it would not be noticed even inanal dialogue and bad acting. Mainly I love this kind of tiny movies (The Real Blonde, Valking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but this has failed on so many levels that I consider it one of the worst movies I've been through in the last few years .
