Maci, Ullman and Sutherland were as big as usual. Not even Ritter was bad. How her name was as beautiful as usual. It could have been a good movie. It was terrible for a bad plot. He was completely predictable, banal and boring. From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was exposed as a routine of child color by numbers. The characters were pieces of cut out cardboard. There was nothing new and interesting to say and it was completely overwhelmed over the acting, which was a pity. Finally, the damage that writer scenarios is not a victim. Especially with the "premature" lines of the child, which were completely incredible. Again, only the act prevented a much lower score.
