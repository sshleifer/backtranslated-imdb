Man, who the hell are the people who shot this movie? And more importantly, where can I get something? The introductory scene sets a tone for the film: a woman who has rolled around in the heat of a fire, turning into a wolfhound. And this is not a transformation of American insect Rick Baker, people. We are talking about some of the worst lipstick ever made on the movie. I can only imagine a stoned Italian glue on naked Annika Borel (who plays Daniel, the film's protagonist (is that the case?), And asks her to turn into fur. That's so bad. From here, it does not get much better. The minute runs out while the landscape boasts male actors dragging on Daniela and her condition or something (I can not remember, but the dialogue is so bad that you can not cry). It's ridiculous that Daniel is not even a jeweler, she is a psychopath who goes mentally whenever a man is around (understandably, as she was raped as a child) and thinks she becomes a wolf-like her ancestor (starting scene). She can not even tear off the throat of every man she sees, and she just wants to be loved! Things start looking for Daniel as she meets him and falls in love with a stuntman who does not run her "episodes". Check the assembly here, one of the nicest ones you'll ever see (laughter and grilling after diving your head through the window). Daniela's happiness does not endure as the film takes a cruel turn, is suddenly brutally beaten and raped by a group of bandits who kill the stuntman. Reminding me of "spitting on your grave," Daniela draws bloody revenge on her rapists. This is 100 minutes of my life, I will never return. But hey, it's the game you play when you're a movie monster.
