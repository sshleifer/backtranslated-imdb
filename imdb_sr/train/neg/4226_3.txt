Wow ... I can not believe how ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) really bad. I heard rumors, read reviews - but I had to focus on myself. Well, let me tell you - IT BLOVES !!! The worst act of any film ever made, the duplication that had to be done while everyone was involved was completely futile, incompetent and funny GIG FKS, with no apparent complication, "cinema" that seemed to be burned by my grandmother with my camcorder, weapons requiem are without jokes - made of tin foil - the list goes on and on ... The three are stranded on an island where a bunch of freaks run around with plastic swords. Two prisoners were released together with the rebels of the island freaks, and the day is their day before the rest of the "tribe" haunts them ... it's pretty much ... </ i> <i> Honestly - this is one of the LARGEST films that I've ever had an accident to subject myself to. The budget had to be around $ 200 and it was spent entirely on the FKS (which was not really a bad idea ...). There is nothing that ZOMBIE DOOM could be different from other meaningless scenes from the much-discussed HORRIBLI dialogue above. This film makes other non-budgetary outlets such as PREMUTOS: THE LIFE OF LIVING DEADS looks like TITANIC. Some people can classify the ZD in the category "so bad - it's good" - and I suppose that if you are really drunk or tall and are watching it with a few MST3K-style friends - I guess you could look this way. But not from me. I hated almost everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally terrible and included as a "bonus" on a shock-issuing ZD release) indicative of other works by Andreas Schnais - then he should be banned from ever having to do anything with filming ever again under death penalty. There is a fun kung-fu battle in the second half of the movie, and a lot of blood - so I will give this one a VERY generous 3/10 - Do yourself a favor and skip this.
