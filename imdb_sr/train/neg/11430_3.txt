All right, let me say a new word here: polyphobia: fear of polyamoric relationships. This is yet another long line of films that begins with the embrace of the audience about a kind of troika, just to turn the coin and all this preach about how it is so necessary and the only moral solution. Only one person out of a thousand people understands the joy that can be loved by more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. Remember my words: a few decades from now, the polyphobia will be as big as homophobia, but guess who was too confused to understand it? First time for the first time: the producers of this film. And they like so much. Why even make a funny conservative and old-fashioned kind of movie like this one? Seeking to be infinitely open to gainess, it completely ignores the fact that we live at a time when monogamy turns into a sequential monogamy, which again turns into rocking and polyamorium. Open your eyes, people, please! This is a disappointing, young chicken. (But, damn, I have to say, Heather Graham is the sweetest thing in life.) 3 of 10.
