After being a big fan of the ten-minute TV episode 'Stella Street', I expected this film with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately, I remained very disappointed. I was amazed by the fact that almost all of the edges and one liners were directly erected from the TV episodes, and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comedy time, if the actors once said it, and it was not difficult for them to they say it again. I bought my copy on DVD and I felt cheated that I grew up with my hard-earned money to look at the same jokes again. SPOILERS * The film begins with Stella Street in Surrey Street), gradually settling down 'some of the most famous people on the stage and screen for the past forty years', including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities on the streets ended up with their total wealth by a local fraudsters, and forced to live as bastards and jointly working people. There are some nice moments, but in general, the writers manage to take an interesting idea and the performance is pretty boring. * END OF SPOILERS * In Tv episodes, all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornvell (including women), but Ronnie Ancona is added to the film. I think this was a mistake. Her imitations were not funny, and her characters seemed to be involved in the story just to give her something to do. If you were not a fan of Stella Street episode, you might find this movie fun. But if you were a fan, I think you might be able to distance yourself from feeling that you are a little cheated. 4/10
