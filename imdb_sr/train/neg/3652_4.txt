I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been hit, but I was disappointed with the lack of a DVD menu screen. I'll say that my first reason for watching this movie was Claire Forlani. Although it's fun to watch, I feel that it has not met my expectations that I have found out of her other films so far. In fact, I was equally pleased to see Arkine in a humorous performance. The other two actors were not well familiar, so I can not compare their performance, but they were pretty satisfied. The acting is the only precious quality of this film in my opinion. The line story, although some might say it was unusual, had no direction. I feel that the main problem stems from the script, and not from the direction of this film. If you enjoy one of these actors, then I recommend this film, but otherwise leave it alone.
