The Sixties were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social turmoil and turmoil was a common occurrence when people talked about their attitudes. Racial tension, politics, war in Vietnam, sexual promiscuity and drug use were part of daily fabric and daily news. This film has tried to incorporate these historical aspects into an entertainment movie, and to a great extent succeeded. In this film are followed by two families: one white, one black. During the first half of the film, the story monitors every family on an equal footing through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the other half of the film is almost dedicated to the white family. However, there are more characters in this family, and the stories are intertwined, but the racial aspect of this century is not taken into account equally. the clip is mixed with colors and black and white original recordings to document the film. The film is a fiction, but the clips of famous historical figures are used to determine the time limit. I enjoyed the film, but the situation was predictable and the story was one-sided.
