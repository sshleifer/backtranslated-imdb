An old intellectual is talking about what he considers art in films. You got your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman, and some other things before the 80s. To hide that there is no idea what's going on in the movies these days, he throws into Matrix. But it's not just the same lame movie-artistic speech over again. This speech is reduced to obsolete psychological platitudes: it-ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. It is decorated with a raw effect that Zizte is arranged in the films he deals with. For someone who needs to know a lot about movies, his film is cinematically speaking: isiks. Put it in Žižek's words - I saw it on the screen, last night or, as the big film director says: Mr. (Žižek), what you just said is one of the craziest The idiotic things I've ever heard. At no time in your unconnected, incorrect response you were not even close to what could be considered rational thought. Everyone in this room is stupid now listening to him. I assign you (only) two points, and let God pity your soul.
