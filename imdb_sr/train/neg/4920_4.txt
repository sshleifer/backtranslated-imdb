Very smooth modern (guarding it sensually) transforms the story of Dracula (although it remains with traditional customs) with a rather interesting, if not fully understood story of the Prince of Darkness. When I first tried to watch it, I could have made it halfway before I lost interest. It started well again (especially when it comes to thief scenes, and then encounters with Dracula), but for me it was less when it hit Nev Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. An excellent place to set up, but never used his settings (despite the rippling of paradise in the damn where Dracula might flourish). Produced by Ves Carven (and they threw that name there), but written by / directed by Patrick Lussier. He had his artistic moments with little imaginative dreams, but some kinetic changes and cheap earthquakes do not help. The messy script really gets silly. Lussier makes a polished job that remains pretty glassy, ​​placing a lot of blood (makeup is appropriately achieved) and a lot of "Virgin" commercials. No, I do not mean the virgin, but the music company, as well as the numerous recordings and Helsing's daughter there. Oh, that was not obvious. Soundtrack is a fun choice of rock melodies. Now they are performing everywhere in the store, but there are few celebrities (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlin Munro). Gerard Butler while Dracula simply did not get rid of, because there was not much presence. It was simply overshadowed by court ladies at night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Rian as Dracula's brides. He likes Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Vaddell are fine. Christopher Plummer gives a whipping turns while Van Helsing and Omar Epps are having fun with their role.
