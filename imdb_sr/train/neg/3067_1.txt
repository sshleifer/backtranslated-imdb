This is simply bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they are strayed from the original, are good in themselves. They can bring a different perspective and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and pleasant. It was so badly designed and implemented as it can be. This was not good even when it was. Viggo Mortenson is a top-notch actor, but some of his selection of roles and projects leave something that is desirable. The original "Vanishing Point" was such an exciting, psychological adventure; This is not an adventure at all and it's not fun or fun. This is done based on access to movie numbers, by inserting points for a plot that believes that someone from Hollywood will satisfy what they see as the current film audience. Basically, they see us as a bunch of idiots. It is regrettable that someone will put this as a feature film, and even try to change the cult classic again. Manipulating plot devices, "make-it-obviously-so-do-miss" aspects, ridiculous dialogue, stereotypical characters, amateur ... This is a plain bad ....
