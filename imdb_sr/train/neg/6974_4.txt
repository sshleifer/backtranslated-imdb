The blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film, but not in any way that could make any sense. At some point, some children wander at deeper levels, exploring. They begin to discuss what they will find there and one of them (the girl) says they bet they will find a blue monkey. Yes, it is. Absolutely insignificant for the story, the only sad link to the title, and no idea why she would have assumed she would find a blue monkey in the basement of the hospital. I guess somebody had to remember!
