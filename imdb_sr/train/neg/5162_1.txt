This film reminded me so much of the "History of Violence," which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior, but ended up only as a cheap action movie that turns into a film about thinking about violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British youngster move to a small English city and face endless harassment by local drunks who do nothing but pub pubes all day long and create real problems. Do not these people have a job? After all, Dustin takes everything he can and keeps himself in his house until the end of the film and fights against each of the drunken assailants with such terrible means as sculpting whiskey pouring on someone, and the legs flew out of the rifle and someone caught a head in a bear's trap. It's ridiculous that someone would have the need for such a big beet trap in a small British city, except that it could put a head on it. Sam Peckinpah, who made the "Vild Bunch" that also covered the blood that allowed violence in which no one was spared. But it was done with style, and you believed. Straw dogs are not convinced. First, the site is wrong and does not work. Why put it in England? I might think, perhaps, in some inner city or small town in the American South of the 1930s or something. Secondly, in my opinion, it has never been clear in what way these people are so quick in the violence, unless they got drunk and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. Peckinpah himself missed the sign this.
