Greetings from the darkness. What happened to Barry Levinson? He directed two of my favorite favorites in Avalon and Diner. He also had some fine films ("Rainman"), but he always provided something interesting ... so far. I think the worst thing you can ever say about comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is the definition of annoying. Never a big fan of pure jokes ("Dumb and dumber"), I was just amazed how much this movie really horrible. In the whole thing there may be 2 whispers - if you can pay attention for so long. The best part of the movie is running the head of a Redbone soundtrack. If the film was written as a song, it would be tolerable. Rachel Veisz is a wonderful actress and I realize that everyone wants to do comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world exhibits one weakness. A member of the SNL, Ami Poehler, is common in her role as garbage in a trailer. The film's catastrophe is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work has replaced flashes with some promises, but after that their chemistry disappears due to a bad scenario. This script is like most Black Jack idea - not a bad idea, but there is no hope for success.
