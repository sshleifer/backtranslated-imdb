This show was a loss of 30 minutes of valuable space on the DVR hard drive. I did not expect much and I got less. Not only do I expect this show to be canceled by another episode, I can not believe that Geico will ever try to use EVER cave campaigns again. I'd rather spend the night checking my daughter's hair than watching this piece of garbage. I wonder what ABC has transmitted to incorporate this show into the '07 fall 'scheme, perhaps in realizing the shoah from a hospital / crime / documentary film with the AFLAC duck? In case I fail to express my opinion on this show, let me be clear and say that this is not too good.
