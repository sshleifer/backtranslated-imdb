Where do I start? By the title of this film, I expected a certain degree of authenticity, in the end, I was disappointed. This is not a story about Lale Andersen or the song of Lily Marlene, but about the Hollywood (or the choice of your movie nod) story based on some real characters. I should have had a clue when I heard a tough English accent that gave an introduction to a movie in the German language; red text (title, artists) should be the second trail. The story is made (Lale is not deceived by the parents of Swiss Rolf Liebermann, there is no information that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song was shot out of control of the NS regime, and not under control, the track record at the station was buried in Vienna while a lieutenant etc.), costumes are bad and defective for time frames (SS black uniforms were used by border guards to workplaces, daily daily use was used when the war started, etc.), the characters are stereo types (SA bullies in the club when s basically they were out of force). Do not waste your time.
