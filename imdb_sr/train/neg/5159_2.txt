Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but cakes. At first it looks great, but in the end it does not give pleasure - nothing. The plow is a mess confusion around the toy factory and the power of evil. So, how is it possible that with this basic work and Robin Villiams, the film still turns out to be so bad?! This is because the picture appears without any substance - similar to the terrible Popeie's picture done by Villiams at the beginning of his film career. The film must have cost the whole fortune, but there may not have been enough money to recruit writers who have finished high school. I'm really not sure why it's made - it's certainly not made to provide any entertainment.
