The action, character development, and gags in this movie are extremely weak. Pretty wasteful time. Conclusion Saving Grace should make you feel warm and unclear as if the characters have grown through their struggles. There was no such development that such warm feelings would be possible. The beauty of the drugs is blown up and much of the film is not worth the lifetime. The plot builds what should be a tension, but the characters are not developed enough to care. Then he goes through the solution of all the remaining problems for about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling that they just lost their time.
