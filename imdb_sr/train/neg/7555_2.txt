Do not let this assumption deceive you - this was a funny movie. The problem - it should not have been a comedy. The story sets you up nicely for the end that never comes. Worse, the setting is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking, "Is it?" I estimate that it is simply because there were a few short moments of promise, but it ends up completely flat. Nicholas Cage did a good job as he could be expected to play, but he had very little business. There are strange routines and interesting turns everywhere, which absolutely has nothing to do with the film. Let this one go to the video before spending his money.
