Denzel is the only thing that's right in this movie. Maybe at an early stage this was a better movie. Someone decided to cut out some of the actions and plot points at the beginning of the film, giving the largest part of the story in the first five minutes. This and the destruction of everything that was built in the rhythm and rhythm could have been earlier. So, it puzzles you first and then it refuses you. Dramatization is moved beyond the suspicion of mistrust. Of course there is a feeling of great injustice and anger that films like this potentially manage to seduce the viewers. I agree, that's right, if you're looking for ... get out.
