Pretty decent with some stylish pictures, but a small budget hampers things. I also got the impression that they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic websites with strange internet sites. If you love anime in certain things like cyber city and AD police, then this could increase your street. But essentially, its low-budget cash matrix is ​​not completely deprived of its own style. Great soundtrack for some unknown grunge / punk / post grunge bands. Worth checking only for soundtrack.
