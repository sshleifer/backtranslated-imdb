Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, Big Blue, Dogville) directed and interpreted this strange film, which is the second show of a trilogy. I may be wrong, but I do not think this film is part of the Dogme '95 manifest, although it really looks like that. I'm not sure what I mean about this movie. All actors are good. They perform pretty good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I do not know, I do not like something in the movie. The scene scene is too long. It goes from an interesting piece of art to an erotic piece of shit that I do not know exactly where it stands. Surely this is not a bad movie, but I will not suggest to people to see it, nor will I tell them they do not watch. Do what you want. If you feel curious and open, try, you may like it.
