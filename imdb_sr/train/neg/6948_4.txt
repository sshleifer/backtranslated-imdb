An interesting idea (four African women wounded in a social hesitant revenge by looting banks) destroys the terribly slow direction of F. Grey Graya and a terrible script (Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full of unwanted fun moments. Instead of making a striking comment on the role of an urban woman struggling to remain on the surface in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them, Grays, Bufford and Lanier prefer to discourage their audience with a high-profile opera tragedy. It's the worst melodrama. Grays have their actors who hold onto every tired line, and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to raise a lull, deciding instead to retain his camera dressed on the confused faces of the performer. And they are confused: although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fok has some raw talent (Kueen Latifah is fourth and as an actress she is a great rapper), they need a safer hand than Grey to lead them and as a result, they are released as penetrating and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Clone.
