I read the novel 'Jane Eire' for the first time in 1986. It was a time when I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was a great version and very similar to a book. Years later, I saw this version and was horrified. Villiam Hurt is completely wrong as Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a passionate character, where Villiam Hurt portrays him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is a story of love and passion, but I could not see it in this version. No, back to the BBC version. Wonderful weather is guaranteed.
