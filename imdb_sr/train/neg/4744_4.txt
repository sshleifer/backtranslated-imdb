The worst DCOM I've ever seen. Ever. Well, maybe it's not as bad as a smart house. This was just bad. The acting and story were fine, but the effects were great! They were so fake! The only good fighting scene was between brother and Shen. It was probably the only scene I was excited about. All in all, I found this film very boring and the film suddenly ended. I will give him four for Brand Song which is a very funny actress and this one scene of the fight. 4/10
