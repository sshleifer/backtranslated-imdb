First I would like to apologize for my poor English. I am not a HOSTEL-hardcore-fan, but I liked this movie. Live Feed, however, SUCKED BIG TIME! I've never seen a movie with top-notch acting, but hey, who's surprised? Acting in Live Feed was ... well, not there! I saw some comments, because it had to be a school project or something like that. Okay, but not students in the media or at school acting. It was not a class at all! What about the story? It's really sad getting on the hostel. And what about the mountain? What about the psychopathic scenes of torture that should make your bravery twisted and leave you cold sweating? That was the most disappointing thing about the movie about holes! Short, fast and without edges. More like execution than torture. Okay, where the bins are blood, but it did not look real. Slaughter and violence were more reminiscent of Braindead than the Hostel or any movie from the chicken. And Braindead was fun! Okei, I laughed a few times on Live Feed, but that was more of a disappointment than a pure fun!
