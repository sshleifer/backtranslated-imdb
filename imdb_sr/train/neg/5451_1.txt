Filmfour will have to do much better than this little movie, if it gets a true reputation for itself. This film is set in Glasgow (although only a few secondary characters have something approaching Scottish accent). The premise, about people who live anywhere, who meet in the same caf√© early in the morning, because they have night work, could make a really funny, insightful, strange, cult film. Instead, we have a group of confident saddos and conspiracy that is so made to surprise us that it is not forbidden. Ks and I are friends. Ks sleeps with Z. And also sleeps with Z. Oh, understand that. Totally wasting time. Painful dialogue - sounded like something a 16-year-old group would write for a GCSE drama project. The female figure was completely superfluous - he just wrote as a female in the hope that women would be drawn into seeing him. If you are a guy who laughs with beer ads and can usually be found strolling in a package, shouting at Saturday night in unreleased city centers, then you will like this movie and find it "real laf ". Everyone else, run, do not get away from this little wicked thing. And one question, when the group left the "boring" coastal city (Saltcoats accidentally even though they changed the name to the film), to return to Glasgow, WHY they did it through the Forton Highway in LANCASTER who's in England?
