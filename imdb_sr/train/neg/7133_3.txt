I felt like I was watching Fast and Furious again, but with different actors and a slightly different complication. I'll say that cars in the movie are very cool. So, if you love fast cars, then you'll probably consider this movie to be a little fun. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from the days of our lives. She is a really good singer, but it's a shame that she gave her such bad songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; Not exactly what you would do here. Since this is a Hollywood movie, you have to tell the story a bit, but in real life I do not think that any average Joe would come across such a pretty girl as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a racing car, repair the car and be a singer. It's all very stupid. Another side note, anyone who is willing to invest 25 million in a race for cars is a walnut. But in the end, it was kind of cool when Natasha stopped before the target and turned to Michael. Inexorably. FINAL VERDICT: This film is for freaks for cars. So, if you love fast cars, I recommend this to you.
