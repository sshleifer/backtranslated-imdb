Janeane Garofalo was very public in her dissatisfaction with this film, calling it, among other things, anti-feminist. Also on the radio show she hates to make "romantic comedies" because she does not believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeana here. This movie is at best a little bit. She does everything in her power, but all in all, it was just another boring, incredible "romantic comedy" that has no basis in the real world. While there will be those who will say "stop the disbelief," you are tired of suspending it almost every time you get a romantic movie from Hollywood. Janeane's character, for some reason, is usually shot in the shadows and the dark, which makes him unattractive, while Umin's image is shot in brighter tones (which Janeane is probably unhappy and probably one of the reasons why this film is ignored). It really hurts the movie if we want to buy a premise that Janeane should look better than the two. As many have said here and on other comments, Janeane is not ugly, but actually beautiful. I did not read a review where someone said that Uma looked better. Still, I believe that the character of Ben Chaplin more than likely remained at Uma, not Janeane. Many men do not like really intelligent women (and many women do not like really intelligent men), and unfortunately, Ben would probably stay with Mind. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unattractive, it does not work. Her natural beauty is passing anyway. I think there are many Jane's male fans who are obsessed with her like this movie because they like to think of themselves in the image of Ben Chaplin, and actually score with Janeane. Janeane is much more complicated than the character who plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollivood can imagine), so you have a cold shower of gentlemen. It's the role that Janeane is best known for, and that's a shame, because that's really not good for a movie.
