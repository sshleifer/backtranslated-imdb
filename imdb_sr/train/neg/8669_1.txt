First of all, I loved Raja Bradbury's novel. It's a type of horror that falls under your skin and is held up later. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Vine. I just hope this movie will be fine. He had many chances, with a great acting team, such as Jason Robards and Jonathn Price. And Bradbury wrote the script himself. And above all, there is also PAM GRIER! How can it fail? There may be spoilers. First of all, he was denied. Much of the horror of the book was lost because Bradbury had to be forced to keep the violence at a minimum. All the images from the book ... disappeared. Everything that led you to turn ... disappeared. And then there's the acting. Like many films Disney released in the 80s, children in this movie can not play. And that tormented me very much, none of them seemed like 13, but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like they were familiar. I think Jason Robards and Jonathan Price could do this in their roles of Mr. Halloween and Mr. Darka. But here it's like they do not care. All they want is to somehow pay off a mortgage or something like that. It's far from their best performances. Pam Grier was as good as a witch, but the wizard of the dust itself was not well withdrawn. She is much less evil and has no presence as she did in the book. And everything left from the book. The balloon is a nightmare, the marking of Jim's house, the real death of Mr. Mrak, what happened to Mr. Coogan at the carousel, the fate of the lightning salesmen, the real witch's death, and oh much more. And the special effects were bad, even for the eighties. Dizziness for one thing with the horse-thrusting horses moving around was not really creepy, and that strange green mist that really had nothing to do with anything. I could continue as this film torn the original novel, but it makes the blood swell. Do not watch this movie, but read the book. It's the classic Bradbury.
