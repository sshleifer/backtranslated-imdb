Just because the event really happened does not mean that it will make a good script / movie. The cat's cat, Peter Bogdanovich, claims to be based on the actual events that took place on the cruise hosted by Villiam Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to making bizarre characters from time to create a story for bizarre characters. The key moments of the story seem incredible; for example, when Hurst accidentally shoots a producer, believing him to be Chaplin. Based on the key element of the story of someone wearing the wrong hat, he is swept and fictional. The story tries to be a dark comedy, but the Cat Miahsa misses an important part of this equation, a comedy. Also, empathy for any character is lacking. It does not matter who shot, who was killed, who is guilty, and who is innocent. There is no strong person to cheer. As a result, conflicts are difficult to care and the final outcome is random.
