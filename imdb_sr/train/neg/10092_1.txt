Serious shit. First, the film begins with a cop and his partner who are parked in front of the warehouse / furniture store. The "bad" cop takes the girl they stopped, into the attic of the warehouse, while the new policeman sits outside and thinks about what is happening there. The "bad" policeman comes back with a heavy bag, and the police officer does not think he has any problems, but he still asks what was in the bag, he asks, gets a shit, and then all the thoughts are fine (for now). The "bad" policeman repeats this process, and even once with a titanic scene (he made something better). But at the end of the day, people begin to catch, which took some time, as it is obvious. One girl gets a vowel curse placed on her only in case she dies, like you. Now, a "bad" cop finally kills this magically protected bitch, and then rids the bodies in bags. Since she had the magic oogei-boogei, she returns with a lot of eye shadow, which should indicate that she may be zombie ... also, magical curse causes all other girls to become "monsters for eyeshadow". Some of the girls meet with a guy, who is obviously a currency specialist, and offers them a ride (it looks like he looks normal). But when the girls see other people, like the husband of a girl, he freaks out because it's disgusting (some people are sending, but others do not notice) ... a massive plot. <br /> <br /> So, in order to finish this, monsters of eye shadow kill a "bad" cop, which eventually becomes zombie in the last scene. It's like they're trying to get us ready to continue! It's as if anyone wants to see part 2 of this cow dropping.
