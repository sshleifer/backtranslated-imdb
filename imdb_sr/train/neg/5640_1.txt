I am a big fan of Villem Dafoe, and I really wanted this film (I had to get a Chinese DVD from Region 5!). But it's really one of the worst I've ever seen. Act (except Dafoe) is terrible. Dafoe and Colagrande have written and directed this (although not credited as a director) and have no visible talent for writing or directing. (Hold on to acting Villema; Giada gets out of work, PLEASE) Absolutely nothing is happening. Apart from a series of totally unconvincing, completely unconvincing motivations, these two people (who just met) are in this house. Colagrande is sleepy, I do not care that the term is practically NEVER changing. And the scene of sex is completely lame. Actually, I've twice shrunk to one of them. Iuck! They are definitely not the least erotic, yet they are the only time your movie does not sleep. Then it is taken by refusal. Just terrible.
