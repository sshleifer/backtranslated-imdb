JUDAAI was the brave film of Raja Canvara at the time of 1997 when such a topic was cursed from the box To give him credit, he managed to show how greed changed the person and to what extent a person could go gets what he wants. But the movie is damn melodramatic, in many places funny. You are wondering why Anil does not buy TV for his wife? when he earns so much To show how poor he is? The turn is well processed, but the handling is straight from the 80's. The Johnny-Paresh comedy that entertains here and there stands out as a sick thumb. It does not fit into the story. Even there are several scenes that move in the right direction. Anil works well for his part Sridevi is excellent in his part Urmila is decent Among the rest Kader Khan is as usual John Lever is ridiculous, Paresh irritates Farid
