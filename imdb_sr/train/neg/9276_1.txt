This is a really poor little movie. However, the original (un) holy trinity was governed by the law of decreasing yields with the third, the "Final Conflict" that degenerated into a ridiculous plot about half the film, apparently only to provide the necessary unnecessarily complicated deaths they had until now became the whole raison d'Ã©tat 'etre for the Omen series. But then to impose this sketchy TV movie (watch out for customers Omen Box on a DVD - do not be fooled by the widescreen transmission ratio, that was a tiny bit) on the back of a series of generally fine demonic heaters was unprofitable, especially confirmed he was, by the executive producer and producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvei Bernhard. I would plot if it exists, except for the usual scenes of death (hopelessly reduced for TV sensibilities) and some of the worst performances I've seen. All those who were involved in this project to catering facilities should be ashamed of these travesties ever come to the screen, let alone masked under the name Omen. If one person convinces me to avoid this mess, I will feel better about it.
