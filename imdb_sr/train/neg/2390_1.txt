I absolutely love all the books of Tom Robbins, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books. I knew there would be no way for the movie to shoot even half of Robbins' magic, but after I looked at the film, I made it I would never want to read the book again. The film Even Covgirls Get the Blues does not include the eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love affair between Bonanze Jellibean and Sissi than anything else. With an incredibly low line of complication in the film, I think better actors could choose better actors. The only actors in the film I thought to have played their roles in the description of Robbins in the book were Julian's friends, in their five-minute video at the beginning of the film. Those who did not read the book could enjoy the film, but as a great admirer of Tom Robbins, this film was nothing but disappointment.
