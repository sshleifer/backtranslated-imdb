If you're watching this movie, or you're a fan of Fred Olen Rai, you found it on $ 4.99 in Suncoast and thought "what do I have to lose?" Or you turned around the closed-eyed movie store and rented the first movie that touched your finger. This film is hysterically bad. Everything that has a horrible movie is needed: a scenario that involves dialogue and puzzling bypasses in the plot, a strange science involving psychics and other dimensions, a continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space, actors who are not just wooden, but it seems that borders with a confused, free nudity (not all that you would necessarily require), and, of course, a monster of 5 'playing what I suppose is the kid of Fred Olen Raia. Below everything is, however, something similar to the heart - as if Mickei & Judy decided to merge all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie (hey! my dad can direct it!) Thais! Johnny Dad Shop hardware, and I know that former stripper who can behave in him!). Take care of the discolouration of the reel - you can find out why the final cut of the movie was so shy. By the way, Biohazard II ... Alien Force is also worth a look, but do not have the same pleasantly sanded veneer.
