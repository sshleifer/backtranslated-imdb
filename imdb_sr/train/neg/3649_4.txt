This is a fairly small performance of the paranormal, although it seems that Art Bell and his character have come up with a way to build a career from a stance illustrated by Carl Kolchak. Of course, there would probably be no Ks-Files if this show did not prepare this audience well. Darren McGuin is not exactly a super-hero, but he is an acceptable enough guy to deliver heroic deeds. Look at his work on some of those old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here is the main attraction, there seems to be no girl or woman who interferes. In fact, there is not much sexual attraction in the show. Something I noticed is also that pacing is not really tense in a typical way. There's a lot of humor in this show. Sometimes she just jumps to reach the climax. From this play there is a thread that comes to the present MAD MEN shov in terms of style. Not that David Chase writes Mad Men, but the people who worked under him at The Sopranos definitely imitated and inherited his serio-comic tone.
