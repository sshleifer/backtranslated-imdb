The stars of the stars are some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Ami Poehler and the great Christopher Valken. With such a plaster, one can only expect the best. However, with "envy", nobody could save this disaster. Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and associates in the shramble factory. Both live decent, but since Tim has better performance at work, he is able to afford more than his friend Nika. Nick is a dreamer who always finds new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with an idea for a spray that saves dog food to disappear (Yes, I'm serious). In love with this idea, Nick decides to really invent this product. He offers Tim to invest in his idea and share 50/50 profit. The team refuses to think that the idea will never work. He enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal trainer, and a lovely desert. The team starts to feel envious of Nick. Hence the name of the film. The concept is not bad, but it still turns out to be terrible. This film contains some of the worst dialogues and very bad performances of all actors. Again, as I mentioned before, none of them could save this mess. Even the great Christopher Valken, who played a homeless man named "J-man", made this film funny. The film is bad from the beginning and only continues to deteriorate. I recommend this film if: * you like shit (no intention of playing) * you want to see Jack Black in white beat / I'm saying, avoid this movie at all costs, but avoid SPECIAL if: * you are offended by the bathroom humor * you like animals
