Slaughter A high story of the revenge of a reluctant who has become the victim of one of the coldest and coldest jokes in the history of the film. Unfortunately, after a promising opening, the film went straight to hell. A very boring and redundant mess with middle incisions and the last half an hour that sucked in a completely new level of suckiness. The guy who played the dumbfound killed himself shortly after the film was released. If you want to rent a movie, stop it after a joke and remember, choose life.
