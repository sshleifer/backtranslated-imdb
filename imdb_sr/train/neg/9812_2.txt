Not only did the plot of this film succeed with the ease in which two psychopaths were able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking the sweat, but that was a terrible scourge of 'Misery'. However, the main reason I gave this film with such a low rating was that it was absolutely horrified. I am not someone who is easily shocked by what the filmmakers bring and have always had love for horror, but this film has gone too far purely in terms of violence and torture just to gain points in a shock factor. I think most people, when watching only the first ten minutes' Hide and Seek, you will find yourself getting to the remote.
