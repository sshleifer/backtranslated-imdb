(so-called BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF DEMON) * Spoiler * This was a drive-in function, along with a VAMPI VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production in which a series of women in one village is killed approximately at the same time when a local Countess named Ianos Dalmar sees a horse riding with his dog who eats 'man-eating' behind him. Citizens already suspect that he is the one behind all this and wants his castle to burn. The murders started from the time when the elder brother count Ianos Count Igor Dalmar was terribly burned and killed in a laboratory accident. is shown in his experiments. Ianos agrees to hire him instead of brother and together seek formula for the regeneration of dead cells. Ianos wants to bring back the revived Imperial corpse. But, of course, Igor is still alive (though awfully burnt) and is chasing and killing women in the village. We see that his face on the grill appears in various places in the film, so we know he is still alive, making it all too obvious. Igor meets another fierce end when the fight with Ianos over Ivan is launched, with candles burning on the same bed that Igor encounters, meeting another, the last magical place. and looks pretty grainy and bad. Except for scratches, no other supplement is included. Although it has a beautiful, creepy Spanish castle and a good atmosphere, I found it pretty boring and predictable, without excitement or mystery. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
