I'm sure there is some sort of cult of IMDB that likes films that MST3K mocked. After I looked at this and the "Werewolf" and read dozens of comments about how junior, I became convinced that some conceitment was happening here. Many people say that people who hate him "just scare themselves up," "I do not know a good horor" or such things. Well, I really do not care about it, but I want something to happen in the movie! Most are just the woman sitting and looking around! Or a walk around the house / garden! The film requires something that will give it to the atmosphere, you do not get it just that they do not have useless scenes that someone is walking around and watching. Oh, and "Think"? Yes, I was thinking "MOVE! IOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I've ever had! P.P. P. For the record, I am a big fan of the old style of horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, Such things.
