A really terrifying film. It feels like it was made in the early nineties by the right person who wanted to show that homosexuals are good, normal people who are striving for the mainstream. Retrograde to the extent that it is offensive, LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the most desirable way to salvation for sad, lonely, sexually stunned gays. Wow! Who knew him? The accompanying characters are caricatures of homosexual stereotypes (feminized spider, bitter, lonely queen, fagot, etc.), and the main characters are milky, middle class, clones of middle bones, a little interesting. As for the romantic and ideological struggle of the main couple, there is not much to say: we all saw it before, and did much better.
