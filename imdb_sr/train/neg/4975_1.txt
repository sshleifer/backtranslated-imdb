After looking at the Canadian / Icelandic / British 2004 production "Beovulf & Grendel", which I thought was great and amazing, I joined this - the first of three new Beovulf films to be released this year - with fear. As soon as I heard the "Viking" and saw the horned helmets, I was groaning. These were the migratory Era Swedes and the Danes, not the Vikings (they came later). Even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to take off your helmet and then break you). Then there is Hrolfgar's Palace, which looks like a set for a film about Greece or Rome, and not in Denmark of the 6th century. Swords and armor appear to be props that have remained from earlier films set in different historical periods. I noticed a weapon that cruisers may have used in the "Kingdom of Heaven," and one character even had the sword of reproduction of "Vindlas Steel" from Beovulf & Grendel! Above the basic complication of the original epic poem, writing was sad and the play was completely wooden and unpredictable. The biggest arch was a cross-arms with a secret weapon, complete with a round-shaped and exploding projectiles, which looked like something that was bought from Iraqi insurgents. A monster with special effects and his mother were on steroids, so Beovulf could never take off his hand, as he did in the poem. Thank gods for the bascule! I could go on, but I will not.
