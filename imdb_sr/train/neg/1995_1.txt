I just paid a dollar for DVD this movie, and that did not matter. It looks like it's bad print and it's in the public domain, I suppose. Neagle - in spite of its fame, rewards and reputation - is a common British gala that can not sing or play or act. Some of the fine old Hollywood actors shown here must have thought they were doing a classic. Director Herbert Vilcock (Neagle's husband) always thought Anna was the most exciting and most femme on the screen. He made a mistake. She was incredibly popular in Britain before and after the Second World War. Her "serious" roles are even more absurd than her music performance. Only a few famous songs are included and none of them are well presented. Skip this and find the one who plays Doris Dai. At least you get the right comedy and professional dance style!
