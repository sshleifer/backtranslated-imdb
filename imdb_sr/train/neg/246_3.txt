This is obviously a futuristic adaptation of the "Mysterious Island" by Zil Verna. Sound editing is pretty bad. You hear a dialogue on the set and you hear the voices that are being recorded at the recording stand at the same time! This is an amateur movie with actors from Boston and recorded around Nev Hampshire. For those who live in Nev-England and who read this comment will be amazed by the great V. This film is full of shortcomings. You can hear a director's voice giving directions and giving instructions to the actress. "OK, now get up." As for other characters. There's one guy who speaks with the mind instead of the voice and this blue alien. An alien speaks in a deep voice. When she grabs or grunts when she fights, you hear the voice of an actor. As far as special effects are concerned, man! This is Brett Piper's early work for loud crying! Creatures are good, but animation is tense. Realli jerk. Something like the animation of Karl Zeman on the ROAD TO THE TIME OF TIME (1955). Special effects are imaginative. Music is good. In the end, this film makes EKUINOKS or PLANET DINOSAUR look like Harrihausen's epic. Did you know MISTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a budget for shoes? Care must be taken of ambitious filmmakers.
