I love Don Knotts, just to say it! He is a huge talent and the best in what he does, which represents a nervous, kindly confused loser thrown to the position of authority. He is fantastic in this role as Roi Fleming, Reluctant Astronaut, but the movie is pretty boring, indeed, although I am a kid brother and I am thrilled with watching this and other of his films. It's still worth watching, but it's really the movie that children enjoy best. I would categorize him as 100% cozy for the family and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night. As with all Knotts movies, there is a great acting actor actress and you can not help but you can not smile when Knotts gives one of his trembling open mouths, no matter how old you are and exhausted. From the perspective of an adult, one thing I think is great in this movie is how NASA captured the sixties - all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was surprised that Leslie Neilsen was then kind and boring. The only complaint on this story is Roi's love affair, a rather sketchy, inconspicuous woman who can not give him time until she becomes a big shot - if you are like me, you hope she will give it. at the end. Beware - you'll whistle the tune for a few days after watching, that's so appealing.
