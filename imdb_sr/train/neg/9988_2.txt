Cameron Diaz is a woman who is married to a judge, played by Harvei Keitel, whose life is fine until the former comes in and things get complicated. While I was watching this movie, I wondered several times why I was because the film was so funny and blah and badly scripted without any conviction. Even the audience does not really drive what's happening. Even wonderful Cameron can not keep this on a scale of one to ten
