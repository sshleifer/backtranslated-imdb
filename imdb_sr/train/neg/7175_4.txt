This may have been based on historical events, and we know that the creators of this television documentary have taken the liberty of making it more dramatic - I can live with it - but that was so bad! I was stunned in the event of a flaunted crisis in the air as everyone seemed calm, surely somebody would panic, and what a smooth flight, without feeling the discomfort of the passengers - come on! You are not sure about the regulations, today some of the aviation safety issues look like OTT nonsense, but why remove shoes before an emergency landing, common sense tells me it's not a good idea! The recordings of this massive aircraft that came to this remote runway were inconclusive and false. In reality, it would be a great look from the country around, in this film it was disproportionate and it looked like a model that was probably. Sliding passages appeared on the front and middle emergency doors, but no one appeared at the exit, although the drop was much smaller. The captain returned to the plane after landing - why? this has never been explained. We know that an emergency landing was due to the lack of fuel, but even so there must have been some fuel that sprayed at the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of explosion had to be a very real danger, but the evacuation seemed almost casual, and everyone was standing around the foot of the side slides instead of getting as far as possible, as I'm sure I would do it. There were too many inconsistencies, mistakes and false actions. I would prefer to see the real-time drama performance and the realistic movement of the plane. He had the potential to be quite exciting, but undoubtedly due to budget defects, and made it feel like an airplane that loses all engines is nothing terrible, and you would surely slide down to a little uneven landing, but a real hazard! - Of course the reality is somewhat different!
