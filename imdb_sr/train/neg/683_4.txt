Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and she lacks something in her life. She enters the Miss France competition against the wishes of her boyfriend Andrea (Georges Charlia) and she wins. She moves for the title of Miss Europe leaving her boyfriend behind. She won again, but returned home to Andreu because he asked her. When once she is gathered, her life is again becoming earthly, so that one night he writes a message and goes to experience the glory that awaits as Miss Europe. Andrew followed her ..... This movie is a silent movie with piano music, all the way to the end. It's also accelerated so everything looks quick. After that, a limited dialogue has been added and this is very false. The actors are fine keeping in mind that this is a silent film. The best part of the movie comes to an end, but the story lasts a bit too long. After watching this, I'm not sure what the matter is about the look of Louise Brooks - she has a terrible hairstyle that makes her face thick. I do not have to watch it again.
