HORRENDOUS! Avoid plague. I would rate this in the top 10 worst movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. Looks like day care students ... Wait, I've seen programs better than this. It opens like a soft pornography with a blurred naked woman doing a scene of a shower, and then goes badly. Good bare scenes, or that's it. Problems with sound and light were persistent throughout the film. Sometimes I swore I could hear the engine engine noise. IIKES! I would like to see another film about this story, but that it's done by different people. This group of actors and members of the team needs more acting and hours of filming. He voted 1 out of 10.
