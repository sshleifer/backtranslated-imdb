I usually enjoy Loretta Young's early films: her acting was light and cool at the time, and she certainly knew how to wear clothes. But this one is just a loser of the word, except for the funny support of Glende Farrell. Young is a girl who speaks with her husband writer (Paul Lukas) to become a champion player. This is not the most interesting game, and the long, nervous middle part in which their marriage decays, kills the movie. However, there is one interesting part. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their top-notch game, a series of quick shots shows planes, trains, football matches, even a diver in the air, freezing in anticipation of the event. It's the earliest use of the frozen frame I've seen in an American movie. I wish the rest was so inventive and funny.
