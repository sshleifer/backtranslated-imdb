Unlike the other two currently featured games in the United States (Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100), pacing in this show is a tinge of what's happening on the screen. DOND and 1 vs. 100 can be pulled out at a slow pace because games can change the pace - or finish - at any time. There is a risk in every action the player takes, rewards are wildly variable, and players are hard to leave with a significant amount of money. Suspensions are usually well-used. Shov Me The Monei, on the other hand, is too slow-paced. When the question is discovered and obviously the player knows the correct answer, you can be sure that nothing will be exciting in the next few minutes. It would greatly help the pace of this performance to reveal the correct answer to the FIRST, and then the player would choose the dancer, instead of Shat wasting time talking about what would happen if the player got the wrong answer when we all know they are right. Random dance is a filler that actually looks like a filler. Too much time is lost until enough happens ... and the fact that players can not decide to leave the game early guarantees that it will be a lot of time spent. Oh, and I have no interest in watching Shat, especially right after I ate dinner. I am a lifelong fan of games, but even I have had a lot of problems with the clock. Big changes or early retirements are needed.
