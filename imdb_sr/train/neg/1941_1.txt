I can not believe that I spent five years of my life wasting on this garbage. The previous five-day offer of this author was very pleasant and I really enjoyed it. But most of the dialogue was totally incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit because she either mumbled or mumbled her lines, but most of the rest of the actors followed her example. Significant exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old students whose diction was exemplary. Do producers not listen to production before broadcasting to make sure that the dialogue is audible? As a result, I guess I lost track of what was happening, and as it seemed that the original line of complication was turned into a standard thing between us and the Muslims, I soon lost interest. The end was a complete anti-climax. Complete dud.
