I do not know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the strangest movies I've been watching for a long time. It is sometimes disturbing, but also boring elsewhere. Scenes of dental torture are highly elaborated and can attract anyone who intertwines. I found myself holding my teeth during some of the above scenes. A smart thing about a movie is to play with our fears, so the dentist is very disturbing. The film's humor is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you are a fan of strange and weird parties and teeth that pierce into dust, this is just the movie you were looking for. , try it! My Rating: 4/10 (maybe a little weird for my taste)
