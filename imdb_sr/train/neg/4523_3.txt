When this film was released, he produced one of the best film reviews of the capsules: Sphink Stinks. Yes, but in a hypnotic way. Casting is stupid, starting from the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud like the Egyptians? For that, there is not enough makeup in Cairo, at least not while this film is being shot. But it's pretty fun to watch them try. The performances run a mummy scale (forgive, apparent observation) to over-top, with very few stops between them. Les Lesley-Anne Dovn looks like he can not find Egypt on the map, and even less to explain his archaeological treasures. This is at least partly due to some very bad writing, one of the curse that will be visited by every viewer of this film. It is my opinion that movies that include a curse or who draw the ground from a topic that is somewhat esoteric, such as egiptology, are ripe for stupid, overwritten dialogue. We do not disappoint, and convergence proves a double blow. The plot has one driving source of dramatic tension: can it become duller and less convincing? The answer is usually YES. The location of the shots is beautiful, and the scene is generally very good, the only consistent reminder that it was not a low-budget production. It's also the fact that there are so many famous faces that serve in such unintentional laughter. Cheap, no; Cheesy, yes.
