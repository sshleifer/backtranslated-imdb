This movie is horrible! It is rival "Ishtar" in the number of unpleasant moments. I would consider it to be less than 3, except for a few ridiculous lines; but, overall, this film was a shit! It seemed like they did it over the weekend in some bankruptcy somewhere. Joe Roth should always join Elaine Mai at the director.
