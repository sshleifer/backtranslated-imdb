It was a movie that I hoped I could suggest to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the film complete, I knew I could not even watch that damn thing close. You are almost convinced that the actual war did not last so long. Others will try to question my patriotism for criticizing such a film. But you can not go seeing Saving Private Ryan at LOC. Forget about the difference in budget for a movie or audience - they do not prevent the director from making an intelligent movie. The length of the film is not so bad and the fact that it repeats - they attack the same hill but give it different names. I thought LOC was terrible terrain - this hill looked like my yard. The sequences of character development (flashback soilder, who reflect on their last moments, before they were deployed) should have been throughout the film, and not just accumulate in one long memory. To this day, I have not yet seen the end. But there was a much better movie (not much talk) called the Border.
