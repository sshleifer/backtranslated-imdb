I love Jamie Foxx. I enjoy 99% of the movies I see. And I got out of this. Now, I admit, maybe it had something to do with two middle-white women in a theater that laughed at every little thing ("Oh no, Jamie knocks on the door! HE HE HEE!"), But. this was incredibly embarrassing. It could not have been shooting a camera, and no camera was taken from a conventional angle ... everything had to be in your face, loud and boring. Bad guy tried to be smooth and Malkovich, but at this point, he is just old and tired. Nothing new nor interesting. Of all the characters, too many lines you've seen, you've heard too many of them before, and too many "hard guy" lines ... and I do not mind such things, really, as long as it has little originality. In fact, it's pretty much the entire support that was just drained. I love Jamie Fock, and I think he's really funny, and I thought he was funny in this movie ... but it was not funny enough to hold everything else. This film required less recording, less boring camera shots, more emotions, more feelings, and even more Jamie Fokk. I gave him 2.
