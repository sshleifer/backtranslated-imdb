A man finds that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 1950s and that he now has the power to ... burn the flame! I was really ready for this movie, and what was directed by the great Toby Hooper and staring at the wildness of Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, he did not rise above the average film about people with violence. Spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it, unfortunately, it seems that it never fulfills its potential and extends its plot too much. Special effects are not bad and they help the film to be transferred to the finals. Actors are not bad, Dourif steals the show. Everywhere around, there's no classics, but it's not even the worst of its kind. ** from ****
