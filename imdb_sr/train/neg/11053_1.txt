This is one of those "so bad good" movies that you always hear, but you never see! Unlike Troma films that are deliberately bad and campsites (and I'm not having fun), this is 100% clean. Solid dancers on an acidic journey and the magic first friend who calls lightning and turns into the Good Witch of the East, the fact that she is seriously pushing himself so far over the edge of the bad that makes him a full circle back fun. Sufficiently convincing because of that.
