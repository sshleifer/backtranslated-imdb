This film is a total dog. I found myself trying to find anything that would be laughed only so that I would not feel like I completely lost my money - and my time. Writing in this movie is absolutely terrible. It's a shame that it's not in line with the standards of other Hale Storm movies. They were supposed to save money on getting actors from the D-list like Fred Villard and Garry Coleman and they spent money working on the script until it was right. Even Gary Coleman was not properly used for his role. This film leaves you wondering what is the point of most plots - including the backing. After I looked at this film, I left the impression that the producers hoped to capture some kind of Napoleonic dynamite, such as humor, where there are not as many lines as a character and delivery. Unfortunately, this film does not deliver lines, characters, delivery or humor. Instead, I should have gone to the dentist!
