This film had an IMDB rating of 8.1 so I expected much more from him. It starts ridiculously and pleased with the energy that is felt spontaneously. But before the movie is halfway, it starts to pull and everything becomes ill predictable. The characters in the office were thrilled in the first third of the film, but we are not very familiar with them; They become caricatures, not real people. It's the same story that I've seen hundreds of times, just here in slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could wake up another predictable love story only if the dialogue was not so stale! also with the Dead Letter office. I hope this movie will soon end up in Dead Movie Office.
