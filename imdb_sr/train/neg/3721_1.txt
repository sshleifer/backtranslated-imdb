Two films are useful for scaring people of God, this and 'Horizon events'. One has a significant and touching message, the other one is one-dimensional as a religious film can get. Too bad Paul Anderson went to the damn movie Resident Evil, he really had something. Thieves in the night are disturbed by many obvious independent movie attributes (acting, narration, dialogue and persuasion) and obviously what are the intentions of the film from the beginning. The Christian film industry did not learn from this failure, so we are stuck with Omega Code, Left Behind and other trouble films. Their basic element is that they are so interested in selling their message: "Save yourself, people!" everything else becomes the second of the Bible's Bible over the head of the Bible. All in all, I can not believe I even write this about a movie that is ineffective. Skip it completely and return to Samu Neil to get your eyes out. 1 of 5
