Oh my God. I bought this movie and ... I was watching ... the whole ... thing. . . Okay, it'll be fine ... I know I'll be fine for a month or two. Soon, I hope to get rid of the flashes. I wanted to eat something after the movie, but it seems that I can not get the courage to try and keep the food at this moment. Bad? Yes bad. Very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, it does not look good to get the message in the right way. Hmm ... There is no word that would describe how horrible it is .... it's not terrible ... Hmm is repulsively terribly thrown / acting / film / directed / writing. Now I do not know what to do, but to throw it away. Maybe I burn him, I would not want to end up at the bottom of an architectural copy for a thousand years. Worst movie from "Hei Happi"
