I would give this film a zero of ten, but I will give it two. The reason One of them is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the movie, which is not really a reason. The last thing is that Rani appears in this film and works with Kamal. I love Rani very much and I respect that she is a great actress. That's why I did not enjoy her in this movie as she loves Kamala, but that's not a big deal. In any case, many scenes in the bedroom that made this film visible, allows us to talk about this film. Whether it's good or bad, I think it's a totally dumb movie that yelled at me. I like a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ reviews by clicking on my name, I have great taste. The movie is not funny is one thing, and if it's hard to hit the movies, why there is no morality in this movie. His bias movie is not a true story and stinks. Looking at Kamal as he loves these actresses, I am troubled, a man can not be kissed well.
