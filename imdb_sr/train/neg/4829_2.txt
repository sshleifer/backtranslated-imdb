As a regular film observer, I can not say I enjoy watching this one. It's not too emotional for a drama, not too much for a thriller, not too fast for action. In addition, some moments of the film are barely credible. All right, I understand, the soldiers become a little out of their minds there, but it's hard to believe that someone would risk his life, capture in the midst of the enemy city, and after the professor's wife yelled out without asking the question (appropriately). It would look terribly romantic if it were an animation, but it should be a serious film about the war. There are several such episodes, so the whole picture leaves the impression that it's just a crude overview of the movie, and It takes a lot of work. It seems that filmmakers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier, but all these "curves" of his psychology seem simply unnatural. This picture left a question in my head: WHY? Why did they give him the Oscar? Why SIKS? And IMHO is the most exciting part of the movie :)
