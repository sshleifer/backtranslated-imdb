The really bad and easy worst episode I've ever seen ... ever. They tried to compensate him by giving him, 'we know we are doing this' routine. It would be ridiculous that there was no fact that the "Simpsons" had already done so. And it would still not make up for the idea if it ever came to the idea. Flashbacks were held as part of the usual artistic (mostly J.D) fantasies. Flashback was not even the actual events that happened, only compilations say that J.D fell or I do not know ... Elliott fell. If I wanted to watch the Scrubs compilation, I would go to the iTunes and I would not have lost half an hour of my life. Scrubs eventually fell into a trap that most sitcoms must, and it disappoints. I managed to go 5th and fourth of the season without this episode. I was hoping that there should not be such sit-coma. And as a transient thought, why the hell is Dr.Cok bald?
