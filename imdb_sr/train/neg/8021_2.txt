Visually incoherent and full of himself, the director obviously decided to seek the fauk-depth to expand the 5-minute work for 81 minutes. The moments that work in this movie are VERY limited, and characters do not even feel real. How did you feel you were invested in the main protagonist who was so unreal? Essential and stylish, everything feels like an unusual dream. It disturbs the incorrect operation of the camera, the unpleasant silence and gaps in action, and what about the small picture of a spider crawling on the screen? Whoever he meant, he had to return to the film school. He did not add any meaning, just cheese, and he did not even have a stylistic radio with the rest of the film (assuming that the film even had a style, which is closely related). What a flop.
