Forward - continue with your caution. My main problem with this movie is that when Harry learns the identity of three blackmailers - with relative ease - continues to crash into their demands. And then the whole scene with a kidnapping woman decided to connect his classic car to explode (with money in it), which makes us a pretty big logical jump. Well, so he wanted to keep his affair with Ciny out of sight to the public because of his wife's participation in the YES campaign. I can see this, but why not hire someone to hit this shit a little or even kill them when it finds out that there is no evidence of blackmail (e.g., the body's body?) This was a pretty interesting movie for the first two. / 3 that. After that it somehow breaks down.
