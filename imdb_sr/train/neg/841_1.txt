I just watched this movie 15 minutes ago and still have no idea what I was just looking at. Mostly I think it's a movie about the online S & M "star" CD-ROM that is realistic as online flash cartoons. She was killed by someone, because of which the sister and FBI team are investigating death. Local killings departments in Big Citi, USA, are also investigating, though most of his work comes in handy to familiarize themselves with the CD-ROMs he claims to be realistic "as the real thing". I know. Wow. Michael Madsen is the only one in the movie that has any credits behind. He's in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of it is a bang for the main girl for seemingly no reason. I will not even explain the end, because honestly, I can not do it myself. But before the final scene, we were treated with 3 or 4 minutes of editing everything in the movie. Honestly, they could run to the end of the final scene, and that would be the same effect with the direction of the crossed eyes and all that. All in all, stay away from this movie. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could have used those 80 minutes for something else and I was happier. Like, playing this game with a knife where you hit your arm multiple times. It would be much more fun in 80 minutes.
