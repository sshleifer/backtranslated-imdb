The Spanish icon of horror Paul Naschi plays in this, one of his weakest invertebrate films ... but for a moment he is carrying me. Most people will be acquainted with him under his most common television title - "FURI OF THE VOLF MAN", and over the years there have been many home video versions. If you want to be serious in giving a fair shot, the most effective issue that I saw the address WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEP, and it is registered and complete European version that returns a few disturbing scenes and contains original footage of naked missing from Furio's fingerprint. Naschi plays Valdemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet only to find out that he received a curse from a werewolf and that his wife had an affair. He takes care of her and her lover while in the animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy doctor and her assistant. Apparently, the doctor tries to "tame" the werewolf, and there is a very strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and hairy and canine Daninskoga which is under its transom, at least in the original version. In the end, we get two insects at the price of one, while Danin fights with the wolf! The biggest problem with the film is that the director (according to Naschi's claims) was often drunk, and the results are really inconsistent. When you watch a copy of VOLF MAN NEVER SLEEP, it's not that hard to figure out what's going on, even though editing remains awesome in places. Worst of all were the occasional capture unadjusted Naschijevog hungry werewolf who was pulled from another previous film (MARC LA DEL HOMBRE LOBO, called "Frankenstein BLOOD OF TERROR") and mixed into this without any reasonable reason! The waxing of clothes is changed from black shirt to white and back again, as well as its behavior; at one point, a wolf walk in a hippy trance from FURI, and then a regime and runaway savage from BLOODY TERROR. Really bizarre.
