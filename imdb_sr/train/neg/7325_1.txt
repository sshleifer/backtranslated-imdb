This makes Hollioaks actors look like Roial Shakespeare Companions. This film is a jaw that falls into how horrible it is. Turning off the DVD player was not enough. I want to find the people who are responsible for this disaster and sham their faces. I will never get that time again. Never. How is it possible to create such a banal, boring and soulless movie? I could not remember a way of acting that would alleviate boredom. Writing the necessary ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a shameful cinema. The more you can say than repeat that it's really a terrible acting. Please avoid.
