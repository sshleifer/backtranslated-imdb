Saturdai Night Live, National Lampoon and SCTV alumnus are together in sometimes a funny movie sketch. However, it's very interesting to watch now, at the beginning of 2005. Twenty years after this film should take place, look at how many of their legs became absolutely true: there is a fake movie, which probably was not at that time he was not smart, for something called "The Pregnant Man", which came true with the stupid Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Junior" movie. There's a commercial joke, which at that time was probably not even smart for something that includes Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called "Celebrate Vrestling", which has now been released with the popular Celebrity Boking show. There is a movie advertisement, which at that time was probably not a smart one, and John Candi is in a cut-headed movie. Take a look at this trailer and see how similar the recordings and complications of the Frank Hellenlotter Basket Case !! And finally, there is a commercial for late late documentary about "dead sleep, only two remain ..." The documentary's name is ... LAST HIPPY! LOL. Four prophecies are being realized!
