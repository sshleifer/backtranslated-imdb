I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate everything about it. It's so boring and stupid. Everyone says they are nat and alek volff heroes in the world of music and will make it great. WHAT TYPES OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS DOWNLOAD ??? !?!?!?!?!?! nat and alek will end up like a hobby or end up like Jane Hudson from "Whatever Happened to Babi Jane?". I could have walked even 20 minutes from this, barely 30 seconds of the show, and I managed to spend about half an hour of 'Battle of the Bands'. For anyone to cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kid's Choice Award, I have no idea. a few days before the premiere of the film on the Nike, most teenage actresses on Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsei Shav, etc.) appeared in advertisements that affected children who died of brain about how nat and Alek volff are. First of all, they did not cheat me, and secondly, nat and alek probably or drugged them, or paid them a lot of money to say it and sound convincing, because I do not see how anyone could find this show / movie entertaining. music is terrible. Naturally, singing sounds like a sick, dying loser at the crevice. alek is the most unfavorable film / TV show EVER. He's not funny, he's boring, he's really weird, he thinks he's hot and knows everything about the girls. This guy is happy if he ever succeeds. you know that this play is fake when you discover that some characters (in real life) do not exist at all! Jesse's character was actually played by Nat and Alec's cousin Jesse Draper (they have to have a budget problem). Their father is not single, married to Polly Draper, but does not appear in the show, which makes Volff's mom less. Rosalina does not exist. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I'll tell you, Naked Brothers will be in some deep state ** when their "fans" find out that the whole thing is set. 0/10
