The only reason I'm commenting on is that I finally realized why Dr. Bark bald. Although we probably understood all this at the same time this week, Dr. Cock is baleful because these episodes showed in a different order than they were filmed. The latest episode in which our dear sister Roberts dies who loves Jesus Dr. The chicken wiped her head. It must have been for some unusual reason to prove them to be defective and forgot that they have withdrawn continuously. For shame, Scrubs. They made such mistakes before. I remember when Elliot was trying to get Scott Foley and her hair was wet 2 seconds before the water hit. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show should speed up.
