This British film is really terrible, and it's hard to believe that Glen Ford is in it, although it's pretty dormant. The idea of ​​a bomb on the train sounds good ... but it turns out that this train ends up parked for most of the movie! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area in which the car is parked is evacuated, so it's not for anyone. In fact, this movie could be used in the movie class to show how to make a movie about uncertainty. True uncertainty is generated by the audience knowing things the characters do not know, which the director is obviously unknown. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs on it, but it says that we believe there is only one. After the first bomb has been destroyed, it seems that there is no reason to watch the movie anymore. But at the last moment, a villain who has no obvious motivation for his actions reveals that there are two. We are not even sure when the bombs will explode, so we do not even have a classic sequence of tension "knocking the bomb". A good 10 minutes or more is spent watching the French woman Glenn Ford thinking about leaving him, and then he is wondering where he is. She is such a boring character that we do not care if she will reconcile with him, and when she does, there is nothing emotional about it. Most other characters are pretty deprived of personality, and none has problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it feels long because it's boring and boring. Do not waste your time.
