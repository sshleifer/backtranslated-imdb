This is the worst adaptation of the classical story I've ever seen. Unnecessarily modernizing it, and some things are actually just sick. Songs are rarely moving along the story. It seems they were thrown at random. The flying scene with Marlee is ridiculous and funny. It's not just one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's definitely the worst music I've ever seen. <br /> <br is probably considered classical because "A Christmas Carol" is a classic story. Just because the original story was classic does not mean that it's a cheap adaptation.
