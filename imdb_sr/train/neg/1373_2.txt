This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Usually I praise every movie for some aspect of his production, but the intensely irritating behavior of more than half the characters has made it difficult for me to appreciate the movie Any part of this movie. The most common was the conclusion that the man who designed the building was in the wrong way that the avalanche collapsed. OK. Also, the attempt to take off the avalanche slalom will not succeed. Running 10 feet in some trees will not work. But it's here. As already mentioned, the innate nonsense and pure nonsense of some characters is ridiculous. In a confined space, with limited oxygen, a four-year-old could tell you that a fire is not a good idea. In any case, about 5 minutes of film is purchased and acquired a certain value. However, if you have a little intelligence, and you will consider that much of this film is hard to tolerate. It hurts me because so many quality stories are not produced and someone will pay for such things done. Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? Well, in order to give you a hook you must continue to watch to see the latest fighting avalanche techniques. Absolutely priceless.
