In order to amplify the drama of this story about the maternity ward, it was set up in a special department for "severe cases". The main story is Loretta Ioung; she is on vacation from a long prison for murder. Will doctors save her baby at the cost of living or pay attention to her husband's request for the contrary? The melodrama and sentiment are dominant, and they are not sincere. For example, just to move things, this hospital has a psychological department adjacent to the maternity ward, and allows a woman who has a hysterical pregnancy to wander around the theft of a baby. There is only enough laughter and sarcasm to make this known as the Varners film, mostly by Glende Farrell, who pours gin out of his hot water bottle while waiting for twins to discover her sadness that there is a law against sale. An example of her repartition: "Be careful." Farrell: "Too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon is, of course, beautifully authoritative as the main nurse, but do not expect to be given a dramatic moment. The main theme of the movie is that a look at the baby turns everyone to complain. Even with obvious limitations, this film should have been better than it is.
