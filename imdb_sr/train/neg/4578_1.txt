Another cult strikes again. This is not a spoiler, because REAL came to an end after you explored the people who brought this overly long, pseudo-scientific advertisement ... Ramtha's Enlightment School. To hide behind the OZ scam screen, I'm leaving. Thanks to Ramthi I watched a lump copy of this film on the recommendation of a "friend" ... in order to lose the valuable resources of this modern lobotomizer, it would be tragic. I can only hope that they "really believe that I can walk on the water" enough to take this lead to a "logical" conclusion ... in other words; walking, alienating ... or silence :-) As a movie ... it deserves a strong "1" at its fun value, especially for creating the most unpleasant character in the history of the film (the photographer's roommate ... eeeeeek!). If you have to watch this movie, borrow it from one of the people who argued.
