After Amenabar and Balaguero's overestimated success, Spanish horror films spread as a disease in the more sad world of horror films. The result is all in films like El segundo nombre, TV production badly written, but also worse. I did not read the book by Ramsey Campbell, but I am sure that the author of The Doll's book Vho Ate His mother did not have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at all costs, unless you are looking for a quiet sleeping night in a fresh cinema. 2/10
