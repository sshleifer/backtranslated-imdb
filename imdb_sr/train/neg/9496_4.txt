Trifling is a romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about a love affair that grows between a beautiful hippy (Kai Lenz) and a real estate agent in Los Angeles in his golden years (Villiam Holden, surprisingly polite in this very complex arrangement). The scenario is insignificant, but not without some imaginary passages; Still, the scenario is such a medieval clich√© so far that most of the pictures came out as childish. Perhaps he worked much better with different tracks: Holden and Lenz do not match well (her stature is so small it looks as if she is overwhelmed), making their intimate scenes less exciting than simply embarrassing. Dated, murky-romantic, and mostly inconspicuous. ** from the ****
