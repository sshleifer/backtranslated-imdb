Is it just me or is this child really disturbing? Nurse with friends, most of her time spends running around by the disobedient little one, so too. As far as he is concerned, I know he is a kid, but his acting ability is as woody as dead wood. So far I'm only halfway, and I'm fascinated by the story, but the people in it, let it go, I just hope it will be all the better, because I can not know what it's all about. Although, some supposedly cryptic messages in scribbling on the wall and notebooks, indicate that everything is backward, i.e. The dog is God, the living is evil, etc. As it does not matter) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I will update this post, but if you are reading this, then well ...... See the above statement.
