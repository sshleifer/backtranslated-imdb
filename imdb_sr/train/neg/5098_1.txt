This must be one of the best anime shows ever made. And yes, even the "End of the Evangelion" is shown to me, and that hated me even more. Not to mention the countless turns of this show! I do not mind psychological and philosophy, but the Evangelion drags him into the mud like nothing else! It seemed that many characters were not interesting. The only ones that were interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. In addition, most of the rest were a bunch of whistle-blowers. They have to go to the psychiatric center, not to control huge robots against aliens called "Angels". Even the fighting of bellows and aliens did not help at all. It goes something like this: "Well, there are you robots, and they are really cool because they bleed (!) When they get hurt, but they're not really mechanics, but trapped angels, so sometimes they cry and do not doing what the juvenile pilots want, and they need to be better controlled ... blah blah blah! I'm very sorry, but I can not recommend anyone to Evangelion, anime otaku or not. For those who love it very much this series, you are well entitled to this opinion, I respect you. But to those who have an obsession "out of your mind" think that everyone will love this series, you are more egoist. I like "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run" -Dim "and" Robot Taekwon V ".
