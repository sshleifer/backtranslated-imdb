This is one of those films that are more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from the perspective of fun. I'm judging on how much I enjoyed the movie or I entertained him, so I give him a grade 4. If I rated him as an academic film, he would still have 10 pieces. It was shot in a very interesting way, like a pseudo-silent movie with elements of sound effect and reality. This meant transferring unrelated memory and fragmentation of the mind, and this is interesting in these aspects. However, the film has many disgusting elements that I was not so much fun. Mostly they are just disturbing. There are also some very interesting images, and some interesting concepts, but some of the characteristic connections (especially between mother and son) are quite disturbing. will not. For me it was interesting from an academic perspective, but that was not a good hour, and I probably will not be coming back this time again. 4/10 if you are looking for a party. 10/10 from an academic standpoint.
