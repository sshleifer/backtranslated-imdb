Thank you for killing the franchise with this party, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Vallace. This movie is bullshit at so many levels that it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this low budget reintroduction meets. Jon Bon Jovi (poor Kevin Bacon) rides in Mexico with a surfboard with a hidden section featuring vampire killer ala Antonio Case Banderas's guitar in DESPERADO. He takes some poor "hunters" along the way (including an unpleasant feminist infected girl who takes the pills in order not to go to a vampire), and they have started to stop a mother of a vampire who has not been given any background, so we could take care less about her or her search (walking in the sun crushing the Black Cross and performing rituals to enable it). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen it and did much better. John Carpenter has been lately responsible for many bad films. Frankly, I think he has passed his peak and is incapable of making another horror classic. The only decent film that was made by THE THE LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is completely shit, down to an incredibly cheap look and retarded GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now it's a loss of celluloid. Where are the giants like ASSAULT TO PRECINCT 13, HALLOVEEN (1), FREE FROM NEW YORK AND STAR? The carpenter's prince Vallace proves she can not write a paper bag exit with her paper - a thin piece packed with women, clinging and recycled scratches from the original. Did I mention I hated every character in the movie? There was not an unforgettable character in the whole movie. How did it happen? This movie has nothing to recommend. Not even a DVD presentation is good; It looks terrible to me. For comparison, JASON Ks: "FRIDAY 13 IN A SPACE" is a masterpiece. This is the way to make a sequel and (re) energize franchise, ladies and calls, as well as create an exciting DVD menu.
