This film is really bad, with a script full of "unforgettable" lines and incredibly bad performances. Special effects are also bad (they are not the worst I've ever seen), and music is so bad that you have to listen to believe it. Only two short themes (long 30 seconds) are constantly repeated throughout the whole movie. All in all, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
