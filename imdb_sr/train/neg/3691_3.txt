In the first place I'm not a fan of Rajnikant, but Baba was a great disappointment. Between the horrible stories, actions and songs were only central. The story becomes very insightful. Instead of running for an office such as the NTR or the MGR, Rajni almost appeared as the next big guru Tamil Nadu. My wife told me that Ranee after this film came out, made it work for more movies! .... it was a great movie, which made up for the purchase of this dude ... except that Baba looks worse by comparison!
