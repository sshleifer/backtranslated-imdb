This is a horrible remix of a marginal but well-known film from the early 70's. I saw the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a twenty minute movie that has been 'crowded' in 2 hours or whatever it is. The raw story, which is by the way, is completely different from the original. The main government involvement was unrealistic. No flow from one scene to another. In the original you can go for a beer or hit the bathroom and keep up the pace. It took only a few hours of movie time to change the oil container on the car. It takes a lot longer than in real life. Auto guys notice that. Likewise, the fool or fools who chose to throw the 1968 charger and misused the Challenger since 1970, should shoot at the heels with an annoying bullet. The fact that they are not 'auto-people' is painfully obvious, and their transition will not be sad. The actors lacked any emotions, everything was cut and dried. One step above the monotone. Barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic. Last but not least, the radio DJ stated that Challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). It's total rubbish. Can you tell aerodynamics, or lack of it ?? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste your time watching this.
