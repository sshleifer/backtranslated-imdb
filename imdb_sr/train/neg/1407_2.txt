After Life was a miracle, I did not expect much. It's hard to believe that these movies were shot by the same man as Do Iou Bell Dolly Bell, for example. A vow is two hours of stupid foolishness without a story. The wild and unbridled humor of the Underground seems to have degenerated here in a pathetic noise. It seems that Kusturica has been steadily down the road because she began to make real comedies for life, starting with a black cat, a white cats, which I think was great, but she already had some disturbing signs of dementia. His early films liked me so much, and that's why it's especially disappointing to see something like this. Let's hope the next one will be great.
