I honestly do not want to write this review. I am a Christian, so I was eagerly waiting to see this movie. It looked great - a Christian movie with some pretty famous stars and a complication that seemed intriguing (not buying the Bible code alone - you can make it say everything you want. But, I still believe in everything in the Bible). So I sit on the edge of the seat and enjoy the reviews, when the film appears and manages to ruin my mood in a few minutes. I had to bite my lips in order to stop commenting on terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater (people would tear me away from people who were cheering for a rather clumsy, but basically raising the scene and grasping the crazy apparently and predictable Tension scenarios, safe Once I started to turn the final points, I could think. There were many parts of the movie I liked - some of the unexpected effects of perfume, some of the effects that were really special (I do not count Vision.) They were badly made ), and some interesting Unfortunately, I got a clear impression that if I read the book of Revelations Monkey and put a monkey in front of the typewriter for an hour, I could get a better scenario. And music was out of the poor (even for Bond fans who love some kind of cheese music in action scenes and intrigues.) I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater - like people who were crying and breathless because of how amazing it was - but I am not someone who can be calm by a writer who throws some words on some Bible things She scars and hits the Christian seal. I need a good plot and convincing dialogue before I can enjoy most of the movies, and that's just not the case. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And it's a tragedy. When will we see some intelligent Christian fiction? It must be somewhere ...
