Sentinel is all about the Hollywood soul and the grieving lack of imagination that is present in many films these days. I can not even imagine a good thing about it, everything is so generic, so manufactured and so lazy to gather that there really is just as a commercial about how to make money from a harmless, unsuitable people. The plot of a secret service agent planning to kill Prez might be fun. If a good director deals with them or a carefree actor. Douglas is the one that's framed. Basinger is the first lady, with whom she has an affair (an undeveloped, unexplained folding plan). Sutherland is the best friend who believes he is guilty because there would be no film if he did not. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with the wealth of Maibelline and ... that's it. I suppose there are fewer demands for women when they enter the secret service. As usual, in a film like this, the role of Preza itself is nothing but a tool, a symbol and very badly written. Clark Johnson's, the one who gave us the equally pathetic SVAT 2003, has no signature in any mechanical signature, and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and telephoned in their performances from a distance. Eva Longoria, the most elaborate woman of the 21st century, is basically just to attract the audience of "Desperate Housewives". Her role is 100% meaningless and she does absolutely nothing to deepen the plot or contribute to character development. There are barely two lines to rub together. A truly wasteful marketing trick. If you are a slaughter pig, then do not let me stop you. But it's time and money that will not come back.
