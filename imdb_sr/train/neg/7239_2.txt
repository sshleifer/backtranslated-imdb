This movie is advertised as a smart romantic comedy. He is neither smart nor romantic and definitely not an effective comedy. The fate of a benevolent, but poor character, "Tom," oscillates from one extremely shameful disaster to another. The only salvific graces are the competent performance of Tony Colette and the frequency with which we see Paltrow's comfortable face. All in all, you should avoid!
