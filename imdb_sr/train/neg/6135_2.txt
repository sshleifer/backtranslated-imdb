America needs the best man to win a "game" and who will hire? Gymnastics (About Brother!) The game is Kurt Thomas who has the necessary skills to win the game, including the ninja, the village of lunatics and Richard Norton whom Kurt Thomas said "to keep his hardware in his pants". (His exact words) I missed it in cinemas, and that's a good reason, because I would probably be kicked out because of the laughter I broke at regular intervals. The first thing that went through my head was how much these ninjas are lame if a gymnast can kick them. Kurt Thomas is like 5 feet 4 and barely guessed as "The Best Man for a Job" As for the acting talent of Kurt Thomas, so if you can not say something nice ... In all seriousness, although you should ask yourself how much cocaine was used to The idea is so stupid. Only the decision to give Tara Reid as a scientist here is at the top of nonsense. Although she was 18 years old the title of the dumbest movie I've ever seen. Not to say that this did not seem to me to be unacceptable, so I laughed that I almost drowned. Twice. Only in the 1980s can a film with such a bad idea be made. Though for recording it is the only movie ever to have a hero who is so skinny, he can not even pull the sword out of the ground. This is the vimpiest action movie ever made and one of the funniest. <br /> * From 4- (bad)
