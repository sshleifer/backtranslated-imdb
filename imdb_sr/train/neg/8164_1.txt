I saw this movie in a real cinema (probably $ 2.00) with my cousin and uncle. We were about 11 and 12, I guess, and really in terrible movies. I remember being so excited to see him, because my cool uncle allowed me to pick a movie (and probably we could never do it again!) And after that we were disappointed! It's just boring and not scary. The only thing I remember was Corki Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and that was not that great, only someone I recognized. I've already seen bad movies and this one has always been in my mind as the worst. It was from what I can remember, one of the most painful, non-horrible, wasteful of our collective $ 6, and the scattering of the film. I've read some reviews that say it's worth the clock and I say, "Too much everyone," but I would not be tired either. Even not so bad is not good.
