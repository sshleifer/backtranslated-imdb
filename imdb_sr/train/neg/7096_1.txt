It's incredible that it manages to be terrible on so many levels. Scenario, acting, directing and selecting actors are terrible. Costumes, sets, and pseudo-medieval languages ​​are also extremely terrible. In a strange way, I actually enjoyed this movie, once I accepted that it would not be good. It's a shame that people would spend so much time and effort to produce something so poorly if they could really do something quite decent from the premise (though not quite convincing!), But instead treat us as a bit of nausea and cheek story of dragons and knights , which lacks the charm that can be found in other such fantastic films. Let's hope the Lord of the Rings is a little better! Oh, and the hairdo of David Thevlis makes him look like He-Man. That is!
