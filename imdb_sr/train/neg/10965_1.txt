I actually watch this movie while I write this. . . If the following comments "prove my lack of development as a true, artistic filmmaker," then let it be so. . . But. . . I thought (I'm still thinking how I watch) that this movie is. . . Mildly speaking, it is very, very overrated. Again, very. It looks like a really, really bad student film done by someone with extraordinarily limited resources. . . and who did not pay much attention to detail. I do not want to continue and to deal with all the different ways this movie is missing, but. . . Okay . . . I simply do not understand (I recall, I completely admit that perhaps this idiot is here - not a filmmaker - did not get this "piece of imaginative genius"). . . I rented this on a gir, because the reviews were very, very extraordinary. . . Sheesh. . .
