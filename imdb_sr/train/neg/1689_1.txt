Wow, what a total disappointment! The fact that people think this film is terrifying is ridiculous. Special effects were the direct fraud of the "Ring". Story? Was he one? Not in my opinion. Just a bunch of unusual pictures. The whole movie was boring, stupid, messy. I suppose there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror movie I've ever seen for years. And that fish Buffy? Well, she's a bad actress! Like plastic like Barbie and also talented .. No, wait, it would be an insult to talent Barbie! I guess many guys helped this movie at the box office because it was PG-13, and it was rated R, it would bombard the IMO! Stupid movie!
