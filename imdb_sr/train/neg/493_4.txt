A dysfunctional family goes home because of holidays and the results of murders and disorder. Violent sexy Milligan at his worst home. Much better than a home movie (as much as Milligans movies) this is a trip to the style of deviation of the 1960s. Known for abundant nudity and sex, this film is neither sexy nor horrible, playing more as strange. The film suffers from inequality and inexpensive production (no one has ever been sure where money went to his films since he was always broken). It's a bad bad movie that does not pay off to see except as a Milligans complete set or because some good people joke.
