The director of high school (Keenan Vinn) with the lost basketball team unconsciously hires a coach who turns out to be not only a beautiful blue woman (Cathy Lee Crosby), but also a catalyst for their new ways of winning. Are you really surprised? By the time of romance grows between coach and senior Jack (Michael Biehn). The police have never been notified. In the package along with other Crovn International Pictures as a movie for Grindhouse, this film does not serve. This can be easily edited in a television movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as coach Randi Ravlings, especially in her scarce suits, but I was expecting more than just a R titled titration. A foreign poster that includes a breakfast center hypnotized by his colleagues in the opinion that the former NBA player Sidney Vicks is the real reason for the team's new success, not training for Cathy Lee. Too much fuss and insufficient sleeves make this a great disappointment.
