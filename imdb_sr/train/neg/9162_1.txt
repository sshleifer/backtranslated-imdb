The only reason this movie is rated as 1 is that zero is not one of the options to choose from. With a shop that was thinner than depressed cabbage soup, terrible acting and special effects that appear to have come out of the TV series "Thunderbirds", it's incredible that Vidmark did not kill the director who put the black mark on his resume. Even until the 1950s, special effects are horrible, except for a couple of underwater sequences. I can only assume that he was nominated for the best special effects because, apart from the 20,000 League under the sea and NJEMA, there was no one who made the effects. That year Disney did not have any competition that this was their only competition. I would not recommend a movie, even for movie submarine lovers, because the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to a single shot showing sea water that descends along the periscope. There are other, much better, subfilms you can enjoy in this era, such as the aforementioned 20,000 Leagues or Torpedo Run.
