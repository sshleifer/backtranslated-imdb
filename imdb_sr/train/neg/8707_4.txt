This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I rented it like a joke, expecting to make fun of the first few scenes, and let me say that I've never laughed so much in my life. The first scene in which ninjas accidentally emerge from the air and begin a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredible funny stupid action movies in my life. This is not a movie of dinosaurs, it is more a film that entertains (and does not mean, in general) action genre. I did not see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I do not think I missed much. If you want to watch a movie that goes great with six packages or any herbal medicine, then I insist you rent this movie and sit and watch how 100 years of progress in the movie are thrown into the garbage and turn into a car
