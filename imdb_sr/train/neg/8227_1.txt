I'll hold this fast and sweet. Five girls returning home from a soccer game opt for a 'shortcut' leading them down the abandoned forest path. Of course, nothing is happening to them except good things, which are sure to arrive at their destination. Okay, they do not know. They are soon rushed by disturbed fish that have serious mental problems, and what follows is 90 minutes of pure boredom. I hope I will never again see any of these actors in any movie. Their screaming voices gave me a headache, and the script was so poorly written that it included many repeated phrases and meaningless hysterical screaming. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror movies I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
