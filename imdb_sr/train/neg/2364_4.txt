"Freddi's Dead" did the cleverest thing he could do after disappointing his fifth film. It started from scratch. Of course, this "final" movie in saga is silly, but it's at least genuine. Some of the images are even a bit stunning. And the story of Freddie's child (Lisa Zane), who returns to the city to confront his evil father, is unique. She has a lot of good actors (Zane, Iaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who basically look stupid and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter. It's a one-sided, it's a magic trick, and in the end, it's nothing but stupid, childish fun. <br /> <br />
