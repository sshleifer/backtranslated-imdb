The reviewer from Poland must be a feminist because she thinks that "Young Katarina" is an excellent film and historically accurate. Nothing can be further from the truth. As a practitioner of the Russian historian, for many, many years, I took an exception with the IC almost at every step, and especially a politically correct presentation of her as a boss who brought Russia in its own hands in the direction of domination. The truth? They brought her to St.Petersburg just to be his wife and mother, and she discovered that she had to "tie" her palaces, fighters and army just to survive. While she was not challenging them, she / she was allowed to give in to cultural desires (filling Hermitage with artistic goods, etc.). There is so much evidence that it was not "big", but in this area of ​​postmodern revisionism, the evidence is not very popular. IC is just a costume drama, something of Ted Turner, which, like "Peter the Great" in 1986, is another example of how Russia has shown badly in the West.
