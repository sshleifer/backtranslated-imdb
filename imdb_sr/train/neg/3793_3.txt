The weed was always a problem ballet. It does not resemble the original story of ETA Hofman on which it is based. In the ballet, the story is essentially finished until the second half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Kingdom. Sveets watch a series of character dances. There is an endless variety of stage productions that reinterpret the story in countless ways (not always successful) in order to compensate for the weak libretto ballet. Balanchine's version does not really make any sense for a drama or story (despite the fact that the Tchaikovsky Wonderful is the first act in which there is a lot of drama and mystery). The result is a completely forgotten Christmas party in the first half, when almost nothing happens and where even the dance (the little bit of it) is not particularly memorable. Pantomime is working too much, especially Drosselmeier, which might seem transient on the stage, just looks stupid for the big screen. Unfortunately, things are not much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets (Act II in the version stage). Although there are several choreographic reviews, most choreographies are bland and non-inspiring. It's certainly not antique Balanchine. Balanchine is widely accepted as the master of abstract dance, but I always felt that it was less successful as the creator of the narrative ballet. Looking at this film version of his stage production, the Hedgehog only confirmed this view again.
