Some people could regard this film as part of an artwork - in order to express their imagination in a movie to create a film filled with antagonistic pain and death. . This film is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is this a complete waste of time, it also makes you days. The horror images shown in the movie not only attract you for the air, but they are put into your mind and it takes a few days to forget them. Such a shame that people spend their imagination on such inhuman suffering ... "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, climax and resolution.
