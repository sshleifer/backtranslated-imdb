This film is flawed on many fronts. Like many before, it shows more than the mythology of Alam than history. Production is poor, which generally leaves the impression of a welfare project for many actors who would otherwise have to work on Hollywood markets. This was my greatest disadvantage - I know the age and general personality of the real Alam protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors who chose them to show them never allows any indication of conviction. Texan, I grew up with mythology. Later I learned more about history. I can accept decent production from any perspective (although I prefer historical precision), but that never gave me the chance to enjoy. Even John Vaine's or Fess Parker versions have had more lives than this messy mess, while they are just a little less accurate. Very disappointing - Avoid it.
