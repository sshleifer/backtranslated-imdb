Yes, this movie is a real thief. She stole some great Oscar from the Avatars just because politicians wanted another movie about a war hero to boost acceptance (support?) For the wars that the US is still leading. I really do not want to go to politics, but come on, this is clearer than the summer sky. Hurt locker does not really have anything special, it's not really a complication at all. I really feel in the 50s in Hungary, when the party told people what to love, and what not. The same propaganda films were produced at that time, with the exception that they were black and white. Even if we consider this title a reasonable part of the genre, "US Wars are Cool", you surely have much better movies to choose from.
