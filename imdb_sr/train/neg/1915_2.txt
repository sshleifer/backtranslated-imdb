It's a pretty good band, but the film is not even near the mercy of the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Anyone looking for a fun movie caper should visit the original. Villiam Macchi is perhaps one of our biggest live actors, but he is not using it here. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I'm kind of sorry that he was trying to fill those shoes. I could try to imitate Bogart or young De Niro. The artistic direction is rich and textured, but it does not bring anything into the story, the extra parts that add stories are felt completely unnecessary and the things that are subtracted are missed. Even the beginning of the way it does appear looks bizarrely unnecessary and takes away the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his strange and genius charm, and Luis Guzman has this strange charisma, but part of the love story in the movie looks awkward and straightforward. It's a pity that nobody understood how to make this movie, as it was done for the first time, but it's also a shame that we live in a culture in which we feel like we have to process amazing things instead of simply learning to enjoy the original.
