This was an impulse for me in a local video. Do not make the same mistake as me. This film is boring, incredibly playful and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle was especially badly written and delivered; I grabbed on every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper makes several rare occurrences and his usual disconnection; his role was obviously not for him. And although the film is allegedly set up in Puerto Rico, he feels much more like a part of the Hollywood film; All the main characters are whites and several people who speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Odd. In any case, when you see this on the shelf of your local video store, keep walking.
