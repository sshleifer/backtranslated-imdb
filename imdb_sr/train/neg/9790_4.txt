At least, the set will remain interested for less than ten years. Eleanor (Geena Davis) and Fred (Hugh Laurie) Little, nice, well-off couple, went home from the orphanage to bring a new younger brother to son George (Johnathan Lipnicki). They return home with a rather strange new brother ... a sharp little mouse named Stuart (Michael J Fok). Yes, mouse. Stuart is happy to find a sense of belonging even if he is in a super-big world that contains cat food for his new Snovbell family (by Nathan Lane). Stuart goes into the experience of family loyalty and overall friendship. George will finally accept his little brother, when the trained Stuart saved the shame of a race with a model ship. And voices: Chaz Palminteri, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
