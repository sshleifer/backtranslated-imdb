I do not know who Sue Kramer, the director of this film, but I doubt that A) is a lesbian, and B) somehow embarrassed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove that they are not homophobic. I can imagine that everyone thinks: "My God, this is terrible. It's not funny, it's a pedestrian, it's completely chrome." But keeping her mouth shut for fear of being labeled as anti-gay or "will not get" a gay lifestyle. (This is probably why Kramer did not throw gai people to play and gay people.) In any case, it's not worth it to review. All actors are directed to play every scene completely over the top, so there is neither sincerity nor conviction in everything they do. It's full of cliches and there's nothing about this film that's the least fun - much less fun. I hated it and I'm not afraid to say it. It's a shame that people with no stupidity who gave Kramer the money to build this bomb were not impartial in their assessment.
