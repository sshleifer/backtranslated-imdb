I totally agree with the last commentator, this is perhaps the worst movie ever made. Michael Madsen had to do this movie as a favor to someone. The image quality is grainy to the end. And that is a small plot, it's just stupid. the lower result would be. Do not waste time on this movie or you will regret it.
