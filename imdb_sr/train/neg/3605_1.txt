The cover of the box makes this movie really good, do not be fooled. Splatter University was released in 1984, which was the last good year for horror, but this film is bullshit. The characters are so boring. Only the teacher is cool. There is no conspiracy for this film, who, to the devil, would ever produce this film loss? Distributors in front! woman, we all know that we have to have a wife, if you want to break the rules, do it in good horror, do not throw this waste
