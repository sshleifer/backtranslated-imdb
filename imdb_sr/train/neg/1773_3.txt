Oh, darling! I rarely boreded the movie "horror" or smiled at me, as much as this one. After a witty beginning with an intriguing premise, she descends into something more than a slasher flick, with some supernatural and sexual sides. Usually excellent Alice Krige is lost in this, and complications are creeps. Do not bother if you're not really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
