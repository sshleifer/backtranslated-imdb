I am a big fan of David Linch and I have everything I did on a DVD, except for a hotel room and a two-hour Twin Peaks movie. So, when I learned about this, I immediately grabbed it and ... and ... what is this? It's a bunch of roughly drawn black and white cartoon films that are loud and ugly and immortal. Maybe I do not know what's good, but maybe this is just a bunch of shit that was installed publicly under the name of David Linch to earn a few bucks. Let me make it clear that I did not care about working with the language, but I had to continue to adjust the sound because my neighbors might have. All in all, this is a very disappointing edition and maybe it's just left in the side of the set as curiosity. I recommend that you do not spend your money on this. 2 of 10
