I read all the books Love Come Softly. Knowing that films can not use all aspects of the book, but generally have at least the main point of the book. I was very disappointed in this film. The only thing they have in this film in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit (although both parents come in the book). That is all. The story was so weird and far away, yes, sad, from the book, that I just could not enjoy it. Even if I had not read the book, it was too sad. I know that pioneering life was rude, but the whole movie was bad. The rating is for the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.
