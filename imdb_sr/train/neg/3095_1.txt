Wow, I finally succeeded, after a few attempts, to finish watching this terrible film, only to find out that Rick Sloane and his production team ended up straight to the video sequel this year. Of all the films reviewed by the MST3K - and they are really digging from the bottom of the barrel, showing the reputable bad Manos, "The Werewolf", "Incredibly Strange", and the lesser known disasters such as "Laserblast," Zombie nightmare, and Time Chasers - this must surely be the absolute greatest pile of rubbish they have ever shown (making it perfect for riffing). Quite simply, the film talks about Munchie's gemlin gangs that exploit people's desires for fame, wealth, heroism and, of course, sex in a way that ends up so people are killed. But this is the type of film in which the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, illustrated by two guys struggling in the yard with garden tools), writing is so forced (as is often described) of a gremlin scene hanging on the hand of a girl who would notice it, only turn her head a quarter to the left ... and this is not the first time that it happens in the movie, and the story is so ... rarely paid attention (hence the MST3K riff about "the law in the future where movies must be made by FILMmakers), to actually rebuke for furry dolls to kill everyone a screen. ... The worst movie ever.
