What was the deal with the clothes? Everyone was dressed like something in the late '70s early 80's. Cars were even outdated. The school was outdated. The clothing of the nuns was obsolete, and the hospital looked like something in the forties, with its wards and wooden stairs and things. Nothing in the whole film meant that it happened in 1991. My mother laughed, saying, "Geeeee-od! WHERE is the film filmed?" When we pressed the "INFO BUTTON" button on the remote control, we were sure that 1991 must have been a mistake! Has anyone noticed it? My favorite part, however, was when a woman told her husband, on the phone, about the reverse crucifix in the mirror, and he only says: "Well, look, I have a meeting at the congress, about that later." That line was only classics. JUST LIKE A MAN! The favorite part of my mother was when they gave "Spavn of the Devil Child" their own Rottweiler. My mother said, "Just what should be born in the devil ... Rottveiler" She also enjoyed all the people who were crumbling in churches, clinging to their breasts. Her other favorite part was a guy at the school parking lot, driving 5 miles an hour, heading right into the garbage truck / truck / front end of the loader. He had about 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he just continued, with a real stupid look on his face. I mean, how fast can you go to school parking?!?! Whatever!
