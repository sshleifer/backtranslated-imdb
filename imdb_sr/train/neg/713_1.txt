Can I, first of all, say that I felt so great about this film that I signed for the IMDb specifically to review it. And my review? This is simply the worst movie I've ever seen. <i> The movie synopsis sounded interesting - the Nazis, the occult, the journey through time, etc. But the film shop did not manage to combine all these elements together. Do you remember the South Park episode where the Manatees who wrote the Famili Gui using the 'idea balls' appeared? Did these Manatees write Unholi? As if the writer wanted to incorporate all these different ideas, but he had no idea how to connect them all, and then make things even less meaningful, he included the theme for the journey through Donnie Darko's time to the end, blurring chronology. From the early days I can say that this was a bad movie. Special effects were too low a budget for something better than a DVD. The acting was not great, but I honestly saw it upstairs. I will praise the Nazi images, they were creepy, but the evil Nazi type was just a comic book. I have no vengeance against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I am not even in the horror genre. But this film can not be described as a thriller or a drama. That this story is well told, it would be a good movie. But that was exaggerated. Vaaaaai too much.
