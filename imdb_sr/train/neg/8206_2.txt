With one of my favorite actors, James Spider, I expected this film to be at least tolerable. It was not. After the first half hour, I watched the rest with the remote control in my hand so that it was fast forward. So loosely, so standard, someone knows what will happen in every scene. It can even be predicted by word dialogue. This is one of those films that make them scratch and say, "How's this movie ever filmed?" In an attempt to say something positive, I will add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. But, in general, if you've seen 5 Sci / Fi movies, or are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
