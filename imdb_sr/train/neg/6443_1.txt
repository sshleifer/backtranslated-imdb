I was one of the few non-liberals who appeared to see Steve's video. It was a pretty experience ... in a propaganda movie and a boredom. I hoped the movie would be a real documentary about Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but it turned out to be another liberal effort to fall in love with conservatives and a local religious community. It really seems to be a self-initiative director to make a documentary that only reflects his prejudices about the issues. What's even more surprising is to see all the '10' votes his local voices posted here. Did they even see the video? Hungry Batman, this must rank with all the presidential people! Their ratings are obvious as well as the bias in this film. Yes, like staging votes on IMDb helped in the chrome movie. Maybe my voice will help to balance this.
