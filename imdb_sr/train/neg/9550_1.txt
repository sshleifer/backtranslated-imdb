After Highlander 2 (which I still denied), I thought it was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I liked the original Vargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with the details and details of the original movie. The original Vargames had at least some hake that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew NISTA O RAÄŒUNALIMA, except how to use a word processor. I doubt he's seen the original movie. The act is not even convincing. Please, be saved, under no circumstances, do not watch this movie. I do not care if the channel is jammed on the TV and you can not turn off the TV. This movie will ruin your life.
