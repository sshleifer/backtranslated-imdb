I'm not the best rom / com fan in the best times. It was a bit quite good (Dream for Insomniac check), but this is only more than the same but less. . The only real laugh of laughter is when male parties and friends instinctively help Li's character. I guarantee that there are at least 10 more movies on the shelf that deserve you $ 3 out of 10 (And just because I'm a great Lee fan)
