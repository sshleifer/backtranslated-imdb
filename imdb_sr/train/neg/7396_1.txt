Unfortunately, I have to agree with the critics written by the halophones. For short film, cinema, costumes, sets, sound, assembly and everything else is very, very good. This might seem surprising at first glance, but I was told that the technical team working on it consists of professionals, so quality is expected. The problem, as usual, lies in the story itself. The point is, it's not really a story. To tell the story (or in the case of a movie, SHOW STORY) you need a plot and a conflict. You need things that are happening to the protagonist: events. These events are happening because the protagonist wants something and for some reason he can not get it. Tim Vatcher has no problems or goals. He is the kind of supernatural entity that sees humanity. That's it. So, what we have here is pure exposure. Instead of telling us the story, we simply teach things about this Tim Watcher individual. Naturally, given the special nature of Tim Vatcher and the short duration of the film, it is difficult to give enough background on him to make the film fit on Voice-Over Narration. In this case, it is being used in the worst possible way, that is, giving information that we would not normally hear. In fact, if there were no VOs, they would think that the figure is just a silly old man looking at things. VO also explains what's happening on the screen! The images we've shown are only decoration for the text we're listening to. I could say that this short film would make a good video for the band or something, but because the pictures do not stand alone, it's impossible to say that. What remains obviously has a value as a measure of the crew's technical capabilities (not unbelievable, but good), but fails to entertain, entertain, excite or, at the very least, display the story.
