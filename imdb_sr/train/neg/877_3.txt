I was delighted to watch this film, expecting it to be a sequel to the cult classical "Private Lessons" that shows the dream of every male teenager. I remember. It's just a plain soft-core Cinemak movie that will not change your life. There's only one sexy scene in the roof, but that's it. I've been looking at it for a long time, but believe me, this is just an ordinary boring soft flick. Women are hot, but it is not enough to rent or buy a movie. My advice is to watch this only if it is broadcast via cable.
