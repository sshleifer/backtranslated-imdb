The film started slowly when we came to the cinema, we thought it looked pretty good, but after about 5 minutes we were all bored and wondered what kind of movie we came to see, I do not like this movie and I would not recommend to anyone, the best part of the night it was when the alarm and lights came back because the project broke down because we thought that we all could go home. This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen that we all were annoying or minded, and most people in the cinema actually came out of the door at the end because it was so dirty. I'm surprised that nobody came out before. if you go and see that, make sure you get busy, do not go even better and do not see it at all.
