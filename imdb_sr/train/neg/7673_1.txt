I do not know where to start from. Tara Reid should be stopped before being placed in another movie. Stephen Dorff looks like he got the motivation of his character from Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". Slater lullabies through this shit. Mode, editing, sound (do we really need a heavi-metal video in the middle of a pistol?), Kostime (vest with muscles on them), and hey, there is no noticeable plot. I'm astounded that none of the project stops and says, "Hey guys, this just does not make sense, let's start over." I hope Slater's career can recover from this disaster. Lower the worst movie I've ever seen.
