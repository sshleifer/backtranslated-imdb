Avoid this unless you want to watch a movie but a bad movie. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in the French film. What? Well, think about this. Cowboy music is hilarious for fighting swords. Or, what do you think of a woman in the underwear, holding a knife and jumping to bed? Someone should do 'What is Tiger Lily' on this bomb? Re-write the script, then either dub or subtitle. It's almost now. (BTV, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Boukuet, both known to the American audience, have roles.)
