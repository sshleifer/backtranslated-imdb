No one should try to adjust Tom Robbins's book for the screen. While the film is good and the performances are good, a good reading dialogue is shit when it comes to speaking. Or, in other words, no one could suggest that the hearing of a foreign name was like seeing it written on a pearl. All in all, the film feels like a badly adapted Cliffs Notes to the book - most of the pieces are carved to a fifth of their size in the book, in terms of the previous and current story, and the end is wild (and unpleasant) from the one in the book. Most of the complications from the book have been lost, including one that makes everything meaningful at the end, and there is more than one reference that makes sense in the book, which makes the viewer say "Huh?" Unfortunately, not worth the effort - the script was to be read, compared to the book, burned down, and all the actors went to do something much better. I admire Gus Van Sant, but none of his caliber could have made a decent movie about such a complicated book without making a mini-series.
