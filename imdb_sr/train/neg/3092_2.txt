If movies like Ghouls discard Gremlins, then Hobgoblins sink to a new level of garbage dumping like Ghoulia. These barely animated furries have some sort of scheme to fill fantasies (which include basically sexual dreams of grotesque characters - oh joy), but what has to do with any speculation, except for the director to let himself fall for her preference for eroticism. They show this in the eighth round of Hell, the suspect. There is no real complication - just "goblins - kill!" and weak attempts of humor and a mild attempt to wake the audience.
