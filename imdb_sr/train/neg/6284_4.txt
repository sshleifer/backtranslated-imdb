I liked the initial premise of this movie, which is what led me to catch it, but the problem that I quickly found was that one knows how much it will happen in the first 20-30 minutes (the couples will come behind the mirror and we will not take everything ). There is no real turning point (which is fine), but even the final disclosure does not make much sense (how can she be upset by uncertainty and fear for the whole movie, if it is a bad id of a mirror?). However, the scenes 'outside the mirror' calmed down when they first appeared, and the murder of blondes is also effectively creepy, but ultimately, unfortunately, it appears to be a movie in search of a story or more interesting scenarios, a bunch of atmospheres in the atmosphere and a superb sound design of 80-90 minutes, actually it does not cut it, in fact it gets pretty boring.
