The movie featuring Salma Haiek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. An independent movie sounds even better. The study will control less content that will allow actors and writers and directors of more creativity. But why is this film so pale? Ask the dust. This film assumes that we are heavily invested in characters. Nobody gets a real story in the background, so we never know why characters act in the way they do it. Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if you continue to be left at the end of this film. I told my friend that I went to watch this movie, and that I thought it was terrible. Her question: "Even Colin Farrell could save him? My answer:" Even the donkey Colin Farrell can not save him. "
