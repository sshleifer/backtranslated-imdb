I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is horrible. Just terrible. I love Shav Bros movies. (I'm not a hater.), and I had great expectations of this because I found it on many "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies". (Now I am convinced that all the 10 best lists are all cutting and gluing jobs.) First of all, there is hardly any action in the movie. The majority of the film consists of telling about the plot, which is an incredible feat because it is thin at best. Even the action itself might have been impressive in 1978, but it's a routine by today's standards. A special warning to Netflik users: DVDs that deliver are terrible; the picture is terrible and not even 16: 9 improved.
