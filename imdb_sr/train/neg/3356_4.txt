In Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting of Hill House is an atmospheric story of terror that transmits supernatural phenomena to an old villa. The atmosphere is well placed, and the winters are well placed. Maroting masterpiece. The haunting 'The Haunting' 1963 stays closely related to the book, but also adds its details to the store. Fortunately, it's very little, so the horror of books and winters is even better done on the screen. Black and white photography only contributes to the creepiness of the film. Perfect! And then Jan de Bont did this. In 1999, The Hauntinga remodeled the cinema - if you could call it a remake. Why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself, but for now, let's look at the film itself. It starts on average, like most horror movies. The Hill House set is beautiful, and strangely mysterious, and in minutes, it seems like the movie will actually be quite correct. And then comes the first fear: a loose wire for a harpsichord cuts a female face (Assistant Dr. Marrow). This is hilarious, and the truth is that it almost drowns me. From then on, the film only spirally descends. The act seems to be somewhat woody as the film continues, with Owen Wilson's character being particularly irritating (so it's a relief when he cuts off his head). , which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and it looks very old. Examples of this are many, so I will not try to make them. So, all in all, I, along with hundreds of others, strongly recommend that you watch the original cooler or, as an alternative, buy the novel Shirley Jackson. But please, stay away from this. And, if you decide to watch this, watch it on TV (since many channels like to show this movie, not the original) or rent it cheaply, but please do not buy it, whatever you do. Do not waste your money! Final score: 4/10
