Where to begin ?! . . . I feel ... broken! That's right, broken! I just spent 1.5hrs of my life, 1.5hrs that I could spend doing something more useful, such as looking at the color of the dry, to this so-called horror flick. not dramatically, no action, nothing ... Its predictability, annoying, tragic ... Perhaps I will come here a bit rough, but watch this movie and you will be feel the same way ... or ... no, do not look ... unless you want to feel violated.
