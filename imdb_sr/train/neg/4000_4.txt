I enjoyed the "American Movie", so I rented Chris Smith's first film, which I thought was a documentary. In the first minute I saw it was not, but I started it. What's the movie on the dead side. Being faithful to life does not work for you if you are just going to examine the anxiety, especially. the boredom that we have already met. I'm sorry, but will it come as a recovery for anyone who 1) many jobs shit and 2) most of them are shitty, the minimum wage jobs in the service sector ??? I knew it before I saw the movie. Anyhow, it did not allow testing at all, because while the movie struggles to feel "real" (handheld camera, no music, etc.), what's happening hardly takes place like in the "real world". Would the employer be so glad for Randy when he picked up his check after Randi left him after 3 days when the guy said he expected to stay 6 months ?? Or the day after he left the job (and screwed up the machine he was working on), everyone would be so easy for him? The big problem is our "hero" (?), Randi. This guy is a loser. Not because he got stuck on these jobs, or he has a tiny apartment, or he looks like one. He's a drug. He does not pay attention or even really tries on these jobs. He has zero. If I had to hire someone, he would not go through an interview. important movies. "American Job" does not work.
