Everyone noticed that Tommy had only 3 facial expressions. 1. It looks like angry eyes gives to every enemy. 2. Holding your hand in the face, mouth agape and scared eyes. 3. Smiling Tommy Turnbull. I must say that I hate this show, I do not watch it, but like Lioko, we all looked at at least one, I must say that this show is a border racist, uninteresting and meaningless. Each episode ends with the victory of a robot, except for one exception when the robot essentially allows this overly freaky freakazoid to fly off the plane. Jokes are also pretty rough, I think that these are mostly people who say the word "suck" or fart, I think that the more violent show is shocking. Is there no one hiding a bowling ball under your hatred, and the other uses a chain, for God's sake, what kind of school they will go to. Not to mention his older brother, who is a border psychopath, and has no other character traits. The whole broadcast I feel has been disconnected by the KSLR and Fosters megas. It's like it can be said that the trio of the cooperator, the Gemini and Kiva, and Robotboi are similar to Megas, where they beat anyone, no matter what the chances are, and he is free even though he is a robot. There is simply no regret for this show, I'm surprised it's still working.
