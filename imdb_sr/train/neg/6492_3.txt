I was not entirely sure what to expect from comedy, drama, fantasy, science fiction genre, but, considering the actors involved, I thought I would turn it around. The tone of the film was uncomfortable, passing through the patches of each of the genres, but it was never completely balanced, so I finally gave up trying, and concentrated on cinema and individual performances, which I thought were good as a whole, getting each character had little depth due to the nature of the story (nothing will be given here). I have to say that he felt much longer than 96 minutes, not in a good way. In the end, I asked for a closure, some measure of satisfaction, but it did not turn out to be a smart or ingenious piece of work that I hoped would be. I think Tony mistakenly thought that what he did at the end of the film gave us that ... but it was a tragic mistake to try to confirm the previous 95 minutes with a poorly conceived conclusion. In the end, I feel cheated. It would be better for the IMO to let it stand without "ending" as a piece of art ... only. Or ... maybe I completely missed the point :)
