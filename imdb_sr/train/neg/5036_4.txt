SVEET SIKSTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirlei, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell Fifteen Years Bad Girl Melissa is New to Desert city ​​and it does not go long before people start dying around it. The detective must make traces with the help of his daughter, Nancy Drew, who played on Friday the 13th alumni of Dana Kimmell. Local Indians are the main suspects because they seem to upset the prejudices of citizens. These events led to the discovery of a murderer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party. This sub-sample slasher is not too memorable. It's made for a TV feeling, without much haste, besides its own crazed theme song of the title character that plays several times. Lines like "killers will turn us into a salad." Get fit into the standard scenarios of the eighties. He calls Marci Melissa a bad name, and then somehow instantly develop friendship. Apparently, Marci sees it difficult to fit, because Melissa knows how to wear makeup. This film would be difficult to make today, while the main character is a fifteen-year-old, and the director inserts more worthless close-ups. The social comment of the Indians was not sufficiently developed to seriously grasp. I am too surprised by the rather high rating this film receives. And "Sweet Sixteen" and "Bloody Birthday" Ed Hunta had the potential to use that honorable tradition of the birthday party to create an intense series of massacres, but I feel that it did not work. But on the brighter side, the release of unknown movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow.
