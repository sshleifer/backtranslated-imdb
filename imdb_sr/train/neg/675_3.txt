City girl Meg Tilly received her mother's terrible phone call and, apparently shamed, returning home to her family's excavations, just to face the mystery: why all the inhabitants of the homeland behave in bizarre and disturbing ways? The radio thriller, who barely nods his head to ecology, has inhabitants of a small town who are crazy, which (funny) involves two women looking at each other with a desire in a public place and Tim Matheson receives the oral attention of the girl on the bench in the office. The picture is too stupid for words, consumes Till's craving and quiet intensity on the trash, while he is forced into a corner from which he can not hope to get out. Some of Thomasa Del Ruto's cinema is good (especially the sequence of fire in the garage), although it has been lowered due to frenzied editing - and quite a bathetic finale. The simplified scenario has an uneasy surprise, as well as a piece of originality in the sleeve. * 1/2 of ****
