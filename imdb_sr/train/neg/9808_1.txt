The worst thing I've ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who, for some unexplained reason, have super powers, and when using a special device, they turn into strange, poorly designed suits. Playing when they are not in retarded suits looks decent. It's definitely not good, but it's not the worst thing I've ever seen. However, when they wear suits, the actor's acting goes from bad to bad; much, much worse. Hyper-animated idiots have countless unnecessary movements. Even when they speak, they seem to have attacks. Zlikovci are dumber than Rangers. Every episode, a weak, idiotic villain comes with a plan to destroy Rangers. Then he sends the force of hyper-animated aliens to attack Rangers. Rangers then initialize their 10-hour animation transformation, and then destroy aliens. Then, a poorly designed criminal, who can be either an armor-monger who actually looks and acts evil, to a creature similar to a humanoid bumblebee with trumpets attached to his back that shows the obvious signs of mental retardation. Powers Rangers fight the villain, and then the villain turns into Godzilla, whether it's a raining cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, nuclear bombs are on creatures and creatures turn into giants). Powers Rangers spend 5 minutes playing a hyper-animation and calling their Zodiacs which are obviously toys that the producers of shaws used for special effects to look real. The Powers Rangers win, the criminal is angry, everyone surrenders a "valuable" lesson, and the concert ends. That's it. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, a fake battle for kung fu.
