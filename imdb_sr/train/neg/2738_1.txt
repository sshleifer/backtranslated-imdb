Trash / bad films are usually not bad because I will find them more enjoyable. This is so bad that I have no more say to describe it - it's under "bad". At the beginning of the movie there is a guide that tells you what to do during the film. Needless to say that instructions and a dozen beers can not help me sit through the whole movie. One tagliner compared this with KILLBILL, which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent one. Obvious. this tagliner had a plan to tempt you to buy this DVD. If you're considering renting this DVD, drop it! If you are thinking about buying, do not think! If you are unhappy about having this DVD, do not play it, throw it in the garbage canvas immediately.
