If they could bring Ed Asner why they did not get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers? And why the protagonist threw a wise old sage on the ground when he was never in danger. This made the old man mask the pride of pride and that the young man felt guilty that he had left him with life-long disability. I guess that is the reason why the main character refuses money and why the old man works as a dog even when he volunteers for additional work. If a d-bag boy is a bad guy because he is at a distance, why is a soldier better then? She has a good reason to be jealous, a good reason to drag her out of her hometown and through a protective, controlling manipulative father. All the characters thought to be nice are not all of them being a "bad" boy. How did they even meet, a wine broker and a sawmaker?
