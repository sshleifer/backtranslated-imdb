If half of the movie looks strangely familiar, it means you are watching too much of the disgusting Italian cult of shit! You see, the notorious half-brother Lucio Fulci not only produced this film, but also the freedom to re-use most Sadistic sequences of killing in his (and easier to follow) "Cat in the Brain". Already the starting scene, in which the prostitute is brutally cut off by an ax, is a feature of Fulcin's later film and so is another handful of murders and mournful moments. "Massacre" Andrea Bianchi fails as a giallo, as the search for a sadistic killer among the film crew who filmed horror films is only tempting and uncertain, but it's still a good party if you are in a cheap and terrible race. . An incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of disgusting characters that are all potential maniacs, but none of the red hackers of Biachi has come to the fore, and you can immediately point to the killer. Whatever you are left to enjoy are really the misogyny effects of makeup and the hilariously terrible acting performances of the ensemble. Whenever there is no bloodthirsty on the screen, as between the first and second killings, the "massacre" is slow and almost unbearable with its meaningless dialogues and a completely unobtrusive photo. Fortunately, in the second half, women were put on fences, and men were repeatedly stabbed with rusted spikes. Music is crap and the use of location for recording is very unimaginable. My advice would be to skip this puppy and go straight to the above-mentioned "cat in the brain". This one of them contains ALL great moments of "massacre" and then some.
