this is probably the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie ... ever. And what about casting. the lead lady in this movie has some kind of dis-figuration of the nose and it's almost impossible to look at any time period without fixing on the nose. you could go to the local store on Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 qualified, better-looking leading ladies. I made an unfortunate mistake renting this movie because it had a "cool" DVD case. This film seems to be just a class project for a group of students of multimedia at the local technical faculty. I'd rather spend an hour to watch this movie on television for public access ... at least the special effects are better and people there are more attractive than anyone you see in this movie
