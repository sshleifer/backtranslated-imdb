As Charles Dance says in this film, "Bollocks!" There is no complication, character development, and extremely incredible. Full things that do not happen in the real world (since when are British police inspectors armed with pistols in shoulders?). A lot of mistakes (Bulgarian trains in London?). It's full of stupid and artificial dialogue. And directing / editing is terrible - cluttered hand-crafted cameras that do not add anything to the film except the vague feeling of seasickness; confusing leaps; no structure. The character of Vesleia Snipes is completely inconceivable - why should we worry about what will happen to him? Directly to video? Directly to the waste bin!
