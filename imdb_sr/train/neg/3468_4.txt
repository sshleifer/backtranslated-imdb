The Student Film Director invites a Class B actress (a brilliant diva-ish MOLLY RINGVALD!) To complete a film about the horror that her mother (terribly annoying Kilie Minogue!) Tried to make 12 years ago. This is the most unusual choice for the action, because any Aussie fan horror knows that the genre is missing from the director's women. The movie has a curse because Moli had to kill a psycho killer on the original set. But she returned, because she needs exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the set. Cut is an Austrian attempt at a modern "slasher", but unfortunately it brings nothing new or exciting to the table. In fact, it raises half of the Craven's 90's. A lot of the movie world - the name is "Scream" (except that Aussie name-fall - Jane Campion ... sees this not so funny) and a lot "is this really, or is this movie" la "New Nightmare". Editing is bad, music is boring, the effects are ridiculous, almost everything is bad about it. Fortunately, the movie can have a sense of humor: at one point a well-dressed girl in the film crew says to the owner of the house where she is shooting: "Do not worry, we'll treat your house as if it were ours," to which he responds, "to me It does not mean anything, you look like you're living in a dump! "Ha! And Molly's funny one-tiered ones were enough to not regret having rented this one. "Do you have any kind of diet here?" (while driving in the movie professor's car) and "Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu?" (first that murmurs on the set) and "Where is the hell, my agent?" (Wait, that's what I thought about her.)
