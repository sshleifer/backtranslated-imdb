This film was a real disappointment for me. I have been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I learned to make a movie about him, I was very excited, I got a film about VHS when it came out, and I was tortured by what I saw the film was not about his life, but already about his death. I thought it would be a film about the origin of Grams of life and music, but they had to record a film about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his death in books and movies, I wanted a film about his life, not about his notorious death. I was very disappointed. I would like people to see his life, more than his death. The only thing that's good in this movie was his music. This film is a disappointment to every Gram Parsons Fan.
