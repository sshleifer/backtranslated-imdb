You like beautiful girls? Yes, me too. What's bad about pretty girls / women? I have nothing, so why would I give this film only 2 stars out of 5, even though I got the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriiame and Aia Ueto? If I really wanted to watch wonderful people, I would watch MTV or something for what. This is a movie, a so-called action movie. So, by definition, does not need real land at all? I do not agree 100%, but let's say to that. What then is needed? 20 minutes a shot from the first part (maybe I exaggerate a little, but it was more than 20 minutes ...)?! That would be "No". But again you never know, people who watched the part one may not know what they ate for breakfast, so to remind them ... hey, maybe they remind them even twice? Just to be sure that they will not forget ... at least until the credits appear, of course !!!! So forget the story, the character development, the real emotions, the "acting" (and no, I do not think women in skirts who walk and / or fight for the acting!) ... what does it leave? Yes, the action scene. Action scenes are not bad and that's why I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! I gave a chance to this movie, but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / look at, believe me ...
