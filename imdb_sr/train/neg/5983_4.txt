I was one of those "several Americans" who grew up with all the amazing creations of Gerri Andersen. Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made an excellent action / adventure movie that only writers could figure out where to target it. we do not expect to target such a low age group. Like Lost in Space, this could also be visually stunning and exciting. It was supposed to focus on more action / adventure and to the goal of the original series ... rescue people in trouble. younger than the original). The break part was Ladi Penelope and Parker. I did not care much for the characters in the original, but I was grateful for them in the movie. Stole the show! I always enjoyed Thunderbird for high-tech rather than stories, and even that I did not have enough time for the screen. I would enjoy seeing more cool things. But then, I'm just a big kid ...;)
