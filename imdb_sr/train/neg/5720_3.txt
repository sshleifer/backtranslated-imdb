Some gorehound-friends have recommended me "Live Feed", and basically I can not complain because the film certainly yields abundant amounts of rough nonsense and baskets of full sleeves, but of course it's not a good movie. More than obvious monetization of the latest trends in horror cinema, so-called. Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to outperform every other movie in this genre (including the "Hostel" and "Sav" patterns) with their sick and distorted effects of makeup and thoroughly distorted footage of naked co-eds tried, patched and prayed for your lives. There is no real conspiracy to describe. Five totally meaningless twenty friends traveling to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but I also do not know why they decided to travel instead of Cancun. Obviously, they are not interested in continental culture, and even cause a feverish scene when they see a sweet dog in the local market. The quintet later goes into night life, and one of them accidentally harasses the leader of the criminal clan. Simply apologizing is obviously not enough, as the gangster follows them into an adult theater and gradually submits to all evil torture. One girl stabbed her chest, and another poor girl even pushed her poisonous snake down her throat; iikes. "Live Feed" is surprisingly boring despite all the bloodshed and amateur production values ​​that are quite difficult to overlook, even if you're used to watching an independent fan-boi trash movie like this. The fat guy shown on the front page, an oriental deadly master, is recognized quite cool and he is also the most talented of the whole crowd, for the bar keeps mouth closed all the time. I would not really recommend this bunch of dirt, but hey, if you love loud and disgusting metal music, torture a crappy recording and blurry losers, go straight and watch!
