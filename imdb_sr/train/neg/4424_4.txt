Uh Oh! Another gai film. This time shows the black side. Bet on your last dollar to have an unhappy ending! But why? With only less than half a dozen exceptions, ALL gai films must end with death or fine "addio". It's like all the European Noir movies of the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's. Lead ... male or female must die or go alone into oblivion. Why, in the name of God, the writers, directors and producers should leave the audience to the theater and feel depression? After all, it should be gay ... not an act. Perhaps the category should be changed to the 'glum' movie. A large percentage of gay relationships lasts and couples drive together in the sunset! No matter who writes or produces, it only shows the bottom side of the gaius of life and gives the wrong impression of the gaius way of life. This film just proves my position. If you rent a DVD, take an antidepressant because here comes another 'gay' movie! This is wrong!
