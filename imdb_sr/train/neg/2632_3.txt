It's sad to evaluate a movie with many of my favorite actors, locations and genres, i.e. Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, DC and the political thriller, but 'The Sentinel' really hits. As if they had a great idea, they signed a real throw and had great city recordings, then went on vacation, leaving the remaining team to improvise the rest. I wish I could blame another brighter performance from Basinger (not only to feel like one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but still steamed over a decade later that she is the only, and definitely only a bad actor in the movie to win Oscar for "LA Confidential.") But she was not the only problem. Sutherland, whom I love as Jack Bauer at '24', is playing Jack again. I miss my old 'Time to Kill' or 'A Few Good Men'. Douglas certainly took a break from acting and he called this. Plot: Someone, a traitor of the Secret Service, wants the president to be dead, and Douglas is (incidentally) framed. Will anyone trust him? In fact, there is no spoiler here: as fast as they came to that base to the end, it's almost before you know it. And why did anyone want the president to be dead? Is this disclosed below? Too many holes in the land, too open doors and never closed and too predictable 'Sentinel'. If you watch only one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who is familiar with these types of movies or even has seen only one episode of 'Lav & Order' that you will know in the first frame. Was it terrible? Not exactly, the cinema was good, and despite Sutherland playing again with Jack, he still has it.
