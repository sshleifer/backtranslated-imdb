The cabin of fever is the first feature film directed by Elia Roth. Roth and Randi Pearlstein have written a script from the Roth story. This is a zombie film, which owes much to George Romer and his "living dead films", and the original Tekas Chainsav Massacrenot to mention "Evil Dead" by Sam Ramy. There is nothing original here, and the story is not tempting. The acting is in par with this genre, only the story fails. And he made it better. He said that after achieving commercial, if not artistic success from this film, Roth decided that the director came out with an infinitely terrible, mean, absurd (although much more ambitious) bullshit fest Hostel.Roth Cabbage Fever is not a good movie, but compared to the hostel it is an artwork. I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) has convinced this guy that filming is a wrong career choice. Home fever, poor 3/10 because it was not so smal as Hostel.
