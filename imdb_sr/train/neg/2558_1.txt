I should have checked this for the website, and I looked at it with optimism that it might at least be cheesy but fun rip off, and it's not even good enough. "666: Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (Even worse than "Godsend") with scenes ripping from "Omen" without shame. The end is even very similar to the way the Omen ends. Not to mention that acting, writing, and story are just devastated. If these movies make money, I'm sad to see where the asylum goes. Shame.
