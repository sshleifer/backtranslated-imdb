This typically melodramatic Bollivood film has unexplainedly become favorite among Western critics. The script is ridiculous, acting at the top, and it looks embarrassing. The only reason to watch this soap opera is the wonderful song sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain invoked by the legendary Meena Kumari. Watching an actress who was ill during the shooting and drank to death at the age of 40 after the film was released has the same fascination as watching the train wreck. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but he lacks the authority to perform both tasks well. Bollivood has produced much better movies.
