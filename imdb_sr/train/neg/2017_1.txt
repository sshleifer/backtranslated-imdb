The action is convincing, but banal, i.e. The beautiful and neglected wife of a rich and powerful man has a flop with a psychotic piece, and then she tries to conceal her while she is psycho and blackmail her. But what is evolving here is astoundingly illogical. Despite the resources available to ordinary couples who have money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine seems to have only one domestic, their lawyer and local police (who say they can not do anything) are available as they get into uncertainty and terror. They do not have private security personnel (only a fake security system that fails), home or field staff, drivers, etc. It does not even seem to be the means to engage private nurses who care about the hero when they are in danger of life-threatening injuries, leaving men and women alone and vulnerable in their home. Our heroine is shown as having a brains of the handle, and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the most unusual and irrational way. The production is an insult to spectators who in vain have spent their time with this crime and crime that lost the talents of veteran actors Olive Hussei and Don Murray (what did they mean?). And, the embarrassment on Lifetime Television for insulting its audience for this unobtrusive offer.
