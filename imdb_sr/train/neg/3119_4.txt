Robin Villiams gave a fine performance at The Night Listener as well as other band members. However, the film seems to have rushed and leaves too many free ends to be considered "must see". I think the problem is because there is not enough strong connection between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to write it in this way because IMDb wants to automatically correct the spelling on "Niko"). The film lasts just over 1:30 and for the first 15 minutes, or at least that looks, Noon starts searching for Pete Logan, the boy he calls. about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not too deep, they mostly consist of how you are ... I'm in the hospital ... why did you leave the boy ... etc? In the book, the kid almost becomes an underdog psychiatrist and defect. and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy, when he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he could be a fraud. the audience remains to be wondering why? Since there is no strong relationship between Noon and the callers, why be tormented? Who cares if the caller does not exist? I know there is a difference between books and movies, but these calls and that connection were crucial for setting up on the screen because it provides the basis for the rest of the movie. Since this does not happen, the film decays. This is surprising due to Maupin's other work, Tales of the Citi. When it was made in a mini-series, it worked great.
