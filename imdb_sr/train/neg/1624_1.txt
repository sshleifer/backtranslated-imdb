I've seen this movie a couple of years ago. I could not sleep and there was nothing. So I checked him. What really matters to me is that it does not make sense and that's why it's disturbing. Richard is tied to chicken wires, and Jarvis begins to hang out with Richard's girlfriend while she is unconscious. Then Jarvis's friend Troubador plays some stupid song on his guitar. The next morning, Richard's girlfriend talks to Jarvis and Troubi, then returns to Richard and looks at him while he's still in touch. Then they play some happy music and the film is over. I mean, what happened? Have they stopped? And what did she say to those two (Troubi and Jarvis)? It's confusing and poor. I can not stand movies that are disturbing and do not make sense. This was the worst movie I've ever seen since the version of the "Lord of the Flies" of the '90s.
