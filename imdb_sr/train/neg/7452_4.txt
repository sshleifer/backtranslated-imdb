For me, this movie just fell on his face. The main problem for me was throwing Glover as a serial killer. I do not know if it grows out of casting or simply his behavior, but I doubt that Glover could ever show a convincing bad guy. He's a good guy, and that's always obvious in his performances. In addition, the film is your series of stories about the serial killer. Nothing very innovative.
