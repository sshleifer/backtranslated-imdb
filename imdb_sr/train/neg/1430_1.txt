As we walked through the channels of late Saturday night, my friends and I came across this film. First, the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as an Indian? Seriously?! His accent pierced so much, although his character was obviously Scottish. Then I was stunned when I discovered that this film was shot after playing James Bond / Agent 007 twice already. This film shows stereotypes, with an inspirational professor figure. The girls who played Poni should pay for keeping their mouth closed. And this film was awarded? I can not believe. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we seriously wanted to evaluate our eyes after we watched this for only 10 seconds. We switched to "Kicking and Screaming" on this, and we wanted to go back. We watched the childish classic "Indian in the cabinet" of 1995, who also talked about Iroquois. The next line is our desire to escape: "Take me out, earthy catcher." From "Gray Sove": "If you do not like it, you do not have to watch."
