With Goldie Havn and Peter Sellers in a movie that you thought would not make this a mistake. But what can I say? This was a terrible leap. The film is about Peter Sellers as an elderly gentleman who suddenly finds himself in touch with really strange young people not to mention the attractive hippie at Goldie Havn. The film is incredibly disconnected and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Havn are very funny people, but this film does not prove it. This song about 'Arabella Cinderella' is pretty cool, but that's it. I recommend this film only to people who like to watch an extreme newspaper, it's almost the definition of a single movie. I suppose this film is more than any other sign of time, in terms of definitive experimentalism and everything about unconventionality, the problem is that the quality is fully recorded, and writing, not to mention the direction, is right there. Especially Peter Sellers is very hit and missed; he will go from Dr. Strangelove and Being There during his career, to stupid movies like this one and Magic Christian, which was very similar to this in context and style, but that movie had a few funny moments. This is nonsense, and I'm sad that someone is as good as Peter Sellers was in this movie. Not recommended to anyone.
