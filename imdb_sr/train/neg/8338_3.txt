This film is very important because it suggested this thinking: sometimes you might want to be sick ... sometimes you may want to have a syndrome ... sometimes, for example, you may want to have Goldfield syndrome ... so you "do not I remember this boring movie ... and above all you do not remember Adam Sandler's superfluous ... sometimes, you just want to ... rent another movie ... My voice? 3 from 10. My proposal? If you're not a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (... it's a joke that does not have a fan of Adam Sandler .. I want to hope), save yourself ... Somebody to save? Drev Barrimore ... maybe.
