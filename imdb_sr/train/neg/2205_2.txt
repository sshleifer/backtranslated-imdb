This type of plot really has a lot of potential, but it's slaughtered here. Frankly, I felt the cheese element at the beginning, but I thought it would be better after grotesque birth. Vhoa, I made a mistake! So a crazy scientist makes a monster, wants to brag to his old friends before he kills them, but of course they escape. After that, it's really bad. I should have counted the time when the shark rubber mask ran over some leaf, but I would probably lose the number. Go down to the bloody drops from the cut off leg to show how a man-shark finds people. I hate to feed myself with the spoon of every aspect of the horror film. Oh, and after me almost killed a mutated male shark and walked around the jungle island, there is nothing more exciting than the middle man who recites Shakespeare ... This is the place where You will find the roots of the monsters ... if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for the sound.
