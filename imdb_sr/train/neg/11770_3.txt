'P' (or Club-P) should really call 'L' for chrome. Every festival has a disappointment, and that's one that fails to fulfill its big logo: "Thai lesbians fighting the monsters." Instead, this is a story about a girl from a Khmer country who learned a little return from the baku, along with a few strange (but specific) rules: "do not walk under the rope," "do not eat raw meat," and "you do not accept money for your power. " Well, guess which people, the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a "bar-girl" and breaks up all the rules her grandmother has learned, and then frees the evil spirit that perfectly kills the "foreign boys" who pay for it Services . Although this film can not be released in Thailand due to a controversial topic, most American audiences will find this ho-hum horor pic cross between "Shovgirls" and "Vampire Interview", as directed by Walt Disnei . If not for several scenes with significant amounts of blood, MPAA could probably only evaluate it for teens. There are literally broadcast TV shows of adults, although you would expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the movie about the brothel, and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life. <br /> <br /> What Regarding the lesbian angle, there is one short ear and a pair "I love you" to prove that the two main stars are really a couple (on a brother). And the P bar must be the only exotic dance club on the planet where girls hold their sarongs and they do carnival tricks (there's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers from the girl's mouth ... o, phallic images.) NO / Nude naked, DOES NOT make a monster (unless you count on five feet high Thais Ghost with yellow eyes), and in no way should ADULT be paid to see this kind of nonsense except on DVD. You are warned!
