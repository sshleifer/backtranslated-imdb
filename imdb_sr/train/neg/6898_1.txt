Avoid this shit at all costs. Poor scripts, bad directing, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. You got an idea? This film is trying to be Western flavored, not. He tries to be violently violent, he is not. He tries to show a new look at the old genre. Actors are trying out there best, and my heart is going. But with such unusable material to work with it, it's hard to do something great. For me this is everything looks "fresh outta film school will set the world on" the first attempt. Filmmaker producers often bite more than they, or their budget, can chew. The best they can do is to take a few steps backwards, to review what is possible, and to work for the next time period.
