I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he meant when filming this movie. Normally if he made a bad movie I could blame the screenwriter or director, but in this case, it's all he is. The accuracy of this film is his fault. It proves that even Heston can not make an interesting Shakespeare story. I spent two and a half hours of my life on this nap and I will never get that time again. This is by far the worst Heston movie I've ever seen. If you are a Shakespeare fan, you may be able to enjoy this movie, but if you do not waste time, you will regret it for a long time.
