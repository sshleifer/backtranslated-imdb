Jane Russell proved to be a great musician-comedy in a similar title "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" ?? but, unfortunately, this film breaks down these skills. There is a budget and a nice photo from Paris, but the movie just does not work. It seems that Ms. Russell plays Marilyn Monroe. That does not leave anyone to play Jane Russell adequately. Some of the other players are outside of their element. There are several embarrassing scenes; First of all, warn: there is a music number where African cannibals "cook" brunettes in the pot, after Alan Ioung sings in a gorilla suit. This is interesting, sometimes shameful, wasting resources. *** Gentlemen Marri Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Ioung, Scott Brady
