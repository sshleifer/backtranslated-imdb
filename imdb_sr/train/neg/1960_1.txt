I tried to finish this movie three times, but that's terrible. Case: Mom and daughter are driving to bed and breakfast, mom stops on gas, a crazy petrol pump is angry at her husband, whose running at the B & B is trying to rape her. She runs away, moves to B & B and instead of becoming a ballisticist, she wants to call the police, the story continues only with lukewarm behavior on both parts. Wow. Other deficits in the logic of the action are abundant. Operation is also lukewarm, and a neighbor's warning is delivered at a very tight time. The intense kill / death moments do not unequivocally intertwine with warm scenes of interaction between characters. Less focus on the up, more focus on mood and story would be appreciated.
