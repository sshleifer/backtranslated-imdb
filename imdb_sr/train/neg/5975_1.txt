I never wanted to watch this movie, then one day, I looked at him for a joke to see how bad it was; my prejudice has been confirmed. For the start, I would like to question the politics of the film. It hides behind the mask of women who "make a big city in the city," but the only way women can make it big is by using their sexuality, not their intelligence or skills. These women are no more whores. Are fewer attractive girls allowed to be successful? This is not the only right-wing message of the film, there are hundreds of US Flag Shots and huge amounts of money. A good example is that the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and anything that has a spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even featured in this film. Money is presented as the only important thing for young people. The cafeteria manager says he does not allow drug users at his bar, and then goes to poor liters of hard drinks. own neck, and then the necks of its staff and customers. Anyone who knows anything about narcotics means that liquor can be as dangerous as heroin and dangerous than most illegal drugs. And finally, why are the scenes in which the main character is a sexual character interest in the audience (when she's pulling off with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We watch her hang out while the camera practically fits her legs while she is a phone for her father. She 'sells' her father like her boyfriend's 'auction'. I think this is the strangest thing. In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascist, degrading women and sincere, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
