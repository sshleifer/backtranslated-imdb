This movie is not very good. It's boring, and not much blood for a horror movie. The action is only spreading and there is not much happening. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had many opportunities to kill the vampire hunters because she shows she has reflexes like a reflex. But whenever there is one of them, she only takes her time and something always happens where she does not bite them. No wonder that this went straight to cable. FINAL VERDICT: It's not nearly as good as the first movie about vampires. You're SUCKER if you're wasting time on this.
