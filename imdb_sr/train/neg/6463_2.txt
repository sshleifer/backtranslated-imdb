Last night I watched Free Monei and it was the longest 90+ minutes of my life. With such an intriguing acting, I really thought I was delighted - especially since I'm a fan of Brando. VRONG! What a loss of talent. It's almost embarrassing to watch from time to time (like cattle scene), and there were so many missed opportunities for funny settings (why did not they show Charlie Sheen's character who's coming back to pull Brand's truck?) Trying to be a slapstick comedy, but I just did not buy. Skip this. Only for the hard Brands lovers. I give him 2 out of 10 because I still think the worst movie ever made was Skidoo.
