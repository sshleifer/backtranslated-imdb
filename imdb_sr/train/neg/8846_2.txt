In the installation of a mini-series in the Tower of Babel, the narrator describes the builders of the tower as "the descendants of Moses." Or that the light bulb was invented before the coral. Or that a rocket of ankle-and-lightning is guided. Should I say more? The writers of the greatest heroes of the Bible should at least pay more attention to the chronologies of Bible people and events.
