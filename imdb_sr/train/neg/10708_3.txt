This film had the potential to be really good, given that some of the elements of the action were borrowed from the sci-fi shareholder THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always gives some Syrian appeal to his roles. But someone really put the ball on this one. Dolph plays a monk that hits a ass (!) who travels to New York to find a key that unlocks the door beneath his monastery that closed the antichrist. for 2000 years. He has to struggle with a favorite, a ghost that jumps from body to body, much as they are hidden, and Jason goes to hell. Minion, of course, wants a key so he can throw out an antihrist. Along the ride is a boring female archaeologist, and together she and Dolph have been persecuted by the possession bodies. If this sound is fun, forget it. Pacing is a very inconvenient and slow, acting sub-player at best, and scenes of combat are poorly derived. Dolph goes through his role and fires some of the worst dialogues in his career. The cheese factor is really picking up in the end when a militant fights with an army of machine guns that holds the monks in the monastery, but the rest of this film is a snoozefest. Too bad, I really wanted to like this.
