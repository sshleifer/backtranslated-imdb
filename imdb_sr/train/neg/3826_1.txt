Damn, I thought I saw some bad western ones. Although she can not go upstairs. Hell, I think I'd rather open my eyes to the Trinity Triple Feature for loud. I do not think I will be able to watch Ben Hur again without laughing. Just really bad. But hey, if you love stupid westerns with the famous stars in things, he looks into Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but much more fun. 1/10
