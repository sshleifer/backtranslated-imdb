I borrowed this film because not only because of its gay theme, but also because of the thought of playing a role. I was pleasantly surprised that it was filmed in San Francisco since I live near SF. And of course, it was nice to see the Castro County recordings (although castrated men really attracted more gay men than women). But in addition, I can not recommend this film. The characters were not really developed for me and when they finally started to get to the "role playing", I was already bored. And the scene scenes I saw were a bit uncomfortable to watch. The act leaves something that is wanted. Needless to say I did not finish the movie. I would have skipped this.
