I was almost always against the inclusion of songs in the movie. I believe that the quality of the film will improve automatically if only those extremely boring songs are exhibited. However, things quickly changed after watching this terrible Black (without the songs) and this movie, (plenty of songs). While Black was weak to the extreme, he brought an exciting story with some powerful acting and good direction. The songs were almost random and blended almost without problem with the film. There certainly were no women who were scattered with water without apparent reason from the mysterious water sources while wildly walking around the streets at night. . There was no glossing over anything and almost every scene is completely convincing. The first is because English subtitling was below the vault and contained many mistakes that, at times, completely changed the meaning of the actual statement. This is because you will certainly appreciate the accuracy of the display after you have lived it yourself. I would definitely denote it as a work worthy of international recognition. Talks with the drivers who were searching were a nice touch and served at the same time as a source of sincere humor, as well as another perspective on the whole mess. The film, however, is not in several places, where characters sometimes say the most unreasonable things that diminish the overall direction of the film. I also thought that a few saddening scenes were not very good. It was fun to watch, not to awaken feelings of sorrow, and the whole scene seemed a little stupid. However, these are less important things, because the movie as a whole is a really rare treat for watching. Actors, not 'heroes' - this is the key. An opportunity to see persuasive human beings in an unusual environment - everyday life. A look behind the scene looks at the degree of distortion and the rare air of hope for Indian cinema. 8/10.
