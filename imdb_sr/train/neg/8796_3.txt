Average viewers looking for some sense of inner coherence in a movie should give a pass to this case. He creates the same feeling as if he looks at an unusual series of individual images that seem to have some connection with each other, but they never merge as a whole. While this isolative approach to the creation of a kind of cinematographic editing may be appealing to a few students or critics in the inner language of contemporary film creativity, it is quite irritating and plague for us ordinary people who just fell off the saddle. Clearly avoiding accessibility can be an intentional feature of authors such as Kar-Vai Vong and Tarantino, but for me it happens when Andi Varhol warm up. The only redeemable feature I find is in production values, and they simply will not be able to cut everything there. It is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and you are waiting for anxious and futile for some smart development of ideas or thoughts to maintain all the extraordinary and wonderful individual scenes. Sorry. Calligraphic loans unexpectedly start to roll just as your interest begins to excite. I get the same big yawning and giving up reading of what I think are highly educated and thorough comments about this movie that never leads to something truly understandable. Ideas and images without any external context are not my idea of ​​fun. Call me philistines who roam the streets of Hong Kong looking for a salad bowl. <br /> <br />
