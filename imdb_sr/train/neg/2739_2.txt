I have no idea what the shot was, but you can definitely say that they did not have a budget. Bad acting, horrible cinema, and a lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie. The VVF-style cinema will make you cry ... where is the tripod ?! They shot high-quality movies, but missed them.
