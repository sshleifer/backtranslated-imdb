About Baby: Why did not Big Brother suppose he would be hungry for a bottle or food or changing diapers? He had to scream continuously after many hours without worry. Definitely stupid to take a baby from a safe place when he did not have to. And why is the journey wonderfully clear whenever someone wanted to drive somewhere? Were there no trees that were thrown out of the road and can not block them? It's dangerous to go there. When it says, it was nice to have kids who could safely watch for a change.
