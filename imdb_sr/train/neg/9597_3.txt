As much as I love Japanese films, this one has not only cut off ... A film that should be about rebels and the survival of the royal bloodline has proven to be a very slow film with a dubious complication. The photo is fine, although in other Japanese films I saw much better scenes of sword fighting, quick cameras and the way they followed the characters did not even convince me. Soundtrack is so weak that you do not even notice his presence at all. But the worst of all was the way the plot evolved. I have to admit that, sometimes, I have difficulty understanding who is and what is happening. In any case, the platonic love between the protagonist and the other person was completely unnecessary and seemed to emanate from Hollywood influences. All in all, if you are looking for a Japanese film action this is not. It's very slow, with very few fighting scenes with a sword and very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
