There seems to be a little damnation when it comes to gay cinema. Namely, happy endings are not frequent. A nice thing off, gay movies usually end up in broken relationships or in premature death. And some, like Come Undone, just the end ... period. The creators of this horrible stupidity have something or a few things to learn about the plot, direction, and timing. In the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself somewhat confused, and even more after the first insight into the character Jeremie Elkaim who had a small psychic session. It seems that this film is accidentally made without any attempt at continuity or consistency. There is no right way to say when you are looking at the present or some kind of ethereal flashback. I could have taken that much before it became really unattractive. Steven Holden from the New York Times called this film "... blindingly beautiful and extremely real". Well, Stephen seems to have invested in beer glasses before watching, because it's really far from beauty. Because of all the praise this film received, I expected something worth watching. Unfortunately, the film was reduced to the title. Until the end of the film (which did not give any resolution, I would add) it is clear that the writers, the director and the film have all been canceled.
