Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante at Broadway have been running for years, but evidence of his power and charisma have been lost in this film adaptation, which probably stems from the choice of director (Richard Attenborough, which is far from B-vaia as you could get) and the main actor (Michael Douglas, starring director-choreographer as a slim corporate lawyer). A slim tale of hard audition for the Broadway play that turns into a therapeutic session for actors-dancers-singers, is pushed to us, with loud, brilliant talents playing on the beams. Nothing is a modulated or subtle, especially funny background about a former dancer returning to the theater and head with an old flame Douglas. Excessive hopes are filled with promise and hurt, but their personal stories of grief are somewhat unpleasant; This, in combination with Attenborough's slow rhythm, provokes a disaster, and even now famous songs fail to break through the artificial wrap. * 1/2 of ****
