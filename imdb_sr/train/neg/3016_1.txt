I am, like many others, admirer of Tony Scott films. When this film came out, I had the big hope that it would be like 'Man on Fire'. Let's find out that the movie is the longest of it! The story went from the water, and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such a good idea. And the whole 'hand' was superfluous! The film is focused on Kiera Kinghtly, and this film reveals that it will never become a movie star! The film brought some of the worst of the actors ever. All I like in the direction of Tony Scott, but this takes the whole cake! I'm sorry Ton, 1 out of 10!
