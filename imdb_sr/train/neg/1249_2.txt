What a disappointment, especially with regard to the secured budget, the available technical resources and the collected talent. Is not it the basic rule for science fiction / drama to create a ready suspicion of disbelief in the audience? The POA 2001 creates a convincing beginning that pulls us, but later Mr. Burton forgets that his viewers have a brain. Helena Bonham Carter, the supreme libertarian of the chimpanzee, the worthlessness of the human blockade, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary horse-breeding skills (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives who are suddenly riding a full slope), massive and direct human rebellion is too incredible. Mark Wahlberg has never projected any sense of real fear, danger or turmoil in this world. Compare it with the original, in which the naked Chuck Heston metaphorically captured his complete helplessness and astonishment at his event. Uniformed Vahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently awkward situation, and we never ask ourselves about his well-being. Unlike Heston, he seems to have never been in danger. Tim Burton should have used one of the f / k budget for competent script writing. In fact, after this bad fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood producers have ever tried to get rid of scenarios and directors of attacking threats. Let them walk. Trained monkeys could do as well as in Planet of the Apes in 2001. I bet that a review of this effort will not be repeated. It could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for imagination. Another lost opportunity.
