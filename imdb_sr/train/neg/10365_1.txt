Terrible. This thriller was supposed to be buried. What a shit. Horrible writing, characters are less than convincing. Horrible Schlock !! Put some B-stars in terribly written POS to try to give you some credit, but it fails. If I had not had to write ten lines about this movie, I would give her a review of the word, start with 'sh' and end with 'it'. Terrible end, retarded. Who's writing this shit. The ending of this film is so fictitious, weak, as if they have no idea what to do with this story, or their money was running out. Most likely because of the number of cameos in this movie. It's good that these actors are on the road, because it would be a killer in a career. The good thing for them is that it's hard for anyone to see it. At least nobody is important, as future investors. It could end up in thousands of different ways, but like that, I feel cheated out of my precious time. back.
