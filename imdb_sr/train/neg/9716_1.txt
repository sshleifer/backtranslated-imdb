This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... The action is so full of holes, the story is like a bad remake of the film about uncertainty and the actors sound like they were first read directly from manuscripts. Worst of all is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character as he was in the Police Academy - the same crazy feminist - and it's not suitable for the leading man in what was supposed to be a thriller. make "LA Confidential" ten years later ... Avoid this as a plague ...
