I thought that was interesting, and maybe it was an interesting story, except that it was said in such an uninteresting way. It's hard to follow, strange editing, separating the story, the characters mumbling, all in all, a terribly bored waste of time. I just could not get into that, and I did not care what happened to the characters - even Ian Holm could not save this film. Unless you need a cure for insomnia, I would skip it. 3/10, and this is generous.
