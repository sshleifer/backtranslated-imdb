I do not know who to blame, scared writers or untrained director. It seemed to be one of those films in which so much money was paid to the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that there was not enough to really make a movie. It could have been a lot of fun, but it was a veil of scandal, even cowardice, which hung over every scene. Having received a R rating, why is the ubiquitous scene of a balloon shot with a 70-year-old woman, not Angie Harmon? Why Sheen Sleepwalk Through Potentially Hot Relationships With TWO BEST AND SEX ACTRESSES IN THE WORLD? If they were just looking for a laugh, why would not they throw Vhoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenut instead? It was so predictable that I was surprised when I discovered that the director was not five years old. What a loss, not only for spectators, but also for actors.
