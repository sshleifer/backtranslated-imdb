and rent a good horror movie. It's as if the writer never saw a horror movie before and did not realize that everything he wrote was cliché and hacked, was parodied to perfection in movies like "Scream" and "Scari Movie". Among the scary bits there is the most interesting dialogue that has ever been written. Stupid "we go to graduation". I wanted to turn off my ears. Frankly, "The Hills" has a better dialogue. There was really no need to shoot this movie. The lead lady was uninteresting and I was constantly thinking "Her?" Really? Gui is obsessed with her? Really? " All the characters play stupid, including the police. (Cover the place in the teams of 2! Front and rear! No dumb policeman is sitting in his car with windows that are lowered just waiting for his throat slit.) The serial killer is just a swan killer anyone who wants without problems. There is no resistance of victims (or gates). No one has any protection or the least idea of ​​opposing (or turning a security lock on the door of the hotel room). People are like mentally handicapped sheep. In addition, if you are a fan of blood, and you will be disappointed. All murders are kept out of the screen and - ahem - tastefully. (Boo hoo for you!) No killing is not at all interesting. Most of the time has already happened when we found out. The only missing cliche is the cat that always appears in such films. "Oh, kitty! You scared me! I thought you were a killer - AEEEEE!" And then at the end when it's time for the killer to die - well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore. The crowd screamed and spoke on the screen. It was too stupid to be believed and not scary enough. Do not encourage this kind of lazy filmmaking. So, save money and rent "Carrie" or "Fridai" or "Fridai" or "Fridai" or "Fridai" the 13th "or" Halloveen "or" Scream "or" Scari Movie "(any of them) to scare you out of some original plants.
