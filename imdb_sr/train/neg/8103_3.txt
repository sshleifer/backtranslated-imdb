This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not care what critics say, that's bad. I think it's a problem with Kunder's novel. Not that it's unfiltered; It's only 99% of his work, it's pretentious and exaggerated. He seems to be in love with himself, his characters appear as a navel, and his novels are in general a misogyny. I read many of his works (even his socialist poetry, which was really terrible) - I simply do not understand what this is about. Characteristics (such as self-absorption) in his novels make reading awake. In the film, all things I do not like Kundera were enlarged. Maybe I missed something, but I do not think so. On the note page, I can not believe this is a DVD with a Criterion. There is no way that this movie is important.
