Many people see it as a classic, but obviously I missed something. Life in Anarnas in Texas in the early 1950s is pretty boring - which means that the film about life in Anarena, Texas in the early 50's, will be pretty boring! What are so many people seeing in this? When the last series in Anarena ends, there will be nothing in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that spot at the end of the film. But even before it is shut down, there is not much work to do, so basically everything is about sex. High school students are planning to lose innocence - sometimes with each other, and sometimes with some equally adult people in the city. You see, there is not much for them - apart from having sex (sometimes with each other, and sometimes with teenagers who are bored) or to blush about a local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought would add a movie drama. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing happens because of this, Sonni (Timothi Bottoms) and Jaci (Cibill Shepherd) escapes, but nothing happens because Joe Bob (Barc Doile) takes away a little girl, but nothing really It happens because of that. The only thing that added some dramatic value to the film came to the end of the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms), which really points to the emptiness of life in this poor little town, while men stand and look at the body that discusses where Peter Bogdanovic shot this photo in black It's colorful, which should indicate how much this city is gray, but the only thing that was interesting to me was an early look at actors like Donja, Shepherd, Bridges and Randi Kuaid. (As a side, it was frightening to see how Kuaid - 1971 - actually looks like his cousin Eddie in the movie National Lampoon Vacation.) Classic? I do not think like that! 3/10
