In my opinion, the title of the movie should change from "Just Brave" to "Everything About Lane". I went to the screening of this film a few months ago and I was pretty disappointed with the result. Although, I appreciate that the director made a film about men in 442 - a theme that has long deserved to be addressed in the film industry - the acting in some parts of the film was quite stagnant. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlin Tomitas and Jason Scott Lee were great. However, the director should NEVER position himself as the main character in the film. Sorry, Lane, you're just not a movie actor. Stick to what you're good at - theater acting. The appearance of Gina Hiraizumi in this film was also terrible. She never had to give the role of speech and her appearance was not able to play the role of Queen Miss Nisei. There were other young actors in the movie that were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why are not they thrown out for that role? Another big problem with this movie is its action sequences. Japanese-American soldiers do not look like they were fighting against German soldiers ... let alone anybody. Given that this was a low budget feature, but since this was a war movie, is it not important to show some actually fighting? This movie was a worthwhile attempt, but definitely not worth the big distribution.
