After the first 25 minutes that promise to feel warm inside, you are quite convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy. Then the film turns up. A warm feeling can still be there, but as others have said: The action becomes so incredible and artificial that it is almost unbearable to watch. The film is accelerating, and the impression is that either you quickly pass through it, or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut many scenes. Realism is not an end in itself, but as a spectator, I'm pretty sure that this comedy is not deliberately unrealistic, but it is by chance. On the plus side, this movie has a couple of nice interiors, and despite the bad scenario, I think the appearances of actors are mostly good. If I could only estimate the first 25 minutes, I would probably give eight. As it is now, it gets four. ... and that's nice! If you are a pendant for romantic comedy, you will probably have a good time to have fun. If not, I would recommend that you look at something else.
