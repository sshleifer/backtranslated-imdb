I have to say that this film is Mork and that Mindi knocks out, when I watch it, I have a winter, I even have a little soaked. When this Korean guy with spiders in his neck began to kick people, I am like my master of Asia, I smell and suck, because they are constantly eating dogs. Any way back, Chuck had some terrible performance and did not have the intelligence of a regular human being. Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and he believed in the holy spirit and the spirit of the Christmas past. This film is so bad that I put the newborn in a box and left it in the mailbox of Mr. Norris. He can raise my child. I will not let him into the world where he thinks Chuck Norris is a karate expert. He is sick to see how this hack is in real life for the rest of his life.
