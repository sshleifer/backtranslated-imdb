Trying to cross to like those who do not appreciate the opera, exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, it's going badly.

The action revolves around romance with a doctor who treats his throat that suddenly became problematic. Just because it came out so long ago, it's mostly forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has a theater presence next to his singing talent, and nothing that works in this movie does not deny that opinion. His guilt lies in not rejecting a terrible script. Maybe because big operas can have silly stories that he tolerated. Who knows, except those who are involved? Do we have to know? The action is poor and banal. This film is like passing through the cold mud to pick up some juicy sweets (opera music) that hangs above the mud.

Just take one of his great opera or vocal concert shots and recognize the master tenor where he is most appropriate. votes; would fit in a list that includes several efforts by singers, actors, models and athletes to take advantage of their popularity through the film.

As much as he is effective as an actor (the opera demands it), even Jimmy Stevart could not save this scenario. Pavarotti's singing and opera for this film.
