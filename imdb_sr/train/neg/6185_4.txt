My first preview of 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: Reef". The story is about two divers playing Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who like to explore hidden treasures at the bottom of the local ridge. One day after the day of the research, they are approached by a couple who play David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell young divers that they want to hire them to explore the ridge and find a rare artifact about the hidden Columbian goods reported at the bottom of the ridge. The next day, the four will dive to the bottom of the ridge and roughly after the whole day dive will find nothing. A few more days passed, and two hired divers discovered that they are part of a large deadly plot where they can not escape, otherwise they will be killed. They hired them to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other a nucleus. The film also has a story about another person (the main character's brother) trying to patch things up with his girlfriend. The story was a waste of time, this also involves a very sparse sex scene between the pair that is complete waste for me and it was not needed to be shown. However, in addition, the film has some good underwater photography, and the colors fit well and because of that it receives 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel only by name. None of the original actors or characters returns, has a stupid story, stupid characters and boring climax.
