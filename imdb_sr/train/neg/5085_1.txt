this movie starts with a common funeral ... and insists so much at this ordinary funeral that I lost interest in 5 minutes of watching, and I started to skip the scene. It seems to me that the one who made this film is shot to the extent that he is trapped in a permanent morbid trance, incapable of thinking about anything other than death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark kids from Southpark, I want a movie that will receive me well in an interesting story in 10 minutes, I will not sit down and watch 10 minutes nothing but preparation for a funeral .. my grandmother in her last year was fascinated by the funeral , maybe she enjoyed this "movie."
