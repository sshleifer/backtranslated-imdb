Blair Vitch-Var movie that is so disappointed as Bvitch! The title says everything, save money and your time and spend it on a good movie, such as "Once Upon a Time in America", "Shavshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Door" (if you want to watch a big "war" movie), etc. . This film, if it was the baseball team and the main leagues, was the highlight and single A was a novice, then this film was a high school ball. It was shot as if it was a high school drama club that records with its dad's old camera. Of course they went to the enemy space (to make a movie), but I do not call that brave, here we call it simply stupid! This is the way to the end! Now look and then tell me what you think.
