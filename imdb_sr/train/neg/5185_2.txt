The complete loss of Hall Hall's time is a complete waste of time. Scenarios and dialogues are poorly written, the direction is vague and acting boundaries on Hammi. This film was obviously focused on Rang De Basanti, but it's far from marking because there's not one of the elements that made RDB connect with its audience, great acting, good direction and a strong social message that has never been preached but displayed. as a hero who leaked into the Persian carpet, and the hero's mentor watched the lower bullets in the truck! All this could have been acceptable in the 1980s when the quality of the film fell, and bad films like Divia Shakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hits, but film making has become more subtle and imaginative lately. Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every film he makes, but maybe he just does not know how to do it! He uses preaching without worrying about the intelligence of the audience in understanding what he is trying to say. Maybe you just have to concentrate on the party and leave social messages to Rakeish Mehras and Aamir Khans. Even if you disagree with everything I say to you, you agree that during the entire review you will think that the Rang De Basanti was much better and that Mr. Santoshi should have left the industry - hitting Om Shanti Om. Industry-bashing? Santoshi described the industry as a place of biting, hacking, and castration couch, which the hero is willing to leave with a starlet that is strangely called Sania. There are some people who will think that these parts show the true face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! All in all, raise your voice against movies like this and do not spend your hard-earned money on this bomb. * From ****.
