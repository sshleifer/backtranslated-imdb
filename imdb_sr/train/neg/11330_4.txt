"Giant" is one of the most lonely, overly long Hollywood recordings ever. Many scenes look completely fake and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Tailor and James Dean are spent in this great Hollywood production. The central notion of this film, that the rancher ever resisted the drilling of oil on his land, is absurd, and I know it because I'm from Houston. A few scenes, especially Dean who serves Tailor's Coffee, are buying this otherwise boring film. For a much more accurate and more interesting account of how modernism changed the ranch in Texas, see "Hood" (one of the great performances of Paul Nevman) or "Last Imagery".
