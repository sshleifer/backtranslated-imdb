The movie refers to a young man, Michael, who cares about the elderly. Someday he decides to kill some of his cousins' relatives. Approximately at the same time he decides to model his murder after the Zodiac Killer of the 60's. He contacts the author of the book about the Zodiac killer and they create friendship. Michael has a pistol (obviously the only gun, as it seems to be in the hands of some other actors, but not shown as the same pistol.) And he goes out. Original. This is a great movie if you love B movies. I thought that the idea of ​​the movie was good, but the editing and acting really drowned the plot. I thought that 'blood' was too fake, that the lighting in some places was terrible, and the dialogue was too standard. The movie was filmed on the video, which is fine, but editing the movie just made some strange scenes of 'Plan 9'. It's not a bad movie for fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something with a little more polish, go to something else.
