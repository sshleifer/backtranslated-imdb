Vov, I can not believe that people consider this to be a "good" movie. Now I've seen much worse, but there are many romantic / entertaining comedies with John Kusak. This is at best the central film. Although the acting was not terrible, but not great for romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were many free areas that did not appear or were not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters are released as complete cowards. They do not know well enough to understand that they do not like the people they are engaged in. How do we know they are not in love? Because of the extreme lack of remorse, both characters have to leave their finances. I can imagine a few things that are more romantic than a continuous escape from the commitment of these two teams. another like hot potatoes when the commitment approaches. This film is actually two people who can not devote themselves to anything, unlike previous Cusack characters, who were more than willing to dedicate deeply (Loid to Sai Anithing, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.). The biggest failure of this film was the complete lack of any turning circles, or anything interesting. When the film was over, I felt like they were not able to include the climax in the story, which essentially corresponds to the whole film: boring. There is no tension over whether the two will end up together, there is no joy when they do so, there is no consequence for their actions. Any criticism with 'Everyone is too cynical!'. The criticism of this film is not cynicism, simply impartial examination. There are also many other romantic comedies, even those with Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint. If you think this movie is excellent, try these movies, your heart will explode: The Princess Bride, Say Anithing, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping Faith, Charade, Rear Window, North by Northwest , or There Something About Mari (which is a good examination of the ideal romance in relation to today's society).
