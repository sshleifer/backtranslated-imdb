I consider this film one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I could not remember even 20 minutes after the film was over, it even bothered me to write a review. Okay, the fourth was a joke and Freddy was a joker. # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. He was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is essentially a good thing. They tried to make a horror movie instead of comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add uncertainty and fear. That's why Nightmare 5: A child of dreams is neither funny nor scary. What we actually get is a boring movie with the usual bad actors (perhaps with the exception of Lisa Vilcock). The plot (Freddy kills Lisa's friends using dreams about Lisin's unborn child) has a good base, but that's not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story gets very confusing (maybe because it's gone) and you can not stop wondering what the filmmakers want. The scenario had to have more holes than Swiss cheese, so the film itself was very syrusing (let me say that I still do not like cheese, even if I am from Switzerland). No special effects were as good as for example in part 4. Do not try to rent / buy this movie, if not for completeness, it's pretty messy. My Rating: 4/10 (habit, # 6 is also messy ...)
