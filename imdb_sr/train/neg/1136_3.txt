Every film from the 1930s is dated, but if you were only looking at John Ford's films, it would appear to be more dated than watching other people. ie. The Grand Hotel is a relatively modern melodrama. With Ford, it's always hard to sell someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). There is always too much emphasis on some serious badness. Always badly made, inconvenient and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It's just a pretty good delivery device. And the feeling is all about it. What Ford here does not seem to appreciate Lincoln, just asks me how the countries have ever been placed in the population of complete morons shown here. Ford continued to make decent films. This is too long to do anything else but bad. It looks completely wrong. Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre. And nobody from Illinois would say "Follow me" or say "Shonuff!"
