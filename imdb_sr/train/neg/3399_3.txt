A girl does not know what she wants - is it a comedy, is it a drama ... she simply does not know. What could have been a very funny or touching movie ending up in no one's country. The assumption is genuine enough to guarantee a script full of interesting scenarios, but hardly it delivers and ends in the end. This is a real shame if you look at the actors - it's very tight to the end, but they do not get the chance to shine. Frustrating.
