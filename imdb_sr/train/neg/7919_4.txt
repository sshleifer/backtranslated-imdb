I found myself very preoccupied with this film, at least initially, and any credit I gave to this movie was Lacey Chabert, it was fantastic !! But that's the end. It looks like I'm very good at discovering who the killer is, and I like it when the movie can completely confuse me, but I felt outside and lied, they took you all the time in one direction and then suddenly I decided to go to quite another direction in the end, they did not give a shot at all, it's not a scam that very bad writing and planning, someone did not think at all! Feeling a movie would be much better if they kept up on the plot you were guided, but they did not say anything, why did Jane burn the professor's house. Great Damage. as I felt it started as a relatively good movie.
