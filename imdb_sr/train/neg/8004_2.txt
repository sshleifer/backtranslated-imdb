First, to say that the first 20 minutes is great, the monster looks great and CGI is reasonably made. It is a pity that the rest of the film is so disappointing, <br /> ******** Spoilers under ******** <br /> <b> From the starting scene we can see is That this film is anti-American, usually this kind of stereotype would not disturb me (we have gotten enough of the Hollivood from the British), but it's not subtle here to turn Americans into the brains of the dead. The end of realism and your left is going through wondering if Iank raped the mother of the director. The sad scene was very bad and part of the movie where it starts to go downhill. Here we are introduced to the Olympic medal of aunt and drunken uncle who enter the monument and begin to blame their father for the death of their daughters, and then hit him before everyone starts rolling on the floor crying. Difficult realistic bonding in times of crisis! The whole viral side line is ridiculous. If the Americans know that there is no virus, why spend time, money and resources? The US government agent orders that the brain bugs an innocent Korean for nothing, making Americans look evil (or stupid), not helped by the fact that this guy was bumped by a comedy effect. The film is about hunting the monster. American and Korean special forces are in charge of finding the creatures although they are invisible through the film. The only people hunting for a monster, all over Korea, is the main family and some casual rogue who appears in the end to save the day! Of course, several US / Korean agents are trying to stop them by the way. The nurse was involved only in the film to eventually make a vital video. It was clich√©, you knew it would happen, but it was worse, it all bothered! And my last anger, how the hell did that kid survive in the end? The monster swam with his head under water for about 5 minutes! why did the monster ate no children at all?
