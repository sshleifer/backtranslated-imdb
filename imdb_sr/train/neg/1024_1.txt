I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival with pretty firm expectations. the film has a great role and it closes at the festival so it must be fine, right? how I made a mistake. I knew that we were in trouble when the director pre-movie talked about how, when he directed the episode of the sage, he met an unknown actor named Kevin Spacei (director / writer Visegi who made his film debit = blah) ... Edison's director / writer must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spaces that kill the homeless, because I can not see how he (along with other actors in the film) ever agrees to that disaster. This film is absolutely horrible! It's a mixture of every policeman who picks up. with Edison there is nothing new. The acting was bad and the direction was even worse. It seemed like the aforementioned episode of the wise. This was the best movie I ever saw. Several examples of bad stupid moments in Edison ... Morgan Freeman dances around his apartment without any reason for rock and roll music ... Justin Timberlake gets a creative critique from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles .. . llcoolj driving an old fire bird ... 3 guys are shot in the head ... This movie is the opposite of good. Stay away EDISON!
