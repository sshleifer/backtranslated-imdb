... I read about this movie well on the Internet, and many have criticized how this film was bad. And I could not agree more on that. After that, I saw this movie on DVD, I thought twice about it and then I came to the TV commercial on this TV. Fortunately, I saved money for this shit. I sacrificed myself for this film and soon it turned out that this movie can not satisfy me. So I can not judge how the movie was made, but nevertheless ... it's still shit. As for those who loved this film, I apologize for burning this movie and telling me how shit this movie is. I do not know what you think of this movie?
