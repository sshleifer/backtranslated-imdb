This must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember seeing him many years ago when she first appeared on the video and for some strange reason I thought I was enjoying it. So, as an idiot, I ran out to buy a DVD when it was released ... what a tragic error! I will not even try to get into the plot because it's so transparent that you can still see it. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Levis, so I'm getting used to the raw effects of the upstairs and bad acting, but these people are at a completely different level. Almost as if deliberately trying to make the worst movie possible for human beings ... if it was their goal, they succeeded. If they intended to make a movie that should scare you or tell you to believe in any way, in the form or form that it is real, then they have failed ... MISERAL! Avoid this movie ... read the synopsis of the plot and you saw it!
