The "American Nightmare" is officially linked, in my opinion, with "It's Pat!" FOR THE LARGEST FILM OF ALL TIME. Seven friends (unusually similar to the K-Mart version of the "Friends" actors) gather in a cafe to listen to the American nightmare, a pirated radio show. The host is his chick guy. This is the most exciting aspect of his performance. Chandler, Monica, Joei, and ... Oh, wait, I mean, Vaine, Jessie, and the rest of the bad gang dealing with one line takes everything. turning around revealing his biggest fears to beard DJ. Not knowing about them, the crazy sister / serial killer listens ... Crazy sister then continues to trouble Ross and Rachel and ... wait, I apologize again ... by bringing their fears to life. These fears also include those tweaks such as "voodoo" and the departure of old women with prostheses. No. Really. This film, for example, was corrupt. The murder in the crazy sister lacks motivation, there is nothing that would make the viewer "jump", final blows, and - again - voodoo? If you do not have absolutely no relationship to your loved ones, rent "American Nightmare" with them. If you care about your loved ones - even a little - go to your local Blockbusters, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in your freezer.
