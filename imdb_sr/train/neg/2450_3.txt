I watched Peter Jackson's version of Lord of the Rings when I was halfway through the reading of the Two Towers and I thought it was absolutely brilliant. on DVD, but I told myself that I will finish reading the Two Towers and returning the kings before I watch it (as I thought it showed the whole trilogy). So when I finished the trilogy I came and brought the DVD, which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely stupid. I was acting annoying 20 minutes to her, which was really weird, because I love the book and I am shaken that the creator of this movie could even think of being included at least 1 and a half books in the movie of 2 hours and 8 minutes. None of the characters had any emotions when they talked and seemed to be reading the pages, even my favorite character that Gandalf did not even look interesting at all. The animation was the only fine in parts of the film except for the orcs (they looked terrible) and Aragorn and Sam's face. I do not know how this movie was released because there was not even the right end, but it may have been good for the producer to run out of money because the movie could not have been better. I just hope that no one will judge the books on this film. 3/10
