You do not see this movie. Bad acting and stupid effects. Totally wasting time. I was hoping to see many cool killings and hot chickens, instead, the director depended on videos of slaughtering animals to shock you, the observer. Odd. The murders are pretty poor, basically slipping. One woman puts worms in her mouth, he puts her raw hamburgers on her face and sucks her. BTK = BTK broiler, the new "sandwich" burger king ... ha ha. I think that this film did not rely too heavily on real facts. I mean, the real BTK killer did not carry a bunch of rodents, scorpions, and worms ... and oh yes ... and slaughtered the head of the cow. Imagine.
