I did not enjoy the movie, Joshua, in general. Perhaps because I saw another, much better movie called Orphan 2 days earlier, but maybe it's just because this movie was not very good. I'm going with the ladders. Of course, the plot of a child's evil is not very genuine, but that does not mean that the movie can not succeed. It could have been uncertain and fun and cool, but instead it was a slow construction, boring, insignificant, and really did not leave me thinking of anything more than 'it was not good' when it was all over. In the end, Joshua's motivation is revealed. I will not give it away, but the reality is that he has not achieved his goals because Vera Farmiga, as his mother, Abby, disappeared around 3/4 through the film, all the arrows indicate that he will soon return home. She was devoted to the mental institution because she was losing her mind, but then Joshu's father / husband was accused of manipulating her medication that tells the audience that the institution realized that she was not really mentally ill, but to get medical medication. So .. should not he be coming home soon? Will Joshua fail? Will not his mother soon live with him and his sister, and perhaps with his father? I ask the Father because his future has remained open. At the end of the day, I did not care about the characters. The evil demonic child of Joshua was not terrible. The story moved slowly and when it picked up, it was still boring. Silence fell every moment. When it's over, I could not believe I sat down on the whole thing. 4/10 just because the acting was good than the parents, especially Vera Farmiga as Mother, but if you want to watch a movie about the evil "child", go see it orphaned. It is a film that took the non-original concept and created a brilliant film.
