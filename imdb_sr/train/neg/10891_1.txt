I saw a trailer for this movie and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, acting is ruins, special effects (if you can call them that way), they look like something that would not be in place in a school play. Some of the characters are so stupid in this movie that you'll get stuck when they're on the screen, which is unfortunately more and more often. As for the story, forget it. This is a warning, do not even spend money on this movie, which must be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If, for some reason, you love this movie, watch Troll 2, you will probably enjoy it too.
