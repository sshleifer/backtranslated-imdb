I entered the film with expectations, from the hypo, that it would be insightful and uplifting. Certainly more than the cheap promotional for the band "Vilco". Instead, we get a lot of mumbling and whining about the "process," a dull and undoubtedly one-sided display of one member of the band. who was cast out by a leading singer / singer, a sincere acknowledgment of a dead member's friend - for about 18 years - saying that "friendship has gone its way", and this humorous, unconvincing story about how the publishing house "hurt its feelings" but only the band could get 50 offers from other labels (oh, the tension ... no!) They tried to make it look like effort, but I guess all the smoke and mirrors generated a tragedy that did not exist. This does not take into account even the long stocks that fill many of their latest songs with no stories, insights or even decent work in cinema. Neglected attempts at emotional sincerity or a reasonable perspective of life made me sick to watch. From the film, this band sounds like a bunch of wicked little babies pushing to find a voice they do not have and think they are some kind of guards for musical art, which they definitely are not. I thought the music was exhausted, and I could not even understand the verses about the mummified style of the singer. I give it 2/10.
