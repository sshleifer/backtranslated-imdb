I had great hopes for Troy and I'm so disappointed. The film was so sharp that it was pain in the abdomen. The walk was so slow, the dialogue was funny and the film - except for the beautiful battle scene between Achilles (Pita) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow. And why, oh why Hollywood always insists on rewriting the story to fit 'consumer approval'. Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle! It irritates me that such a classical story, such as this, has been turned into soap. And do not even begin to "miss" chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman in which the war was taking place and it did not seem that the two of them were worried about the other. No sparkle, no emotions, no hope. I must say that in the movies defense Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole acted very well with a bad scenario, but this is not enough to save this horrible movie. Can anyone tell me where the Â£ 200 million budget went? Perhaps in all the trees they used for funerals - where did they get all these trees? I am so disappointed that it hurts.
