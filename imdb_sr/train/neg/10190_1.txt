After watching the MST3K episode, I have to ask myself what movies this movie lends to. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point, I really expected Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROVSDOVER. I wonder if the director has any idea how many holes there are in the plot. as well as the fact that, although gas is unavailable, there are plenty of it in abandoned petrol stations, and the stations are close enough for the F1 car to go all over the country.
