From time to time in the Indian cinema comes a movie like Sholaia that changes the way the audience experiences a good movie. And only once (hopefully) we have RGV which Aag violates all standards and creates its own. The standard is so low that it can never be broken. Ram Gopal varma manages to take a talent talent and create a dish so as to breathe it from afar. Take a classic like Sholai and kill him completely unforgivable and I can not believe that he almost called the RGV film Sholai. Although Å olaj had many folklore elements in the film, the film managed to build its plot by making it so clearly defined characters to live forever. What Aag does is to take these characters and screw them up so you'll need a competition to choose the worst. The element of realism is completely lacking and what the film ends with the provision of a bunch of "actors" walking in the complication of a smaller and seemingly unrelated set of events. One star for this movie is a funny loss of voice. it is high time that RGV wakes up in the reality of its failure and demonstrates another "different" plot that can be put into the cinema.
