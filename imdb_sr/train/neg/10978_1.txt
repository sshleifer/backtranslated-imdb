Usually when a movie receives a voice from one, it's because someone just does not like and angry that it does not have a lower rating, and so decides to withdraw it as much as it can, instead of just giving it a low score. This is not the case here. Bonesetter is the perfect example of a movie of 0/10. She does nothing good and has no chance because she does not try to do anything. There are traces of a bad D & D novel that are not held together and a complete lack of any acting performance. It is clear that no one involved in this project made any serious effort, because even the hard work of quite obviously non-aligned persons would be greater. A really horrible movie.
