Where is it written that the sequences have to suck? Scream 2 is not! Others are not! But this is for sure ... the problems include horrific actors (Christopher Valken can only play in the whole movie), bad writing (you will never understand what is happening and have even explored the idea of ​​Nephilim before) a terrible casting contest. Eric Roberts is the dumbest Archangel Michael who I've ever seen in my life! Avoid it as a plague, unless desperately want to see Christopher Valken. In that case, just move quickly to the parts where he is in the movie and avoid the others. Iech !!!
