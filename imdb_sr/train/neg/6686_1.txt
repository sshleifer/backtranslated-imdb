There's no fun in this movie. There is no terrible, fun or even interesting scene in this movie. She advertises as a horror, then calls herself a comedy. It does not even cause humor. It's not even trying to be scary. To not be bored of this movie, you would have to be one of the easiest entertaining people on earth. If you like this film even LITTLE BIT than you do not have a standard for what you are looking at at all. It's hard for me to try to figure out what filmmakers were trying to achieve this. It's not funny, scary, shocking or intriguing. Should it be a drama? Because it was not even dramatic. Please just do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. Life is too valuable to spend 90 minutes watching this.
