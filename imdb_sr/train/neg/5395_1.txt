Kenneth Branagh is trying to turn the obscure, rarely produced comedy by William Shakespeare into a musical from the 1930s, as well as a bad Shakespeare and a bad musical comedy because actors are rarely skilled in one or the other of two styles and in some cases in both cases bad. Nathan Lane is particularly sick, who seems to be hysterical as Costard, but is wrong, and Alicia Silverstone, who manages the shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenage doll girl reading the script accentuated in her High School English Language Teaching. Musical numbers were derived from the expertise of high school production "Ladies at the Sea", leaving the acting heads looking awkward and amateur while singing and dancing, with the lonely exception of Adrian Lester who proved himself to be a wonderful man for the song and dance. The only other saving grace of the film is the contribution of Natasha McLean and Emily Mortimer as a lead sweeter, but they gave far better performance than in this movie and it would be wise to check some other titles in their filmographies and give this a foolish omission.
