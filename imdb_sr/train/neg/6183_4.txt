In 2005, George V. Bush began his second term as President of the United States; North Korea has announced that it possesses nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a film called "Into the Blue" appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened that year, but the film was pathetic and perhaps the worst of that year. The United States has another president, there is another pope, a new Korean nuclear weapon ... and a movie Into the Blue 2: Reef, which is better than the original ... but it's just like saying, "putting your fingers in. This sequel is a really bad movie that kept me terribly boring and disinterested. Actors Into the Blue 2: The Reef are made up of actors from the TV series who completely lack any credibility and dramatic Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias) Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patri I've loved some of the previous films by Stephane Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Eccentric Adventure in particular), but in this film, he can not generate a minimum level of tension, emotions, or fun. The film from this film is not only poorly executed but also repulsive. The cinema from this film is also lame and seems to have been made by a technical team that makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels. Into the Blue 2: The Reef is a horrible movie that is better than the original movie, but it's the same as nothing, as I said earlier. Avoid this shitty movie at all costs.
