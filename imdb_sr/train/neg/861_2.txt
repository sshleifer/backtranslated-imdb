Frustrating film. The story has set our protagonist as Chrissi, a 'young', pretty mournful moving person, and does not do much. In fact, she does very little to move the story so that I was not surprised when I focused on her relatives. Too bad, however, Chrissi looks like an interesting figure. The story was predictable and sometimes felt pretty formulated. So, the question is now, when will we see Campions, Jacksons and Tamahori breaking the ground with tempting, kinematic-told stories that will inspire, and not entertain in two hours? Technical, disgusting recorded movie.
