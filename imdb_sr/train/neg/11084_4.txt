A very plain product made for television, "Tison" is trying to be a serious biographical presentation, while extending moments of anxiety for the effect, quick forwarding through the esotericity of the corrupted boxing sport and a messy sensationalist thing that is the only thing that makes Tison even interesting. A warm watch in the best case that will be more appealing to the public than boxers.
