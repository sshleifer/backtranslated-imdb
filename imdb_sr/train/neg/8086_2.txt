When I first heard about "Solar Crisis" I got a bunch of actors, I wondered why I had never heard of a film with such a big cast before. Then I saw him. Now I know. For a film that includes space, sun, huge deserts and vast metropolises, this is a terribly cramped and claustrophobic trait; It looks like everyone is caught up close, so the camera will not have to pull too far. And the effects, although good, are rather unpleasant; we are talking about the upcoming destruction of the planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers can not refuse a deadly solar torch. But apart from shouting, sweating and red shine in everything, there is no real sense of urgency. Do not start with me in this regard. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boile, and others are doing in this movie, and they do not even try to act with any kind of material feel, it's a hit for everyone. I am interested in who has not yet paid in Hollivood .... As for the end ... Well, let's just say it is tense and intriguing, but it's too late in this attempt. Had she kept that rhythm through the movie, I might have heard of the "Solar Crisis" before. Two stars. Mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves. I wonder how Alan Smithee keeps his job like something?
