Religious Bill Mahera is not an attack on an organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing a bunch of rabbis who invented the mutilated machines to overcome the rules of the Sabbath, he does not really attack Judaism, and it seems angry when the rabbi denies the existence of the state of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to a logical conclusion, he would realize that the mere creation of Israel in the Palestinian territories is based on the so-called "sacred books" of organized religion. This is proof of his complete and ultimate lack of objectivity or focus in creating this film. It is very hard for me to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent. Anyone can go to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs, but what can you offer them in return? They do not actually tell them why they think they are stupid. What makes it "rational" in the room? In a way, it reflects how it really is not and ends in that process as stupid as those people are. If you want to watch a good movie / documentary about real evil religions and how religion can actually be detrimental to human civilization, watch Richard Davkins "Root of All Evil?". It is a brilliant researched documentary, which clearly describes what it hopes to achieve and how. Religulus Bill Mahera is not ridiculous, does not ask interesting questions, or gives any insight into such a controversial topic. It seems that this mockery and agony of the old man are dissatisfied with his Catholic education. I'm almost sorry for him.
