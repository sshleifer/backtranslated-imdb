Action, violence, sex and rude language are things that characters do throughout the film. And everything they do is done for no reason. Марк Л. Lester is not known for his violent (no reason) films (Commando, The Base). The story is strange, but stupid. Actors play their stupid characters ... I'm not saying they're stupid, but I think they're very bad actors. This is another low-budget unknown B movie. If you saw something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or something like these bad movies of the same kind from Misbeegen ... do not rent ... and, by the way, do not rent the movies I mentioned .... I give it 1 and half of 5.
