Now, please, do not call me "non-patriotic", "freak" and much more. The very length of this film (4 hours .. !!!) is the biggest mistake. There is no editing - it seems that J.P. Dutta too fell in love with his project. Even Lagaan had 4 hours - but it was fun and gave her a message. It is based on real incidents and real people. We are honored, but are the necessary scenes of repetition of war? In addition, the focus was constantly shifted from one battalion to another and it was impossible to track them all. Between the conflicts, there were songs about loneliness, love and the like. There was talk. In the beginning, it was somewhat eased by violence, but later it became so monotonous that even the correctness of the upcoming conversation could even be accurately predicted. Why were the soldiers walking around like lions in the jungle, unaware that the enemy was lying somewhere nearby? And when they fired, it caused sympathy, but seemed uninterested in them to be in the first place so sure of their safety. . You better listen to them on a soundtrack, not in a movie. The act was a rescue grace: from experienced veterans such as Sanjai Dutt and Ajai Devgan to relative nebies like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaie Khan, they all behaved as a professional. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special recognition to brighten your mood whenever needed. Dialogues were moving from the brilliant ("From Madhuri .. with Love !!") to the illogical / monotonous ("Pakistan sees") musalman Hindusthan mein hain. And the explosive joy that consisted of all MC, BC, C and F words was not really necessary. LOC Kargil is trying to give a suitable tribute to brave Indian soldiers, but he is too busy and eventually fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve a better tribute.
