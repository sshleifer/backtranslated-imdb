The only reason I remember this movie is that (and still is) the biggest loss of time and money ever spent. I was 17 years old and my friend was 18 years old. We were in the years when action films were our thing for enjoying the majority (ok the 2nd majority). We went outside, we felt so insulted, we wanted to give them back money, but time could never be returned. Editing is what killed this movie. As the truck becomes attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers, the film completely offends the intelligence of the audience by letting these bad guys in 4k4 VV Bugs drop rockets on the truck. Please, rockets on a truck that is known to carry plutonium? Worse, these VVs are able to get 15-18 shots with 4 rocket launchers. You would see the VV with 4 rockets that fired them, cut off around the rear-mounted truck, return a second later with two rockets, shoot the other, then go ahead of the truck and now return a set of 4 missiles. We were cleansed by hoping for a great ending that never happened. It seems that they just ran out of money and stopped. Just funny.
