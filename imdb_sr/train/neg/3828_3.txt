Until 1976, the Westerner was an exhausted genre, and the creators of this film clearly knew him. However, instead of delaying the project and rescue from the need to watch it, they went ahead and made it. Obviously they need an interesting thread in order for the audience to come and watch the movie, they decided to do as grubby and unpleasant as possible. Damn it, it worked for The Vild Bunch so why not work here? Of course, The Vild Bunch has benefited from a top-notch scenario, but the Last Hard Men script is plain old-fashioned garbage. It's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawyer who goes to the escape of a prisoner led by a violent exile (Coburn). Hunting becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershei) is kidnapped by convicts and subjected to sexual degradation. top detail. It's really very disappointing, because the pairing of a star sounds like a promising mouth. There is no sense of speed or urgency in the film. An eternity is needed to move, but when the action finally comes, it is disturbed by an accent on abomination. All in all, this is perhaps the worst movie ever Heston made. I am sure that this is one of the productions that she does not like to include in her famous biography.
