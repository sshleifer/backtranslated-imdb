This film was on a romantic channel, and I thought it could have been a movie that was dumb 80's was pleasing at some level, so we watched his brother. The boy was sucking. The boy is in love with a girl - a correction, his dream girl is (obviously there is a difference, and I am surprised that he realized that his dream girl - was hit with more than 30 feet just goes to show the power of the dream girls ), the boy ends up being masked as a female to be close to a dreamy girl (creative in the sense that this is a far-reaching plan, but non-creative in the sense that they are probably better solutions that can be imagined), nasty situations arise, a match is made ( everything that appears to be taking place around late afternoon - or the location was somehow responsible for this strange light, or the actors have to wait until they come out of their working day to come to the set, I doubt that this is the other). Very clumsy, very pathetic. It's almost never fun * random *, so there really is not anything that could use it. Unless you're interested in seeing Chad Love's early days before he finally got his pie piece with his role as an HIV-positive gay guy in the Life Goes On series, or Gail O'Grady who was at NIPD Blue. and he must have stared at Denis Franz's buttocks). But these are incredible motives - I would say that "systematic deterioration of the senses" would be a more justified purpose. I'm surprised to see all this. I suppose that's the kind of thing that, halfway through, you're still * watching over a morbid, self-flagellate inner problem, and you think you could end it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually went through Such a terrific film, fortunately it will give you little sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health. Can * you * take the challenge?
