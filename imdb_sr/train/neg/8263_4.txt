'Mojo' is a story about London in the 1950s, a world of noisy rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses the 1950s shooting technique, often seen in movies that emphasize physical differences to our time, but also represents a dialogue in a highly exaggerated way (thanks to the many ways in which speech was presented in films created during that period); I have no idea if people have spoken this way outside of the movies, but today no film created and set up in modern times does not use such a stylized language. It seems that the discussion of screenwriters from the fifties of the twentieth century serves as a common abbreviation for the past, which seems to really represent a faraway country; and therefore emphasizes a special, not a universal one, in the story. 'Mojo' is characterized by the powerful performance of Ian Hart and the boring Aiden Gilan and Evan Bremner, who is still struggling to build a career 'Trainspotting'; but feels like a periodical work, a modern film is incomprehensibly structured in an obsolete idiom. Actually, it's boring.
