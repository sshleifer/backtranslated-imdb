Approximately halfway, I realized that I was not at all interested in these characters; however, I still looked a little more. Unfortunately, the next day I came back and finished. I should not mind. If you already know something about a movie, you know that the main character will survive a plane crash - and the title gives you a good idea of ​​what's going to happen later - he'll answer the phone and invite people to ! It was almost as bad as the "Snake on the plane" (another moment of aviation). I realize this is an old movie, and the style of acting at the time was much less natural than today. But even according to these standards, the acting was unpleasant. These were not characters, but stereotypes. I suppose this film was, above all, an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband (Gary Merrill) careers. However, without success - I saw oak trees that had more true emotions than it was. Davis's game of happy goddess (ie, non-glamor role) probably looked as sharp and bold. career move. It was not. It was just boring. She was some kind of Tina Tim in the film, which made Trask (Merrill's character) see the truth about love and forgiveness (although she was less victorious than Tina Tim), peacefully distributing wisdom about life and relationships without naming that Her beloved husband is the Last scene, where Trask calls his wife in Iowa to reconcile, she was so affected and exaggerated at both ends of the telephone line, I almost squeezed. I had to remember that these people were actually paid for what they did in this movie. I noticed that many people enjoy this film. If you realize it raises it, that's great. But honestly, I found it bad. There are many old films from the Golden Age of Hollywood that were much better written and acting.
