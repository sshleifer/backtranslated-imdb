All right, I caught this movie halfway, but ... I praise you. and the Accounting Group, although at least it proved that it can work if it wants! (the part in which someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film, both in terms of acting, as well as scenarios and general conviction). the movie has ever been genuine and had actors whose delivery did not resemble those honest but hopeless GCSE students who are trying to get a passing score. Not as much as Human Traffic as a little crash!
