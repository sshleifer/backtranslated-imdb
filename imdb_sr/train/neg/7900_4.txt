These creatures destroy a peaceful town in the desert. It's basically a whole plot for this movie, and while the scenes dedicated to the Munchies themselves are somewhat entertaining (in some way), everything else is just a filler and a bad filler. From the "hero", who is ill Voodi Allen, to the ultra-stupid city policeman, it's hard to choose the most reputed character in the film. There were moments when almost everyone was on the screen and I thought, "Okay, at least the girl is sweet, but why do we have to deal with the rest of those morons?" The film is also filled with pop-references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linde Blair), which it probably did already dated in the early 90's. (* 1/2)
