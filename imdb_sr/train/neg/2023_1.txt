As the summary says you have just made the most unusual comment I've ever heard on the RPG. You seriously thought they were gay? Are you retarded? If you went to save your best friend and someone decided from the goodness of your heart to help you, then you are in serious debt to that man. Lavitz was a good man and every time they helped each other, they came closer as friends. They were not gay lovers like your bastards. And let me inform you that the game was set up in the Middle Ages. Then the women only prepared meals while the men fought. Do you even know your history? Do you know how many women were supposed to be accepted in the army today? This game contains a lot of realism, although your excessive dispute is obviously catching him, and you really need to spit out some solid evidence instead of the unrealistic assumptions based on your wrong act to interpret the story.
