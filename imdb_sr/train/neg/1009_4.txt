*** OVERVIEW CAN CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I will make this review short and sweet. I bought this film from Best Bui because it sounded interesting and I had some great actors like Kevin Spacei and Morgan Freeman. How much that could be bad, right? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a journalist who hopes to come up with a case that can lead to corrupt policemen in Edison's police. LL Cool J is Deed, a police officer with a special forces team called F.R.A.T. (First Response Assault Tactics). He teamed up with a bad cop named Lazer (Dylan McDermott). In the introductory scene, we see Lazer and Deed downloading bank robbers, but at night they are smashed by a couple of guys who are drugged. I do not want to go much, but things are bad for guys doing drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), is on trial for Deeds & Lazer. He doubts in a rude game and with the help of Ashford, he investigates something ugly. Vallace (Kevin Spacei) who is within F.R.A.T. the team joins Ashford to try to bring corrupt police officers to justice. From the very beginning, you can say that Freeman's and Spacey's performances are pretty pale. The only person who does his best is Dilan McDermott. He's a complete case in this movie and pulled a believer out of me. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. He says every line in the same way and shows almost the same emotion. He was much better in films like Deep Blue Sea & Ani Given Sundai. The film starts with some nice action, but then it pulls through the rest of the film. The end is far from satisfying. Do not waste time with this movie. I put it on Ebay this weekend.
