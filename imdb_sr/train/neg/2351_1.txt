I have no idea how someone managed to stay awake during this performance. The act was shocking and amateur, the story was old news, and the development of plans (or lack of it) always had lower eyelids less than half of each episode. That's about everything that can be said about it, because it was genuinely lacking any substance of any kind. How do you people like this shit? It's stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I do not even know how to explain it further ... As if some of you look carelessly in something like this just because you like some of the actors, or because, for any crazy reason, you have not seen the same formula in dozens emissions a million times before. Just ... forget it. This show was exhausted, and luckily it went forever. I wish they started to work on the demolition of O.C. Once forever.
