JESSICA: A LITTLE SPIRIT is as the name implies a story about ghosts. The theme is meant to be a horror, but it comes closer to comedy! The woman who is brutally murdered comes back from the dead. This is what this film is trying to do as a plot. There is nothing more than that. The film consists of a series of freely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman before her death. Immediately from the introductory scene, this film has the look of "straight to -DVD" effort. Unlike gems such as VACANCY 2, the movie does not make sense for direction or creativity and certainly gives bad films "straight to DVD"! The direction is as poor as it can be with the complete lack of uncertainty, fear, or tension. Even dramatic elements are hopelessly processed and represent something boring than even the worst soap operas that you may have had an accident to endure. show the smallest potential of a successful acting career. Many single scenes are incredibly long, with very long breaks between the dialog. I'm not exaggerating! The only reason why I give this film a grade of 2, and not 1 is because some of the bad actors in combination with even worse dialogue have made several unintentional laughs. In that sentence, I emphasize the word "little". This is not at all one of the films "so bad - it's good," such as the KRP KMA or MASAKR FOR NOKTE. If you hysterically want to laugh, watch these movies. If you want to see a real horror movie about ghosts, see LEGENDA HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING, RINGU, EIE (original Korean version), GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL or PHONE. I advise anyone who was lucky enough to avoid seeing JESSICA: THE PRINCE OF DUGA to keep up a good job! Forget that this movie exists. Do not save thought!
