I've seen my share of Voodie Allen's films, and although they're not always great, you can usually be sure that you'll have fun. Probably the last really good were Bullets Over Broadvai ('94) and Mighti Aphrodite ('95) - since then, the ones I've seen were spotty but visible. And so, when I was invited to see the new Voody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda, who was not yet aware that he was still published, I was happily together. I did not hear much about it, so I was hoping that I would be pleasantly surprised. What I got was definitely the worst Voody Allen movie that I saw. The premise is exaggerated, the actors are horrible, the script is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes did not say anything, and yet they were extended, I suppose I would fill in what would otherwise become a short film of 15 minutes. I do not mind the concept of this movie - two directors discuss this simple situation can be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and it is obvious that the film continues to show us this by performing both scenarios. The problem is not in any of these two 'films'. Comedy is not funny and tragedy is not very tragic. It seems that Allen had come up with a good idea, but then he was left with no money or time to finish the movie. The general level of acting is also very bad - Vill Ferrell is the only one bringing something to the table, which is essentially a Voodoo Allen impression. Previously good actors like Chloe Sevigni just seemed to be boring, and the worst of them is Radha Mitchell like Melinda (which is a shame because her character is in almost every scene!) Towards actors, the script they work with, if not does not exist. Definitely far from Alen we know and love from classics such as Manhattan or Annie Hall.
