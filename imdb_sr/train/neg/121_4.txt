Whoever wrote the script for this film, apparently never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in biography, from early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but that would take pages. All in all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those unrepeatable people who simply can not be shown by anyone but themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi Jr., I would be angry at how many mistakes were made in this movie. The filmmakers made a great deal of effort, but the film seems terribly messy to me.
