After I saw the movie, the first question that appeared in my mind was: Is it supposed to be an irony or not? After reading several comments on the character of Doc Savage and a series of comics, I knew that this film should not have been ironic. So, the story tells us about the American-American super-duck that saves the South American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this comes in such an unreal way that it becomes ridiculous. The compulsory final fight shows the worst presentation of the martial arts I have ever seen. The movie could be interesting to designers of low-budget films as a bad example.
