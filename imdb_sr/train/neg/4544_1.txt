This movie is not worth your time. His reliance on the mysticism of the new age serves as the only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that was countless times repeated. Just encouraged me to spend time commenting when I noticed that some tried to support the reputation of this drive. Their motivation and objectivity is suspicious, because you are encouraged not to look at film mistakes, but to his good-natured message of Nev Age. So it would be good for twenty to thirty evangelists, or Islamic fundamentalists who will positively evaluate movies / television that support their attitudes? Despite the poor quality of production, or the lack of truth in any of its alleged historical backgrounds? I hope not. I'm sure the followers will come right behind me to say floral things about this film, despite the truth.
