Much of what is said about the negative aspects of the film is true. OR .... If I have to pass through the film are: Director Director Director of Photography Editor <br /> <br /> < br /> You can not miss the damn Boom microphone that appears in the movie for almost every chapter in the movie, how can I enjoy and concentrate on the story, and I believe in the damn thing when I recall the technical details of making a movie !!!!!!! WANT FOR DVD OR NOT BOTHER
