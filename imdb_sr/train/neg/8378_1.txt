This film is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! The action is ridiculous and the whole shit "Little Man" is so stupid. The whole movie is unreal and stupid. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". This is just an absurdly terrible thing that never needed to get to the theater. Jokes are not funny and acting is terrible. Please, please save your money, but see this worthless work. I had to stand by sitting in the Little Man for an hour and a half, wanting to have my eyes cracked. I'm afraid that something similar could be thought of! Who's writing this shit? Actors have no talent what ever, how do these people enter Hollywood? They earn money from this garbage!
