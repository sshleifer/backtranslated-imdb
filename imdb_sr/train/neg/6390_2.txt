I've seen about a thousand horrors. (my favorite type) This movie is among the worst. For me, the idea launches a movie. So, even a bad acting, a cheap movie can be good. Something weird is definitely cheap. However, there is little to say. I still do not understand what the karate scene initially has to do with the movie. Something weird has a little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
