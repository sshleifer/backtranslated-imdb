After watching KHAKE I felt I would watch another good movie, but unfortunately Film is a joke and I'm actually trying to present Ariemana Afteralla his father Keshu is a producer. during the promotion, saying that the film has meat, unlike movies that came out of that time, I wonder what the film was about about the film. The ease in which children kidnap the family is one of the funniest parts ever. RKS gives the weakest film to date, except for some of Bachchan's scenes, the film is boring. Music is boring. Amitabh is trying to play his part all, he works well for his part, though he is not the best, even if it distorts the face when it pulls the trigger and looks weird while smokes a cigar. H Akshai is there for a few minutes and only repeats his act and ham. Arieman looks blank, too hard, but exaggerates some scenes Bhumika appears best of all The rest is OK
