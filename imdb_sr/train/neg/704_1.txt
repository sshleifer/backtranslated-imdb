Hungry romanticizing the sexual exploitation of black men from Nevis Orlando by white people of power and privilege. Ooh. Does it cause you appetite? Well, then, the stomach up to VHS or DVD and the gorge on this free trolling through the seami segment of history. For a good measure, it's from the book of the celebrated hack Anne Rice. The director is just as attractive and melodramatic as the siren dialogue. Most of the acting is amateur. The only valuable reminder of the production is that it was practically used by a dozen black actors, all of whom were barely employed in today's market (Jasmine Gui, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including faces that are barely visible (Bianca Lavson, Rachel Cuttrell ). She is, in spite of myself, a great show for Nicole Lin. Puppy and heavy James Erl Jones is also on hand. So, the late Ossie Davis, the minimal talent that owes its success to the legendary Negro Ensemble Compani. This film should be rated as "T" for trips.
