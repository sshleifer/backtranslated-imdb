... or the audience. Quick recapitulation ... So, you have a doctor who has experimented with stolen parts of the body for some unclear reason. He wants to improve the transplant, but he feels that he has to do it in his basement. VTF ??? And then suddenly, unfortunately and conveniently, his fiance cuts off his head in a traffic accident for which he is responsible. Agonized with sorrow, keeps the head in a frying pan (or is it a straw?) And is filled with "adreno-serum" (sic) to keep it alive. And then she woke up, speaking her head (so to speak) even though her neck was obviously cut off on the vocal cords, and she had no lungs, so she could not even talk to them. Apparently, the ungrateful person does not appreciate everything that her fianc√© did for her. Just like a woman ..... Then his sadness turns into a horniness while sees the possibility that his beloved head gestures on the body of the first crazy bimbo he can pick up from the street. In the meantime, a doctor's assistant, a kind of Igor's store, enters into philosophical arguments with his head, who established a tele-kinetic friendship with a "monster in the closet" (every crazy scientist has). Finally, the scriptwriter realizes that he can not continue to impose his misogyny and fear of the intimacy of the audience to the end, so he kills everyone, and then he probably goes to the bank to cash the check before the financial supporters of the film have a chance to stop paying the throw get to work. Have I mentioned that this is a bad movie? Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies to stop displaying this edited version without bloody things. A scene with an assisted hand, piercing around the house without leaving much blood is no longer precious.
