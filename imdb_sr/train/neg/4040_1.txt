I think I'm a little snob when it comes to everything and even though the film experience is more suitable for high-explosion explosions, and I can be very confused about the movies. Not all art films, however, are better than King Kong. I'd probably give Congo two stars, double this film. I assume that people are so excited about being almost identical to the style you can see in the show. For a lesser-known art-buff, a movie that looks like a performance is 'great art'. This film, however, was useless. so she relied on a high drama. The only drama in this movie was whether the cat would fall from the roof or not. So, a deep and meaningful dialogue? Great acting? Hard. Being overly fair: Some of the landscapes were interesting: communist apartments, city views (Petersburg?) And Soviet trams are still in use.
