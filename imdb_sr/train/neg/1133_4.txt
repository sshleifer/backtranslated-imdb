I've seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts in one. Many scenes work in plug-and-play modes inserted strictly to fit the romantic comedy genre. Usually it's okay, because we're dealing with a genre, but the challenge is generally to be genuine, new and inventive. This movie does not manage to do it. It does not make sense to who really are characters, except Silvie Moreau (which is the real star of this film, not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional clich√© and they become nothing more than simple dolls that serve the purpose of a very light narration. with unnecessary large plans. I should also mention too stylish decorations, which makes some scenes natural, that is, the attempt of a natural look seems to be too obvious. Of course, besides that, you also have real music that unfortunately often disagrees. I can not believe that the film that makes apparent Voodoo Allen Allus ends up being so deceptive. If you expect a good romantic comedy, that's not it. Or rather, this is a bad attempt. You will just leave the theater and wonder why this film has received such praise when the film is now over 100 years old and that there are far superior executives in Kuebecou who make better moves. what is that. But it's bad if you're watching a movie as an art and director as an author.
