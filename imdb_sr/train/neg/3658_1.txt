Despite some somewhat strange wonders in the script and the overall value of the curiosity of the film, Furi of the Volfman appears as a boring, uninteresting excursion to the lycanthropy, which was saved only by the statue of the present criminal Perl Crystal. Other players, including Hammi Naschi, are a complete write-off (although it certainly does not help often overwhelmingly dubbing). Although the scenario has enough variation on the themes of the Weir / Frankenstein / Dr Moreau, which could develop dozens of films, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterization is so weak and the dialogue is so ludicrously funny (at least in the English version) that any latent interest in tugid action soon it is canceled. Zabalzin direction looks slender, even amateur. His performance is clumsy and inefficient. It was not helped by Villasenor's excessive lighting. Even the promising sets are so indecently photographed that a direct attempt to give the public a fear signaled far ahead. Other loans fall into a similar pattern of incompetence, although the sharply accentuated musical score and ridiculously rough, completely primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.
