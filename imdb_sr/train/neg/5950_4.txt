My first question after watching this movie was: "Why is the title of LIAM?" If the intention was to tell the story from the boy's perspective, it was not well performed. Of course, in boyfriends scenes, the use of the camera's angle was used, but most of the crucial action took place outside its field of vision. Having a "major" character that can not speak (obviously suggesting the child's helpless, helpless position) makes it harder to have that character much depth. Melodrama is defined as: "dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotypical characters, excessive emotions and language, simplified morale and conflict" LIAM corresponds to this definition for T. The spectator is hit by a head typical stereotypes of a Catholic church of fire and sulfur in a marble school and a well-fed priest who gets money from the parishioners. (Stereotype that gets very tedious.) What more - Jewish characters are lenders of money and factory owners! Much of the film was predictable ... Who did not think we would see Teresa rubbing the toilet after her mother said: "No daughter will cleanse another woman's restroom!" I am a fan of British realism if it is good. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
