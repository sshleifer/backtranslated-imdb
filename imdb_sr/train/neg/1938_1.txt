Where to start? Amitabh's son, played by Akshay Khanna, is 30. Amitabh is in jail for 33+ years ... a. A) Telepathically transmits sperm to the house? B) He asked a good Pakistani guard to send him by post? C) They allow matrimonial visits in secret Pakistani prisons D) All above mentioned E) Manufacturers had a little too much time when they approve scenario? Amrita Rao (Iummm!) wants Khanna - he is ium, ium, iummi ... and obviously wants - who would not, would not he ?! ... But when her father struck and then killed (I hardly think this is a 'spoiler', because he would have to be dead and blind I do not see it coming in the movie), he is rather impolite for this disaster and with the advice (metaphorically) of his hat, leave behind to save his father, not paying attention to her loss, and says (paraphrasing) "If God wants, we will meet again" ... Basically, "I I'll get my dad d MY job finished, apologize for your loss - CIA! Buh bie! "- callus above even Hollywood standards of low standard of living ... <br /> <b /> # 3) There are so many holes in this terrible waste of time called the film, you can drive all the jeeps, trucks and camels any additional things pass through it - indeed, a complete and total waste of time - Oh! There is a great dance sequence (yes, only one - like in the dance sequence - regardless of quality) big abdominal dance - but NOT worth looking at just for this. Rent Veer-Zaaru or Lakshia (will Hrithik Roshan ever attend classes of acting?) for better indo-pack films of conflict ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is pretty damn good - 7.5 / 8 Saying should!
