It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (like mafia) character of the Russians, or at least those of the Russians who can travel outside their big country; It's too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the British police are so inefficient that they can not find a person who robbed a bank even when those entities leave the country by plane. In addition, Nikol Kidman and the alleged Russian colleagues spoke in a language that has not been identified anywhere else, probably Aliens spoke in the mountains of Ural, but far from Russia. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep busy learning the grammar of the Russian language and its pronunciation.
