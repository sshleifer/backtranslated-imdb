Jesus, only in the 70's ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this strange hybrid spaghetti of the western and kung fu mirror that develops around the treasure hunting. Spices of this funny co-production between Shav Brothers and an Italian company include funny storytelling, events outside the wall and some very pitiful T & A. Additional camp moments are served by the disgusting wigs of Lee Van Cleef, Iancea Hobbitt, who is trained in the Bible, who was delighted with Julian Ugarte, a man who was supposed to do a lot of blurred European genre productions, - A witty dialogue, hilarious background music and totally ridiculous sound effects that accompany various small events (especially every leap that Lo Lieh made). While this small piece of action descends and enters the Turkish territory, it's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can not deny the charisma of this duo. Do not expect too much, and you will get a lot of things. It is my truth. What is yours?
