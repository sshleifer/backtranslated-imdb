This is centered on unioronical notions of how to deal with guilt. Merrill denies an upset boy stopping his "whining" about Rennie's death. Real men of old style in action, here. Model aircraft and crash cars were impressive on the big screen. Only narration, despite flashback sequences, is played out to us - all narrators have confidence in us (regardless of 'truth' or 'falsehood'), so there is no viewer's view of the narrative structure. This would become a rough template for future repetitions, such as "Fearless". So, all we have left is an individual performance, and at that level, it's best for Wine's joke, virtual - man shov.
