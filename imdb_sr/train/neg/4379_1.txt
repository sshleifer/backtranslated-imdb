Okay, I rented this movie while I was bed in bed, I was banging on pain, and let me say, it did not help the movie. The film is about a man who is buying a car while passing through a crisis in the middle ages, he loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow a car. Since I do not want to ruin (not that there was anything that would break down), I will let your imagination understand the "Forget" (and I use the word lightly) the following antics. I had to fight to stay awake through this snoring in a minute to sleep a movie, and I would like to say that if you dare to the movie store and think about being adventurous, please do not , that's the loss of the film printed. Then I can again make a mistake ...
