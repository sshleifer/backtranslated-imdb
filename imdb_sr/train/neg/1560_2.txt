This film can not be said to be bad for him, unfortunately, only painfully central. In the absence of any real wit or imagination, a thin plot extends to the absolute limit and "jokes" (which are foreseeable and loose) are dropped to such an unusual length as to get to the bait quickly and quickly. Another note that will mark the sad fall of John Vaters and a reminder that what us "shocked" or entertained us 30 years ago now does not behave the same way. We have all seen this before, and no longer violates any taboo because they have evaporated for a long time. Great omissions.
