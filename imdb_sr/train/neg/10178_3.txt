How did I ever appreciate this sequel? All this is throwing the ball! Worst of all, this can not be compared with the first sequel of the series! Comedy suffers from being ridiculous. Where did all unintentional laughter go? A sufficient slapstick on-the-field action takes place too long. Bob Uecker literally preserved this from a complete nine-inning. What's next, MAIN LEAGUE 4: RETURN TO THE SMALL LEAGUE? May be! Leave this on the shelf and plan your way to an All-Star game. This guy had three strikes too.
