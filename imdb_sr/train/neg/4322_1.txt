Read on and take into consideration - you could save 88 minutes of your life (whether it was all!). fairy tale in Capra style. If it fails ... it completely and absolutely fails. I'm trying to think of one good thing about it and I can not. Allow me to mention some of the most important ... People do not die, they already spend eternity as immigrant workers at the Santa Claus Factory. Angels are actually ex-cowboys sitting on trees. Santa Claus can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). And the plot ... I will not spoil it, but in the movies there must be a little light, just to resist the dark, but it does not. Even the photo is gloomy - the snow is shown at the end of the freezing, it's cold, damp and miserable everywhere. As you can guess, the movie has a happy (schmaltzi) ending. What a relief !
