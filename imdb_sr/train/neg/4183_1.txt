If it was not "Oh So Gourgous," Natassia Malthe, this B-movie would not be worth a single sector of my Tivo disk space! Where is the low rent, the last-storey store recorded the alleged space port? "People of Continuity!" This is the basic principle in the right film creation! At night the allegedly spatial port daytime (day and night at the space station?) Warehouse! ??!? People, please! The only thing I'm going to boast about this movie is the wardrobe department. for the continuous keeping of Natassie in those narrow forms that reveal clothes! Even women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the clothes they obviously spent some time in the shoot, every day of shooting! Sci-fi channel would better show SpaceBalls! At least there would be some real humor in seeing something so incredible. P.S. Michael Ironside, please fire ASAP! You are much better than the actor, even connected with this level of film making.
