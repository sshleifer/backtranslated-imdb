I had to register for IMDb just to comment on how horrible this movie is ... my cats and balls have a better story than this. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but when you delete almost all the movie within 5 minutes, it leaves you with a little bit of desire. There was no "horrible" moment in the film, except when they watched the movie "Halloween Night" on television. Everywhere around, it seemed like that could have been a good story, turning credits, and saying that Chasei Lain was a small loss in that, because I did not immediately recognize her and she was finished before I could. I said 'oh yes, here she is '. I'm so glad to see it at the hotel and I did not pay for it, because I would really be typing that I paid a cent to see this. I usually like or at least find the redeeming factor in the movie, but this is an exception. It's so bad that it's not even so fun - so bad - it's bad ... it's just bad.
