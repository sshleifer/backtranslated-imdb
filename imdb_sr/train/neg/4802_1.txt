I give this marriage three years and it stretches it. Adrianne Curri is messy mouth, spoiled, controlled, loud, and her sexual past makes me laugh. She tells Chris to have a picture to protect and must avoid strip clubs. He married her. Chris has a low self esteem from another time period. I have nothing against Adrianne Curri, but this combination will not be lucky ever after the end. Her mother said that he was an old rooster and thought that this was his last attempt to regain his youth. Here's a very good man who will end up in a nasty divorce. I think his old "Bradi Famili" will not fit into his new life. I see they are closed. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. They supported him and were there for him.
