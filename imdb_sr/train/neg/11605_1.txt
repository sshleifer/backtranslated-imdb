At first glance, I realized that this could have been a decent movie. Have I ever been wrong yet? The start of the film seems to look like a set of freaks gathered and decided to make a low-budget movie. For the first 10 minutes you do not notice nonsense, terrible sound, and terrible special effects, but then it gets worse. Just about 20 minutes ago I was wondering, "What's the complication again?" I could only ask this question when I was not ridiculed by laughter for the pure lame of this film. The main actor has one setting for emotions and he adheres to it throughout the film, although it should have gone through love and hatred and everything between. The flashback scene almost vomited me because she forced me to re-live another minute of a photo from the previous film. Now we're in the middle of a movie where they obviously try to get Morpheus out of the Matrix, even though he's just doing a terrible job. The actor talks about "Star Wars" and phrases of fate of fate is almost unbearable. Now, at the end of the film, you do not realize that this is the end of the movie, because in fact you think the plot is finally developing. "Morpheus" character dies, ONLY a good thing about the movie. Speaks a few words and credits. What is this? There is no plot, a bad act, a cheese of everything, can not be worse. Please, if you appreciate human competence, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!
