I am a Christian who generally believes in theology that is taught in the left side. That being said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in a while. To have a good movie, you must have a well written script. The left behind was very short. First, it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done to coincide the 400-page novel to a two-hour film, but in this film I saw changes that did not make any sense at all. When the characters in the story are preserved (I will not say who), the book makes it clear that this is a long process that seeks the soul. The film is fast and arty. The book is written quite decent, where people like Raiford Steele, Buck Villiams and Hattie Durham look real, but in the film scenarios consistently give quick treatment without anything significant. In the second scene in which one character is angry because he is left behind (again, I will not say who), it seems to be artificial. , but I can not recommend a movie that I feel terribly done with good conscience. Perhaps it would be better to make the first book in 2-3 films. In any case, Christians should understand that they are taken seriously as filmmakers, we have to start by compiling a film in a quality way. I realize that a lot of effort is likely to go to the left, but that's the way I see it.
