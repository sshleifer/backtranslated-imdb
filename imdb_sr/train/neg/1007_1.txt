It was very difficult for me to watch this after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I managed to wake up 45-50 minutes before I turned it away from watching the Monster House (which, by the way, was a great party). The story has huge holes in it. The action is too exaggerated and boring, the acting is terrible, especially from Justin TImberlake, who should really stick to what he is good at (seeing stupid and singing like castration). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly embarrassing, especially when he was ready to dance about rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after he and Timberlake met. It seems that Freeman and Timberlake characters have some sort of parental relationship or something similar, which is simply not obvious, other than the fact that; Although Freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the uneducated and rather stupid character of Timberlake, he never pulls all the obstacles to help him discover a completely funny cover-up. an incredible suspension of disbelief in order to give any recognition of the story, which is simply absurd and interrupted. Do not watch this movie, it's a pure waste of time.
