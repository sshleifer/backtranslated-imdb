Regarding the spaghetti western, I would say "A man can not die" on the boring side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the glow and flare of some other SVs I've seen. Gui Madison is doing his best in the main role, but he lacks the charisma on the screen that is needed to do it. With one exception, the rest of the actors are not particularly good. The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I have not seen before. There is not much to excite. The exception that I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She is the only bright spot in this otherwise central film. Unfortunately, its screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is not OK Rosalba Neri is not playing Jenni Benson Instead, she is Melin's character I'm not sure how anyone could miss Rosalbo Neri for a guy named John Bartha listed in the IMDb credits for film.)
