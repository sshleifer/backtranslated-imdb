First, let me start with a quote my friend said while watching this film: "This whole movie had to be daring." With this film, they did their best to reach that title. The effects are, of course, bad. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of stolen pieces from every B horror movie ever made. Actors, I suppose, should be in college. However, the parts (especially at the beginning) make them look like they are in high school or high school. Does not make sense. The scarecrow that goes around and kills people is not at all comfortable. (SPOILER: In the end, when they sang Lester's name and he reappears, the black guy and the Scarecrow laugh, probably from the reliefs that were on their last scene, and on the raw dialogue.)
