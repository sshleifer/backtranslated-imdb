So, American Pie: Beta House is the sixth American film in the series. Although, it really has nothing to do with the original three American films, except that some characters should be associated with characters from the original trilogy, and Eugene Levi is in it (can not this guy get a better gig?). Very little for the compliment of this movie. No funny jokes. The act is painful to watch, especially a girl with a "southern" emphasis that looks more like a Canadian imitation of a British woman who pretends to be a peasant using the word "ia'll". This movie makes me feel like an idiot. Why did not I apply for a college where no one is going to the time (but everyone gets good grades), the girls are constantly being pulled out in public, everyone has an unwanted sex without change, without the burden of a baby and SPI, and you can ejaculate every girlfriend of family photo without her thinking ? Really, this series has dropped to the standards of softcore pornography. Perhaps for the next, it will finally break and employ Ron Jeremy as the leader. I'm sure I can tie him up for a series so that his character Stifler's third uncle will be removed or something like that.
