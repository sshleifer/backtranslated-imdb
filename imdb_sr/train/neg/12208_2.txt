As a military veteran, I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it's a disgrace for those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the true SF soldiers I knew were offended by this shame is a disgrace. If the film was presented as a satire or even as a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. But this is seriously understood by my people, especially abroad. No matter what it sounds, wherever I went to Europe in the late 1980s, it seemed to me to judge me with the Americans in general with this film. Unreal? Hmm, let's see. A single-handed, muscularly attached jerk was pulled out of a prison gang to go on a secret mission to Southeast Asia to release some American prisoners of war. In a current battle, he kills around 500 enemy soldiers with a M-60 machine that never runs ammunition and never overheats. And never miss, running with a 32-pound pistol raised with one hand. I could go on, but I have a headache. I gave this 2/10 just because it's something better than Rambo III.
