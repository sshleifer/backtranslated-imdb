I can not believe that NITI from official reviews for this film does not warn people to contain two rather disturbing scenes of sexual assault. As if our culture accepts this behavior as simply sexual, but not violent. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to condemn these attacks - as in the case, a woman who is constantly attacked and pressured never keeps men responsible for their actions, as well as anyone else. One man is stopped to end an attack when someone throws a dagger, but he is rooted only with "you can not force a woman to love you" and not "you should never sexually force a woman, a jerk" ... A woman's view, the movie is brought down. She somehow "throws a bone" on women in allowing them to be skilled fighters and leaders, but the film is much more defined by a romantic - characterized by the idea that human sexuality must include an imbalance of power, and men are dominated by the woman they love. This incredible fighter for martial arts does not use any of his martial arts to try to defend his attackers. She never even made them apologize - rather, she seems apologetic. All in all, depressing a disturbing movie, with great cinema and some cool martial scenes, but not as good as her long recording.
