The completely ridiculous "period" of the film is just a tiny excuse for its extensive, graphic representation of the heroic affair with the "beast", a monster that is allegedly appearing every century to rape some women. That's pretty much what it does, and the film's view of the beast is really terrible; It's basically a tall fellow in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC hose for hard skin that squeezes a lot of white liquid. For lovers of false animal pornography, I suppose this is a real turning point. However, it was fun for me to open horses who had sex in the public square.
