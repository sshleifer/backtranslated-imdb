This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched him with a large group of friends and after completing it, none of us understood the plot. Apart from the lack of complication, the acting was terrible, "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely terrible. The only factor in buying a movie is that it's so incredibly bad that it's pretty funny. You can not laugh the overwhelming zombie, while the actors throw out the exhausted dialogue. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but that's something that a group of friends can gather and make a good laugh. Now it's a joke among my friends and me. 1 of 10
