It's a bad movie, but I have to give it to the main actress in this ... Francine Forbes. He seemed to act at least and I personally thought it was somehow cute. It's a shame that it only appears in another database in the database. In addition, the film is filled with ridiculous mountains and false scenes of death. People are stabbed, and they GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! But if you like to watch poor horror movies, I recommend this movie.
