I grew up reading Mods of Blaise, comics and books, and she is truly my heroine. Although I was not a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, I was interested to hear a few years back thinking that he could make a film about her: could I finally give Modesty a nice treatment on a big screen worth it? I heard about "My name is modesty" a few months ago and checked the stars he got here, and he was not too surprised to find out the result was not too high because loved ones often have problems with melting fans. heart if it's wrong. That's why I decided not to read reviews and watch the movie instead, and well, I just finished watching, both stunned and sad, and yes, quite angry, too. Sad and furious, giving more than one hour of his time to see something as fantastic as Character Blaise's character turned into a movie that has nothing to give to the viewer or fan. It seems that almost everything about this movie is sub-par and unprofessional, although I must admit that I watched some actors in other films before they were fine and I can not blame them. But the script and the direction ... my God, why even make this kind of crap with production values ​​slightly larger than the average TV movie, but much worse? I do not know the background of this film and I do not really want to know, but I just can not wonder how, how, for good reason, Tarantino could say with a straight face that he loves modesty, and then put this? He lost immense respect in my eyes. The director was not the right man for this job and I can honestly thank him for ruining my night. I gave this film 3 stars and these stars go to actors and technical quality that could have been worse. The other seven missing stars are what this movie was not good at. Well, we hope that at some point there will be serious productions of The Modesti Blaise Movie, which has some other goals than stealing money from the Fans of Humility. Although people like Tarantino are making decisions, I do not hold my breath.
