This British-Spanish co-production is one of the countless films filmed in Spain after the unexpected phenomenal success of Italian "spaghetti" westerns and, as typical of such genre efforts, a characteristic eclectic range of established and emerging international stars: Robert Shav, Telli Savalas, Stella Stevens , Martin Landau, Fernando Rei, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Maians, etc. Ironically, however, this unwashed disorder of the film serves as a great example of why most of the American film genres became a dying species in the 1970s and today is practically (or officially?) Extinct. I really wanted to like this film, not just because the West is one of my favorite types of movies, but also because it had all the features, including an intriguing premise, to be good - not to mention the fact that my father bought the issue of the edition A CITY CALLS FOR BASTARD JOURNALISM THE FIRST RED RELLE to alleviate, ease! As it is, the only virtue of the film (if you can even call it) is its pure eccentricity: for example, Stevens, playing a widow for revenge on a man who betrayed his revolutionary husband, sleeps in a coffin (!) Ride in a chariot of his stupid servant (?) Sutton; Savalas, as a bloodthirsty apostate, who at first seems to be the main villain of the film, has sent a letter from his own admirer Lettier very early in the picture; then it turns out that the villain is Landau, who, in the first scene of the film, sees the robbery of our legendary hero - the priest Shav! Fernando Rey, who plays a blind peasant, is the only one who can identify Shoa rebel who ultimately turns out to be just a front for ... well, it does not matter! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and from there it becomes a stranger! The production team that was in charge of this film was also behind other western trips around the same time period, such as CUSTER OF VEST (1967), BAD MANS RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972 ).
