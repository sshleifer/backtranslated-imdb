Please, somebody stop Ben Stiller from playing in any movie. Write studies, hell, write your local congressman. I laughed more at the funeral, and then I watched ANYONE Stiller. Jack Black is trying to do something about comedy about the disappearance of shit for dogs, and Christopher Walken, perhaps one of the greatest actors of his generation, just seems embarrassed to be there. Stiller is his unbridled self, but now even with someone who will save him, he proves that he is overvalued as a comic book. It's no wonder why this movie was badly filled and it was available for cinema in dollars after only a few weeks. I warn you, and you have to warn your friends, do not watch this movie, it's just terrible, the worst then Gothika (personally, I never thought I was going to say), the worst plan 9, the worst Ishtar, the worst then the Golden Child. Please, Hollivood, stop letting Ben Stiller in your movies, he's not funny, he's a horrible actor, and brings others with you. The next film is ranked 1 because there are no allowed negative results, so while the board says one, I will give it zero.
