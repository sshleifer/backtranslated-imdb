This must be the dumbest movie I've ever seen (front spoilers)! First, the plot is stupid. The little kid is weird and moves to the hotel because his father is his guard. We found that the kid has a gift, "Great." This gift has never had anything to do with anything except to make the child cool. Then the film becomes boring and boring until a man finally crazy. He goes to the savage to kill the child and his wife, because ... well, he feels so. Why else would you do that? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the bathtub. The man kissed and realized that he was kissing a dead body, which is extremely disgusting. Somehow the Negro enters the hotel and strikes with an ax. Then a kid and a woman take the car of a black man and leave a father who dies within minutes after hypothermia. Most movies are not a total waste of time, but it belongs to this category. The music is messy, the characters are ruined (except for Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and suits the description of vomiting, the ending is very predictable, the story is slow, tedious and boring. This film is extremely overrated. REMOVE THIS FILM IN ALL COSTS. I'm surprised he's got such a high rating on IMDb.
