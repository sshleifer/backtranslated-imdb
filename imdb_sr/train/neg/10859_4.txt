This is yet another of the many B minus films labeled a film noir in the hope of provoking an interest in something that has been deprived of. All aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are central. The operation of the three lines is wooden. It seems that John Dall was expected to go into the film business, but then someone realized that he had little talent and that he ended TV work. Lee J Cobb, who is usually brilliant, can not rise above bad scenarios and bad directions. Jane Wyatt should be femme fatale, but she does not come close to convince spectators. The movie has two of the strangest cars I've ever seen, the one in which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly weird. DVD download is a typical Alpha.
