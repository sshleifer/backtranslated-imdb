Heavy film for categorization. I never gave him a concentration of 110%, and therefore it was not as simple as the action appeared, but I could not say with certainty who did what was among the FBI's American characters and what were their roles. Nor could I seriously understand Irvine as film characters when their lines and scenes were in the style of one of his shows, and not that they acted. This is nothing more than a magnificent episode of the Discoveri television. shov, with a largely negligible backdrop that appeared on the road. However, just like every Irvin shov is always worth watching, and this movie is worth a look, but not for Christmas. Speaking of it, I have better things than being here. High 4/10
