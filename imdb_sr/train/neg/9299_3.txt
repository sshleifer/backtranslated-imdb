As I watched this movie, I tried to figure out why they were trying to make it. Although the main plot of the film is potentially good, there are all kinds of unconnected / unnecessary backgrounds. People who are marketing marketing in Hollywood have certainly dictated multiple bad guys, permanent double crosses, and men and women who get too close and have sex. It's weird to see that they have more sex than we did with the president and his mistress. Many plots and sub-assemblies make the movie too wide and none of the characters is properly developed - I really did not feel that I knew any character, except that they were all corrupt and evil. The end is completely incomplete - he left me more than I wanted what could have been, but what was supposed to be. In the end, there is really no explanation as to why someone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who make a double cross. I am surprised that so many well-established (and good) actors have agreed to make such a hollow movie. This looked like a movie made by students working on their second or third project. Do not waste your time if you are not on the movie class and want an example of what you do not need to do. filming.
