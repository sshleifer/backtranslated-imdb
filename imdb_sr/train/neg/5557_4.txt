All right, but does that make a good movie? Well, not exactly, in my opinion. There is not much that I would recommend. I found it very slow, fatigued, in fact. Number one and two were a little predictable, but not so much. I also thought that this film was pretty camouflaged, which I did not really think fit for this series and character. Jeff Fahei plays the main bad person in this war. he is a decent actor, but I felt that he also played his character over the top. And I guess it fits into the tone of the movie, which would be great if I loved film.plus, there were a lot of bad lines. Arnold Vosloo is back in the main role, but he is given little to do in this film. The character did not really evolve, as I hoped. it's not unpleasant, it's pretty bad. I vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
