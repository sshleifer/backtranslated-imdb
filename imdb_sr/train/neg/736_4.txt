Twenty years ago, five-year-old boy Michael Havthorne saw that his father killed his mother with an ax on an empty path and later committed suicide. Nowadays Michael (Gordon Currie) calls his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Mic Agnev), Emmanuelle Vaugier, Lisa Ann (Kelli Benson), Neda (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Mitch Maldives). Phillip Rhis) and Trish (Rachel Haivard) to spend the Night of Witches in the country with their grandfather and grandmother on the farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their biggest inner fear, and together with their Indian Biron Chief Moon, they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using a carved wooden doll Morti (Jon Fedele) that would eliminate their fears forever . Michael's biggest fear is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morti turns into his father, killing his friends. "Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and pointless hair line. a film that uses an interesting concept of eliminating the greatest deepest fears of any friend before it grows, but in a messy script full of clich√©s. There are some exaggerated performances, such as Ms. Betsi Palmer; Others are very weak, but in general the acting is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation as to why the doll was brought to live; Further, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each of them dies. A low tempo for more than fifty minutes could be used to build a more dramatic situation. At the very end, Michael shows the charm that his father was interested in not having noticed the story. I do not know if the previous reference was arranged on a DVD that was released in Brazil with 87 minutes of time. Special effects are very reasonable for B-film. My voice is four. Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloveen" ("Fear 2: One Night Halloween")
