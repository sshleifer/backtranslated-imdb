I have a question for those who are thinking about this idea. Why? What led them to think about making another movie. If the memory serves, did Cinderella not end with "They all lived happily ever after"? I'm pretty sure it is, or is it implied. Wait a minute if everyone lived happily for the rest of their lives, so that they could be a sequel? Unless they tried to make the most overwhelming story in history, there could not be a sequel. I mean, we could surely sing ashes about nonsense in two hours, but why? A film that ends "happily ever after" can not have a sequel; if it does, then they do not live happily ever after! Something has to go wrong, which causes problems with the first place! Why? That's wrong, it's evil. That's my last word.
