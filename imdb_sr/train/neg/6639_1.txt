It's very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop filming. Each time they get worse. Niki and Flo (2003) are depressive stingers of the camera. It's sad that in many films that are being made annually in Romania, the worst can be sent abroad (for example, the International Film Festival in Chicago). This film without plot, acting or scenario is a waste of time and money. Rating: 0.02 out of 10
