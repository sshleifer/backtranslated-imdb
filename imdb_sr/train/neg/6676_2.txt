Perhaps I was not the greatest fan of Blair witches, but I still appreciated that effort, so I rejoiced with Altered, especially after I read the superlatives thrown in different IMDb comments. "Unique", "intelligent", "Cult classic of the future," and so on ... you have to wonder where people come to such things to describe such a bad effort. Because, unfortunately, Altered is a poor, bad movie that fails to embark on any and every respect. Nonsense is not funny. Horror and up is not scary. And regardless of the "thinking" aspect that some of the poor guys saw in this film, there have been serious misconceptions, because in this mess certainly there is nothing deep or clever. Is it at least tolerable? Is experience valuable in any way? Unfortunately there is no. To begin with, become a very bad act. It's not hard to say that most of the B-films are better than these days. The plot? Boring and messy. Dialogs? Many amateurs are actually making better progress. It's really the way that puzzles move. I did not expect any significant improvements over Blair Vitch, but at least a small step forward. Instead, our director worsened over time, completely unaware of previous experiences. If there is a major flaw in Altered, this is the main set. Most of the shop takes place in one location, where the main characters are limited, but Sanchez has not given place to any person. Bearing in mind that in Blair Vitch, the forest plays a major role and that as a character (antagonist, if you like) as three students, you think the director would realize that the same thing is needed here. But no ... this place has no personality, thanks to the untidy direction and regardless of the details. There is nothing salvage here. Dying fans "Blair Vitch" better follow Daniela Miricka. Although his production is far from being golden, it shows a better structure than Sanchez and some lessons from Blair Vitch are applied (unfortunately, in poor stories but nevertheless).
