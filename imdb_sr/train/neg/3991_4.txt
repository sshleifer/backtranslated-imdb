I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this movie wreck wreck and declared poor Stevie Wonder for the eternal pairing of his beautiful music with this theater disorder. He also disdained the way he used curses as part of a normal prose of professional black people. The embarrassment is the abuse of his attitude on the part of the viewers of ethnic films. Scenes that appear to be fictional blue colors and have nothing to do with themes or sub-themes, they play as though some college had written this. I'm particularly embarrassed by the absurd scene in which two seek out for no apparent reason sparingly, and the policemen are coming in even more widespread Snipes. Exaggerating traces makes you feel that Spike has no respect for his viewers or has no idea what the film is about. The final scene seems to have been thrown out to justify the use of the hammer to achieve the goal. This film also supports the myth that all people in culture use F-word in an informal conversation. I hope that he will understand that other films are in the same pool as the one in which he does not grow as a film maker. I think his relationship with Scorsese in Clockers was a wise move. Documentary films such as four small girls should be kept. Shock movies do not give Oscars.
