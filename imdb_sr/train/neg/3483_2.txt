Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Maci, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Rejected by his girlfriend, hotshot does not want to be left alone for Christmas, so she decides to return to her child's home, imposing a dysfunctional family who now lives there and bribes them to represent themselves as his family. The unpleasant and one-dimensional performance of Affleck, who mostly acts with an uninteresting smile, makes his image a mentally unbalanced puffer, but Gandolfini and O'Hara breathe life into this mess. Even for a farce, her stupidity is bulky, there is little point in the scene to the scene, and her sentimental messages are fake as Affleck's smile. 91 min., Rated PG-13. * Â½
