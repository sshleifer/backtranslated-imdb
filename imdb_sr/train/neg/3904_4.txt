I admit - Emma is, in my opinion, the only major novel ever written. It's as close to perfection as it can be any mortal creation. Jane Austin reaches the peak of his art here. Unfortunately, this is at best palimpsest. Comparison with the version of Gwyneth Paltrow is inevitable - this version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and much more enjoyable to watch. There are some good elements here - Kate Berkinsale (who previously played Flora Poste in Farm Cold Comfort, apparently Emma's spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raimond Coulthard makes a fairly decorated Frank Churchill. The production is nice, but the interior is too dark. However, there are several major problems. The first is Mark Strong - first of all, it does not look good for Mr. Knightley. This may be because he plays a role as a censored Victorian priest. That's very bad. The second problem is a long one. Simply put, the film is too short - to get the right feeling, it should be twice as long. Finally, and most importantly, there is a quality of adaptation. Austen is the dream adaptor - all the dialogue already exists. It only needs to be trimmed and edited. It seems Andrew Davies thinks differently. First, this is a pretty dark movie, and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy. More importantly, Davis considered it appropriate to overwrite the end as a kind of a bouche holiday. Which planet, or less of Thomas Hardy's, did he come? It is completely out of style and spirit of the novel. I believe it is very daring to try to improve - perfection. See the Paltre version, or watch Kate in the Farm cool comfort.
