This film is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm studying French at college so I understand all the dialogue, so the language barrier was not a problem. I must say that it's really hard to sympathize with any character shown in the movie. There is only one professional actor in the acting team and I assume there are no professional directors or writers. Although I rated it with 1 out of 10, it probably does not deserve such a bad score. This is just a futile effort to reduce the current overall rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. Maybe 4.3 will be a more accurate rating because the movie is a real event that lasts 100 minutes or more so you will never return. It's a real pity that I'm sure a student at college smashed his nut to make a movie twice as good and half as long. However, if you want to join a bandwagon that looks like rolling around IMDb, you can still give "Lost in Translation" 10 as well.
