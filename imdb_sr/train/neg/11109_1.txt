I'm really surprised that this movie has this rank! For years I have not seen such a bad movie. This film was a very bad movie. Splatter is not enough to describe unnecessary (almost funny) blood scenes). If you do not like hostel2 or Volf Creek or Halloveen (2007) ... this is 10 times higher. The story reminds me of RL Stine goosebumps.! I can not say about acting because the script was so awesome. (why do I have to write 10 lines? I never understood this.) == Here comes spoilers == The story is about a butcher who kills people all the time in the metro. We're talking about thousands of murders and nobody gets to know it. In fact, these people are simply missing. And there's a good guy trying to solve the mystery (and we have no mystery because we know a bad guy from the beginning) and as usual, nobody believes him! What a surprise! In the end he puts his butcher clothes and fights with a butcher killer!
