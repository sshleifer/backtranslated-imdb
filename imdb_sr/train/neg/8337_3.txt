Millie's the juice. She marries a rich man named Maitland and they have a child. Then he caught him cheating and divorcing ... but allowing him to keep the child he claims to love. Then, at the beginning of the 1930s, she would be entitled to great spouse and child support, but she let this guy suddenly easily ... without the support ... what kind of juice! Later, when a boyfriend and a life looks pretty good, it turns out that he is also a cheat! Wow, is it difficult for her to choose people? As a result of these bad relationships, Millie is changing. Now she's a wild girl - she does everything she can to turn away from her hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter who left her early in the movie is now 17, and unusual fashion has not changed much. An old friend of Millie (yes, that's another evil man!) Now she pretends to be a friend of her daughter, but she has a crafty design on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, he will kill him. Take a wild guess what will happen next! All in all, the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess - a bit like "Madam X", but much, much less focused. Often it seems that Moli's motivations and actions do not make sense. It seems that little is invested in the film - as long as it supports the idea that all men are pigs. Unusual, but not particularly good.
