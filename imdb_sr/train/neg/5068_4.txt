I was astounded when I discovered how many fans have this show. I did not say that Friends were, at best, "average" comedy, and not as big as others did. Let's face it, that there was no casting of Corn Coke Arket, David Sweetwear, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrou, Jennifer Aniston and Met Le Blanc, then who knows if this show would last as long as it did. I very much doubt that. Although the series has progressed, the Friends have become increasingly progressive, miserable and boring, that I am not interested in characters - most of them overestimated in TV history - or their condition, or who was sleeping with whom. And it was funny in the first four seasons until sometimes funny. Even when he had all these Hollywood actors from the A-list in the film world, I still did not try to get involved. Writing in Friend became stagnant that I lost interest in this show since the sixth season, and furthermore for the end. Well, it was predictable, at the very least. What was embarrassing was that it took ten seasons, while some of my favorite shows lasted only three, four seasons, for example, and eventually they were canceled and downloaded from the air forever. The show was to stop immediately until the actors wanted a higher salary. In fact, however much the series was falling, the show was bigger than the actors themselves, and not the other way around. When I finished 2004, I was so excited to see the back of this sitcom. Now we are talking about a story about a reunion of a friend coming to us soon. Still, I will not be happy about it.
