Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into an adventurous film "Jack London" is not a bad idea; Certainly, he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. This film, however, is flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, integrity is missing. Michael O'Shea (like London) has some speeches in London; and, it's nice to see how his bearded Jack receives "The Call of the Wild" after spending some quality time alone, in the snowy mountains, with his dog "Buck". Virginia Maio and Susan Haivard are very nice. The film outlines the unfortunate "yellow dangers" of the parallels between life in London and World War II, which are both tense and offensive. ** Jack London (November 24, 43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Haivard, Virginia Maio
