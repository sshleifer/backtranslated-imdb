Ouch! This was a little painful to pass. It has a cute and fun premise, but from there everything goes to hell. Matthev Modine is almost always a pedestrian and boring, and does not disappoint this one. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville turned into surprisingly decent performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, played at the top. I know it's the way parts are written, and it's hard to blame the actors, when the script and the director make them do such a glass. If you have unusual characters, that's fine, but you have to have good stuff to succeed. Is not here. Escape screaming from this movie if it's possible.
