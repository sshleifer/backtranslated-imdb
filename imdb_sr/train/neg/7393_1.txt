I'm a big fan of Steven Seagal. To hell, I'm probably as heavy as I am, although I do not have street credibility to deal with a curly tail. Expressing his prejudice and affection for his favorite American corpulent stage and film hero, I must seriously proclaim that this is his worst movie ever. I'm not sure that he could make the movie a bit worse than this. In his defense, the main problems with this film appear in post-production. It is painful that this film should have a different story. This results in a sad voice in which Steve's voice almost does not synchronize with the voice of dubbed voice. Installation is dark and everything starts bad, it gets worse, and in the end you will want to replace Da Vinci code. Yes, it's so bad. After that I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at listening to his CDs. Is it time for me to start checking some of Van Damme directly on DVD? If you are tempted to watch this movie, remove the eyeballs and rinse them to the toilet. Life in the dark is better than 89 minutes.
