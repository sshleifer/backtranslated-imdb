Luckily, there is no video about this Western Western car that will remain on board for the Great Frank at the time when his career rebelled. The story of a weasel that lives on the reputation of its big-breasted brother, who is fleeing from the city by the bad guys just to return to gather his cities with a new discovery, must have been written by a writer from the background. All in all, this show stinks. The story is basically boring, poorly designed and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I have to leave completely from another reviewer who found him "... underestimated ..." Critics beat him at that time and deserved. You will have to catch him in the last show, if you are late and have insomnia. But if you can go through it, you have more courage than most of my friends in the movie.
