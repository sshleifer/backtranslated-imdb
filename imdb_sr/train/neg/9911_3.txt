If you have beloved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you do not need Billy Burke, Coolio, or any other interference. Massive talent is completely lost in "Three Days to Vegas", and the blame falls on the script. My neighborhood movies are as interesting as this blurred movie. If you want to see how to use a veteran with a good script, see "The Crev". There really is not any factor in redemption, and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such poor material is a crime. I wanted to like her, but a shallow scripture deceives the audience by not giving anything to the actors in essence. - MERK
