I just watched this movie and I have to say that although at first there was little effort to make a decent movie, it was absolutely terrible - but not in the sense that I am sure of. > It was as if the child directed this insult to intelligence with the conviction that all potential viewers are morons OR is extremely difficult for a party or both .... Thank God for fast forward! I can not imagine the type of viewers the producer had in mind when he was filming this movie. I mean, you have actors who are trying to be serious, though barely, and a script that cries for total rewriting, .... I can no longer say. If Harlequin Romance opted for horror films, that would be a good effort. If you think this movie is fun, I recommend that you look for some guidelines regarding the purpose of the movies. There is much better food there. Join the club, READ OUTPUTS, but above all, avoid this kind of shit.
