Incredibly bad acting, not a good, unclear story and unusual images and slow movements where they need the least: Adrenaline is all that a movie should not be. Georgina Verbaan (a Dutch soap opera that did not attend English classes) plays a rich girl Frey, who has the habit of looking for "excitement". It mostly works out dangerous stops, breaks things and annoys people. And not in a fun way. There is also Draco (Rivas). He leads the group, but there are other illegal activities on the side. There is also Freiin Dad (Lockier), who also plays a suspicious role. And finally, we got Jason (debutant Fialla), Frei's boyfriend. One day, Freia is gone and everyone seems to be involved but we, the viewer, really do not care because no one's acting is either sympathetic or convincing, and the story does not make sense. Why is it made at all? 2/10.
