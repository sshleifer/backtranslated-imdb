If you want to see the true story of early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - however, if you are looking for a reasonably made fascia with artistic theme, you have found a movie. This film is such a fundamentally incorrect depiction of the life of Artemisia Gentileschi that almost cried me. (Insert Artemisia inaccuracies on Google and examine some of the facts as opposed to fictional articles.) However, from a purely technical point of view, the film was fine: sets, costumes, and especially chiaroscuro lighting helped create an impressive early 17th century ; although the aforementioned GLARING FACTORY INCIDENTS dropped a bit. I wonder how the director / co-writer Agnes Merlet defended his film at the time? Maybe she refused to show Artemis as a victim, which would be unfortunate because we faced her.
