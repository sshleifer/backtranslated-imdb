What did I just look at? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. The concept of a serial killer of clowns is actually quite daunting because there are many people who fear the clowns .... but the fact that the 300-pound kindergarten recites the clown's killers makes a joke of the genre. I'm still wondering how the character of Mark could not escape the clown ... he is 300 pounds, he must eventually be tired. The whole region made me stand up and literally said, "What have I just watched?" It's obvious that Brandon Denis's cousin ... and they got him in the middle of the movie, which means he had sex with his cousin ..... it's something people want to see * anger *. Another thing I found hilarious stupid was the introductory scene in which the clown falls on a woman and she says, "What have you done?" Well, what do you think, what did he just do? The last thing that was stupidly funny was one second when the main character splashed the hiker and called ac * nt, and then 5 minutes later said violence did not help anything ... did the script writer give the line the wrong guy? None of this movie makes any sense. The film was a more or less stupid low-budget porn I got into shopping (all 3.99) and did not get any entertainment other than the sex scene. I'm surprised that a fat clown did not join an orgy to fit in well. I was hoping that the movie would have some fun value like other B movies, but I was wrong. This is a moronic piece of garbage that is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
