I bought this DVD for $ 1 in Valmart. When I see it, I may go back to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave a movie, and 2, and not one, is that the story has several elements of a new story, although it actually does not grow to the level of interest. This film has all the signs that it was created for the street theater market - ultra-low budget, amateur acting and the liberal dose of sex (for the film in the early 60's). In fact, I wonder if perhaps the only reason the film was made was to make quick money and because someone knew some strippers who could use them as add-ons. The film talks about a fool who wants to plant his girlfriend's cut off head on the body of a donor who does not doubt. Most potential donors are scandalous strippers or models - whose only real purpose in the movie is to get amazed while removing most of their clothes. However, they are trying too hard for a movie to be worth watching for bad bits, and the movie is not terrible enough to merit watching the bad movie lovers.
