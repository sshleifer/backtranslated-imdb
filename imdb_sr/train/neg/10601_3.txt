This is the official sequel of the '92 sci-fi action thriller. In the original, Van Damme was among some of the dead veterans of the war in Vietnam who came to life as perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this, I suppose, about ten years later, since Van Damme has a daughter of that time. Now he works with the government in a classified installation for the latest Unisol training - under the code name Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: a super-computer on-site (called Seth - as a snake in the "King Cobra" the same year) crazy, takes over the command of Unisols, and even takes over his computer brain into a new super-Unisol body Take it). We are looking for the next step in evolution, folks! Most of Van Damme's struggles are with one of the most important Unisol (pro Goldman) who just keeps on coming: leave him out of the building - not good; Get him in the truck - do not go! Shoot it, burn it - forget it! Much of the humor was discovered in a way that Van Damme was now obsolete and out of class (even gray around the edges). But, while taking licking, he continues to kick! Most extensions of this kind are pretty poor imitation of the original, and although this is not a genius move, it can be consistently fun, especially if you are a wrestling fan.
