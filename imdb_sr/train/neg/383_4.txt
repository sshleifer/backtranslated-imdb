The No One Sleeps Line is not a bad idea, and the theme is quite interesting. But, watching this film, we said loudly: "These filmmakers are trying to find good locations, lighting is good, makeup and hair are good ... why is the sound so bad?" Through the film, the sound was an echo, distorted, and much of the dialogue was incomprehensible. In this movie there is a good acting and I think that Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would be worth it to be done as a high budget movie. Simply I can not repeat enough - if you have a limited budget, pay more good sound. . The sound is as much a part of the film as the picture, and it's worth doing good. I could have earned 6.
