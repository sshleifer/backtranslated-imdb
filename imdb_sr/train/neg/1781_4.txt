Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as tough as most of his stories on the movie. Mother and son move to a small town in Indiana with a secret. They are crazy, cat creatures feeding young virgins. This little story has its own part of the up and special effects; plus incest. Alice Krige is remarkable as a mother. Other performers include Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King as a cemetery keeper.
