What is the disadvantage that a truly competent director, such as Andre de Toth, who specializes in skipping, changeable alliances, has not first received this concept. He could help to discover the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by Villiam Bishop. While the movie stands, it's pretty messy (as Chipe suggests). The main problems are in the direction, cheap budget and bad letter. The power lies in an excellent acting and interesting general concept - characters that were in different directions of the conflicted forces. What was needed is someone who has enough vision to connect positive elements by reworking the script into a kind of coherent whole, rather than in the spatial, nasty mess that is, (try to understand motivation and interaction if you can). Also, a larger budget could coincide with contrasting locations and studio footage, and extracted locations from too obvious LA suburbs. The real shame lies in the dissolution of the great actor - Haiden, Tailor (before his teeth were closed), Dehner, Reeves, along with James Millican and Villiam Bishop just before his premature death. There are not a few films that illustrate the importance of author-visionary vision more than this modest Western, which, in the right hands, could have been much more.
