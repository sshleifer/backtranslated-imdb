This documentary has been reenactment in the past few years of the Betti Page career (Paige Richards). The Tennessee tease is the most recognizable queen of pin-up in history. Her most remarkable work came in the fifties of the last century and was the fetish of photographs, slavery and the fight of the cats "girly flicks". Irving Klaus (Dukei Flisvatter) in his Movie Star Nevs instructed Betti what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in famous photographs or "deer films", but nevertheless Klav was charged with distributing obscene material and ordered to destroy them in order to avoid prosecution. Not surprisingly, Bethti had a cult who was following at the height of her career. The girl next to the door with black hair, blue eyes and glass watches, dressed in fetish equipment or not, would have fascinated for decades. After all, it was said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and that she was the second most iconic picture in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page will disappear and dedicate her last years to religion. This movie could actually be much better; but good enough to hold interest. Miss Richards is astounding by herself. The bra, panties, harness and hose harness do not hurt her image at all. Also in the actors: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Be careful that this film can change your heartbeat.
