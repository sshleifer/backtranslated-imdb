There are so many negative reviews about "Stay on, Joe," I can not keep silent here and this injustice happens. This is a page you have not heard before. Elvis Presley's films are my pleasure for the simple reason: they are perfect films for pure relaxation because I do not have to think when I watch them. That means I do not have to worry about missing a complex plot because there is never a real plot. I can only take off my shoes, take a beer, relax, turn my brain off and enjoy all the general shaws and the striking rock n 'roll melodies from the worst decade of all of them. In my books "Stay on, Joe" definitely belongs to the category "so bad is good". Now, if you are like me and appreciate the "value of garbage", this is the ultimate experience of the camps of the 1960s. It's so bad that it's almost surreal to watch and when you think it can not be worse, it surprises you in the most challenging way. In the end you are so amazed at all the new levels of stupidity that you simply do not know whether to laugh or cry. In short: I love it because it's so much fun that there used to be a generation that actually made such films. I still give him 1 out of 10, when - when hitting the bottom 100 will become the current bad movie classic.
