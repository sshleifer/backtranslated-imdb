This is a really bad movie. I am a big fan of Italian horror, Argenta, Maria Bava, Fulci and that, even our good friend here Lamberto sometimes comes out with good ones. The first two "Demonic" films I find very entertaining - they were so bad they were great, but this is so bad that it's really, really bad. It's very boring, the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters - the woman struck me and the fierce scream-baby pain in my wife *** led me to madness, there was not even close enough story dedicated to Ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film. I turned it off about three-quarters of a trip because I was very, very boring! Do not bother.
