First, this film was not so bad. It was fun ... at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons. I never saw the original so I can not compare two. This film reminded me of this strange movie "The Village of the Damned" by Christopher Reeve. The two films have different complications, but these nasty disgusting feelings and unwanted comedy exist in both of them. Knitted man should be mysterious / thriller / men, do not be angry female movie. I do not know that the whole pagan thing and the sacrifice were a little distant. Nicholas Cage, his magnificently bad self goes to a lonely island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long-lost fiancé. who claims that her daughter was taken away and hidden by the islanders. Cage is a policeman and as a tired policeman goes to a semi-unknown island, leaving no word about his stay to anyone in the real world. Stupid. Things become even more strange when large women from the Amish Guards who settled the island cope and lie about where the girl disappeared. His fiancée is not a help that seems to be elusive and tired all the time. Cage remains on the island when he finds out that his daughter's girlfriend disappeared and that he is happy to be deceived to come to this island as a victim at the Island Harvest Festival. In this film, men do not go so well. A sickening twist of feminism? I thought that the movie was ridiculous, especially when the cage hit some women and run around in the bear's suit. I think there was too much hole in this movie. I think that the whole concept of angry women who are released on the island without any concern for men is quite fun, but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just strange. While most women had a wounded jerk and anger, this is a clear form of sexism. I'd turn off the movie with disgust if the roles turned. This movie is something that can be seen only once or twice. This is NOT a thriller, it should be categorized as strange.
