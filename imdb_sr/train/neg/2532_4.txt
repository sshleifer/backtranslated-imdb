The personality cult raised the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman etc. Like Kings B. Since the people in Crown International were so crucial, they were not elevated to a status that they earned richly. A movie like The VAN can now look like a one-time Drive-in esoteric, but it was a significant hit when it's released (not to mention subsequent releases as a dual feature with other Crowd hits). VAN was the perfect example of the Crowd strategy of capturing the mood of film visitors at the time of the film's release. Here, they were sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and a short "Custom Van" hir. As others have noticed, it is ironic that the "hit" song in the movie refers to Chevi when the title Dodge is in the movie itself. I had the city of Selectman where I even even declared these vans "the sin of sin on wheels!" Perfect line of commercials for the movie! There is a common assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscular heads and low eyebrows (including Danni DeVito support). In many ways, this does not differ much from the old films of the Beach Party of the 60's, but now it's seasoned by Nudity and Drug. It is obvious that this is a limited budget and a limited schedule, while the film is pleased with the clear charm that compensates some, according to today's standards, certainly non-PC views of women. The classic touch is the Toaster for Bobby's Sin on Wheels. Yes, toaster! Hey, you gotta have something hot for those munchies! Grindhouse Fest.
