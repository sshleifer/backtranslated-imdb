I saw this film a few years ago on the BBC and I sat over it. How? I do not know, this is up there in a "bad" good chart, Kidman, Baldwin, and Pullman have to calm down when they see him now. I think Voody Allen would be wondrous with strange complications, and Baldwin's miracle. part could have been played with dense by Leslie Nelson. It was again tonight I tried to look it again, but life was too short. the few minutes I watched was Nicole, who was so hot about 93, did Baldwin ever make a good movie? Pullman played his "nice but smoke" character, the F-word that comes out of the mouth when a lady from the "frasier", like the detective accuses of murder, sounds so wrong. Stay away.
