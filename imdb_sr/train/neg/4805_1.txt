I loved Adrianne Curri before this show. I thought she was great at the Top Model and she was really pleased when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he looks like a great guy. But this show was made by SIK! I am so mad at both of them for what happened in that show. I do not care what they were of different ages, I know that age can not stand between love. But Adrianne, you were all just SEVEN MONTHS. It did not surprise me at all what he did not suggest. And I do not see an appeal to force somebody to marry you before he's ready. If it was supposed to be, then why not just enjoy society and love each other, and let it come naturally? Converting a wedding ring into a sphere and a chain was totally unnecessary, it's silly that Chris loves you with or without a ring. And Chris, I'm ashamed that you broke it anyway and suggested it! You went through two unsuccessful marriages, how could you run into another just because she hit it? I hope the relationship will last, but I really feel that the marriage has rushed for the wrong reasons. Maybe they can now take their breath and find the right reasons to marry.
