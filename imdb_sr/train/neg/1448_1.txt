Growing up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from former Gillian, I can tell you that this movie is tortuous. Most teens do not live like this movie shows. The action is poor, and the false accents are fun, and it enhances the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer beers, rusty tonics, peasants. A terrible fake Texas accent is what kills him. True, there is a certain Texas story for most Texas accent, but these people are exaggerating. You can not get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to make Tekas accents. It just does not work. John Travolta should have been holding disco-dancing or for the 50s. Debra Vinger was more convincing than Wonder Girl, but as a Texan.
