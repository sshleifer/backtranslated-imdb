Elvis Presley plays the "Indian" Indian who has to defend his reserve from nasty business tycoons. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight and create children. Fighting, wrestling, and "punching" interchange the stereotypical expression "How"? ; Maybe he was preparing for his famous "return". It could not have been because the script of this movie was excited. Joan Blondell, who tries to seduce Elvis and Burgess Meredith in "war color", should be ashamed. The most shameful song is Elvis's love song "Dominic". There are some surrealistic scenes, but they never become trips enough to succeed in that genre; though, "Stay on, Joe" could laugh if you are in the right "mood". Otherwise, stay away. ** Stay, Joe (1968) Peter Tevksburi ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
