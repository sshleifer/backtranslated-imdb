The most sad part of this is the fact that it is 87 minutes that I will never return. I knew this was terrible from the very beginning, while the guy was dressed like a crazy Indian boss at the top of the roof. (See if they could get away with it in 2008). My 10-year-old boy is currently in baseball, so we decided to rent him on a rainy day. Although he looked like he was enjoying his parts, I had to get up when I heard all the unnecessary offense. Bad, bad movie. This was a horrible scam of media bad news. Totally impervious and completely predictable. I do not mind the predictable movie if it's good, but this is absolutely not.
