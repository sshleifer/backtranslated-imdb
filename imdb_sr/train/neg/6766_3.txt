You probably heard that phrase when he came in this movie? "Herbie: Fully Loaded With The Crap" And That Is True. This film is really terrible and totally chrome. This is the second worst film ever that Lindsey ever shot from the queen's teen drama confession. The only good thing in this movie seems to be an actor who has surpassed talent that is far better than a million times the film and is the only selling point of the movie. I do not see how such an esteemed actor as Matt Dillon could be part of this movie, does he not read that terrible script before signing up to be in it? What I did not like in this movie is the basis of how Herbie is surreal and fantastic as an extraordinary ability and climbing to the wall and going faster than a racing car, and yet it's just the Beatles. I know it's a movie for kids, but they've gone too far and it just turned out to be stupid than fun. Small realism is needed, plus the story is too predictable. Final words: Unless children are actually 5-12 years old, I doubt that anyone could enjoy this meaningless film. What a loss of my money. I feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (rating F)
