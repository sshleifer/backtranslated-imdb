Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the scariest, amateur films I've ever seen - ranking up there with manos, hands, fate in terms of bad acting, useless direction and value of production in kindergarten. In this film, a silly dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum, CA, and begins to eat local hay. In an exciting peak, the creature described by a local "giant alligator with fins", pulling his own weight over rough country to this forced her since lunch, before the bulldozer struck several times and died of boredom. Every character in this movie is a complete moron. An absurd background depicts moving into the alcoholic beverage store to buy a $ 4.75 pint; rather than buy a bottle, idiot shot at the cashier and other passers-by, shoot the policeman, chased by the lake, all so that it can be eaten by a monster. The unfortunate big plans of the monsters reveal that this is just a piece of styrofoam. There is a false mađioničar who fights with false British accent (that would be done more legitimate), two excessive uncontrollable landlord boat, a cheesy "prehistoric art furnace" carried out in the crayon, and boring banjo-pickin 'background moosic. In one poignant scene, fake magician and his stupid wife / girlfriend / accomplice managed to get the film in another 4 minutes so you will succumb to how the stars can be seen in the night sky, although it is clear that it is still day. Even on constant acceleration, this moovie hurts, and it hurts badly. MooCov says we call fumigators, because this cow's craving really stinks! : = 8P
