Many of the themes or parts of the story are the same as in Leon, then other parts felt like another movie, I do not know which one, but there is a familiar feeling throughout the whole movie. It was nice to watch, but it would be fantastic! that the story was more original. The theme of the little girl, a bad killer from Leon, is just a little corrected. The opening scenes are really good :-) It's strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in movies :-) My biggest problem was to remember the parts from Leon, Nikita and where they are from a French or American version. If you have not seen Leon, then this is a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. Best regards / Rick
