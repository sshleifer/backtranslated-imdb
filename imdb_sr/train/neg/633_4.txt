Good Earth follows the life of slave girls and poor farmers in China. The film is based on the novel Perla S. Noise. The story is great, but I hated that they decided to act Anglo. Valter Connolly is ridiculous as a farmer's father. He has such a tough American accent, like most actors, whom I could not stand listening to as he speaks. in the main roles. Take Anglos and make them look like the Chinese are similar to Angloos that puts the shoe on the face to play afro-Americans.
