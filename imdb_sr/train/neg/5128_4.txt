This early B entry into the patriotic category waved a beautiful young Gene Tierney on the advertisements and posters, but you have to wait for a good time before you see it, riding in a hollywood-ridden camel. Earlier we set George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely agree, but they must assemble before the attack. I saw Sanders like so many pleasant things that it was fun to attend a nice guy's row. However, the attraction of Bruce Cabot is quite mysterious to me - he is basically unbearable in comparison, but I always felt he just appeared, smiling, under the car, covered with fat and schooling in the sixth grade. Some people like them like Gin's Roma guy. This is an action adventure charger, and as we were warned to attack the local people with weapons, ready to sabotage and attack the British in their country, there is a final fight in which we must lose the main character for the good of everyone. This feature does not require anything more than your closest attention on Saturday afternoon, the programmer who did everything that was paired with the better. It was almost more interesting to identify the great support and surpass the look of Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles. Two or two and a star of five. -MDM
