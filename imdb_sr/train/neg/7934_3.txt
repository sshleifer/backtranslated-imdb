The family that travels for the softball league of their daughter decides on the 'scenic route' and end up in the middle of nothing. The father is a greedy photographer, and when he is hearing an old abandoned secondary school in the city, he decides to make another roundabout to take some photos. Naturally, the side view is filled with freaks, which immediately kidnap women and leave the young son and father to take care of themselves. The only cool thing about this movie is that the family actually fights against its inbred prisoners. In addition, there is nothing worth the movie.
