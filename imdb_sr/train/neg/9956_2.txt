I made a special effort to watch this movie and I was completely disappointed with the result. On the paper, the scenario looks hopeful, and the choice of actors leaves hope in hope - I loved Pacino in the Scent of a Voman and I saw Annie Duperrei and Marthe Keller in several French and other films of the 70's / 80's. But I forgot how important part of the dialogue is in the film, and in this movie are absolute ..... trash! Recording locations were also attractive, but hopeless, pretentious and forced dialogues put it all down to zero. In addition, I am pretty allergic to the world of motor racing and I do not find any interest in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in the "Love Story" were better than those in this movie (and that's saying something !!). I really did expect better than this film, and I was very disappointed that they let me down so much.
