Another half of Steven Soderberg's revolutionary biography about If Guevari deals with his latest campaign to export the revolution to Bolivia. To maintain his holiness over Soderberg, he simply hit the frogs with the mass executions he presided over after the Cuban Revolution and the craziness of his adventure in the Congo ("This is a history of failure", he writes in the Foreword of the Congo diary) to focus entirely on Che's attempt to support support to rise against the government in Bolivia. It would turn out to be a disaster and Gevarine's final act. What tormented the first chapter was followed by this case, because Soderbergh slows his film to creep to examine the blissful face of the contemplative Guevar who is once again playing as James Dean in the eastern Eden, Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is that Guevara has little success in receiving the accountant and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades swallowed in the heart of the darkness of the Bolivian jungle. Unlike Verner Herzog in the magnificent, Aguirre, God's wrath, Soderbergh does not use the metaphorical possibilities of the jungle to ameliorate the desperation of the guerrillas. He seems to be worried more by keeping Che's nimbus above his head than by exploring a panic situation on dead enders. There is one Herzogian moment in which Che sits on a stubborn horse that sneaks and screams to start, but the entire Soderbergh mice scene remains flat, messy and uninteresting. In both of his films, Soderbergh shows that Che groupie is obviously and that's why his focus remains short-sighted and narrow. He spent too much time building his monument to Chew and not enough to develop relationships with key players in his league, especially Fidel Castro. Worse still, it makes it a slow and impartial approach that never ignites a fire. One would have thought that it was enough in Eisenstein and Vertov to understand that the change was shown much better with style.
