Let's be honest: the only reason someone bought this, the only reason someone reviewed it, and the only reason anyone could claim to enjoy this is that David Linch did it, because you want to have David Linch's children . But guess what? Even David Linch can make a piece of shit. Perhaps Linch wanted to overcome normality and experience absurdity in himself as a pure subject of knowledge. Perhaps the creepy, cacophonic sounds, as well as visually-spicy pictures, should imply something about the place of humanity in the world, about our relationship with Real, about the absurdity of all that. Instead, only one thing told me: I just lost $ 20. If I wanted an offensive offensive, I could pull Hansen up high and let me bleed my ears. If I wanted an absurd because of the absurdity, I could only throw a dump on the plate and watch it for 33 minutes. Dumbland has only one quality buyout - it's a target, the target is ridiculous. That is, it's so bad that it's not even funny because it's so bad. However, this fact is a bit ridiculous. If you hate and hate your money, buy Dumbland. If not, save yourself agony.
