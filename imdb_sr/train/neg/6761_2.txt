Let's be honest. As a film school, made without a budget and "real" actors, this is a passively interesting movie. As something that will be posted on a DVD for an innocent viewer, it's a very bad product. If I would tirelessly change and accidentally capture this movie, it would probably have caught my eye and attention for some time. As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I will get a real cinematographic product, i.e. Film, I feel deeply disappointed. It's a video on TV, something on the line of the old series of the sixties, but without that particular charm. In addition to the leading man Redfield (who is also the director) appears to be other actors or from the campus (too old for that), or members of the directing household, who appear in front of the camera without any help, not only the couch for the acting, but also the artists of makeup or hairdresser (the hood over the overgrown permanent bangs or top caps over the zip is a very long way since the creation of the 1840s). Everything was captured using a stationary camera in a small, naked studio, sometimes using a blue background screen in the open. The synthesizer generated an uninspired result of the lousy "period" of the inspired romantic karaoke offense to the ears of the audience many times. The film is trying to be "dreamy", but in fact it's just a collage of those recordings that led to the assembly (and believe me the standards were not too high to start). There and there are interesting dialogues, but it is generally quite silly and two-dimensional production in more than one way, without a flash of genius either by the director or by any crew member. So they tried to "watch" movies in the 1980s. Mr. Redfield works a lot better as an actor than a director.
