This is one of the most popular and fiercest films I have seen for a long time. Unfortunately, I was deluded by keeping this, because the presence of Donald Sutherland in the wrong way gave some credibility. [This is the last time that will happen.] Leslei Ann Varren's character was boring and stupid as they came. There were smarter characters than her killed in the movie. It's just one of the many things in this movie that prompted me to ask: "Where is justice?" Why is the late-night cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological chaos? It seems that most of these films have a certain problem with women and seem to focus on them terrorized and killed. This film could have been equally tense, and that he was not ill and distorted in that process. All that is done is to turn the stomach of the observer into his illness and offend the intelligence of the viewer. Actors are wrongly good. My assumption is that they are the first BAGGEDI of Sutherland and used it to attract others as lemmings in this.
