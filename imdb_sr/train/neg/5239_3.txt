I watched this movie based on very favorable reviews I read about it here. They definitely saw something in this movie that I have not seen, that's for sure. The film starts at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes is interesting, then it starts to swim and pull, not to mention completely incredible. At the end you will find yourself saying, "What ?! He will do it? How far will he go with this thing?" The action starts with the image of Jeff Goldblum, John, who enters the delicacy to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new seller, Auggie Rose, is killed during a robbery. John enters the ambulance and goes to the hospital with him. This looks a bit, but wait, there's more. John becomes completely obsessed with Auggie Rose. For reasons that never create any logical meaning, John, who has a very good life, a beautiful, full of love, a safe, well-paid job, a beautiful house, nice car, expensive clothes - decides he wants to be a loser like Auggie Rose, and experience life on low paid jobs, live in a landfill with a little girl, and possible connections with dangerous people. a witty, half-wrapped movie has received favorable reviews that I will never know. Of course, Goldblum makes a good acting job - he always works - and his looks have improved over the years - but if you do not have BIG in love with Jeff Goldblum and you have to see every movie in it, I would not recommend this party. It's been about two hours of your life that you will not come back - and believe me - you have nothing to be thankful for when these two hours went by, except that you are grateful that you still do not sit down and watch this movie. ! <br /> <br />
