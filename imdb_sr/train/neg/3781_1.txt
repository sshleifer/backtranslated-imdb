(Some Possible Spoilers) I'm not quite sure what Dreamvorks was thinking when they decided to drop $ 80 million to this extremely tired and lame animated movie. They probably thought that spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring the audience (mostly the family) to see in the crowd. It seemed that he worked at the weekend opening, amounting to $ 26m, roughly making a total of $ 38.1m. $. total (estimated for this weekend). But I think the audience who came over the weekend saw almost the same as I did when I saw and spread the word. This is a big movie, apart from animation everything else, it usually appears that the script runs for three years. The film is only about 80 minutes. long, but feels like an epic three hours. There are several points for me, so an irritating narration is one of them, and so it's obviously written. At some point he escapes from some hijackers, and although you can see that the horse is obviously frightened, he raises the storyteller (voice of talented Matt Damon) to clarify any delusions (which would only happen in the simplest way of thinking.) <Br /> Another constant pop-up of Brian Adams's songs, now I am a fan of his music, I think he is good, but whether Dreamvorks really thought that the audience would be able to cope with 8-9 In the end, and here's the spoiler, the horse is shot by members of the calvary, no less or less, she (horse) falls into rage the Spirit (the focus of the film) is trying to save her, but they both cross the waterfall, which must have at least a 50-foot drop, and later in the film we finally see that this horse is alive and well. I know this is a children's movie, but even and this little amount of realism is unacceptable. In short, this is really chrome vie, I'm not saying kids will not enjoy it, but anyone else will check their watches just waiting to finish this trophy. on my Top 10 list this year. - ** of 4 stars. <br /> <br />
