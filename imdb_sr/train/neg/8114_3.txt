... mainly because the Ju-on 2 boasts an incredible value of forty minutes of material literally shot from the first Ju-on - and when you consider that the sequel lasts only 76 minutes, it leaves you 36 original minutes worth of the movie. Ho-hum. I found it to be very irritating - as if the viewers simply did not remember the same things! - Not to mention boring, to look at it all again. Okay, this lawsuit aside, the signature for Ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain many unanswered questions. The first film, which honestly, for more than 36 minutes, simply does not go far enough to make any sense of the original very tangled story. There are, however, some really nice new horror sequences that show how good the film was, that it had time to evolve; and some of the questions put in the original - some, but not all - were answered. So, in conclusion - if you liked the first original movie and want to see some further events on the story, go but do not forget to hold the remote control with your finger on the fast-motion button forty minutes.
