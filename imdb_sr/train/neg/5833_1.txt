3lbs is obviously just an affordable program for Stanley Tucci to be a producer / a wretched doctor. Unlike home, he has absolutely no personality and, unlike Grey's Anatomy, cases of brain surgery are not interesting either. This program should be set up at the leading neurological center - yet nothing interesting and exciting is happening! Even the so-called pathetic "quarrel" between him and the rival does not add anything to the play, nor even the hallucination. The pilot had a brief glimpse into the social life of the leader as a father - stammering! boring and meaningless. This performance is pants, at this moment is the saturation of medical drama and it does nothing to separate as a special one.
