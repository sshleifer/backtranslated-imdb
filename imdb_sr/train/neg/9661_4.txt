I want to say that the acting is bad, but I think it was directed. I never even thought of many bars (the same director), but it could have been blamed in the 1980s. This, however, has no excuses. People are firing while leaving the trenches with a man in front of you !? Such mistakes, along with an obscure time line, a strange tactic of struggle, under steam and poor visual effects, make this film a sub-movie over all. Then as many others commented, all this American shit. The German general practically feared his captured US private man. Be prepared to swallow it, even in small doses. To summarize, this is not a horrible but definitely war movie in all aspects.
