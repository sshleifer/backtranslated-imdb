REALLI? REALLI ???? I know that if you make a political war movie, you will see that this film is just garbage. Terrible in every sense. Terribly imprecise in many ways. It's easier for me to believe that the President of the United States fits in, flying the plane and firing aliens. It's easier to notice a few things that were right. The jaw dropped when I saw someone say that this movie is the best in the last 25 years. It was an excessive, seemingly meaningless redirecting of the plot, and sometimes he had questionable cinema. Ks-Side, IouTube, ACUPAT Programs? did anyone check that things did not exist in 2004? It's not that you had to do extensive research, just five years before this film came out. I am a veteran of the war in Iraq and if you spend one day in infantry or EOD units, you would understand how B.S. this movie is. To compare this with water or rescuer Ryan is ridiculous. Why do not you throw Commando and Red Dawn out there? I think it could be more precise. If for some reason you see the past of incredible complications, historical and factual disagreements, then this movie might be fine. Nothing more. If you continue to listen to "Oscar Buzz", and you need to add your pompous review, go straight ahead. As far as I'm concerned, I write to the director to see if I can get my 131 minutes back.
