The reason why the DVD releases of this film in black and white are that nobody can grasp the color prints of this public film, a modest sea story at best. Distributed for television through Allied Artists, DVDs (or VHSs) on the market at this time for this title come from the same 16MM television footage. Films distributed for television before 1963 were often distributed in b / w graphics, as most viewers did not have color sets anyway. The strike c / b print for television was also cheaper because it often included plenty of graphics to cover all the stations that filmed the movie on a syndicated basis.
