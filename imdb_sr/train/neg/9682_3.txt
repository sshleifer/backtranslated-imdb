To overcome the death of his wife, the old man does what everybody in his position naturally does (at least in Peter Greenavan's film): he and his son are settling their home with eight and a half (one does not have a leg) and embark on a sexual odyssey. This is the Greenavai movie, has a lot of pretentious and uninteresting blabbering and of course there is an unnecessary male nudity. In fact, the father and son share a bed that sleeps on the goal. Gross. Besides, who wants to see an old full-face guy? For those who are not on the homo-erotic scene, one of the women likes to do bad things with horses. No story - just a random collection of boring scenes.
