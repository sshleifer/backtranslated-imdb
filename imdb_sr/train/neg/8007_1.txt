Indeed, I really did not expect this type of film outside of America. How can anyone take the subject of sexual abuse of children and turn it into a "thriller" is just sick. Auteuil (whom I previously admired) who went around like a Rambo for saving children was in ignorance and offended all the children who were sexually exploited all over the world. The film "Happiness" was released this year BEFORE this film. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed. It's great to read some comments from more intelligent viewers. They were able to see the bad and ridiculous processing of this topic. Those of you who think this is a great cinema show a disgusting amount of ignorance and you have to watch "Happiness" to open your minds with the real horrors of pedophilia. Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or abused by his neighbor, teacher, friend or even a cousin? Hmm ... I wonder. If they make a film about international slavery for children of any kind, they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotional instead of this shit that pushes the button. 1/10
