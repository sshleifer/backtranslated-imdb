Jude Leo gives everything in this wonderful movie of a vampire that offers something of value. Totally lacks eroticism, excitement or leading lady with an appeal. One decent fight, a few moments of mild uncertainty. And a plot of one ton. Film cheats philosophically in a series of conversations between Loyen's character and a persistent killer detective, well-played by Timothy Spall. But, despite their greatest efforts, both actors put themselves on the cross of the banality of the film. With a smaller actor in the lead - and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis's cinema - the crocodiles would fit into the sea of ​​low-budget vampire rapids.
