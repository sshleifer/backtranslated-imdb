I entered this film, expecting it to be similar to Matrix or Pi. Boy, am I wrong? Yes, the movie is a poorly written, poorly performed action (with CG animated cells and peptides to run). However, the actual focus of the film is the "expert" heads that speak among the new segments of the perfume. Naturally, this is innocent enough. At first there is little real quantum physics. For example, it is said that the electrons exist both as a particle and as a wave, and that the atom is mostly an empty space. However, the film takes a huge (and non-scientific) leap, saying that sub-atomic quantum effects also occur on large scales. The speakers speak even more. According to them, the following is true: - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives could not see his ships because their minds were incapable of seeing anything differently. -Meditation can reduce the murder rate. - With a positive thought, you can walk on the water. - Your thoughts can change the formation of ice crystals in bottles of water. And it's only the first 40 minutes! Watching the movie was torture. This movie looked like a movie that would show you to join the cult. After I did my homework, I realized that this was essentially exactly that. On the other hand, this can be seen as camping comedies (although it is not funny). > Save time and money: do not watch this movie.
