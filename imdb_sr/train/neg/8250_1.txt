I ordered a film from Korea because I was an additive in it and I was interested to see how it turned out. Seeing him, I can say that I am ashamed of having had any part of it. I feel embarrassed not only for myself, but for all the others who have had any role in the making of this rude British comedy. stiff-to-do so to the extent that I looked away from the screen in disbelief on several occasions. Until you look at a movie, it's hard to imagine how romantic comedy can be non-romantic and non-comical. It's not just a bad story, but a badly made movie. In one scene, you can really see a runner or assistant director showing S.A. when it needs to be deleted. Details about this will be published in the section "Goofs". Up, it filled me with emotions (disappointment, anger, shame ??)
