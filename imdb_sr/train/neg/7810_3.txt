Against all hopes, it is very badly made, sometimes painful, film. This is Michael Madsen's first film, which shows that he is not so good at it. Some people think that the story is ridiculous; the alcoholic realizes that his life and family are falling apart, and he calls the priest as the last help for help. After telling the preacher his story, he accepts Jesus Christ into his heart. In fact, I found many religious scenes, as when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to church, but moves away from her, quite realistic. I also liked how Cecil knows that his life is falling apart and trying to get help, but he realizes that God alone can help him. In the end, she understands with the help of God that she can go through life without re-drinking. This film is not well made at all. The acting is bad, the script can use some work and looks worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Now, just because you become Christians does not mean that you will automatically be able to stop addiction or cure your broken family, and Cecil understands it and works hard to stay on the right path. All in all, if your Christian values ​​the way this film depicts Christianity, and if you are not, you may be invited to learn more about your faith.
