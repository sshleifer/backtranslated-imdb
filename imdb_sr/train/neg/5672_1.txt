I'm ashamed of having this movie in my collection. The most redeemable factor for owning a DVD is a short movie in bonus features. My vote for this movie is a big fat ZERO. Do not misunderstand, I'm a terrible girl. but I want a little meat behind the story, not to mention that I prefer the evil to happen to people, not to deceive them to watch, what seemed like forever, cuts of animal tobacco. The work of brutality interrupts long lasting silence and bad behavior. If I was forced to make a comparison with another film, the only thing that came to mind was Kanibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, useless and totally uncomfortable watch.
