So, I wonder as I watch this movie, did the producers of this film manage to save money on Sandra Bullock's dress by pulling out their "pre" from Miss Congeniality? Has Mrs. Bullock also managed to speak through this role by channeling "before" Gracie Hart? As many critics have previously noticed, the film is very diverse. Add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character Cassie Maivether as something darker Gracie Hart with more stories in the background and soon becomes a snooze fest. (and better) in other films. As "a good guy is trying to protect his partner, despite the evidence," the character was seen earlier. In fact, none of the characters in the movie have ever crossed two dimensions or tried to be anything other than stereotyped stereotypes. Killing one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer, but you're not a serial killer or even a killer.
