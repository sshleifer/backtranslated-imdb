Jesus, another life movie, but it's not the worst movie in the world yet, but far from the best. I think that the main problem is that it is quite obvious who is responsible for what, and is generally quite predictable. Worse yet, some of the flashbacks ended up confusing, and the viewer remained cautious: "Ok, how should I worry?" One thing I liked is that your film shows that it's never as simple as "good guys are good and bad are bad," and sometimes it is evil against evil, and not good against evil. Hadlei did not do what he did out of feelings of justice, she did it because she considered her right to work for the family, and to eliminate competition. As for Alicia, it simply proves that the victim is not always a good person. Some of them really "come", even if "it" was a painful, terrible death. A "burning bed" is a great example of this, but the difference is that the malicious man in the "Burning Bed" got exactly what he deserved. But did Alicia "come"? Some will say that she did it, but others disagree, and the law does not apply at all. As for the acting, it is a mixed bag. Some are doing a good job, such as Mia, but others have simply come to be indifferent to their roles. They were mostly wooden or simply not convincing. Although the music was pretty cool, some scenes are nice and fun, especially if you love a girl / girl. The film is not badly recorded, but given its weak points, the forces are in the background, unfortunately. I heard rumors about the sequel, but considering the years, I doubt it. ll happen. But I would not be surprised if there was a sudden surprise. If Alicia is evil, humiliated and terrible as people say, then I think she will not think: "IAI! I woke up from who! Oh, Hadley was responsible? Oh! That's OK! I want the charges to be rejected!" There is no way that Hadlei would be in jail for a long time, if at all, because there was no murder. In any case, it's worth checking at least once!
