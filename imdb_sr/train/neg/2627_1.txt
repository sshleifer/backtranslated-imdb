This bomb is just one 'explosion' for another, without humor and just absurd situations. Really, pyrotechnics to the extreme. Reality is not one of its strong sides. I give him 1 of 10. I would have done it by zero, but this option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But then sometimes we all have to have money. And I still refuse from that farce Tim Burton about Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that it was a turkey. But if it was a party, then this film is not even a gizzard. I wish I could say, "Give me back my money." You can bet I want if I can. But this is a problem with premium services, a subscription type.
