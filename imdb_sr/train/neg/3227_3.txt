This is a sequel to the notorious Guinea pig series. A short Japanese TV show, which was canceled after the psychopath recognized that it was inspired by the killing of a young student on the show. This short film in the series is, like all other films in the series, practically without a story. A group of guys captured a young woman. They tied her up and continued to torture her to death while filming her. They were beaten, pouring boiling oil, using the pliers on it, and finally, in the "beloved" close-up, pushed the needle through her eye. This is the most direct of all the films in Guinea and one of the first. Probably this film, more than anyone else, gave Guinea a rumor that it sniffed. They certainly gave inspiration to Nicolas Cage's film "8 mm." These films have become quite popular in horror circles. They advanced to more sleek, but equally graphic films like "Nude Blood". They probably fill in the emptiness left by Mondo movies, which are a little cleansed and become reality TV. It is not recommended, but it will probably attract those who will once see something, and wonder why after that, I know that I am.
