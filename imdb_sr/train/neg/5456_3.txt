This is just one of those disgusting movies you find on a life TV that shows the disgusting behavior of a disgusting woman in a compassionate way. With other such nasty films as "The Burning Bed", "Enough", or "The Monster," this movie takes a disgusting criminal and tries to show the viewer why she is not such a bad person. Let us! Here are my questions to filmmakers: If LeTourneau was a man, and Willie was a twelve-year-old girl, would you make a picture of sympathy and empathy with that person? Answer: Hell no. Imagine changing the generations in this film, and then you will see why I and others here are considered a worthless piece of garbage. If the poles were replaced, there would be no attempt to sympathize with the criminal. Instead, he would probably treat us as a portrait of a monstrous and disgusting man who had robbed a young girl, his dismayed behavior brought him to jail, and his victim was brain-washed by the Stockholm syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not get the same treatment in this movie is thanks to her sex. Let's call the shovel. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Simple and easy. There are no ifs, ands or buts. She is a criminal who belongs to the prison, and deserves us to laugh and contempt, but certainly not our sympathy or compassion.
