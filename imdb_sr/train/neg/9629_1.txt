I've seen it for free, fortunately, and I want it to be better than it has been, but it's actually the same old thing that movie studios have on us in the last ten years. Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple that is the opposite - yet still attract each other. If the lines do not surprise and excite, the film will not even be. > A lot of gazes and frogs for the fart. Halfway through the film, I started to realize that Ben Stiller was not really so funny, but he was very busy. And Jennifer Anniston is not really that pretty, but her hair looks great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seimore Hoffman had to pay a lot of money to be in this average ho-hum movie, I expected more of them. What was interesting was that I saw it after I saw American Splendor, which is really a funny and original movie - and I compared them to my head, and I found myself wanting the executives movies are forced to sit through those two films backwards - perhaps it would make some sense to them and start making better movies with unknown things, and not just those formulas that best play on planes.
