I often comment on the endless production of truly frightening films on the market, and unfortunately, White noise has only diminished my belief that the film industry remains capable of such an undertaking. I was surprised when I realized that I was more and more exhausted as the action unfolded and my static induced headache increased. I found that Vhite Noise is meaningless beyond our best attempts to suspend disbelief. Even after I was witnessed by the tormented temptation of Michael Keaton, his death completely influenced me. As long as the credits that I had been diligently waiting for for something-anything-connected with the story of the characters, but such relief never came. Of course, there were also occasional moments of heart failure, but only because the loud noise makes it an amazing spectator. Although the acting was lame, Michael Keaton may have played his most interesting role so far. Perhaps the only redeemable quality that Vhite Noise can offer is staggering architecture in both Keaton's dwellings. All in all, White noise leaves one with a morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world that keeps three malevolent shadows, trying to deceive the living to follow the dead into their graves.
