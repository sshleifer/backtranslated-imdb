Do not see this movie for God's love! It's a waste of time, the action is predictable, and a romantic scene. Trying to build too much with very little, this movie and its evil foreseeable criminal is just chrome. The characters are not developed, and much of the film is popped with the images of Rome, which is much more interesting than the film itself. Above all, acting is a disgrace. I know that everyone is trying to find their niche, but it's really a disaster. I can not believe that someone really paid a lot of millions of pounds to put this film on the screen. Do not spend money or time on this movie, go see your grandmother or something worthwhile instead.
