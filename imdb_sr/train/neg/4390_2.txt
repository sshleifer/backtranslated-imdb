The TV guide described the complicated SEVERED TIES as: "The cut-off experiment goes wrong" so I immediately thought it would be about a hand that has its own mind as seen in BEAST WITH PET RINGS or HANDS or someone who's hand-over as in parts of the body. Both rooms were tested and tested, or more accurately tired and tested, so I was curious that manufacturers would approach stories. In fact, I thought they were making an art art film like PI to using a black and white photo at the beginning of the film, but it seemed that the producers were tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make the comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD. Very little to say about it, except that I did not like ZLO DEAD movies and I did not like SEVERED TIES and it seems to me really unfair that films like this use an obscene amount of rubber when a third world cries for condoms
