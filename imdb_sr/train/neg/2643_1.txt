This is because of the lack of a better term, the film is bad. Where to start ...... Cinemaphotographi - This is, perhaps, the worst I've ever seen this year. It looked as if the camera had been thrown from the camera to the man. Maybe they only had one camera. It gives you the feeling that you are volleyball. There is a bunch of scenes, accidentally, thrown without any continuity. When they were working on a "split screen", it was absurd. Everything was tight, it looked funny. Tone colors were far away. These people should learn how to balance the camera. This 'movie' is badly made and poorly executed. Complication - You must be kidding. If I were a SS agent, I would have sued the manufacturers. He looked like Marx brothers with radio and pistols. Sutherland was in his '24' mode - I can see it for free. Eva Longoria would be better with a little less, and more. She was not much like a bimbo for action. I could not see the real plot, except Douglas who wanted the president's wife. I never said why mercenaries tried to kill the press. I simply can not see the president of the United States living his life in tunnels in the building, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-s-e. Hollivood is dead. This film is proof. I like the big screen. Since I was a kid. A lot more of these films and I will stop. What's the Hollywood thing, he made so many chickens, forgot how to make a real movie? To own a theater, I would start running old movies. The one with real actors, good stories - and good cinematography. This film is a dog. Do not waste time and money on it. I evaluate this 'movie' zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can watch his years longer, but his only big part is the weak guy who can do it.
