How come I have never seen or heard about this film about garbage before? On my alley is a damn teenquill, a funny complicating and irresistible atmosphere of cheese from the 80's hanging around it. For some reason nobody really is interested, the staff and students of the elite Catholic university have been scolded by an unknown psychopath. A freshly recruited teacher, Julie Parker, became involved when all the people she contacted either appeared dead or behaved strangely. This movie is hilariously bad! There is absolutely no logic or coherence, and each character is equally insignificant for others. For example, a girl was killed and her body thrown into a container. Then, for no reason, the story moves abruptly in three weeks, and the killed girl is never mentioned or even missed. Not even her boyfriend! The act is poor and there is not even a nudity to enjoy. The discovery of the killer is pretty funny, because it seemed that the creators were convinced that it was the original craft ... No, guys! "Splatter University" is easily one of the worst horror-turkeys ever.
