Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is completely and completely rude, rude, rude and crazy. This is truly the only way to describe this horrible, trashy piece of stand-up. Eddie Murphy goes into shock, not laughing trying to win. Helps to occasionally be ridiculous, but mostly loses complications with rude language and rude sexual jokes. Unless you do not like Eddie's violation. I do not think I'm going to bother with "Eddie Murphy Rav". I like Eddie much more in the movie scenario. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
