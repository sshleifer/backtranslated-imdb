.... because if I did, maybe I wanted to crucify me on a wooden cross! I am still trying to determine the plot of this film - and I am "generous" that it was even complicated. As already mentioned, it is wrong on the cover of the DVD that Richard Dreifuss is actually a star. He was hardly in the movie. And if he was really "frustrated" because the back side indicated that, well, that's probably because he said YES to be in this film disaster and can not get out of it! It seemed that the film focused on Jared Martin and that his role in the film, in addition to extreme close circles, was not so mysterious that actually was the role of Gene Barry - or not. And when we talk about "great" ... whoever had a smart idea to fit Gene Barry into the clothes of Humpty Dumpti, which showed his trousers, literally pulled to his chin, he should be condemned to severe moments watching this film stoned. I could go further and further on how this film was terrible, from a dialogue that did not fit the "acting" mouth (I mean Clutch Cargo) to the unusual jumping from the scene to the scene (again, generously, even when we called the picture frames "scenes "), for a lack of action .... However, if you are in a bad genre in the early 70's and if you are in a Michigan cottage with nothing but this film and box with small and feline pictures, we recommend you have a good bottle of wine before you go into this strange driving of the movie, because you will be grateful that you may not recall the next day!
