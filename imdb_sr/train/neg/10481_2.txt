The film is poorly poured, except for some of the famous Hollywood names. Other performances of unknown names (ie Jennifer Gabrielle) are unkind. I saw other films of this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. Perhaps this is a reflection of the script? In a positive tone, the appearance of Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita saved the film from oblivion. Still, I enjoyed Pat in Karate Kid. There are many good watching films, and in short, this one is not one of them. Save money and celluloid. Jason Vanness
