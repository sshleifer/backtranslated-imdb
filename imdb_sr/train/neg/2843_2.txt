Oh yeah, Sakura Killers is a stupid, horrible ninja movie, not a mistake. But it's also incredibly pleasant. This is largely due to the great presence of a Chuck Connors, who has been rewarded as an actor in the film, but really only shines in several scenes. I suppose he should be the guy of Obi Van Kenobi ("Solid ninja-buster," he shouts a copy of the box), but his "wisdom" is ridiculous. "Go without thinking" ??? My friend says this is a sign of mental retardation, not the biggest concentration. But really, his two assistants, Sonny and Dennis, have such a terrible dialogue that "Brooklin", as we call it Colonel, has a tendency to shine in comparison. Take special care of Denis's logic about the 'genetic link' that Sakura is involved with. If you know anything about cloning, you will die of laughter. And yes, this is the main plot, people. Terrible fun movie, Sakura Killers is hard to find a gem. I will not spoil the 'trick' finish, except that it's the perfect set for Sakura Killers 2. It's a pity that Chuck Connors died. :-( Because he has the stupid ways of blowing ninjas.
