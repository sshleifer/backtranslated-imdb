This story is about a romantic triangle between the legs. An African male prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waiter who does not speak French and never shaves. As a film it's boring, nasty and depressing, recorded or foggy, cloudy winter days or in poorly lit interiors, where everyone is bathed in a strange blue light. And yes, I know, it's because it's a white balance. They are all pale and depressed and look exhausted, dirty and dirty. The bodies are bony and shot in such a close circle that they look rather ugly and unassuming. Moles, greasy hair. Iuk. Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time or naked or sex. A story? Well, Stephanie's mother dies. All three characters return to Stephanie in their home village, where through a bunch of memories of a deserted village and a predictably dark interior, we see little Stephanie in childhood as a boy called Pierre. Mother dies. Well ... and that's all, really. The development of character is minimized, as well as the breakdown of the story. I suppose the story is not linear (this would explain many non-securitures), but really, after I paid seven euros, I do not want to build the film myself: that's what the director takes my money. Expect from me to get involved in the process of telling the story and to close my hands, so to speak, I ask too. This film is a bunch of pretentious garbage made, above all, from the desire to epater les bourgeois (i.e., shocking directions). I see how it was for a film festival in Berlin, and I see why he did not arrive.
