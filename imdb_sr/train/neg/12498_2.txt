This movie has a really good story. The work of men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the north of the Pacific, is a thing of the hero and legend. This film reveals a good story with three ends (no satisfaction), a few unnecessary and meaningless battles and two alleged "romantic" connections that have as many sparks as dead campfire. The rescue scenes are great - even if the generation of the computer is hockey and scenarios are quite unreal - but the background is limp and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his playing hand (watch out for her). Ashton Kutcher is straight but not terrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best female is one of the coastguard's sailors in the rescue center and she's on the camera for about two minutes in the whole movie. It could have been a great movie - and Costner needed it!
