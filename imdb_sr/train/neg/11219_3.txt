This was a film about unbelief and revenge. A blizzard with "twins" feels something is wrong with her sister. This film lasted forever to determine the action. Action that has been done many times. The acting was mostly bad. When the action is merged, the film ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with a violent father. It seems that the father favors Ashley, so Laura gets the blame for everything. It is promised that girls will never be separated, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job at a restaurant where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course this can not come from this very well. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a bad excuse to find him. I waited for this film to be repaired and some sort of resolution would happen somewhere, but that never happened.
