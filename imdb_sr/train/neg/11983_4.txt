Marie Dressler wears this drama about the time of depression about the kind owner of the bank, which was recently broadcast on TCM during the month of comedy in April. If you come with expectations of great laughter with the kindness of the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you will be disappointed, because this is really a very inexperienced movie. It's also very badly made, surprising, since it came from MGM. Leonardo Smith's naked bone filming is strictly from 'setting up the camera and not moving it' to school, often at the cost of the actors, which are delivered off the screen (it's like a pan and scans the press before it exists!) Or cut off heads. The film does not even have a deserving director, who emphasizes the obvious nature of production. All in all, it's an unsatisfactory mess, with Dressler often feeling overly emotional and only that bizarre, the final reel to the bathroom separates him.
