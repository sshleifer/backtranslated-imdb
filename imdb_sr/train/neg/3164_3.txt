Unwanted Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of the angel (without wings) falls on her from the back of the truck and kills her. She then tries to destroy her ex-boyfriend's relationship with her new girlfriend, a psychic she can see. An obvious non-original film would not be bad in clich√© sense, except that Lorgor's character is faint and disgusting, which takes away all the fun of the movie. It's like your ears are cleaned with abrasive paper. To be honest, Longoria, or anyone else in the acting team, is not a problem, it's his terrible scenario that goes through the process. It's really really stupid.
