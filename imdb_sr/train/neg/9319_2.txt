I do not know what you're talking about, the first time I watched this movie with two of my friends, we could not stop crying. This is one of the funniest shit I've ever seen. This comment on porn is so correct though hahahaha. Yes, this film is actually worse, but it has caused tears in my eyes for fake characters, bad dialogue and acting. Not to mention the expensive cameras they were shooting?! It looks like one of those movies from my drivers. the class. The requisites seem to have come out of the drama of high school. Music sounds like it's from the original Nintendo system game. The only thing that even approached the fear of this movie was that it had a killer clown who, who did not crawl out of the thick, lurking clowns? if somebody ever watched this, however, they must pay attention to actor's mistakes of actors such as word lips and some of their facial expressions. Hahahaha I died alone. SUSAN
