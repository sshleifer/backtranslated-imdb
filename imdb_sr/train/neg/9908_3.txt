I gave these 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open and left unexplained, and because of the disgusting scenes of someone who eats in an extremely disgusting way, plus scenes of a rotten rot. None of the above should have been shown in such a graphical way. The film's action, such as it, refers to three loosely-connected stories, none of which has been completed satisfactorily. Head hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is a character that connects all three vignettes. First we have Dylan McDermott, who looks bloody fine, as a wanted criminal escapes to Mexico to escape both from the law and from the head hunter, as he drives through the border town and sees the sad girl in the salon she plays Helen Hunt. Then we have one of Hemingway's girls, not sure which one of them, playing a Western woman on a lonely border that goes over to see about a neighbor's wife, an attractive redhead, which we soon realize is in the wrong end too long. The film's conclusion returns to the bounty hunter and what is happening to him, while the final scene in the film is completely beyond rational understanding.
