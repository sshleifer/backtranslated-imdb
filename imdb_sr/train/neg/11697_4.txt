I am not one of those who think that the king is a great writer, his books are great disturbances for several hours, and they often have interesting rooms, although, in my opinion, they break up very quickly if they give them a serious thought. Br /> This film suffers from having quite accurately re-examined King's story. If you read the book, there is no surprise, no change, no scene or character change. This is a movie made by King's fans for King's fans. For the rest of us, there is nothing horrible in the film, it's the horror of the "gypsy curse", with its curse being something that many people want to become thinner. The last third has some serious structural problems, and it seems that a little forced ending violates the rules of this genre. There are also worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but maybe you too. read the book, because there is nothing new here ... <br />
