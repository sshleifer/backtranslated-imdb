There is much good that can be said about this caricature; The backgrounds are rich, colorfully colored and full of fine art deco details. The animation is in line with the usual studio standards of that time, which are undoubtedly higher than today's. However, I think it's boring for a number of reasons. The Music: Definitely not in line with Scott Bradley's standard standards. Though it probably should evoke the setting of "Great Gatsby," it ends up as gloomy, sleepy, repetitive, and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous are not the same as Beethoven's 5th Symphony). Since most people (including me) tend to close their eyes when they are yelling, there is a lot of visual part of a cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer. Story: I'm not giving any secrets that are not already in the summary of the action - the land of good, the city is bad. This is a common theme in movies, animated and alive, from this era. It is a false nostalgia for a non-existent rural idyll, which is now reflected in a similar nostalgia for "values" that were never.
