Mike Havthorne (Gordon Currie) is a witness to the brutal murder of his mother and the suicide of his father Morty (Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of friends in the hut of his family in a forest at a Halloween party. While playing a game where guests confess and confront their worst fears ... Mike tries to summon the soul of his late father. Soon it was discovered that Morty's spirit inhabits a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue revives and begins bloodshed. Most F / K's are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme. The story of getting up was poorly done. Cast actors include: Kelli Benson, Phillip Rhis, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Biron Chief-Moon and veteran Betsi Palmer.
