Well, my God, am I disappointed? When I first heard the remake of Robert Vise from the 1963 film The Haunting, I was afraid it would be destroyed by a variety of visual effects of the size of summer films. But deep down, I had faith. Surely, with such a talented actor ... De Bont and the company will not destroy the film, whose original was a fantastic and terrifying film that understood the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now !! ?? My fears turned out ... a promising film was wrong. Yes, the production design of Eugenio Zannetti was dropped; the film is beautifully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never make a mistake. But the scenario puts the fine actors in the test ... asking them to deliver the kind of dialogue that is spoken only in movies. In the end, always beautiful Lily Tailor is the only artist who escaped with some dignity ... and that's hardly enough. But the crime of all crimes is that horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imagination to feel the terrible fear of the fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to show us what we should be afraid of ... and you know what? As it is miraculously understood as ... visual effects appear as some kind of nonsense. And the climax is a phantasmagoric mess ... but things have been wrong before long. Everything in Haunting is over-inflated. I'm afraid there's no real excitement or screaming in this old ruffian house ... just the crap. Instead, look at the original. <br /> <br />
