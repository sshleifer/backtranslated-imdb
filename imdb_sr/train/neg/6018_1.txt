It is sad for me that Christians (and I am one) feel that we have to make films such as "Left Behind". We have a lot of better stories to say that they do not have to be so careful. I was very disappointed with this film. As an ambitious filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this film as a perfect example of what I will not do with my career in the movie.
