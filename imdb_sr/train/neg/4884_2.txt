Criminal Insane 2 is included in the new DVD of Satan's Black Wedding / Criminal Madness, and this is a good thing, because when I watched a movie and I know that there is a continuation (especially something that is so obscure) I am always curious. Now my curiosity was pleased and I will never see this again. Most CI2 is nothing more than a "flashback" for CI, and Ethel's videos fall asleep, remembering beautiful memories, I suppose. Thanks to the proposal 13, she was released from the state of Napa (she wondered if she saw the Crampa game while she was there?) She sent her to the house halfway by a beautiful old lady whom Ethel immediately called to call "grandma". Everything is recorded with a video camera so that the image and sound are quite pathetic, so it is even complete with several "rolls". Of course, Ethel does her thing, which is to send someone between her and the food, especially the one who witnesses one of her disorders and extort her dessert. Also, you have to ask about any house halfway for killers who have a large drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and a rat poison under the sink. I guess it's all a matter of wrong "trust." If you love or do not like criminal madness, however, there is no good reason to look at this except from curiosity. You wonder why the manufacturers have even tried it. 2 of 10
