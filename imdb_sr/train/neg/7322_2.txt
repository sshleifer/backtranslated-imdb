I will be credited to where a credit is credited, and say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as an actress who drinks and does what she wants. She is dull, drunk, stubborn and very sexy; much better than this film deserves. But it's IT. This boring film about uncertainty is a fragmented confusion, trying to turn it into a thriller thriller, a thriller, a story of loyalty and betrayal, and a pair of erotic thrillers. The movie, my friends, is not even the least exciting. For example, who thought to throw C. Thomas Hovell as a desirable leading man? He is not ugly, but because he cried loudly, it seems that Fiorentin's hardcore Goddess is dealing with a teacher at a kindergarten. Hovell has neither the authority nor the presence of the screen to fulfill the main role of man. The scenario is by far the worst aspect of the film. There is no tension as Fiorentin's character gets spooky phone calls, there is no mystery about her guilt in the killings that are in the focus of the movie, there is no sense of liberation while Fiorentino gets hollow Hovell to lose his barriers. Look for the interesting but poorly derived cameo, Adam Ant and Issac Haies, and one really, really good sex scene between Hovell and Fiorentina. Besides, my first incentive would be to put this poor piece of garbage and rent something else.
