If this film is meant to discourage people from using drugs, it does not work. I was ready to start using them. I waited for something to happen and nothing had ever happened. This film is neither a horror nor a drama. It's just a paranoid user of the target. This film can win an award for using the word "F" so many times and so useless. It was not well said, but I felt like Metha replaced the Metha that they owe to somebody. Hector became even worse and more paranoid when the film continued, and the girl became even hopeless. The end really made sense. The film did not make any sense if it did not show just how boring it was to get stuck in the house in the middle of the night with a meth-head. I rely on other feedback when I decided to watch this movie, and the rating on this movie should be a significantly lower average.
