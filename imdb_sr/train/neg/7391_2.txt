Like most fans of Steven Seag, I know that I do not expect a masterpiece every time I shoot a movie, but I expect the movie at least to have a sorting budget. The main problem with the copy I was watching was a terrible breakdown of duplication. I know that in some films this has to be done and I accept it, but when they overdub with completely different voices of actors and continue to do this through a movie, it requires the magic of the archdiocese. Likewise, it seems that the sets are made without any worries, because in one scene a sliding glass plate in a top secret laboratory has a massive crack that passes through it. I was really disappointed with this film, and I only hope that the next Stevens project will be completed before sending a movie to buy / rent. The story about this film asked me whether I'm watching a movie from a science fiction movie or not, some parts look like aliens, but they never fully explained what's going on and I find it very confusing.
