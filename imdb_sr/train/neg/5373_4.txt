This is a classic example of an increasing film problem. Why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue? What's the point? This film is not alone. It seems that most films do so now. For 2 years, I wondered if it was something that was wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV and there it was again. BACKGROUND of the noise that could happen to the city block behind the actors pushes the dialogue. In the film, it was even more confusing, because in the English version of women constantly murmur. I continued to hope that Jean Reno would say, "Excuse me, will you speak or draw balls from your mouth." If you watch it on DVD and you even have a high school French, I recommend a French version with subtitles. I give 4 because Reno was so good at Leon. People were crazy about landscapes, but I saw it on TV. I lived in Rockies for several years, so "Enh".
