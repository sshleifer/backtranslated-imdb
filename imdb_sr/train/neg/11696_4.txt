I began to watch this low-expecting movie, actually I noticed it only because it was an adaptation of S.K. novel (a novel I never read). I'm glad that my expectations were low, because the movie was not nearly as good, but it manages to interest you. What really attracts this story is the work done by the director and actors. The film is long-lasting, there are no "nice" recordings and no fears, the dialogues are stupid, and special effects are shit. Interested (I suppose the book has to be good) without the use of many horoscopic clich√©s. My vote 4/10.
