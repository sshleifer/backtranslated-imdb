The person who wrote a great review of this wrong project must be related to the writer / director / star - or, in fact, the same person who reflects rational thinking that this film would be appealing to anyone who is not connected to a firmly woven inner circle. What do you say about this? Want to make a movie - tell the story; to entertain; draw me to colorful characters. Of course, you can do it skillfully without falling in with the commercial elements that are designed for mass appeal. However, do not turn to the elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is constantly struggling to understand the scarce narrative threads. If a dreamy psychological thread touches me, then it's easier to buy a concrete fabric.
