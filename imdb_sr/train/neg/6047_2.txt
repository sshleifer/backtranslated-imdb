What made France's connection so good was the connection between Doile (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this disaster directed by Frankenheimer (brought to us by jewels like Raindeer Games and Dr. Moreau's Island), the film focuses on Doile and its unique obsession with capturing Charnier (Reia). The fictitious idea that the NIPD will allow Doyle to travel to Marseille to find Charnier with the help of the French local authorities laughs loudly ridiculously. Correct me if I'm wrong, but did not Charnier skip the city with 65 kilograms of pure smack !!! Street value of 32 million, but yes, send Doile to find this guy, it was his blow. Please!!! The story was bad. The acting was terrible (with the exception of Hackman, who completely outgrew his part). The direction was everywhere. Even the cuts between the scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and follow the first war twice and skip this one.
