As a fan mange and anime Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADI, VIOLENT JACK, etc.), I'm looking forward to this. I did not see any manga or anime, so I had no prejudice to go in. Good thing. What we have here is a series of stupid "softcore" movies that appeared with alarming regularity on cable channels late into the night. Though it's pitiable compared to what is in the head of regular cable viewers (the inexperienced pieces of our hero are either deliciously hidden behind a strategically glued joke or decorated with a funny sunshine effect), there are long scenes of tying and torturing to borrow procedures with enough hatred to make it made unsuitable for children. Although I have nothing against naked female heroes, I do not like amateur recorded films (there are at least four in this series). With the plus side, in each of the four episodes I've seen, there's at least one incredibly beautiful actress. No wonder the Nagai TESTICLE BOI never succeeded ...
