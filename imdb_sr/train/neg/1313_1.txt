Do not try to watch this terrible mini-series. It's a six-wise, incredible love triangle between three people who do not have absolutely no chemistry one after the other. There is no warmth in this story, no true passion, no real romance. It's dry, boring, drawn, and non-violent. And it does not meet the expected level of technical expertise. Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more valuable.
