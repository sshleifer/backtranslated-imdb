Women's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive. A cheating spouse wants to be dead and decides to make good use of his phobia by placing it in a suitcase and leaving it in the basement. The only reason to see this amateur film about the garbage is Michael Berriman in a really small sting and two scenes of sex with Delio Sheppard. And for the last twenty minutes Brinke's bloody rampage is pretty fun to watch. The cut head is really terrible. Better watch "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course, I do not expect classical fun from Fred Olen Rai, but "Haunting Fear" is too boring to be comfortable.
