Seriously, what is this? Hooper made classic movies such as Tekas Chainsav Massacre, and then made this horrible movie, what happened? Did he get too much into the cracks? This movie is about a guy named Sam who has the ability to burn things, (Firestarter, anyone?) The act was divine, the plot was garbage, and the special effects were extremely stupid, they looked like something in the '70s. Van Damme should be pleased that Derailed is no longer the worst movie ever, and what about the ending? he started to shine blue, turned into a bright blue ball, sucked his girls' fire and the film ended. WHAT WAS THAT? HUH? when the film was over, I hoped the DVD would burn spontaneously to save me from pain. EXCLUDING FROM THIS FILM. DO NOT THINK THEN LATER.
