As a fan-horror film, I'm trying to look at all the important novelties of this genre, especially those that are the products of my own domestic film. And I can say that "The Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as a Russian title) is one of the poorest films among them. First, it can not be scary for a young child, so slow and so predictable that there is no room for real horror. Frankly, it's bad at all points: from stupid complications (I do not know why Russian producers / directors decided to turn the classic story of Ukrainian return into a chrome and funny modern American thriller. The previous reviewer does not excite it) and the dreadful and stupid acting Work. All actors, including leading Valeri Nikolaiev and Jevgeniia Kriukova, who are fairly well-known in Russia, resemble wooden dolls or something similar, and I do not seem to be trying to play at all, they just spoke their English lines without any expression. And finally I do not understand why they made this film in English with Russian actors? I think it was their wrong turn. At least they could play some American or English actors for leading parts to make them more convincing. I can also say the same for the so-called "small American urban backgrounds" that were shot in Estonia and look like this. The only positive moment I found in the "Power of Fear" are visual effects. They're not great, but pretty good for the Russian movie. And the music is fine, at least it does not irritate me. That's why I give him two stars. All in all, if you want to see a good horror movie? Do not waste time and money on this boring movie. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror, I advise you to find a copy of "Vii or the Spirit of Evil". It's a really great movie based on the same novel as "Power of Fear", but much, much better.
