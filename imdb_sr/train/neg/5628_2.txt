I am not an artist-prone individual. I am a science-feminine woman, and I felt that this movie might be one of those camp-based art films in the budget. I've been watching this with my fiancé and my future daughter. We tried to find something in this movie to keep our interest. My fiancé and his daughter voted for it and we switched to Oceans 13, but that's another story. Not to turn back, I woke up the next morning and gave the film another shot. I started to seriously watch this movie again. I just do not understand, I thought I would get it. I thought that the funniest part was the wash of ash and urn that found the place near the fireplace, which was used as a vase for what seemed to be a dead flower. Interesting and there were still dead things inside. It was a strange and bizarre movie. Maybe that's what they asked for, but I will not be deceived the other way!
