This film was disgusting. Theirs should be a warning that a sadistic tyranny writer is trying to make a name for himself before he is held hostage for an hour and a half watching the trash. What is trash? Abuse of people's time, energy abuse and the scatter of any educational system that has taught her how to read and write. Talia, you're a sick, crazy loser. Your psychiatrist must override stronger drugs for your problem. Playing and plotting did not give me a choice but to move quickly through the middle of the garbage. I ended up on a scene that was undesirable. If you want to learn how to shock, people watch Larry Clark's movie. I have lost any respect for the entire composition of this film "no more support from me." How can actors or actors sit on a set while such rough images of human behavior manifest themselves from the mind of a psyche? I'm sorry for all the actors who participated in that scene. I think the devil now knows who the writer of this film is; Congratulations on winning your attention.
