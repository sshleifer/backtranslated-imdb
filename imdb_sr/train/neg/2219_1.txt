Perhaps one of the most appreciated so-called horror classic ever made, Halloween has incredible Michael Miers and some great actress Jamie Lee Curtis. there is an inexorable amount of time spent on the dullness / culmination of actual events. This is a type of film from which you can go to the popcorn for a microwave oven and do not miss anything. How it produced so many extensions, I will never understand. Thank God, Rob Zombie is transforming it. And in general, I hate remake. It will surely more than compensate for all the random gaps in meeting time with some strange points of interest that the original really misses. This is a movie that we think we should love, just like the way we are taught that we should enjoy Dickens. Do not assume this is a classic.
