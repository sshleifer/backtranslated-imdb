I do not think they shot this movie. Totally unnecessary. The first movie was fine. But there was no need for a sequel, certainly not after the television series that was already the sequel to the first movie. This movie feels like a soap opera. Writing is so bad, completely simple. Jokes do not meet, the acting is straight, it is shot like soap, it has no direction. The first film had a good emotional spine behind it. Each character had a small bow. It was then very simple, but somehow it succeeded and I could see the merits of that movie. But this time there is no cohesive story. The characters are boring stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: The Brazilian boy playing Akela Daeseleire's son is pretty good. It was their moment of creative success on this film. I heard that they have already shot another television series as a continuation of 'Team Spirit 2', but please, God, do not give them a third story ...
