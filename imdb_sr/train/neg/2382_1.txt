There are films such as Plan 9 that are so bad to have charm about them; there are some like "Watervorld" who have the same inexplicable drawing as a car accident, and there are some like "Desperate Life" that you hate to Recognize to Love. Covgirls do not have any of these purchases. The cast actors have enough talent to be able to watch almost every action, and from what I've been told, the book is pleasant. How then can this movie be so intolerable bad? To begin with, it seems that the director has gathered actors of the name without any other connection than would bring 20 things. Then tell them to do the best they can to Kevin Costner's imitation. Open the book randomly and start recording everything on the page, taking care that the vast expanses of America are in any way interesting. In the end, give the job a job for your coworker, because the meat packing factory just put it off. He has twenty years of cutting experience. This film now defines my cellar. It's so bad, it's not good for bad.
