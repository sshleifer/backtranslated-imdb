This is a copy of Doris Classics from 1948, a romantic on the open sea. The story is more or less the same, but it is contemporary. Govinda plays a sharply clever man who on his way replaces his husband. While Rani is a friend of a college woman who does her the same service. They are allegedly trying to get caught as husband and wife try to travel to Bombai. On the way, Govinda greets another girl for a dreamy woman and spies her while in love with Ra≈æin is thrilled. Leverage plays the dual role of father and son and attorneys who specialize in divorce. They are against each other for the infected couple. It's a bad attempt to copy original classics, and the songs are pretty scary. The comedy is a joke and it will not make us laugh too much.
