Presented in Australia as 'Hydrosphere', this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you hypnotize it and watch it all the way, just to see if it could get worse ... and that's happening! The story is so predictable that it looks like it was written by a high school drama class, the sets are pathetic, but slightly better than the miniatures, and the action is wooden. from the cabinet for the 'Total Recall' equipment. There seems to be no original idea throughout the movie. I thought this film was so bad that I laughed the most. Malcolm McDovell should shame his head. Obviously he needed money!
