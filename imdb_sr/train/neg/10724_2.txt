this is the perfect example of a great departing terribly bad ... so, can I advise someone to watch it? Well, I was kind of obliged by the fact that it was in the tiff competition (I still can not believe he won) .. and I remained only to the end because the director was there for the k & a part .. but that's also nothing Interesting ... what is it about? so the first half (worth watching) is three characters: a whore, a musician and some kind of official .. the first two are lying about their professions ... but the third is a real liar ... the other half (do something otherwise ... I will not ruin the good evening) Includes some old breasts and heavy drinks ... but you may see it is completely different ... jury typha (did they drink vodka?)
