I just saw this movie (mostly because it's Brady Corbet), and I must say that I was not satisfied. Of course, computer graphics was amazing, but the story needed a bit of touch. Also, I think this film would do much better with more curses and blood, and that it was rated PG-13. It would definitely attract more people to see it -> teenagers. What also attracted more teens (especially teenagers) would be much closer to Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! Although the film had a weak spot, I still saw it and thought it was ok!
