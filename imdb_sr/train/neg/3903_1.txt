Emma is my favorite novel by Jane Austin - Emma is well-intentioned despite her flaws, so readers can forgive and love, as well as the relationship she has with Mr. romantic ekcitement. Mr. Knightley is the perfect man, and Emma is closest to what you could get at that time an independent, smart, confident woman - remember, she's only 21 years old and she's surely matured and grew out of her faults. Who does not want to be Emma? Who does not want to tell him, Mr. Knightley? This version of Emma does not give you any meaning for the things I love with Emma. I could not even finish watching, I just found it so scary. I could not see that warm, generous side of Emma, ​​which tells the reader that she loves: the patience and warmth she shows to her father; the closeness between her and Mrs. Weston, which shows her readiness to put her friend's happiness above her (because she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by passing the marriage of Miss Tailors). Карактер г. Voodhouse in this adaptation looks just bizarre, and not just strange, older and somewhat trying. This adaptation most importantly fails to revive the relationship between Mr. Knightley and Emma. Their relationship is built on mutual respect and devotion: Mr. Knightlei is lenient to Emma's minor mistakes that believe that her intelligence and genuine concern for others will never allow her to go terribly; and Emma looks at him, although he hides hiding this and continues to use his own court. The dress that gives her at the very beginning of the performance completely exaggerates the argument between them, and destroys all possibilities to show the nature of their relationship as I described above. Mr. Knightley is also insufficiently attracted to revive sexual tension between the leader (or cause any admiration of viewers). Really awesome. I can not understand why everyone who really likes the novel Emma likes it, unless it miraculously redeems after I turned it off.
