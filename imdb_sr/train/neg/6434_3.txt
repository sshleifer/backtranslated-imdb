I'm always surprised how different people are and how you get both extremes for almost every movie. People who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst. Stigmata would not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's up there. First sound. The producers spent more time on the soundtrack than on the installation. It was so loud when music was playing, and nobody spoke, and when Patricus spoke in a monotone voice, she could hardly be heard. I usually love Patric and Gaberial, but both are both in this movie. Patricia basically had 3 emotions. Silence, in great pain, or really angry has a stigma. The former was dominant, the other involved screaming pain, the third involved raising her voice. It was a volume that shook three, not emotions. Perhaps I missed a lot of deep meanings and subheadings that everyone was talking about, or I might have been hindered by terrible shooting and MTV style. When you watch a video for 3 minutes, you need quick cutting and slow motion to transfer a fast story, in a two-hour movie, it's troublesome. I do not see what it means to see women over steet and throw a child. And no Pittsburgh is raining so often! I think maybe it was intended for the right story, with something that could be said, but all the budget was spent on buying music and equipment for slow rain. fired a bullet and rented this magnificent apartment in which Mrs. Arkuett lived and eventually fired a guy with a story.
