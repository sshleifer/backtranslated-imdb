The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best Horror films of all time. This is the worst. When I sat down to watch this, I actually thought it was bad fourth and fifth, it should have been good after the previous terrible. I made a mistake. Incredibly wrong. When I watched the first ten minutes, in fact I was tempted to exclude it, but I thought that no, it might be improved. That's not. Not only that it was just a horrible movie by itself, he did not need any further extension, because the last two (fourth and fifth) already were terrible enough! Also, how many times can you return Freddy !? The act in it was TERRIBLE, the story was predictable and shit, and she also had flaws in her. The way Springwood was made was completely wrong. He does not respect the first one. To add to this, the whole thing seemed to be incredible. Some people say this film was "funny". This movie is not "funny" at all. Since when was Freddy Krueger supposed to be "ridiculous"? I'd call it funny. This film should be a film about horrors, not comedies. If Freddie had a daughter, would not it look like the first one? The end was stupid and stupid, just like the rest. This completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the former. It just shows up. Such a disadvantage that Ves Craven created something so good at the beginning, but still has to retreat because of this garbage belonging to the bin. They should not even try to make this movie. There are no other items other than the third one. The third is only decent from all the sequels. If this was a DVD itself and not a part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD I got, I would throw it out when I got it. Summary: A pathetic and bad attempt to continue. - The complete package of the first movie So, please, do not waste your time on this worthless garbage.
