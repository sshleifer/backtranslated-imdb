I thought the movie was good in parts. The start was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the film were good. Camera corners in the first 30 minutes were strange and I did not like it because they did not cover the actors completely. I think the last 25 minutes of the movie was not so great that we expect a lot in the case of such films. Dialogue did not make sense and I do not think they were very witty. I felt like trying to copy movies as a telephone cabinet in terms of dialogue, but they desperately failed. they placed it for it and did not make any sense for the story. Full movie has only the law and the right. I do not think it was a waste of time, its OK movie, but no gr8
