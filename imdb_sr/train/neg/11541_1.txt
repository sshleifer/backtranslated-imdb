This film is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It is surprising that brilliant actors, as the two main characters in this film, have agreed to act in such a worthless peace of rubbish. The film is a genre of rape / beating and revenge. The couple went to the party and on the return they hit the deer and he went to finish it when a jeep filled with bad guys came. He did not go to their car, but shot him and beat him while trying to start the car of the car that betrayed her, and she was raped. Then it was somehow in the father's house and one of the bad guys that the neighbor took the shotgun and wanted to kill him ... Such a stupid scenario! Bell's Hollivood! He was against that vengeance, but "She was raped," "She laughs", so she has to kill them all ... But once in the house she was satisfied with pushing a gun in the anus of bad guys and went as she went crazy and executed bad guy. Personally I think the director has run out of money before he finishes this because the film ends before he executes anyone involved in this rape and beating that is not a big surprise because the sponsor obviously saw this and wanted to recover the money. This film is not for people who enjoy watching rape because they will not see anything they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... It's for harassment that this peace of mind is made by British cinema. I personally love it and that's why I watched this. Do not do it yourself, you have better things for watching a stupid scenario ...
