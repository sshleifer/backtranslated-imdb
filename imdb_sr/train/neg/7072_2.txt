My address just sums up this bunch of shit. I should have hinted when I saw a film about Fred Olen Rai - but I thought, 'Hey, maybe it's better than his usual boyfriend,' I was wrong! This must be the worst movie ever to be directed at children. The acting was terrible, humor did not exist, the Directorate was the worst I ever saw & Special Effects would not look unintelligible on Disney's 1950s movie. WHAT IS DEE-VALLACE STONE EVER! Which used to have such a promising career in the '80s. Film veteran and former actor Russ Tamblin was a terribly bad guy and the budget was so low that he was completely incredible even as a movie for children. I did not see video sequel made in 1999 and I do not intend to do it If you want a good movie for children Watch 'HONEY AND SHRUNK / BLEV UP THE KIDS' OR DISCOUNTS MOVIE MI RATING AS 19 IO: - 2/10 RATING KID KID: - 3/10 ON THE BEST!
