Martin Veisz, who directed a solid "Rohtenburg", will take the heat with Ves Craven for another ruined "The Hills Have Eyes 2". Remembering the legendary original, which boasted an incredible story and a dog that has a flashback, will be forever deleted by this technically smoother remake (only in name). A crowd of national guards (and women) are sent to a research area in the desert, surrounded by hills filled with mutants. One by one soldiers were elected. That's it. There is some rough violence and a rather brutal scene of rape, but there is still much to excite. Film "heroes" are a common bunch of clich√©s and mutants, far from Craven's original "family," mostly resembling Brian Thompson from "Cobra" along with some creatures left by Stan Winton from "Vrong Turn". A large part of the action takes place in the caves, ala "Descent", and it was recorded by Sam McCurdi. A funny aspect is the addition of Vesa and Jonathan Craven to a cute mutant that sings around its cave like Leatherface in Hooper's original "motor tester". Veisz will be blamed for this boring debacle, but he is not at fault because he does everything in his power to maintain uncertainty and exhale freshness from fictitious situations. Unfortunately, he is not a fan.
