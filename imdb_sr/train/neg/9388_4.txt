The former private guard who turned, throws out his latest job and is immediately offered the opportunity to return to his previous profession. His mission: to follow the mysterious French woman who recently arrived in California ... and obviously she was looking for a racket. An unsuccessful attempt to update a movie genre noir, without enough bite or wit (or inclusion of the dynamics of the action) in the script. The director and co-writer Paul Magvood (who later claimed that the image was edited without his involvement) does not give the impression that he highly valued films from the forties from which Chandler emerged; his nostalgia is appropriately crushed, but also bitter-colored and somewhat indifferent. Handling is an unusual, complimentary low key, and Varren Oates is well presented as a variant of the '70s' on the 'private dick' archetype, but the film has no picture. It's nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Graham in the acting team - although none of them have much work to do, and Caron's cold-cool racing character in all this irritates. The colorful cinema of Alan Stenswold, a beautiful location, but it does not make any kind of boiling. * 1/2 of ****
