Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - in connection with Bruce), the killer from the first film, is again dealing with her old tricks. She is one of the advisors in the Rolling Hills Camp. As long as the girls in the camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and curses are all right. But a few steps across the line and Angela kills them - breaking bad jokes all the way to the end. The original "Sleepavai Camp" was a wicked and nasty film that had some good side. This is also evil and nasty, but there are no good points. The plot is done until death and this adds NISHT to the new one in the formula. There are plenty of killing people here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats cut out), but all blood is so obviously false that it actually became comical. This also has the smallest amount of camper I've ever seen and practically everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higins). As expected, there is a free naked woman (provided by a terribly non-talented Valerie Hartman) and a compulsory team for a good girlfriend / good guy (Renne Estevez and Toni Higgins). With the exception of Springstein and Higgins, acting is bad - even by film standards. There is also the cruel sharpness of this film in which one character drowned in the cottage! Boring and sick with a stupid complication, meaningless nudity and bad worse. Skip.
