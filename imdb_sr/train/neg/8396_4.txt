... but I even saw it better. The story here is predictable - the film crew tries to film a horror movie at the scene of the murder. Three guesses about what's going on. This is not a total bomb - the actors are pretty good with the professionals of John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine who give the best performance. It's pretty well made - for a budget with a low budget. Just do not expect any nudity, cursing, blood or blood (the film has a very slight PG rating). I've never been bored - it's okay to watch a calm night. I saw it on the video - it was HORRIBLE print - very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. Still, I did not hate him and it has a cool ending that surprised me - basically nothing has happened until then, so that the guard does not get you. Worth to see, but only if you're a final horror movie.
