I rented this film solely on the basis of the fact that my cover was attractive. However, as soon as the film started, I'm sorry. It seems they used a home video camera to record this movie and let it do a little child. They also used inappropriate spooky faces and shapes to try to scare people, but I smiled, I could put it better than that. As for complications, I felt that they had some really good ideas, but for suspicious lines, and in some cases they were in the shadows. He had no direction. I did not want to sit through all this because it caused me physical pain to watch it, but I always finish what I started, so I took a deep breath and let it continue. Definitely 98 minutes in my life lost. I would rescue the shame to know that you were watching the 'Haunted Boat' and found something that was more fun. I'm a fan of horror films with a low budget, but this was a big disappointment that I thought nothing could get worse after 'Terror Toons', but that made me review it. Lowering your genre. * From ***** (Star is for ideas about the worst fears come)
