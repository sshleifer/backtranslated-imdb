This film is made for TV, so, having in mind, I will not get into it as hard as I would the feature film. The scenario is a sub-pair, but it manages to be mildly humorous in clips, whether it means being or not. The acting is mostly over-the-top, but this is true for many low-budget films. The aspect of this film that I really hated is, however, that 90-95% of it is filmed in the film, but in random places, it will be 5-10 seconds where the video is recorded on the video. You can say that the contrast is smaller, the colors are less alive, and the image is apparently 30 frames per second instead of 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if those scenes were to be filmed later and then they did not have the money to film on the film (I guess that's the reason), but it's disorientative and really makes the movie look lighter. Anyway, I definitely saw worse movies, but I definitely would not say that I enjoy this movie and I can not recommend that anyone see it.
