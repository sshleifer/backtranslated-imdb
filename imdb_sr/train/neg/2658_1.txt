Looking at CBS's "Surrender, Dorothy," I was constantly wondering why Diane Keaton would like to be in it (not because it is a television movie - with the scarcity of roles for some older actresses, it's no wonder why Oscar was awarded performers like Keaton is turning to television - but because Keaton does not provide a shine chance. The sole mother, sorrowing for the sudden death of her twenties daughter, imposed - and gradually became a friend - with a group of young people whose daughter was close at the time of the accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplai gives us a group of characters crossing the street to avoid it. Apart from being rude and vague, these fake people are incredibly incredible, such as a neat scenario and a bungalow near the beach where children are staying (a young man wearing muscle shirts telling us that he is gay, Diane Keaton says, "Give up Dorothy "and he actually asks," It's from the "Wizard of Oz", is not it? "... no, genius, it's from" Citizen Khan "!). Keaton may have wanted to do this material on the basis of the subject of facing death. She tries to turn this extremely inaccessible woman into the shadow of her personality (many unpleasant suits), but she does not look at the good viewer, because Keaton was always warmly sympathetic and flexible in an easy way. Here, she is a crazy harp that does not teach a lot of lessons in her own way of discovering herself (the film quickly forgets the dead young woman and becomes the odor of the mother's nervous wreck, which looks like an overflowing hippy who never lost anyone near her). This is a series of film actors who promote voice shows with a warning: "It should help many grieving mothers there". I can not imagine helping someone because it is essentially lowered, confused and confusing. It's disturbed.
