Slasher flick, made in the early 80's, has a curse on him who has anyone trying to end up pretending to be dead. Years later, a group of filmmakers tried to complete the film - it also revived deadly curse movies. A great idea for the movie, but unfortunately the "Cut" is just another lost opportunity. Unfortunately, Australia did not have the best results in the world when it comes to horror. "Razorback" (1984) was a stupid one like Hollywood III (1987), which was already half American. As for our attack on comedy-horror, it's best to leave 'Bodi Melt' (1993). The problem with the "cut" is that creators are trying to create a smart satire of horror a la 'Scream' (1996), but they do not have an insight into the genre or what makes it successful. And although this sounds weird, I'm talking about a movie slasher, but what the 'Cut' really miss is "heart". Certainly follows the basic "rules" established by "Scream", but does not want to play with the formula, instead it is valid for a cardboard copy earlier. Slayer, Scarman, is probably one of the earliest and most harmful villains in the history of horror films. His infinite barbaric insecurity, lame single liners would make the dialogue of pornography look like Shakespeare. Actors do not always look as if they are fully involved and they seem to just wait for the recording to end in order to pay their checks. And the film's sense is like deliberately trying not to be creepy; looks more like the episode 'Neighbors' or 'Heartbreak High'. Otherwise, those attempts in MTV style, hyper-cinema during the "research" series just look poor, outdated and insane. If Australia ever gets a chance to do the horror again (which I hope we will continue to be) maybe we should take a leaf from the book 'Mad Mak' (1979). Instead of trying to copy the US, we should try to download the genre.
