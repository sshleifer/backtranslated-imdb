I'll start by admitting I'm not a fan of John Ford. (I watched "Informer" just because I'm trying to go through the list of "giants".) So, if it is, just move, because you will not agree with me. /> <br /> What is the overwhelmed and outdated piece of nonsense! I will say that there is a good idea for the film here (it led me to think about how few films about the Irish Revolution), but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under exaggerated and inexpensive sentiment. I suppose it's a bit interesting to watch for a while to see that a transition that is more or less flawless, made from silent words to "talk" - the acting styles of some principals have this excessive quality of endemic early films and movies feel as if they could better play with cover cards than voice dialing. (Of course, the title cards would prevent Ford from repeating every part of the emotions six times.) Which dialogue usually has: "They are always behind me Luckie Charms!" quality worsened by the fact that every actor is permitted to use his own personal version of the Irish accent. Of course, however bad, accents are useful in reminding us that we are in Ireland, because the sets generally look as if they were dragged from a German expressionist piece that is being recorded on the next sound stage. (I feel like I could see some villagers with a lead eye, burning Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) Techniques are changing. Change of taste. So I will not give up on how crazy it seems that this film was so praised in its time. But this is not one of the classic that holds - more just a "just warning" of an exaggerated malaria to which Ford will devote its career.
