Oliver Gruner is completely unknown to me. My friend showed me this film because he saw Gruner in what he called a pretty good sci-fi movie, Nemesis. As we watched this, we found ourselves rapidly progressing through BS drama parts just to get incredible action sequences. Gruner loves to kick and direct play. And kick! Haha Gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in the ghetto near the one in which he grew up. in a Mexican gang that bothered the family. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the boy to kick back (against a gang, too crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damma character who kills everyone (or pretty badly depresses them) and works to free his block of these gangs. Gruner is probably not well known by the choice of scenarios whether this film is all about comparing possible choices. This ghetto is pure hell and I enjoy watching the colorful team of characters go through it as if they have a chance against Gruner's character. Music was a typical action music (huge pianos and timpans, a kidney guitar) which was not really as bad as it sounds. The director really had to keep the action in motion instead of making a break every 5 minutes for a strained family moment. for Oliver Gruner to play, but the overall feeling of the film leaves the desire to close more on what you just saw.
