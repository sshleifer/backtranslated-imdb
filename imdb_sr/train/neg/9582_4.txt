This frustrated piece of faecal matter adds so many pointless scenarios that in the end it is the laugh of the turmoil of absolute joy. It's a shame that the premise is promising (as is often the case in Duhllivood), but in the hands of this screenwriter, he goes to the countryside. Loue is in jail and serves time for the DUI who killed his mistress. We see him having nightmares just to know that he feels really bad about this. Then his neighbor with a cellular colleague hanged himself. Or he? Love has some doubts, but it quickly rejects them. His doubts are so weak that bad guys do not have to worry. Why were they then set to be killed? Ah, this story could be interesting here. It falls from the rails there, and once they get off the rails, it decides to get offensive to the offending spectators, watching the next hour of tension. ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* *** I will not deal with endless counting of the irrationality of what follows, but considering this end. Love was captured by bad guys on the train. They want the tape they have, because that tape will screw up their boss and them. So, three policemen come to the train, drawn weapons, ready to save Love. The bad guys kill the cops, half past the passengers, and then ... they continue to love Love to get the tape. HELLO!!!! To kill 3 policemen in public will bring you to a deep doodle, to hell with a tape. However, they pass through a mall in which it rises, as if the public did not exist as witnesses, and in the end Love was caught and the bad guy still wants the tape !!!
