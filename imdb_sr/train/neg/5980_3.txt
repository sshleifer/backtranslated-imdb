There is a group of Fok TV executives sitting at the table in the meeting room and wondering what a new show will be. "How would you target something like 24 or" West Ving "? says one of them, but everyone agrees that it would be too expensive and cheaper TV is less likely to damage the station if it breaks down. "Well, how about we get some great comedy writers and make a high-quality sitcom?" offers another and gets fired on the spot. "Do not you know that good writers cost a lot of money "the great boss of the bark." That's why we made up the reality of TV. "" We could do another criminal drama ... "suggests a man in a gentle suit." I'm listening ... "the boss answered, suddenly "People love CSI, so let's make another copy of it," Blandman adds. "But there are already too many CSI clones out there, what can we do to get our one out?" Naive junior searches and is immediately fired. "They point out! If we do this, people can be confused! Give them more of what they already like! Big major screams. 'Let's just add more violence and make it really horrible, but we're Fok,' another suit suggests that the big boss responds to 'now you're getting'. "We could make them a crime division," he continues, adding, apparently on the roll. <br /> 'Jove, it has it!' The big boss laughs, 'and the victims can be beautiful and endangered women who wear very little on the screen'. "Well, that would certainly dissuade people from average behavior and bad scenarios," says Blandman. "Then it is solved, we only need a name," announces the big boss. "Can we call it the violence of sexual policemen?" "Too literally, how about the Killer Instinct, he transmits violence, but sounds a bit like the Basic Instinct that had a lot of sex." 'Puuurfect', the big boss responds, and then they all slam each other on their back and go and cancel Arrested Development.
