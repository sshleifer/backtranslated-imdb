The film begins as an ordinary strip-hero-movie. It's about a boy who's been buried, no parents, and is crazy in love with a school girl # 1. Nothing is surprising in the film, there is nothing that can not be assumed to come into the film. Toby McGuire shows us that either he is not a good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one. Perhaps kids at the age of ten can enjoy the movie, but it's a bit violent for the youngest. You can not escape from thinking about movies like X-Men, Batman, and Spavn. All these titles are better. I almost left the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good even though it was a computer animation, But even that was nothing to put into a Christmas tree! So, my recommendation: Do not watch this movie even if you are paid for it!
