I'm starting this review with a great giant spoiler about this movie. Do not read on ... here it is, refuse your eyes! The main character, a girl who always survives in other films, was killed here. There, I just saved you 79 minutes of your life. This is one of those low-cost films that were thrown together in the middle of the 80's Kaiser's Era. Despite killing a heroine, this is just a garbage. And priests and students have a bad voice. They are conceived as exaggerated, sociopathic idiots with too many internal problems to deal with what looks like a life in a student home for juniors ... and students are even worse. just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, even though I suggest you watch the head cleaning pane, which would be more fun. , curses, short female nudity and sexual references. <br /> <br />
