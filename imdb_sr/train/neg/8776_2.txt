Michael Keaton was never a good actor; in Tim Burton's batman films, he always falls in the shadow of his great villains. Here, he acted as a widower who picked up radio frequencies that look like dead people trying to make contact with the living ... there really is every place that shock you. Because there are too many things that end in unexplainable, undiscovered and uninteresting. So where is the shocking excitement when everything is so badly done in the first place that VHITE NOISE makes a fool of itself? Actually bad acting and horrific editing, this movie is nothing to watch. Michael Keaton tries to return the thriller, but eventually loses his target more than ever.
