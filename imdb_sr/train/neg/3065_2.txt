This film represents the times when it was made as much as the original, I suppose. What is really sad, because at the deeper level, the title 'Vanishing Point' is so ironic. I'm sure that was not the case, but the original was taken in 1970, and it was published in 1971. REAL '' VANISHING POINT '' was the end of an era, which mostly ended in the early seventies. In this remake, all counter-cultural elements have been removed, and more PCs are presented in an attempt to reach a wider audience, probably. "Sanitized for iour protection" The insertion of American Indian scenes was free, and the idea of ​​'noble purpose' on the journey was the seizure of the add-on. I'm glad to watch it, but it was even more appreciated by me originally. Original is cult classic and golden. This remake is terrible.
