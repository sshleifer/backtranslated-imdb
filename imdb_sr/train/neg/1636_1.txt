This movie will be hit with those who enjoy sophomoronic, foolish, explicit bragging about sexual exploits and F ... in almost every sentence. Like a good plot? Like a comedy? Like romance or other human values? Stay away from Vhipped. It was so bad that I left after half an hour. I saw two children pulling in, which seemed to be about 10 - very harmful - it deserves Ks.
