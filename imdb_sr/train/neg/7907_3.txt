An excellent performance by Alic Elias emphasizes otherwise misguided and confused pile of shit. I've seen this movie, maybe 12 times, and with every passage I find less and less satisfaction. Why are Munchies so lousy? Has it ever been explained? Are they a reflection of our rampant, brave animal self? If they are, why would not it make it more obvious? Why not reject just one subtlety that calls into question this movie, and make this connection explicit? The second part of this film that bother me without ending - motorcycles. The jacket that a little monster wears on the front cover seems to suggest a "street" passenger. Sunglasses say "pretty cool guy." With all this, I'm ready Easi Rider to meet the Muppets. All I get is Munchies (1987). What gives? Stay Gremlins Series if you are a lover with reduced, wise shooting, reptiles - this will give you the treatment you deserve.
