The guy has done a lot of design titles for a bunch of movies and I suppose he said one day; I should choose a cheap scenario, I try to put as many titles into him as a cause (in the end, I'm the designer of the title) and I'm trying to persuade people that it's actually a movie. One of the worst I've ever seen. If you have a desire to see good titles, check some posters so that you do not waste your time watching this. It's a bit ironic, do not you think you've seen a poster? the only part of his project that should do the title was almost nothing!
