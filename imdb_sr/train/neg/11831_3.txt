I do not understand how these animated films continue to emerge, and no matter how good (or bad) people like it. I saw this film with two children (5.7). They like almost everything that is animated (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost complete, and I was looking forward to seeing the movie with its top-of-the-line acting. To be honest, I was bored. It was incredibly predictable and simply unusual. It was a couple of sneaks through the movie and that was it. Of course they tried again and again to get a cheap laugh, but they just did not work. My son almost always says he wants a DVD after we see an animated film, but not this one. My daughter fell asleep halfway. Also, the kids thought the animation of the characters was strange. I have not heard that from them ever since I saw Polar Ekpress, who gave my daughter a nightmare. Believe me, I'm not the guy who seeks the negative in everything. But quality is high-quality, and like many animated films that throw it there, there's very little.
