"Dead letter office" is a low-budget movie about a few employees in the Australian postal service, who are struggling to restore their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is bad, and the links between past misfortunes and current thinking of the characters are clumsy and overly schematic. However, what disappoints most is that it is the view of life in the title of the film: there is no mechanization at all, and it is quite impossible to determine what one of the staff really makes for living. However, part of the complication is that the office is threatened by closure, but this type of office was certainly closed in the 1930s, if it ever really existed. It's a shame because the overall tone of the movie is sharp and distorted, and in the script there are some promises: but convince a bit of detail. All in all, he feels the work of someone who has not experienced much real life; student film, with a concept and a draft, but unfortunately a bit more.
