I am a fan of the series and I have read all 7 books. I wanted to see this just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who need to watch this are those who have already read the series and are curious about it. It's pretty bad, and it will turn off the reading. Not to be evil, but Lucie is so ugly that she diminishes the film. Was she the daughter of the director? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth. She had overbits that would shame every beaver. The film only loses so much in translation. CS books are not translated as easily as Tolke's LOTR books, or even Harry Potter. One thing they have done right! Aslan! very well done. Although other human actors with painted faces (beavers, wolf) looked stupid, Aslan was very well made because he was not just a human actor. (I suppose it's like old horse clothes? 2 people inside?) Also, it would be interesting to me what kids think about this movie. Maybe you would enjoy? But as far as adults are concerned, it is certain that they will not, even if they are a CS fan.
