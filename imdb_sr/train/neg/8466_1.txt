The words let me down. And it's not usual. Done correctly this could have been a great, funny bug B-movie sci-fi, but unfortunately it was not. Rarely in the field of drama so many competent actors fought so futile with such a doggy scenario. I can only support the comments of the previous critics - go clean the bathroom. In fact, everything is apart from watching this movie. Positive: Nose Lusi Beeman. Negatives: Everything else. Very suitable line: "This is not going anywhere". If only any plastic surgeon encountered such a fate.
