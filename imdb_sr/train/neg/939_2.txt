I loved the Batman TV series and I really enjoyed this. But they tried to do too much. Why have they had a story about Adam West and Burt Vardy trying to bring back the batmobile was outside of me? I do not want to knock Burt or Adam in the way they look now ... ... It's been 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin, but to see them dressed in suits and fight with 'badges' It was sad. I'd rather see the former stars comment. The Batmobile story was stupid. As for the film about the flashback, I think it was too short and that it was too emptied. It was just a brief review in my opinion. I'd love more background. They showed Penguin and Joker every minute, just to tell the same things I already knew. Joker had had mustaches under the makeup, and the penguin had to smoke, although he hated him and was a former smoker. That was the team 2. I would like to read the book. I'm sure there's more to prove. Like why there were 2 Riddlers or why 3 Females or 3 Masters froze. Where was Commissioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. The list continues. As I said, even those who were in this were barely in it. Very disappointing. And it's really rough.
