My mother keeps the tape of this movie as a general threat to any person who loves the movie and who is annoyed. Everything about it stinks. As such, the real classic is. <br /> Who gave 10/10? Did you inadvertently watch a good movie and accidentally vote for this? Everyone involved in the filmmaking process should be forced to watch at least a small part of this film. It should be an indelible stain on the minds of everything that holds the film sacred and to be respected as a tide in a kinematically terrible one.
