This is a version that even the author hated, because that's the case. They gave her a "happy end" and changed a lot of dialogue, and that's just a big pile of saccharin. The 'stage manager' is pretty good, I believe that he has created a role, but everyone else is falling into this 40-th actor style that he actually represents. One great feature - music. This is one of the best results ever recorded, and it's worth a look at the record store. In general, I think the version of Spalding Grei / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller 1989 is far superior.
