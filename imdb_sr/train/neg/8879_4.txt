I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics. Here he is doing a good job, but the course is so bad, and the pacing is so tiring that he never goes away. The story starts well, although I wonder how he could count on his wife hanging. She continues to rob and carry things. The bell of death is double. First of all, if we took the amount of time the characters spent walking from one room to another or part of the house to another, it would have consumed about a third of the film. Add to that, Robertson's figure sitting in bed in the blue light looks confused, which could add one more piece. I agree with those who said that a half-hour shorter film would be pretty decent, though a meaningless movie. The biggest weakness is just a tricky action that, when said and done, leaves unbelievable questions. I'm not putting a spoiler, but when it's over, do not think too much. I can get up to ten what-if without raising sweat. It would be better if there was a story about ghosts.
