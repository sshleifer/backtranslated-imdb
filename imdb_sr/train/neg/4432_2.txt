Tatie Danielle is all about the terrible old witch who is tormenting her love and unconscious family from the pure vat. There is little subtext that could be related to the French colonial past, but mostly Danielle does things (such as the deliberate abandonment of a small child in the park) that will soon have a man who will pick up teeth with broken fingers. Unfortunately, this is not happening here. It looks good and the acting is fine and there is nothing really wrong with the concept, but it's just SMUG. God, is this film loving itself. It's a shame that it's not nearly so smart or fun as it thinks. The only incentive in the show - I apologize, the film - comes from Danielle getting worse and stupid, and the only surprise comes from seeing the more incredible way it works. That's right: just like in sitcom, that's what this is, with an additional 'bonus' error of size and 110-minute running time.
