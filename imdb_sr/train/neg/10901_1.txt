And a few more "no" at the top of that. Voodoo Academy is no doubt the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly is he trying to do? Tell the story? Obviously not; as it has already been pointed out, most of them are barely legal guys rubbing. Is that then an attempt at subversive homoerotica? Well, perhaps, if not because of the fact that it never exceeds the worst and most unacceptable forms of male contact. (Which, to the excitement of nobody, repeated about eighty thousand times.) Well, that's some kind of horror film; Is he trying to scare us? No, unless the director intends to do it through the complete anxiety and emptiness of his "work". I never enjoyed my film in my life. This is a boring and unnecessary thing I've ever seen. It's like the Voodoo Academy takes the genre of horror, zombie and gay movies, puts them in a mill, then launches them over the coffee filter - just instead of being a kind of coffee filter that filters coffee beans, it's a kind that pulls out all the vital, tense or in any way interesting. The result is 74 minutes of the movie as exciting as a glass of hot water - just without the ability to rehydrate you after a 10-day gin binge that will inevitably hit you if you are watching this horror of human effort.
