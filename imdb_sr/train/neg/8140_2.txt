I saw this film about a mysterious science theater called "Live at Night". This title is much less deceptive than "Batpeople". In fact, it could be more precisely called Batperson. This film talks about a doctor who studies the bats I'm thinking about because he wants to make a better medicine against rabies. This is not very clear. What is clear is that he and his wife are crawling around the cave and biting the bat. Why a scientist should go on a tour to study bats is beyond me. Could not he come in alone. Well, after being bitten, he and his wife go to the honeymoon where they begin to fit. They're going to the worst doctors ever. The guy stays in the hospital and kills his sister. In the end, the guy kills 3-4 people, and his wife stands next to him, and you should cheer him up instead of the sheriff investigating the killings.
