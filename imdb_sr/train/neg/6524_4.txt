Angry Red Planet (Kuickie Reviev) As "The Man From Planet KS," this is a bizarre story of a scientific fantasy that originated from a time in which fantasy and science fiction were still the same. So, we have some very funny special effects and unbridled pseudo-science that turns into science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" released in a high-quality transfer with a sharp picture and a sharp sound - Midnite Movies. So, the main reason for watching this movie? Oh, it's definitely all the time when our space crew is on Mars. (What, did you think "The Red Anger of the Red Planet" referred to Neptune?) Before that, a rather poor space crew loaded into a spaceship, inside which they smoke and throw a sexist chauvinist joke aimed at a "little female" member. the crew. It would be a little offensive to today's standards, it was not so funny. But Mars is the real reason we're looking at this thing. The film is mostly black and white, but Mars, and Mars screams bloody red. It was shot in this bizarre red plastic shine, giving an angry red planet a rather interesting look of overdrive redness. It's a really good scene, as well as (ha ha) alien viewers. The best is "ratbatspidercrab". You think it's a joke? That's what they call the movie! It's a gigantic chimera (little doll) of things that combines the properties of rats, bats, spiders and crustaceans. She borders with all the dolls and is scared of our "heroic crew". There are other strange, poorly conceived aliens to see, but he takes a cake. In the end, after their terrible experience on Mars, the sexist crew embarks on their "ship" and returns to any planet they came from. This is not for everyone. Fans of science fiction films and searchers for curiosity, and some general movie lovers. Lovers of the Misteri Science Theater 3000 will have a day on the field with this (if they have never reached it). 2/10 Modern Score, 6/10 Nostalgia, 4/10 total. <br /> <br /> (vvv.ResidentHazard.com)
