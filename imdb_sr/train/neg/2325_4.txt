The first Scanners may not have been a great movie, but at least it was genuine. There is no such novelty in this film. as a dialog, and special effects are not better than in the original. This film is inferior to the first in all ways. Make a good movie. if they did something better with the story and made it interesting, this could be a decent movie. film, not much more. in spite of everything, there is even worse film. In a great mood, I will give Scanners 2 and 4/10.
