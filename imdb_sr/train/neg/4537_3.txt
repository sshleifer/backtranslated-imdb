I did not really enjoy this movie. I saw him in one camp, and we did not rebel, we were laughing. Of course, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole film idea is terrible (now I know it was based on a book I did not read, but I hope the book was better than this, because I honestly I thought this film was very bad and boring. As I said, I went to a crowd of people from the camp, and we were excited to be there, plus I drank a drink with caffeine, but I was still fighting to stay awake. the thing that kept me going (except for the fear of not being ashamed when I woke up) were shots, which they were totally meaningless. I just did not like it.
