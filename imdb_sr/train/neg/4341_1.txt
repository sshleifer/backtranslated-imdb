This was so pathetic that I turned off the DVD ... maybe halfway. It was so bad, I could not even watch enough to tell you how far I did it. Although I really wanted to believe that the appearance of a young Carlite would be somewhat different, I simply could not buy it. I really do not blame the actors, because I think it's a script that may have fallen. I smiled a few times, but I do not think those lines were funny. The only thing that saved was that I bought it in 2 DVD sets and I would pay. I only paid for the original. This is one of those cases when it should have allowed the classical to be autonomous.
