This film is a bad memory of my childhood. This is one of those movies that show children on a rainy day at school when you can not break, and you'll rather see anything else. At least that's the way I was in elementary school. I just remember how I hate this movie. I agree, I have not seen her for 15 years, and probably do not use it anymore in rainy days, but I just want to warn everyone: You'd better use this to sleep children than to entertain them. Believe me, pick something else. Although the topic is controversial, the plot is so pitiful and slow that I do not remember anything except that I did not like it so strongly that, here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn you of everything against it.
