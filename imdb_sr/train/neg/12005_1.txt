We've all seen some endless epics in our times, but this is really all of them! The film is so long and so slow that, in order to put things in perspective, I was much older when I left the movie theater than I entered it. Almost 4 hours long, it was rather made in tele-series. What starts out as a promising comedy slowly loses the pace. Nikhil Advani has plotted about six love stories and can not do justice to any of them ... There is no interconnection between them, and the links shown in the past 20 minutes are just forced to link the story. The situation is aggravating the Silli Dialogue (most of them are repeated in Hindu cinema for years) and stupid cinema. Priianka does not realize that she really needs more than glamor on the screen ... A complete loss of beauty without acting skills. And then there is a loud-witted Govinda and my-face-knitting-better-than-jam Akshai Khanna, who at the top of his lungs continues to irritate already tired viewers. Just a good part of the movie is the love story of John & Vidio and the beautiful acting / comedy Sohail & Isha. But they are so good in their roles that only these two pairs could justify the film without being confused with another group of characters. Their brilliance is lost in the midst of other bad lines of the plot. My assumption - the director made two separate films (maybe even more!) And some beginner assistant mixed all the records out of the way by sorting them, so the director had no choice to show it all as one movie. .. See only if you want to test your patience !!!
