I am a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I was eagerly waiting for this episode. First I will comment on the movie, then the MST3K episode. Recipe for this movie: take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare materials and a $ 1.25 budget. Mix well, then drain all life and movement, until it becomes blunt and lifeless. Serve cold in a large, regular stone boiler. Film, I give 3 out of 10 because actors at least deserve little credit. Okay, now episode MST3K. I admit, the first time I saw him, I fell asleep halfway. I understand that this was the reaction of several other people. However, when I looked at him for the second time, I realized that there was a whole lot of intelligent references and good lines that I missed for the first time. The trick with this episode is: Listen carefully! It takes a few reviews to capture each line. Give him another chance, and you'll see what I mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 of 10.
