I saw Sleuth (1972) for a long time with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but now his husband and Jude Lav are his lover's lover. The story is still the same, and it's a fantastic show. During the film I always had the feeling to watch the show. This is one of the reasons why I do not like this classic remake. When I watch a movie adapted to a play I still need to feel to see a movie, not just a play. The director, Kenneth Brannigan, has made some wonderful films in the past, but this time he missed it. The other reason was the look of the film. The design was stylish, elegant, uncomfortable and cool. I never had the feeling that someone lived in that house. The photo was not bad, but the shine was terrible. Sometimes there was blue light, dark, green light, to round off, but not friendly to the eyes. Michael Caine and Jude Lav perform the best they can. I really would like to see these two guys play together on stage. But I must admit that I was never a fan of Jude Leo. The weakest part was the middle part. I remember that in the original this part was still very mysterious and beautiful. I tried to watch it twice and I always slept in the middle part. The end is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems to be more a movie for critics than an audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more fun than Sleuth (2007).
