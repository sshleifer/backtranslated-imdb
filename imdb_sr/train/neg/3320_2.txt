Frankly, I had some high expectations when I began to watch this movie, but it turns out that this is probably one of the most lonely films I've ever seen! First of all, the pace is incredibly slow, so it looks much longer than it is (and not short). I'm sure Jane Austen has written a book, made several pages, filled it with a description, and did not intend to read people in one day, or could retreat and lose her appeal, which "Emma" certainly did. Now, "Sense and Sensibility" had a faint pace, but at least he had lively lines to make up for it, as well as some good performance! It leads me to the defect # 2, which, of course, is an act. Although I do not really care about anyone involved in this movie, I'm sure they are capable of a good job, but I did not see much in this movie. It was as if people were trying too hard to be witty, too heavy to be "upper class", too heavy to be British (well, some of them), so everyone was just pulled out like a bunch of actors, not people . 3. Actors, as I said, they looked just like actors, not as people they played. Maybe it's a good thing, because the people they played were not so good. Why did everyone, for example, love Emma? Of course, she was kind to the rich, handsome people in front of them, but there was a horrible gossip behind their back. If her friends were "ugly," she did not even try to get out behind their back. So, why is this girl so beautiful? Why should people tell stories, "just to laugh?" Of course, the snob could not do it. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" has not really changed my mind. Well, it's easy to see that I did not care about this. I'm sure it's a wonderful book and everything, but some books are not really intended for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
