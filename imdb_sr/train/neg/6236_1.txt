This film was the most out of line and the free-feeding movie I've ever seen in my life. (Except Farenheit 9/11). All information is supported only on the basis of the opinions of five scientists, while 80% of Associate Journalists strongly criticized the science they promote in the Upper World. Global warming is a mass media hysteria and nothing more. Most of the information in the movie was incorrectly quoted or everything was wrong. This film is constantly researched and proven proof that his lies are only lies. LIBERAL BLINDNY! To think that they show it at school proves that the media have ushered into believing in this garbage!
