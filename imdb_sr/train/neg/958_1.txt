How did it become a blockbuster? Dear God, I do not know where to begin why this film is too sucked. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the acting of some characters. The film was too bright, it needed to do something with lighting, for example, making the environment darker. Makeup on some dead characters made this film look like the 1970s. This is 2006! People are not afraid of other people wearing heavy makeup. Most horror scenes are taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror films. Total rip off! So I do not watch Tagalog movies. The only reason why so many people "screamed" while watching this movie is because of compliance. How many times do we need to copy the scenes from the Ring and make them improvise so that instead of the girl that comes out of the TV, she now comes out of the window from the neighboring door? No matter how you set it up, HIS IS ISSUANCE. If you want a good horror movie, watch the 50 best horror movies listed on this website.
