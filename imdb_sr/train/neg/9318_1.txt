This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Again I made a mistake by buying a movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool (after buying this and the movie "Malevolence" which I reviewed here, I learned a lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the forest or in the desert or on the farm. This is allegedly taking place in the forests of Texas, but it is probably filmed in the director's yard. Production was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were the worst. The story had nothing to do with what the last cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.I.E and some other "mom and pop" stores that bought used DVDs and would not even take them. It was a terribly bad apology for the movie. I've already seen some bad films (Troll 2, for example), but this definitely takes a cake. I did not think the film was worse than "Troll 2". I'm a mistake! Do not buy this movie, unless someone gives it to you for free, but even if you've stuck it, unless you throw it away, and that's what I'll do !!!!
