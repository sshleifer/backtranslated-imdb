I was introduced to the fantastic Goodnight Mister Tom book for an absolute age and I just recently had the opportunity to watch this adaptation. I heard many positive objections about it, so I had great hopes. When this film was finished, I was horrified. This film is not a good movie at all. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' was an extremely poor adaptation and practically 4.5 / 10 books were missed. I have specially found that many characters and some great scenes in the book are not in this. There was not a lot of dialogue, it was fast and fast moving, but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never saw the connection and love between Willy Beech and Tom in this film that was a real downhill. Casting was not so good. I thought this could have been really good, but it was so different from the book! Extremely poor adaptation, one of the worst I've ever seen. This deserves a decent remake that should be 1,000 times better than this pile of garbage.
