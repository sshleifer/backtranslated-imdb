"I'm Curious: Yellow" is a dangerous and pretentious bunch of steam. It does not matter what political attitudes are, because this film can hardly be taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that the frontal male nudity is automatic NC-17, this is not true. I've seen R-rated movies with a male nudity. However, they offer only short-term views, but where are the R-films with a gagging vulva and flickering labels? Nigde, because they do not exist. The same goes for those shaky cable shows: the calls are rocking on the breeze, but not the clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie films like The Brovn Bunny, where we are processed at the site of the pulsating John Vincent Gall, but not looking for a pink visitor to Chloe Sevigni. Before crying (or implying) the "double standard" in nudity issues, one should consider the inevitable obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals when the actresses appear naked, and the same can not be said for a man. In fact, you will not even see a woman's genitalia in any movie of pornography or explicit eroticism in an American movie. This alleged dual standard is a less than double standard of recognized depressive ability to culturally accept the term of the female body.
