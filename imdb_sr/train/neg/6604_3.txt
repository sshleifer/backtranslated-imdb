The first one was the best. The other was sucked because the dialogue was terrible. Although, the story was not so bad (in fact, all the stories are good and bad). I put off several times through the film. I know that Jackie Chan has great expertise in martial arts, but he is not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was also not good. And Zhang Ziii, I can say, a few lines, horrible acting (But it's based on her script). All the characters were not so good. But, some of the things I love in Rush Hour 2 is always action and less scenes of sex. I know Jackie Chan does not do what is good for him.
