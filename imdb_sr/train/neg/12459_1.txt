Given how much money was provided for this film, it would have been expected more than the story as a whole. It could be a very worthless movie that I've ever seen. There was no real progress. Character development, minimal. Maybe progress in the field. Enjoying, nothing. I'm not sure what those goals were even trying to do. If you want to watch a movie in which the terrorists are kind of good guys, the US CIA bombard everything that disagrees with our opinion, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see something similar to the progress of a scenario followed by death. For those of us who realize that killing a good guy does not have to be true, we will stick to other movies. In short, this was a terrible attempt to hide the movie 'Ocean's 11', not only do not you know what's going on, but nobody made a movie. Home Alone 3 was a better movie.
