I bought Bloodsuckers at ebai a while ago. I watched the parts and I thought them too stupid to review them again. The excess amount of water 'blood' at the beginning is simply obsolete - not to mention the sound of the wind 'whip-eye'. My friends and I made a film with a very low budget, and the effects still went beyond this shit. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my TEACHER TEACHER. HA! Final judgment: Do not bother with this "horror" movement. 3 stars (out of possible 73)
