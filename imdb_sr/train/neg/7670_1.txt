So where do I begin my story? Tonight I went to this film with a few friends who did not know more than the actors who were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie. what kind of bad decision I made watching this movie. The plot was a shit, as well as a script. The lines were horrific to the extent that people in the audience hysterically laughed. Even some of the scenes looked like they should have been much faster ... as if they were taking place without a special reason. Very poor editing. All in all, this film was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
