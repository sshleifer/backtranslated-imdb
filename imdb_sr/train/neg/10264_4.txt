The head of the regular New York family, Jane Gail (like Mari Barton), works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (like Loma Barton) in the Smirner's Candi Store. After the dealers abducted Mrs. Grandin in the purchase and sale of women as slaves for prostitution, Ms. Gail and her boyfriend Matt Moore (like Larry Burke) must save a young woman who is endangered by virtue. "Traffic in the Souls" has a reputation that is hard to support - it's not unusually good done and it does not show anything special in that the "virtue" of a young woman is endangered by sex traders. Perhaps it can be supported as a film dealing with a theme in a length greater than the usual one (which was claimed to be 10 rolls, originally). Scene locations in New York are the main attraction after all these years. Moving a prisoner behind bars is unforgettable, for nothing else makes the cameras move. **** Traffic in the Souls (November 24, 2011) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
