Pretty standard stuff from B-movie. Seriously, anyone who watches "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and a bunch of people making their first movie should know better than expecting real quality or even moderate intelligence. B movies exist to rewrite formulas that are popular. If you give them even a symbolic analysis, you will complete the demolition of the movie for yourself (and you may write a self-important, defamatory review on IMDb). She had charisma and I thought she was very attractive. It was an unforgettable B-movie. Unfortunately, I can not see from when she filmed movies. I'll watch her again.
