What a descent! This started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. However, it was moving at the speed of the snail, but it still caught me and continued to watch. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalized by possible terrorist connections. But then Morrissey's figure was killed and all the air had left the balloon. The last episode was boring, boring, boring. Everything turned out to be very little beer, and the disruption was incredibly weak. Five hours of my life for it? My advice: Instead, watch dry color.
