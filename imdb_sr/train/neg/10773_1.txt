I was just watching this terrible thing on TV. Needless to say, this is one of those movies you are watching just to see as much as possible. Frankly, I do not know how much lower the bar can go. The characters are composed of one chromic stereo type after another, and the obvious attempt to create another "Bad Nevs Bears" is unpleasant to say VERY the least. I in my time saw some valued turks, but there is no reason for any of them to be listed because this is "Numero Uno". , because it was so bad that it was funny. This ... this ... is NOT even good.
