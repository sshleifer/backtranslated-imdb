Broken part of After Dark Horrorfest III. Neither the killer nor the blood is filled. A lot of broken glass and mirrors in this tense thriller from France and writer / director Sean Ellis. Successful radiologist Gina McVai (Lena Headli) is entering the strange world, for her life appears to be out of control. While attending the celebration of his father's birthday (Richard Jenkins), guests were stunned when the mirror collapsed on the floor for no apparent reason. Things get really strange when they testify to a woman who spat on a picture of driving a London street in a car identical to her. Gina sneaks into her duplex apartment and finds a photo with her father. She leaves and is involved in a crash. Then her mysterious boyfriend is not the same; To be the right family and friends do not easily believe it. Is Gina beside herself? Is she in a parallel world? His nightmares become scary ... is she broken? Good luck if you can figure this out ... it will not be easy. Editing can not be lower. Lighting is questionable. Other players: Melville Poupard, Villiam Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
