It's obvious that many talented people have been working on this film behind the scenes, so do not even look at the end of the points, you will only keep it against them. It seems that nobody was interested in seeing this movie, only three were in the theater; The two fainted after 10 minutes, and they were lucky. 'Monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Vrath of Khan, and rejected designs for space creatures in Alien. The filmmakers obviously did not want to overshadow third-party film monsters, so they engaged actors who apparently failed to remember their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce words before the beginning of the recording. Some scenes are incredibly incapable of transmitting what should happen, if anything. If you are unhappy enough to be in the theater in which this film is shown, and you do not pass out, laugh at what should be scary or uncertain moments of the film. The incredibility of several scenes will just be astonishing, and the regular release of Stephen Dorff from 'Kueen Mari of Damned Words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this. If you need to see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the cheap bin in the video. If there is any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to give it to you.
