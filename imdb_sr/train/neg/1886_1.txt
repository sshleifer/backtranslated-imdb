I once promised that I would never get out of any movie (personal politics that made me suffer through various kinds of shit, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was really a terrific experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that the Austrians are poor, the pathetic crowd is retarded. It shows a world in which love and humanity do not exist, a world in which people are humiliated only for one reason - to draw attention from their miserable existence. By selecting a documentary style with unprofessional actors (most of them seem to be from the imagination of the Austrian shock cartoon Deika), Seidl wants us to assure us that this is a real life in Austrian (European? Western?) Suburbs. The spectator faces portrayal of sexual orgies, violence against women and handicapped, madness and degradation. But this is not a social critique. This is just a pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead, you get bad acting, bad cinema, bad movie recording. If somebody needs such a movie to realize that things in our society are wrong, then that person had to live through life with closed eyes. It's a pseudo-social critique with a hammer. And looking at people in a disgusting way. It shows ugly people - that's not why I hate it. But, in an ugly, misanthropic way, the average people are shown. And that's why this movie is really scary.
