It's really so bad in the movie. My friend rented him because he's an idiot. But again, I have to be an idiot because I've been watching the whole damn thing! The actors were in par with the high school students who think that this is happening. The only place to go is to go back to the tables in Lubium. Everything I could think about while I was looking at this "jewel" was how it was actually made. I mean, some "scriptwriter" actually thought this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. Then some moron with money so much believed in the script that he decided to write some money with a naive misconception that he would return to her. The actors are acting, the locations are scanned, the actors are engaged, computer animators from the Al Collins Graphic Design School have been introduced, and this shit began to form. things I hated about this move, but the only thing that crippled me was excessive use of music. Every minute of this movie is recorded. There was not a break in music. And from time to time it was mixed up above the dialogue, not because you missed a vital point or anything else. After we finished, we decided to watch Mistic River. It was like driving the VV Diesel Rabbit from 1980, then switching to BMV 740il. You can not get two more opposite movies in terms of quality.
