"When a little Bavarian village is burdened with a series of mysterious deaths, the magistrate searches for (sic) attacks. While a police detective refuses to believe that stupidity about vampires returns to the village, a local doctor who treated the victims begins to doubt the truth about crimes, "according to the synopsis of the DVD sleeve. Poorly addressed, dramatically unsatisfactory, vampire mystery. Interestingly, the second line of the movie easily extracts the stupid stars of the movie: stoic Lionel Atvill (like Otto von Niemann), skeptical Melvin Douglas (like Karl Brettschneider), and fairly Fai Vrai (as Ruth Bertin). Much more enjoyment in supporting the actors is the bat-crazy Dvight Frie (like Herman), Hipohondar Maude Eburne (as aunt Gussie Schnappmann) and the suspicious George E. Stone (like Kringen). Mr. Frie, Mrs. Eburne and Mr. Stone are making great progress. Is there another movie that ends with a crazy boom in the bathroom? Magnesium Sulphate? Epsom salt ?? It's a laxative! **** Vampire Bat (1933) Frank Straier ~ Dvight Frie, Melvin Douglas, Maude Eburne
