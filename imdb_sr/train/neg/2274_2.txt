Well, I hate Hollivood, but I love the cinema so I have to watch these rough movies in theaters. And, I was hoping Vanilla Ski would be fine. I was hoping to either keep the original "Open your eyes" the same, or it will do it to your own. Well, it happened that there were a bit of both, and it was exhausted. It started well. I love Radiohead. I wish there was more. But in the end we listen to Good Vibrations from The Beach Bois. Talk about a wide range of sucking. They had one or two good songs in the club, and perhaps a couple of others, but why, why they had to thunder GV during the climax. It was more boring than confusing or open. Especially when there is nothing to cry. At least put some meaning behind the tracks. Kid A = primary. No preference. He also got into a deal with the club scene. It was cool. Otherwise, the film was a big arrogant ball. It's like the audience gets a movie. Those who would read it, and the rest will not. It's so simple. The motives were messed up. I did not understand Diaz's motivation (right?), And some others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stai overboard. Tom Cruise can not work (especially in these types of films [ie Eies Vide Shut]). And lift. I understand. After all, they tried to improve the original with an American-sounding camera with shabby angles and a good print of the film and great processing and would help Crove not screw up.
