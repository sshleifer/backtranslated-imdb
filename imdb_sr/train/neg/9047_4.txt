This film made an impression on me. I looked at him as a freshman in high school and I was home that night. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor who was a big fan of Brady Bunch. I also thought Chuck Connor's role was terrible and evil. However, this film has so much affected me that I am now a volunteer in a female state prison working on Bible studies and church services and trying to change women's lives one at a time. What fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie. None of my friends watched him, and my family is still incomprehensible to date, when I was discussing this film because they did not see it.
