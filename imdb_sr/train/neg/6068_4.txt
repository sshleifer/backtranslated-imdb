Vodka lemon is a charming but extremely uneven Armin's movie that will delight some and disturb others. Though fairly well-designed, the film lacks any real "zing", relying instead on many scenes that will look familiar to crafty viewers of art houses. The film contains a few moments of pure film glamor, unfortunately, they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and that light would be a serious drama, Vodka lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately dissatisfied. You can laugh, but those moments will be a bit and far between the sea of ​​a washed snow of filled landscape and seemingly endless bus ride. The noble effort, ultimately made by the lack of narrative cohesion.
