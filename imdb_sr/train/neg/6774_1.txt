As a passionate admirer Cari Grant, I expected to watch this film and scream with laughter, while AMC charged him as a comedy. I've never been more disappointed with the movie! Kary's usual charm and comedy are effortlessly AVOL from this whole movie; it encounters a tired, boring, and not just about itself. Mississip's character is one of the worst stereotypes I've ever seen-his accent is terribly exaggerated (and inaccurate, according to that part of Mississippi for which he claims to be from it), and whenever he delivers a line, that's more than a decibel more than any other member of the acting team. Mississip tried to stand out in the movie as a lovely, peasant thief, but ultimately succeeds only in reducing the already conspicuous conspiracy. Mensfield looks more like an incoherent Hollywood sex doll, and although she was not known in Hollywood about acting abilities, this movie screamed that she had never had such an ability. The character of Raio Valstona was cute and finally invented. For the four men who went to the coast, it was the smallest leave I've ever seen. I've been watching this nightmare all the way to the end, and while I'm not going to spoil it, I'll tell you it's more absurd to see. The film is trying to provoke patriotism and a sense of debt to the men who are fighting, but the film completely misses this spot because of its poor line and low voice. Sorry, Cary!
