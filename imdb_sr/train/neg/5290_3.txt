I do not usually shoot a movie. I'm trying to see good points and I'm not focusing on bad, but in this case, there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you are going to do something so bad, why bother? Part of the film is shooting Ana's face as she breathes deeply, and the violin plays in the background. the other part is filled with bad and woodwork. Rupert Penri Jones is impersonal. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister with modern manners. Anne is presented as meek and self-contained, which is in the beginning fine, but she remains the same through the film, and you do not see the reason that Captain Ventvorth falls in love with her. All in all, the production misses any sense of the period, with too many mistakes to be ignored, such as the leaking of the concert, kissing on the street, running in the streets without a hat (why this scene in the movie was in fact one of the the most romantic scenes written.) To summarize, an awful film, very disappointing.
