This must be the most brutal "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Valken like a crazy homeless can not make me laugh? Something is wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've ever felt. I used free passes, and I still felt like I wanted money back. I can honestly say that the only movie I've seen above was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. ONLY. up. Movie. I laughed very little on the scene with carousels, and that's it. Spending 2 hours in something charged as a comedy should bring you more than one laugh, right? I do not know, I suppose filmmakers thought "fen" is a funny thing, or something like that. And the other moving shaft is really fighting a dead horse - literally.
