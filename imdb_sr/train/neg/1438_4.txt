Okay! What can you say? First, this adaptation is too long for 4 hours due to the complexity (or lack of such) complications. Actors are trying hard to make something out of this movie, but there is not enough content for the available time. All in all is NOT a Kuatermain character in general. After seeing the interpretation of the great man Sean Conner in The League of Ektraordinari Gentlemen, Svaizee does not really make a mark. This guy with a vinchester repetitive rifle does not have the strength, height, subtlety or humor that is needed for that role, and surpasses him everybody, including the witch, which from my point of view seems more convincing than the actor than the rest of the actors. Some aspects are pleasant, but in the cinema there are stupid mistakes. E.g. When a happy team arrives at the hole in the middle of the desert, their paths are visible to the oasis, just waiting to enter it. Exiting the mine leads to the exit (in the next shot) nothing similar to the exit from the passage through which they climbed, and so on. I waited for Doug McClure to appear at any time. In a way, I want him to have. The Russian leader who deals with Kuatermain has created a stereotyped character that just shoots at everything. Swaisee behaves pretty well as a sad father, returning to London, unable to get custody of his son. Swaziland should keep such things. He is not able to carry a part of a brave gentleman with a firm heart, a life experience, and a sense of fair play. 4 out of 10. Barely
