Well, I rented this movie and found it was really shit. This is a family with a stepmother and the same stupid family struggles, then a cool son comes with his stupid camera and likes to photograph a damaged building and strange things and a strange movie, and then ask your father to take him on the road and simply agree, etc. etc. They go to that city that nobody knows to exist (blah blah blah) And the most unfortunate thing is that the film ends, and yet I do not understand what it is MOVIE !!!! I've seen a lot of mysterious movies, but that was the worst, honest, it does not have a description at all and I want to see it.
