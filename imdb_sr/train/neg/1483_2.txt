I just gave this funnyly-called comedy horror 2 because there are several famous porn stars from the past. A group of tourists, apparently on holiday in Ireland, but in fact in Canada, are fighting a cannibal inbred mutant or something else, and the shop is more or less right out of HILL. I HAVE EYED and IS GOING TO REMEMBER. The only problem is, if I am not wrong, there is only one mutant on the screen, and it is not so impressive. Something like a darkened mummy in that home movie five years ago. Some bloody, but stupid deaths help, but the movie is a strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and is done until death. It's not intentional.
