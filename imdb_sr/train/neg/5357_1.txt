I do not know where to start from. This film feels much like one of those cheap Saturday morning girls returning back in the late eighties of the early nineties. Something like Captain Pover or Pover Rangers. It's full of bad digital layers and really the sirens of "secret agencies" and villains. The act is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrific and there is little continuity. It looks like someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that it was supposed to be complicated. Perhaps one of the happiest scenes in the movie comes early, when a few villains are launching explosive devices in the car agents. For some reason, even though the device is clearly referred to as "remote detonated", bad guys decide to jump on their motorcycles as it moves away. This chase continues. all the time with the bad guys who are doing ridiculously and completely absurdly. Standing on bicycles, working a car and so on. At one point a collision occurs and one of the attackers throws away from his bike, we see that the bike (obviously cgi) was thrown over the car of the agents, but the rider disappeared. Then, a few seconds later, the driver and bicycle are returning ... apparently undamaged by the collision. At this point, although there is an explosive device in the car, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving the past, and then blow up the car in the air. This is also clearly done with cgi. Sounds confusing? It's like the rest of the movie. I could emphasize that when I say cgi, we are not talking about Lord of the cgi-type rings. We're talking about the cheap variant of the Power Rangers type cgi, in fact I think it would be better at Power Rangers. Why did Savina and Todd do this movie I will never know, I can only assume that they have done for money, as a service to someone or because they have been blackmailed ... probably the last one.
