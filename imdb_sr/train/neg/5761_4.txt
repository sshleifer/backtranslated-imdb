Hollivood does it again. A lot of money, without creativity. I'm sure the writers wrote about something other than oxygen. Based on the review, I thought it would be a funny movie. But if you're not at the last stupid pop culture, then you'll miss most of the stupid humor in this movie. Why waste time. You can sit on a diary and do nothing and have fun more than this film will provide
