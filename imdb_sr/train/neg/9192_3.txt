I found this movie in the "horror" section of my video store. It seems to make sense because most zombie movies have their place. From Romer's 'dead' trilogy to '28 days later. 'However, when you watch it, you can quickly see what this movie is about. It's actually a music video that goes faster and more and more becomes increasingly worse. There is no horror here. Only half-way action-oriented action scenes that soon become tiring because they last ... and the last ... and the last ... and soon you'll get the feeling that you may have skipped the DVD player for 3 minutes, but no, so they actually shot a movie . It's a pity. I think anyone could find better use for $ 7 million in the film industry than to make this group. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, but once again, they were overused and became fatigued because each time was the same stunt every time, with only a different character. ROIALLI annoiing is joining the images from the arcade game. I played the game. It's bullshit. Why did they put him here? Oh, that's right, this is not a movie, it's a music video, and that's bad. 3/10 Estimated R: Many violence / bloody and cursing
