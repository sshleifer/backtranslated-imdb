This movie looked promising, but it was actually pretty bad. The assumption was O.K, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors tried the best they could with limited material, but they could not rise above the evil spirit of this inconvenient film college. Jason Schwartzman once again was extremely irritating - even more than in Rushmore, the rest of the actors were quite unseen. The scenes that should have been fun turned out to be unpleasant and incredibly young. Trying to be Road Trip / American Pie, but unsuccessful at all levels. Totally wasting time for everyone.
