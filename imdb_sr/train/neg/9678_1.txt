I'm sorry to say that it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although visually fascinating (for example, Using color was absolutely stunning), she was quite boring and disturbing (see incest father / son). and the wonderful music tracks by Michael Nimano (who wrote the music for most of Greenava's films), and then you can imagine what the difference is. <br /> <br />
