I searched the video store everywhere to find this movie, because I was a big fan of Elvis, and I found it to be a great disappointment. kurt russell had the most "elvis move" down and imitation voice was great, but synchronized singing voice of Elvis is just not working for me. voice did not always fit the ears russel, and it was hard to get lost in the plot, because my mind it is noticeable. also, there was so much clutter in the film, people who do not know much about Elvis, would probably consider them facts. His poems were sung earlier than it was filmed in real life, the time when he received his first guitar was wrong, I'm pretty sure that his brother Jesse Garron was buried in an unmarked grave, rather than in one with a huge tombstone read JESSE GARRON. I know that it was just a TV movie or skipped important events, such as specifically for the return, and withdrew some scenes too. if you want to see a good movie showing Elvis in his premier lease. listening and seeing the true Elvis preform is the only way to really see his talent. (a brilliant statement I know, but still ... I'm going and renting a good Elvis Flick.)
