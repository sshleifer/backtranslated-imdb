In my opinion this film does not bring new thoughts. It seems like I'm taking spears into the spear without looking to the side! The director seems to have a plan! Ghost! I find it lacking its rational, there seems to be no place for an alternative view. Once I'm usually on the side of the naissuary, but this film lacks credibility because it relies on the fantastic observations of a man / woman on the street. For now, if you want to take advantage of a credible alternative of faith that is held in 2000+ years, you need to make more effort to allow the other party to declare your beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film I felt like an attack on the Christian faith, I am for one disbeliever, but I allow others to believe, and I would not want to make them laugh, but try to understand and tolerate.
