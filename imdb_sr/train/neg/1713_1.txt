If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you are not. A competition such as "make your own horror movie in one day" could not have come from this insult to the intelligence of any observer. Mr. Sheets has forgotten the story, the plot, the proper dialogue, the fact that people need some BASIC acting talents and a well-deserved lighting designer has obviously forgotten to appear. It seems to have been shot at the toughest hands and copied to even worse equipment. The effect of makeup consists of a black mascara for zombies and yogurt that flows over the head of people to simulate their melting of the skin. This is nothing more than a home movie, and really bad. It's just fun to watch friends, family members and neighbors who were ready to appear on the shoot. I can not understand why this mockery of a product is listed in EVERY serious film magazine or on the site - I have home movies about weddings that are much better and more interesting. Totally wasting time, money and energy. The ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II extension is just more than the same garbage.
