Wow! Only a movie that was ridiculously awesome could inspire similar "Shovgirls". I mean, where do I start from? An unbearably terrible topic? Pia Zadora does not express through the movie? The fact that, despite being set up in Los Angeles, it is called the "land of the couch for casting" EVERY single man (and woman!) She kisses himself all over to sleep with Pio Zador, by whatever means? Or what about the fact that every person in the movie is completely inconvenient because they are either stupid stupid (Pia) or obvious contempt (everyone else)? And given that this film was written by a real "screenwriter," it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the film industry (who would be admired and kissed by the SCREENVRITER?) But it is (unintentionally) funny as in hell. The scene of the "malfunction" will ginger you, and after seeing the climate "I'm not the only one who had to climb on top" of the scene on the "Awards" (all done in the usual action level we expect from such high-quality actors such as Pia), I sincerely hope that our dear Pia actually took advantage of that speech when the "axis make "my Golden Globe. Make my day. In any case, if you are a fan of a bad, tashi camp, try this otherwise beautiful movie.
