This is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I am an open-minded man and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, when I rent movies, I especially look for some good underestimating horror films. They are always good for laughter, I believe that I know, I've seen many. But this film was so terrible that it was not worth the whim. I was thinking about turning it off in the first five minutes ... which I probably should have. There is nothing good about it, first of all, the camera team is restrained by A $$. The Intro was as dumb as the end. Performance and special effects were terrible. Please, do not watch this movie, you absolutely will hate it.
