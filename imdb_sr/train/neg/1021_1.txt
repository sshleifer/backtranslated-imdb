The movie began to be strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as a cop in secret, with Sgt partner. Lazer (Dilan McDermott from the practice, maybe wrong as a bad guy?) He's committed robbery and murder. Deed refuses to kill a drug dealer, setting up a dirty policeman's conflict with conscience. Other great names (Freeman, Spacei, etc.) They are well-spoken and the movie promises. The film begins to fall as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. I give the opportunity to make a good movie that people may see more than once, or one that teenagers go to see once for Timberlake, I would choose first. Even talented actors must work hard on their craft; Timberlake is not talented and no hard work can save him. I thought it would prove to be better, given the fact that he has been talented for years. Everything he did in this movie was unbelievable. Just because the singer sells millions of records and sells stadiums, that does not mean that it can automatically translate into the feature films. Even hardcore N'Sinc fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent. In addition, there are several holes for a piece, such as Pollack's sudden sniping ability and deadly operation of storage machines. This film had so many promises. Totally disappointing.
