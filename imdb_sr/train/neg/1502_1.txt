The ballad about Djang is a bubble of film! This spaghetti west is simply a collection of scenes from other (and much better!) Films that allegedly associate "Django", saying it was brought by different apostates. Hunt Povers (John Cameron) does not bring anything in the role of Django. Skip this, unless you need to make every Django movie and even so it may not be a good excuse to see this !!
