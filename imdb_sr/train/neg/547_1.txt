The full title of this film is "Vakt: Race Against Time". It's a race that no one can win, but you can definitely reduce your lost margin by not losing any of your precious "vakats" to this torch. This film was awkward and manipulative in a way that K3G made honest. I exaggerated my gullibility. It was ridiculously stupid in his story and deserves to be ridiculed. Silly, senseless, with the funny OTT performance Amity. The central "plot" is another nasty example of rude manipulative propaganda that involves so many "family" BV films. If my father, who raised me, and whom I really loved, treated like Big B, Akshai, I would have shot him. Not to mention the trivial disease of terminal illness.
