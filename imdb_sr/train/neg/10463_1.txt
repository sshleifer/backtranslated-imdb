This film had so many promises. I was very excited about this film. In the end, this was at best funny, in the worst case, painful. Acting styles have triggered a scale of really, really, flat (angels, women and daughters) to excessive animation (Casper's character). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience, instead of trying to get people to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the "bug" scene. It is a pretty insult to the audience's ability to understand things. In defense of this scene, however, he received the greatest laugh of the entire film. I read that they spent a lot of money at various locations abroad. Too bad they did not use it. I did not feel like I was transferred to exotic locations. Everyone could insert a footage of the Colosseum in Rome. However, to finish on a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics that were displayed on decoding computers. It's my opinion (and that's all) that if the factor SCHMALTZ was much lower and that the ACTION factor would be greatly increased, this film would be good.
