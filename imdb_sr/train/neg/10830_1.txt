1999 will enter history as a year when a film critic leads the public in the wrong direction. They first sent us to EIES VIDE SHUT. Then the BLAIR VITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst film of the year, was made. What it is? Who knows. It is full of self-esteem and is overburdened with bad behavior. I always liked to stay and watch the credits, but when this thing was over, I could not get out of the cinema quickly enough. Most of the audience who attended the show I was in was quite similar. The dates were fought, as did the strangers. It's a ugly and hilarious movie that will make you feel ugly and hateful.
