Never watch this movie. Trying to be a scapegoat to scifi / thriller movies from the 1950s and 1960s, but all you've managed to do is really want that you really watched one of them and not. It is very chrome. The spoof must have some aspect that has something superior to quality. This film has no such aspect. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but ... just do not look at it.
