Oh, man, this movie is bad. It's terrible. The story is about a driver of a racing car who is in love with himself, and then he has to promote a fast food chain for chicken and while he does, he does not like himself. He tries to get out of the contract and perform terribly, painfully awkwardly. Jim Nabors looks like he's walking in a dream, he does not act. You will miss such Burt's assistants as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed as you watch this stinker. Hair Loni Anderson is totally frightening, proving that the hair tone did not come out in the sixties. Or maybe it was a wig. Speaking of this, Burt's wig was not bad in this film. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and the Bandit 2". In any case, this movie is the worst Reinolds car, ever, ever, up there with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" which, fortunately, did not have a sequel) are great, fun films. This is not. Even Ned Beatti, who is a great actor, stinks. You crave Jackie Gleason for a hate-ridden guy. And do not worry, this is not one of those funny movies that can be squeezed. It's bad, clean and simple. Even the exits in the end were tired and boring, and the worst of all, inconvenient. At least I forgot, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails that sealed Burt's suitcase a few years ago in Boogie Nights, another film that, like Deliverance, years ago, shows that a man can It works pretty well when it has a decent platform to do it.
