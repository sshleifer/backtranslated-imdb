Vhoo-boi, it was definitely one of the worst movements I've seen all summer. I agree, it was on the Sci Fi, and I do not watch a lot of Sci Fi, but a man, talking about plot shots and two-dimensional characters to the maximum. The characters were stereotyped and exaggerated and the environment was incredible, the vampires were less scary, funny, up above was unnecessary, the special effects were down to the right, and the end? Well, the only thing that's unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly a tomboy becomes a lesbian and begins to work with a female vampire, which, by the way, is not that hot, since it's about three seconds, you're closer to "What the hell?" then "Man, it's hot." If this ever happens in replay, do not give God, do not look at him.
