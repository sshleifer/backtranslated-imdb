The SNL is pretty fun, but people who say it's like watching a short skirmish on the SNL is a little stupid. It's nothing like SNL, it's just stupid shit. Andi Samberg is trying to act like Jon Heather, but it does not work. Although John Heder is ridiculous only in Napoleon's dynamics, Andy is struggling and people think he's ridiculous. Only the funny people in the film were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was funny with Annie was part of the pool. They could make a "quiet place" much better if they did not make a falling scene of 3 friday minutes. > The part in which he pronounces his H is more retarded. They try to go with her for too long and it looks as though Andy laughs while he's acting ... he's a horrible actor and does not deserve to be in the movie. This film is a joke for simple people with a comedian brain of 10 years. About half of the United States.
