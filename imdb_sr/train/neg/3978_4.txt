When in Rome there is definitely an improvement on the way to there. I discovered that it was too predictable, fictitious and slow, and to this day I still consider him the worst Olsen twins. However, while "Wen In Rome" is not a horrible movie, it's not good either. If I had to summarize a single word, I would say it is passable. It's a good party for teenagers, but I do not think adults will find much to continue. When in Rome has its good side. Marie Kate and Ashleigh Olsen are actually pretty decent actresses, certainly very beautiful. I admit when I was 10 or more years old, I really liked it, and I still like me at all. And I enjoyed some of their films, such as Passport in Paris and New York Minute. Returning to the goal, both girls do not do such a bad job, in fact they are very attractive. Plus, their clothes will die, and the landscape of Rome is absolutely stunning. Soundtrack is not even half bad. However, where the film is demolished is in a plot and scenario. The script is in most of the clich√©s and has hints of deja vu. The action, like most of the films Marie Kate and Ashley, is very predictable, and anyone who is familiar with any other work by Olsen twins will find some pretty non-genuine elements. Most of the characters are skinny cartons, and you do not learn much about them, and sometimes they are uneven. Unfortunately, the breath-taking landscape is corrupted by a work that is quite a slapdash camera, which seemed to be hurrying constantly. All in all, it has its own good side and certainly looks. However, in my taste, it is a harmless and predictable teenager's bottom. 4/10 Bethani Cok
