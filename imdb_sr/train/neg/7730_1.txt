Despite its great style, luminosity and shine, this French musical does not speak. The melodies are repetitive, predictable and fatigued. The story is uninteresting, as are many characters. People break into song and dance without motivation or reason. Most actors carry false wigs and wigs, and the sets look hopeless in the studio. To be honest, this video of the updated version is stopped before the end, so the negative effect on me. Certainly shame, have such a talented actor in such a weak final effort. It goes to show, I suppose, where the followers (in this case, the great classic, "Umbrellas") often go wrong. It can not be recovered, just recreate.
