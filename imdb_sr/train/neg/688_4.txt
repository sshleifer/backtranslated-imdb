I always loved Fred MacMurray, and although her career was tragically shortened, I think Carole Lombard is fun to watch. Pair these two great and attractive stars together, add top-level players such as Jean Dikon, Anthony Kuinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Buttervorth, give them a romantic script, link them to famous director Mitchell Leisen and get a core experience. Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet sweet" during her visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks in love. Skid is a big trumpeter, so he goes into a musical career, which is predictably meteoric both in ascent and in decline. During her ascent to music glory, Maggie neglects, which later inspires him to start again after hitting the bottom. Ah, yes? It's a real Hollywood happy end, which does not come too soon. The stars and director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this film is so predictable and slow that it's hard sometimes to watch. The early scenes set in Panama are so tense that they look like they last forever, and later Skoda's alcoholic swirls immensely in New York. Fred and Carole are trying the best they can, but the tired script and direction S-L-O-V do not give them a chance. Even the final scene, in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, simply does not sound true. This film should be seen only once to watch some early performances from the stars MacMurrai and Lombard. However, I guarantee that watching will take about 48 hours.
