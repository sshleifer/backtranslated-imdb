DECOI is one of those independent productions, made by apparent novices, but it does not have all the usual flaws that sink most of such films. He has a definitive story, he has an adequate acting, the photo is very good, the hero and the bad guy are both terrible people, and the background music is not exaggerated. This is DVD Nev Release, so people will ask to see if it pays off. I do not know where all the tenths come from, because there is no way that this movie is so good - even if you are a directing mother. The last movie we saw in the theater was Varner's destruction of JK Ravlings, the favorite and excellent book, Red Phoenix. Comparing DECOI with PHOENIKS, take into account that PHOENIX (as Varners did) did not have a story, there was certainly no acting directed by the director, the photo was terrible, and the music was messy. I rated Phoenik as "1" because the rock is not going down. DECOI is 4 times better - in all respects. If you have a chance, give DECOI a chance. Remember, this is not "Decoi 3 - Shootout" or any nonsense. It's original. If your expectations are not overwhelmed by the foolish "10" results here, you may enjoy the movie under his conditions.
