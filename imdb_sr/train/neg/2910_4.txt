The highlight of this film for me was no doubt Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he was definitely thrown out against the guy and showed that he could tolerate a non-traditional (for him) role. Hanks is usually a good guy in the movie - the one you like, who you admire and who is rooted. Sullivan is definitely not a good guy. It is true that in the context of this film, he encountered a bit of nobility - his purpose was to be avenged on the murder of his wife and the youngest son. Even so, he was already a gangster and murderer before the killings. So Hanks took the role I would not expect from him, and he pulled it out well. Hanks' good performance aside, however, I certainly could not call this a pleasant movie. After the opening which I would best describe as an enigmatic (it was not clear to me how it goes), it turns into a very gloomy film about the complicated relationships that Sullivan has developed as a gangster - mostly encouraged by Rooney (Paul Nevman), who some sort of mafia boss, and he tries to raise his two sons and keep them clean, so to speak; isolated from your job. After an elderly witness testifies to the murder, the gang tries to kill him to silence him, get the wrong son (and his mother), and leave Sullivan and his elder son (Mike, Jr.) On the run. It becomes a strange film about the father / son binding. Although it ends with a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the whole context of the story), it is really very dark, this mood is amplified by many scenes recorded in the dark and abundant precipitation. I must admit that while I appreciated Hanks' performance, the film as a whole simply did not pull me off
