I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1968 film noir, "Criss Cross". I found that this was the second disappointment, but it was still better than this movie. This film is "neo-noir", because it's a trendy day and it's color, two things that the purists would do to be disqualified for film noir status. However, the greatest negativity for her was not cinema (that was fine), but a tangled story. Hey, some of Dashiell Hammett's stories from the 40s were similar, but for some of them I did not care. The filmmakers here did not help the situation by putting in the story flashbacks of images that looked like every three minutes. No wonder this was a story. It was funny! What is happening is that for the 45-minute trail their confusion is no more. I know I did not.
