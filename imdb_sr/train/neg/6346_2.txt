This movie smells! You want to go back two and a half hours how long it takes to get through it. The sliding door, with Gvienth Paltrow and director Peter Hovit, did what Melinda and Melinda are trying to do much better. That movie was smart, witty and good behavior. I care about what happened to the Gvienths - or rather the characters it played - and the performances in support were fantastic. they were less concerned about any of these people - the least of Melinda. One Melinda is so dysfunctional - the first glass of wine is at 10 o'clock in the morning - and so melodramatic she is ridiculous, not in a comical sense. The other Melinda is fine, but it's forgotten. Previous films by Voody Allen worked because, I guess, he spent time on the script and the actors were talented. One part of the trivia for this film is that he wrote this scenario in two months: you can say. And while Chloe Sevigni is talented - they are not around her, it's not enough to be a whole presence. The film becomes Chloe Sevigni and a bunch of other people that you know you saw in other films, but you do not remember which ones. It's sad, very sad.
