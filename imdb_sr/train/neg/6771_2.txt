There are a few things that can be said about it, but I can mention Matt Dillon, who is trying to make something out of nothing and many split screens and graphics to pay off. Since most of the racing films suffer from the assumption that car enthusiasts are not so intelligent, we end up with movies like this one. Lindsay Lohan who has so surprised at Mean Girls has to make better decisions to take. Here she can only collapse. Children will only gently entertain themselves, as they try to more like adults than children (although they are still pretty stupid). Those in the theater I saw showed no real interest after a few minutes. And as a family sports movie, this is terrible. Better moments are initially on a scrapard, creating a feeling, and later in a car bash, creating a certain tension. If you develop a car as a central character, you must develop it better than here. After several compulsory scenes for the collision, you are in the best part: you can be able to leave the multiplex in your car.
