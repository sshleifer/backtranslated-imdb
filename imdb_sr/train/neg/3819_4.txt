T.Z. Post, a college professor, gets a fake letter stating he has inherited $ 750,000. Now with funding, he is pulling his life savings of $ 4,000 and deciding to finally leave and live. After his luggage was sent on a train to Chicago, he met a traveling stroller, and decides he was good enough to present himself on Broadway. Night of the show, poor Professor. The post must hide from its creditors, solve problems of relationships between girls Pansi and & floozi diva Eleanor, and still make sure that the show continues. After watching many Keaton's silent jewels, this pain to pass, but I felt, could have been much worse. By supporting the cast Durante, Todd and Selvin are sometimes very boring, but still cute. Before Charlie Chan Toler is as good as a frustrated director. 90% of the scenarios are poorly written as MGM is trying to convey this as a Marx Bros movie of a poor man, where many of the goggles of vision are falling from the beginning. Compiled with Keaton's drinking problems at the time, this film is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating- 3.
