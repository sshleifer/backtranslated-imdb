It took me only 15 minutes before self-maintenance pulled me out of the empty eye that this movie made no effort and triggered me to scream back to the video store that was armed for the bear. Say that the movie was bad, it would be a missed opportunity to use words intertwined with characters from the upper keys on my keyboard (only to make these comments clean). One to avoid. <br /> <br />
