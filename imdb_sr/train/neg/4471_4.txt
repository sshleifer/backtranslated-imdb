The best thing I can say about this movie is that it was sometimes a little fun and that it was an adequate killer of time. Unfortunately, this film is so boring that I wanted to squeeze them. This is a movie that's so cute that it hurts your teeth. I suppose that the intentions were good, but things get terribly tedious when the dialogue is so painful. When these two tracks are not on the screen together, it's not bad at all, but you are scared during these frequent moments when a loved couple starts talking to each other.
