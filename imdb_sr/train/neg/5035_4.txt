Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she reveals her sexuality with the boys. But it turns out that all the guys who spend time with all the murders were killed in this generic film of the '80s. At the local city sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Vild Bunch) and his boring mysterious good daughter with two shoes, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday, part 13), to get to the bottom of these murders. This film focuses more on the mysterious and melodramatic aspects of the film, and less on the killing itself, and thus is able to distinguish itself from many of its' Slasher 'brothers from the' 80s. It does not hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to emphasize clearly with the statement that the actress is older than 18 years and in this way conveys that I am not overly distorted). On the other hand, the film is interfered with a few partial points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a topic that is rarely used and used too often, and an end that is slightly anti-climatic. But well overcomes bad (hardly). Give this rent, but I would not buy it.
