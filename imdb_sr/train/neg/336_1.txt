Why when the star reaches the top of the star chain, they destroy all good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reinolds reached the peak, and then he started making terrible car breaks. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest asset in Hollywood, just to make fun of him with the terrible Hero of the last action. And here, the lazy Eddie Murphi erases memories at the stores and 48 hours with this "family" adventure game, which is an incredibly boring, childish and generally terrible failure in which the opportunity is to see big, big breasts Charlotte Levis in a tight blouse The most attractive aspect of the whole film. The story is pure boredom. It's about the social worker Murphy, contacted by mysterious types and said he was selected. Chosen for what, I hear you ask. His job is to save a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from the race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, the actor Charles Dance seems terribly embarrassed to be in the film, but hey, I'm sure he's well paid for sacrificing his talents. Of all Murphy's films, this is the worst. I read some of the criticisms that suggest that Murphy is looking at the atypical role in an informal film, and while both points are loosely correct, he does not forgive the fact that the film was atypical and non-formulaic <br /> < br />
