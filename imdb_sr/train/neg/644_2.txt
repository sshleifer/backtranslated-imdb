We were all wondering "why do not they transform slasher movies that were just fine, but did not process those that were already great, so that I can only improve them?" Good with Prom Night they made an average, but trashy entertainment film Jamie Lee Curtis of the 80's and made it even UPPER. His colored color in numbers that obviously tries to attract young teenagers (hence no violence, etc.), The knife in this milky movement is dull. The director spends so much time focusing on an attempt to make a pretty attractive killer of a slightly dashing look that everything else comes out of the window. Actors who include the Britney substance (which was excellent at Hairsprai) are trying the hardest, but the material does not give them anything but to fall in love and look scared. he will hear an attack, but he will not see it). It seems that the only place on which the knife in this film was worked in the assembly package is because the movie seems to be slaughtered (assuming that anything terribly ended on the floor of the cutting room so as not to scare children). pour money from Americans who sent this movie to number 1 in cashbox !!! Slasher movies are fun, but in the case of Prom Nights, I wanted to download the original. I've seen scarier OC and Davsons Creek episodes
