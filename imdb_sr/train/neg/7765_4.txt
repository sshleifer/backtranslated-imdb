Strange, almost all reviewers are very positive about this film. Is it because of the 1975's, and are Chemberlen and Kurtis in it, and for this reason they forgive very bad acting and childish ways of telling? Maybe this is because some people become sentimental about this movie because they read the book? (I did not read the book, but I do not think that's a problem, the filmmakers never assume that the viewers read the book). Or is it because I'm subconsciously irritated by the fact that actors who speak English tend to behave like their French counterparts?
