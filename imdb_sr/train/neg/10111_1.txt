Terrible acting, bad story, cheese makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I've never seen a worse movie in my life, for 5 minutes I decided to speed up to see if something will happen ... No. (Except for a lovely chest) The film was obviously filmed in some warehouse, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the set. You see the same red chair on several different "locations". If you want to make a movie, rent at least one business building and apartment, and not some warehouse that will echo your actor's dialogue .. (Note to producers) Renting a small office space and apartment for a month is much cheaper than the entire warehouse, and both are quite more versatile and more persuasive) If you spend your money on renting these people, I hope you got it with a guarantee of refund ... will look for your money back ... I only used $ 2.99 to rent this tonight and feel great .
