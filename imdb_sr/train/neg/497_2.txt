This is a really stupid movie. It could be fun with the cool appearance of aliens and the environment of the earth, but it just is not. They come to earth to kill people, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and actors. The front of the movie shows these aliens who are surfing surfboards in the universe ... not exactly what they do. These are not alien extraterrestrials, they are stupid cartoon idiots with boring high modulated voices. An alien with the most acceptable voice is Jack Nicholson's alien who always wears his sunglasses. Except for aliens, acting is terrible. Writing is obviously intended for children, because each character is written as a child. This is a stupid movie, which only kids will appreciate, maybe. My Rating: 1/2 of ****. 100 min. PG for mild language.
