So I heard from a few people that this film brought them to tears in the theater. While I watched him for the first time, I expected another romantic film Barbra Streisand; Something like we were. I must have made a mistake. Chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, did not exist, which prevented her from getting involved in the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. Streisand's character fell for an alcoholic who could not sing any note without being pressed by a quick-swipe button. At one point, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about a dead rock star and a woman who can not understand it until she dies. Parts of the film retreated and continued, and I was constantly wondering when this would end. It was quite obvious that his reckless behavior was early in the film, and when I died I did not feel any emotion. It was not a tragic accident, it was actually an idiot. Not to mention the entire film, I was disturbed by his disgusting beard. The ending of the movie when sung "With another look at you / Look around now" was my reason to give this movie a huge 3/10. Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie that I actually felt emotion apart from irritation and anger.
