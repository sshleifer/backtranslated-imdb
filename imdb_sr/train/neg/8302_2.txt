It's strange how the studio thinks it can make a sequel to what is a classic Christmas story with a whole new acting and expects it to float. They surely used various actors for Batman, but in that case, Batman was a classic character before any of the actors wore his coat. In this case, you had a classic figure in blue horns with horns framed by carrying Ralphi who wanted a red pistol for Christmas ... We kind of should have forgotten him and accepted another boy who does not resemble the original. If I did not know it was a sequel, I would not have hit him by actors ... except of course Charles Grodin who is so busy trying to imitate Darryn McGuin to remind you that the original was much better ... In the end, it might work if they threw the film better. They should look for a look or simply ignore the original and not try to copy its look and feel. This is just a cheap imitation. Ralphi does not cause sympathy, but only the desire to appear that his character is throwing around or dying.
