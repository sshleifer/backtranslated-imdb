When I was watching this film, around 1979, I became the first film I ever came out in the middle. There is nothing worse than a comedy that just misses what is funny, and this is missing every time (although I can not speak the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about any sketch. As I enjoyed humorous humor where appropriate, these sketches were unnecessarily vulgar. What was even more outrageous was that this movie was advertised as "the first movie of Robin Williams", using his new glory in the television series "Moor and Mindy". However, it turned out that his role is so small that you can not even notice it on the screen.
