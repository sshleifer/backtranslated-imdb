Immediately, this film was ridiculous. Not that he did not have aspects of redemption? For example, the best thing about this movie was a beautiful background. Anyone who does not live on the east coast should know that the South does not have a beautiful mountain like those in the West. I knew it was Utah now, but maybe Dalton could not push his English accent, so they had to apologize to him by saying that it was the southern city. It's easier to bend his emphasis on the south. It is certain that the film has a plot, but its false sense of place is something I could not pass through. It's not that Utah has a target for the lab ... so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend that it was in the south, outside of me. One other thing in action pictures always confuses me. Why do they always make a sound effect when a character pulls out an automatic gun? It seemed that every other sound effect in this film was "chuk-chich", indicating that 9mm was full and ready for fire. Of course, the weapon already had circuits, so that was not necessary. Finally, the pyrotechnics were at the top. But hey, this film was focused on a particular 'market segment', I guess ... Damn. Each of the actors can act, but this film was chrome.
