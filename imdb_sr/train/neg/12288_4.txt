Making the film as dark as possible and visually unclear, in order to cover up budget deficits, strategy is often used in low-budget horror films, but this is too much. It is SO poorly lit and blur (and this happens almost at night, to start) that you often end up practically watching a black screen (although perhaps a bad video transfer may have had something to do with it). Unfortunately, "blurry" is also the best word for describing the movie. Film authors cast different (and non-original) horoscope ideas without any logic, and halfway you got the feeling they left the effort to make a good horror movie; You know it when you see characters that should be in a deadly danger (or, in some cases, even dead) making a little talk ....
