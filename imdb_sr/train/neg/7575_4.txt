The retired diplomat, who acted nicely with Michael York, is going to Russia to revenge a Russian gangster who killed the son of a diplomatic policeman. Here, the diplomat meets with an extremely powerful and competent Russian policeman who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. I recalled the old action movements from the 1980s that always portray the Russians as evil bad guys who are undermining. a just American government. It's interesting that this time you see a Russian guy as a hero. It's not a big move, it's typically a "B" action. Michael York lends some class to this central movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays a Russian policeman, is a kind of "blah," but surprisingly he has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor to have chemistry with everyone he is working with. The disappointing, handsome Adrian Paul was killed in the first 15 minutes of the film. Now, if Adrian Paul was longer in this movie, it would have been an above-average "B" movement. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that it's really nice to see the first 15 minutes of the movie. Zlikovac, played by Richard Tison, is your typical bad guy. He's very blond and very mean in this movie. Rent this movie if there is nothing else on the watch TV. It's fine. Not bad. Action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot could have moved much faster, but hey, you see how Russia looks today!
