In order to preface this review, I must say that I was, I guess, a little curious about this film. However, I probably would not have seen it if I did not have a slightly distorted hand. In my opinion, this film shows how much a person can be wasteful. In my eyes, the worst thing in this whole phenomenon of Springer is not the type of people that Jerry Springer Shov behaves (which is in itself convincing), but many people are so curious and excited to watch and hear them about their lives (yes, I suppose this includes me ... in whatever extent it is true). If we do not glorify such behavior (as some might say), at least we may have subtly broken our minds and / or desensified ourselves to this kind of behavior. But enough soap (type). Here's the lean: the film has a rating of R, and although it only deserves it (I did not look at some scenes, so I'm not completely sure), I feel that the NC-17 (the top of the hat for the second reviewer) may be a bit more suitable for huge sex content The cynic can comment that the movie is just one big excuse for showing sex on the big screen). The action is very bizarre, connecting the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks that will appear on various Springer shows. In the end, the film leaves one with some sort of resolution - and Springer rhetoric of the need to see the real world (apparently as it is seen through his show). There I agree with him - it is important to know how the world really is so that we can endeavor to make positive changes. By saying this, let me tell you - a pretty bad world in the newspapers or news to see it, but let's not let go of good money to support that kind of sensationalistic and perhaps the formal undermining Springer wants us to give.
