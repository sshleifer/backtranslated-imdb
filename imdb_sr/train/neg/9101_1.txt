This film was like Disney Channel after Dark. Take out the language and the topics "we are not wrong", and you stay with dialogue and innate devices that offend the intelligence of anyone who does not describe "Saved bell" as a quality television. Dialogue so ridiculously cliches and consciously dirty, one might think that the script is the result of the locking of Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room with an order to produce an amalgam of every bad script that each of them ever had in the hands of creation. If it was Roger Kumble's intention, the mission was executed.
