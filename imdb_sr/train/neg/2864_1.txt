This film is so bad that it simply defies reality. Recording is at best high school material, the acting is pathetic, and the director should forever be excluded from the film in any form. It's so bad that it can not even be seen as a comedy as something like Shovgirls. The only thing that this DVD had for him was a wrapper. All I can write to those of you who did not have an accident to testify this is to please do yourself a favorable service in advance and do not waste time and money on this piece of garbage. If you want to look at the film for comedic aspects, there are many more worthy ones in this empire than this garbage.
