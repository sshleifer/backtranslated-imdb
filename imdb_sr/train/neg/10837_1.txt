I can not tell you how angry I was when I watched this movie. The characters are not very interesting, and the action does not exist. So, after I waited to see how the lives of these characters influenced one another, hoping that the last two and a half hours would lead to some significant ending, what will we get? Storm frog. Now, yes, I understand references to the Bible (Ekodus) and on the topic that is basically, but first of all, it was presented without any resolution, and the second would be lost to anyone who did not read the bible (significant) population or Charles Fort much of it). As a well-read person, I thought this film was a self-satisfactory bad imitation of Seinfeld's episodes. Do not waste your time. It would be better to spend reading ... <br /> ... and anything to be honest
