This is the worst thing I've ever seen. There's nothing good about this movie. The action is stupid, the dialogues do not make any sense, humorous scenes have never heard of real humor. The actors simply do not play, which they do not try above. The script itself is something in the same league with Ed Voodoo and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this game, fighting. They are well choreographed as you would expect from Hong Kong guys, and are the only reason to watch the Sun of the Sun. Although I believe that the fighting should only fill the empty space, so the scriptwriter did not have to be tired of thinking about the story. However, this poor and absurd action can prevent you from looking at it all the way. Avoid him if you are not a lover of the dragon lady Cinthia Rothrock.
