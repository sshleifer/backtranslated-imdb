This film deals with two former footballers who are Fred Villiamson (Mack Derringer) and Garry Busei (Lenny) who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer addresses his former wife, Vanity (Jennifer Derringer), who works on a sex phone conversation. Jennifer is threatened by a caller who wants to do her terrible things, and she seeks help and several other lady. Mack & Lenny have more time and often go to Miami, Fl. golf courses or socializing in a sports bar where all kinds of city things take place. There are many strokes, murders and many double meanings of the words that lead this movie to a great NULL. You do not waste time, this movie cost me only 50 cents, and that was too much.
