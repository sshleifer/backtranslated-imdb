I do not know anyone to worry, but I know. This film is historical for one reason. It is the unity of two heroes of two great seventy sci-fi films. One is great, and one is pretty bad. The big one is really great, in fact it's the best. Bad is really bad, in fact, it's the worst. Of course, I refer to the "Star Wars" star, Mark Hamill, called "Luke Skivalker", who is the hero of this film about a kid who gets his Vette, then goes to Vegas (on the water) and after many adventures the end is recovering. (Since it's in car repair, I guess you can call it "Lube Skivalker"). By the way, she meets a whore with a golden heart and ends with a character played by Kim Milford, a hero of the seventies of the last century, a sci-fi cult film "Laserblast", which, as I previously indicated, is the worst sci-fi movie ever made. Milford plays the main bad person Hamill must take away from his car. I realize that nobody cares about this encounter with two great science fiction characters, but I do it. And I also have to say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time. The act of Mark Hamila needs strength, the plot needs extensive training of Jedi, and the character of a whore played by Annie Potts may be the most unfortunate character of all time, ever, in any movie I've ever seen. But it's a fun movie to watch at weekends, or workdays, late at night, very late. It is one of those films that are marching, searching for something, but without the opportunity to find it, and yet, the whole purpose, such as the free form of jazz, is simply there as it is. And it is. And what is it, is not it great, but you can not say it's not fun, because an hour and a half may feel burned, but you will not feel deceived. So turn your mind off, relax and enjoy this confused gem without any expectations, and let the force always be with you.
