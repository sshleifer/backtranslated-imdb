I'm making my way through the collection of Chilling Classics 50 film packages and The VITCHES Mountain (El Monte de las brujas), something like the 17th movie in the set. The film had nothing to keep my attention on. The action was inconsistent. The dialogue seemed improvised. The acting was bad. The characters were insensitive. The best scene is the beginning, with a bitter woman who is brought to the burning daughter's seeming daughter. However, the only link this scene has with the rest of the movie is the main character, Mario, who has the most striking mustache ever. But that's it. The film was not effective at any level. Music was too intrusive. Lighting was very dark, so some scenes were almost completely black. It's really barely visible - what else can I say?
