'Nineteen Eighty Four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. It's a very dark movie, and that's one that will not do you good. It is a romance that takes place in this society and the betrayal of lovers and human nature. The film has some very good ideas and is well performed in presenting this society with dark colors in color (contrasting with happiness and bright colors in dreams) and a general sense of loneliness through objects and people and places. However, despite the craftiness of the film in presenting this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to have led to an idea. It seemed that he spent too much time being smart, not telling the story.
