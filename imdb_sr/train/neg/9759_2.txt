It's rare that I feel the need to write a review on this site, but this film is very much deserving of how badly it is and how the bias of its product is. I felt a special attempt by some filmmakers to portray the Palestinian family as brave and unreliable. We hear them discuss the sadness they feel for oppression, but the film was shot and arranged in a way that we think that the politically oppressed population is a Jewish Israeli population. We do not see any evidence to compare the position of a Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. As far as I understand, there are limitations, but the political nature of the limitation is made to prevent peace. I got out of the movie feeling that the mother was a victim of selfishness in her grief and a completely closed soul because of her side fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the injury of the bomber's parents, and her angry and imprisoned words challenged the final meeting to get out of control. It is more realistic, in my opinion, that the Israeli way of thinking is the root of the problem; ignored requests for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for recognition of the process by which the Jewish population bought the land. I gave these to the two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which would otherwise be documentary, but in the light of the lack of impartiality, all this seems to be exploitative. Likewise, due to poor modifications, the lack of background in the real case, and, finally, the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. After all, it's a bad documentary and a bad movie. I admit that this is partly a result of the political situation, but I am obliged to notice shortcomings in the direction, regardless of the fact that it is a heart and a sad issue.
