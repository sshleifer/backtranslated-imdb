This must be one of the worst movies ever recorded. Even for a biker movie, that's the bottom. Minimum plot includes a bicycle band that takes over a small city (as originally!) And attempts by citizens to fight them. Why not seek help from outside? Who knows? The fighting scenes are obviously fake. Adam West and Tina Louise are in this, but they both have a little work and both are ashamed to be there (understandable) This movie belongs to the trash!
