All in all, this film is terrible and never should have been made. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no connection with the audience and characters, for example, if it is preparing to be attacked, you want to feel: "Oh, my God, no!" In this case, you do not care because there is no connection made to know the character. The trailer seemed to be great, but there is no uncertainty about what it really is. Maybe there was a mystery, but it does not exist. "All it has is a toolbox." on the back of the DVD, you would think that this movie was carefully planned, and smartly made, but it was not, ending, it was just horrible, very flat, and meaningless. Operation is either average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion, it was the loss of one hour of my life. "Special effects" and sets were also average, nothing special that ever happened. There is not much blood or bloody violence, there is not much blood. This movie was advertised to sound incredible, but really, not even worth looking, I do not recommend this to anyone, unless they are easily satisfied, through a few bumps and a boring story.
