In a film that follows the fighting actor, who played, obviously, by an actor who is struggling, it does not help Chris Klein. He struggles to bring something that is remembered in the role and meanders through a shallow script that has managed to show, what can only be described as a meaningless leading man. There is a story, but that's all, and it does not show any basic start, the middle and the end, and the viewer remains to shrug his shoulders, feeling that nothing has happened in the last hour and three quarters. One strong light in the middle of this is Fred Durst, who manages to stand out above his seemingly average talented co-stars and is doing a semi-decent job to revive the backward character of Legdea. Can Fred create this again when working with a higher caliber, it remains to be seen, but I will look at it in the future.
