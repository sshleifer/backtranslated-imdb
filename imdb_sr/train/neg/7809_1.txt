A definitely strange debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is falling apart around him. Cessel took the phone book, looked at the name of the preacher, and called him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's home and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to obey God's word and has Jesus in his heart. It does everything better. Ahh ... that everything in life was so easy. The fact that this "movie" seems to have been made with about $ 500 certainly does not help. 1/10
