I saw this on TV. I'm glad I did not go to the movies to see this or spend money on rent. The film is completely predictable - from corrupted owners and planners, to electrical cables. The action is really weak and incredible - an avalanche expert has been hit by a bang breaking wave of 20 feet (using real shots) and everything he needs to do is get up and shake. Lavina runs a million miles per hour and stops on the side of the road. Some of the avalanche materials are impressive and show its devastating power. But the contract between real avalanches and staged things make this film even easier. Do yourself a favor, do not be bothered with this, not even at T.V.
