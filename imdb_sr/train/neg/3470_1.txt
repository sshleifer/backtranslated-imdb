Like most Ben's films, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. That's if you want to call it a story. Many things left without any thought. I want to thank the director for not explaining things better. I say this because it would mean that torture would take longer. As for all the failures of Ben Affleck, this is no exception, and can only be maintained by other actors. Even then, the acting was mostly fictitious and not convincing. Traveling a series of memories with actors I have not seen for years was not worth the price of admission. All that was meant to be said, and they quickly joined the ranks of "the present." My choice was to wait for the car to be fixed or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. All in all, I would laugh ... mainly because that's all I got from it.
