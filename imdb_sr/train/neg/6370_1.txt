For some reason, TV Guide gave these two and a half stars, plus Faie Dunavai is in it, so it definitely looked like something to see. My, oh, mine, this is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. From my terrible acting (every time a girl asks a boy what's wrong with him, I shouted at the TV: "I can not play!" Dialogue ("Give me my organs!") <Br /> <br /> And Brian DePalma will end, too, it was just beyond the horror. I wanted to like it. And the production values ​​were pretty good. But the vauzers, this was laughing at me, LAUGHING! Most of the time. Do not even work out curiosity, it was my first mistake, and it was my second, third and fourth.
