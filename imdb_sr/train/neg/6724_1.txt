When you choose a movie that I hope you will consider one factor, do the actors in the movie use their fame to positively or negatively affect the moral fabric of our society? This is not a political statement, it is a moral issue that has an impact on society. When a comedian / actor makes sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father, we should ask ourselves (do I support this behavior)? In this case, the behavior of Mr. Fokk is a tear on the social tissue that teaches our youth from the wrong, good behavior of the bad that love-kindness is better than hatred. Mr. Fokk should remember that it's just fun and there are many things for us to choose. Saying sorry does not remove it. It will not be unnecessarily hurt or remove the bad behavior that spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop becoming a fan of it. He sees no more of what they are part of. We can not change them, but we can stop the glory we give them.
