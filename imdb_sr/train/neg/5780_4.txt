I really wanted to love this movie and I looked through thinking that it must be better. Do not misunderstand me, it's not the worst movie ever, but it never fulfills its potential. The premise is good, the actors are great (I was especially inspired to be the witness of the return of David Naughton) and, God loves them, you can say that everyone tried the best they could. Simply over and over again. "Brutal Massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to film makers that only Kristofer Guest can do Christopher's films and, despite the fact that he makes it look easy, you should forget to try to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this and we should see them more often ... they are the reason they get 4 stars from me. If you want to have "Spinal Tap" of horror, I guess I might want the guy who made "Spinal Tap" to guide him ... just thinking there out loud.
