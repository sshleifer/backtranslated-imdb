I give this pretentious piece of garbage just because I do not believe that there is a worse film in the world. I hate this movie, I hate acting, dialogue, posting, writing and directing. I hope that everyone who was involved in this film will burn and rot in the darkest circle of hell. Curse, this nasty waste of time. only the fruit of my imagination. I pray that I dreamed of a movie, and that I will never have to see it again in my local video. BURN IN HELL \ t
