For the most part, this film feels like an effort "made for TV". The direction is fierce, acting (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overwhelmed and soapy. Denise Crosby, in particular, delivers her lines as if she was coldly reading the card. Only one thing makes this movie worth looking at, which is once when Gage returns from "Sememe". Something is worrying when you watch a young kid killing someone, and this movie could be more than some people can handle just for that reason. It's absolute freezing of the bones. This movie does just one thing, but it's one of the things that comes out of the park. Worth to see only the last 10 minutes.
