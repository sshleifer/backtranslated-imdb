Do not waste 90 minutes of your time on "Fast Food, Fast Vomen". It's a boring episodic script with three connected story lines, ridiculously bad for predictable writing, terrible acting, and even bad music. I found anorexic harassment of the protagonist to watch every time on the screen. She needs fast food. Spend 90 minutes to dedicate this party to doing something more exciting ... like trimming nails on your feet. You would have more fun values. The only thing that can be used in this movie is Louise Lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired scenario. Impotent is like an older guy in the movie. VIEWER BEVERAGES!
