At first glance this documentary / fiction / cartoon is quite fun and provokes thoughts. Of course, when something provokes thoughts, it can be studied. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with insinuations and groundless conclusions. The connection that "What Bleep ..." you want to see between science and spirituality, in fact, is not rooted in science at all. The Transcendental Meditation study mentioned in the film claims that group meditation can reduce crime in a given area, in this case in Washington. In reality, the HRA crime rate (murders, rape and attacks) was about 30% higher than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. During the study, there was absolutely no reduction in the murder rate. In fact, any claim that links metaphysics with science could have been revealed. My conclusion from this information is that this movie or a bad attempt to indoctrinate people or jokes. In any case, I suggest you do not waste your time. If you are looking for a long film about science that could cause thought, think about Mindvalk (1990).
