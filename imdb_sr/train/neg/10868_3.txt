With a story and script that appears to have been written by a high school student, "Art of Seduction" fails to provide a romantic, sophisticated experience trying to write. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female leaders are "swinging singles (or in a female case, hired)," but "The Art of Seduction" does not even try. Lossing from a sincere personality test of these two characters, "The Art of Seduction" avoids anything that is essential to the basis of a slim, lean stereotype. The 'art of seduction' is offensive - offending its characters, insulting men and women, and insulting the audience's expectations. It is necessary to the terribly beautiful people we all know and play their painful interactions, while we expect to idolize them. Ji-van is an immature, spoiled, manipulative bitch. The viewers are expected to like her and forgive her, for she is beautiful. Min-jun, well, he's exactly the same. Not even good people. "Humor" in this film primarily revolves around Ji-van and Min-jun's unusual attempts to outflank the fine art of lying and manipulation. There is no development of character, and we never know why Ji-van and Min-jun are like this. We are simply expected to take them as they are, and we do not ask questions - they are sweet! And that's all that matters. The abundant references to the famous actors of the main actors in the reviews of the azn cinema scene can lead you to the Art of Seduction tile. If you are still in high school, you like Grease, or you are a victim of yellow fever, you may like this movie. In spite of its "Romantic" tag, this is not a very good movie.
