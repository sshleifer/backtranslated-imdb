After reading other comments on this film, I would like to share my opinion that this is a difficult movie to see if you are not a complete Brooksofil. I do not watch. When viewed by a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced story that presents us with more unruly neuroses than we are able to be absorbed in one sitting. It's hard to watch. Character Bruce (Robert Cole) is so unwanted and unpleasant that he finds it difficult to connect with him - let alone show himself as he stumps out of a dysfunctional situation that is absorbed into the other. And NEVER should be doing the scene in Toples and expect to take it seriously in a romantic context. No man could have had so many exposed leaves and should turn the baby like Kathryn Harrold ---- unless, of course, it is not Albert Brooks in production controlled by Albert Brooks. "Modern Romance" has its fun moments ----- but is fragmentary and rare. More often than not, I felt like I was on a limited trip with a totally unpleasant person and wanting to do it it is already over, which confirms problems that can develop when too much control over the film is put in only one person - someone who does not have self-discipline to be able to distance himself from it and see what is obviously happening. <As most people probably He knows, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this movie, is actually what he portrayed. Dame later, he threw Albert Bruce into a very successful "broadcast news." James showed us how Albert could form a credible and entertaining comic show. "Albert allowed us to see James (a non-acting actor) to make a rare comical reversal to the surprising the effective way. Fans of "Modern Romance" have so far moved on to the next comment on it. I tell you ----- there is enough pain in the world without having to find in a movie that is conceived as fun.
