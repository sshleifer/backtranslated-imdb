The Germans stand out in the open and slammed with a machine gun. Good guys never die, unless they are for dramatic purposes. The "plot" has so many holes in his ridiculousness. (Where did the German soldiers leave when they dropped the fuel tank onto the train? Erik Estrad? How is that stupid thing? The Germans know where you're going, and not like you can leave the path and get out! head with a hammer hammer 10 times, and then I have to sit down again. I mean, seriously, Felt as if it was made in the 60s, but it was produced in 88 !! 1988 !! A-Tim is more convincing than this horrible pronunciation for the movie. Only if you need a good laugh. This film is Tele Sevalas like the Green Beret was John Vaine.
