STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning US Army has just launched a new big airplane to fight the invisibility that can avoiding detection unlike any other. The killing pilot (Steve Touissant) steals him and seizes him to hold the US government for redemption. So they are forced to send their best man John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention center where his mind should be erased from all the incriminating information he learned over the years. I skipped the Attack Force because I could discover from the cover and all post production manipulations that happened that would be shit and when all negative reviews and low user ratings came to him it only confirmed what I I thought. But I decided to give it to the FOF, because Shadov Man (from the same director) was not bad and, who is dick, Seagal was my favorite action star once and perhaps, perhaps only, could again make an excellent movie. Oh, I'm a fool. Recording, a horrible shot of aircraft combat aircraft, a terrible camera operation, cheap production values, dangerous, unmanageable fighting scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and dull, causing a dream plot that does not go anywhere. Fortunately, his next film, "Sometimes in Chaos" (which I will skip), obviously marks the end of his contract with Sonny, which means more of these horrible European accent movies and his next film Prince of Pistols he could mark the return to theaters. Damn it, he did it and Stallone will be able to do it before him (Rocchi Balboa.) This is not a furious flight. It's not even fun. It's a flight that does not even manage to take off the ground. *
