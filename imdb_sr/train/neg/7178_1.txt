Surprised and only for those who in their twenties were wearing particularly thick pink glasses, which they never saw before, because they were young. Terrible animation, dialogue and tired story. The real product of the 80's, the TOI tinker novel (this is true, TOI is not an absurd, pretentious and childish alienation "collectible action figure"), sold on the back of bad cartoons and other things, is just the thing that bought a toy were "real" children in the period from '84 'to' 87 '. He became a cult because the same adults were immature to free themselves from memory. Avoid.
