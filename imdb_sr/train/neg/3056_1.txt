Before I saw it, I saw some bad Christmas movies. But once I saw it, "Jingle All The Vai" looked better than "Kuma". "Santa Claus" is a cheerful film about Santa Claus that helps children, but it almost feels demonic watching. Grandfather's Merry Hope ho-ho-ho was replaced by an evil, devilish laugh, for which I am sure that many children have been dismissed from Christmas. The action of this massacre is very strange, which fits with all the appearances and dialogue. Santa lives high above the Earth in the North Pole where children from all over the world are preparing for Christmas. But Deda has an enemy named Pitch or Satan. Pitch is trying to destroy Santa Claus Christmas by making three boys naughty, and creating diversions, such as moving a chimney and making a door handle. When Pitch causes the Santa Claus to be attacked by a dog, it is up to Santa's assistant Pedro and Merlin, the wizard, to take Santa out of this cucumber. All about this movie, along with what's really bad, so it's bizarre. Satan dances a lot and seems much more joyful than Santa. Santa Claus talks about the delivery of gifts to all boys and girls, but it seems to only deliver up to 5 children's homes in Mexico. The reindeer leaves the toys, and when the irks are laughing, I'm amazed that it does not bring tears to the eyes of my children ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. For the first 10 minutes, Santa's just playing the body while the children sing. Probably one of the strangest scenes is Santa shooting Pitch in the bottom with a mini-top and carols are laughing about while Pitch dancing around in pain. I think it's better for parents to tell their little children where the babies come from, than to show them. The only positive thing is that you will laugh hysterically if you can appreciate a bad cinema. My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 mins.
