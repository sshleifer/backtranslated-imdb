I love quiet movies, but this was a little fraudulent. As much as I want to say that it was worth the watch when I got up, I can not. I do not think any version of the movie comes close to the book. And do not try it on the kids, they could go crazy. And the lady who played Pollianna, how old was she? 38? I know that the labor laws were different then ... But they came to people.
