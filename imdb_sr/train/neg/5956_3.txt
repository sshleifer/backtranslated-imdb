Another horrible movie in which a teenager jumping on a ball fights with a madman and his supernatural assistant who want to take control?! Yes, but the fact that this one from Canada gives you a slightly different feeling. "Brain" has a problematic teenager Jim Mayelevsky who is being treated in a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader with the help of a big ugly "brain". Can Jim stop him? I guess as our northern neighbor has achieved everything they have achieved, they have the right to make at least one funny horor movie. But nevertheless, they will probably want to be known for having national health care and everything else. Bad guy had a brain. Why did people who made this movie?
