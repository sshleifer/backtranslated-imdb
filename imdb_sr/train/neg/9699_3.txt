Despite the fact that many others thought about the first movie, I really liked it. This, however. How can we sum it up in one word?: This film is (and comes word): CRAP! But let's look at it part by piece: Here's the plot: In the end, the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snowman has other problems: Sud-Jester, her father's son, went astray while It's great, Spliss, went to the extreme to fight his gray hair and sell royal offspring for some blond and full hair. In his desperation, Snow White is seeking help from Otto Valkees, who first has to find his other six dwarfs, then tries to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name Rumpelstiltskin. It seems that the whole action was written on the weekend, where the writers were very drunk, but were under pressure from the studio to write the script. Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for lovers of the first part, or for fans of any other actor, it's really not worth buying DVDs. Trust me. The only thing that at least somehow saves the film from complete oblivion are the performances of some actors. That's why I made a move of 3/10. Unfortunately, the scenario is so bad that none of the actors or all together can not make up for a bad story. For example, at one point they even go into our reality, and unfortunately .. they do not do anything funny while they are here. However, many great actors in this film: Otto Vaalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (Especially funny): Rudiger Hoffmann as a mirror, Helge Schneider and many others more, but unfortunately all these comedians are not able to bring this really bad scenario to life. It may be a treat for some hardcore fans, but for regular movie visitors or for now renters of DVDs or customers it is not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry I rented a movie.
