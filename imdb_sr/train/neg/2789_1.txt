Savage Island (2003) is a chrome film. It's more like a home video with very minimal lighting and a terrible acting. Not only was the story and script were miserable. I do not know why this movie was shot. I've seen a lot of flicks in my time and those I really hate are movies that anger me. This swallowed my blood. The situations were at best senseless. If I had made such a movie, it would be short. Really because you "go" would not be in the picture. I'm a passionate observer of a bad movie. But this film is virtually invisible. I do not mind filming on D.V. but if you do, make the movie enjoyable, not by some tired renewal of top-of-the-line horror films (no mistake). If you come to this in the rental shop, pass by.
