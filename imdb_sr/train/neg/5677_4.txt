"Seed" is a pornography of torture ... no doubt. But, unusually, Uwe Boll wrote, produced and directed a more streamlined movie than any other that he had recorded lately. Every time I watch Boll movie, I feel that some of the script's pages are gone. There are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue. Of course, nothing makes any sense. The films are somewhat surreal in this regard. ***** SPOLERS ***** Why the six policemen who go to the arrest of Seeda are growing and leaving. their separate roads when they arrive in a darkened residence, unlike the real police officers who would enter and clean the house in pairs or triples? Why do cops never use their radio? How can the bodies break up so quickly, a process that would usually last for many months? (I KNOW that photography was in a time interval ... but Seed could never stay on schedule by killing people if he was always waiting for the previous victim to perish to the point that was shown.) How Seed gets a mask whilst waiting for the death penalty instead typical prison uniforms? How can Seed enter the maximum security enclosure, walk around the block of cells, and then come out again without stopping or even noticed? If almost 80 people (according to some newspaper articles shown in the film) are killed, why only one investigator works on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide to go to Seed to Seed's house, where he was originally arrested and where he killed his victims? (Did not he think about doing this earlier?) Why is the police detective going, without support, and even without sending dispatchers what he did and where he went? Especially frustrating when Boll obviously goes a long way from making sure to understand why an electric chair does not work properly. He spent a few minutes in setting up this movie, when he could spend it, making other aspects of the film at least a bit more logical. ***** END OF SPOILER ***** In short, the film only serves as a frame for several different scenes (perhaps Boll would think of it as his "vision") of brutal death by bludgeoning, shooting in the head, executions from electric shock, and the separation of live animals raised for their fur. (The opening scenes of the animals that were dressed were really unnecessary and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The central part is undoubtedly the deadly death of a middle-aged woman Seed by the ax. It is obvious that a lot of time has been spent on this and it reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs", although without a Steele Day soundtrack. Is this a good movie? Is it worth seeing? Only if you are a dedicated fan of pornographic genre or if you are absolutely determined to see a pattern of torture. As I said at the beginning of this review, although this film is quite disgusting and may be troubling in some points, it's really much more competent than most Bol's movies. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a director. I can only hope to continue further from torture and continue in the vein of "Post".
