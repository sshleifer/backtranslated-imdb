OK, as everyone pointed out, this movie is a complete dog. To a certain extent, this was because it was a sex movie that had a lot of material (or darkened to invisibility) to avoid X-rated censors; but the film also has many other flaws. To begin with, it seems that the scriptwriter has mingled his wolf and vampire. Bad in this film are furry and do not like silver, but in every other way they act like vampires. Now you just can not do it with a shitty genre, you have to stick to the rules of the genre, or the fans are confusing and annoying by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. The fact is that the whole (confusing and poorly represented) shop is something that has already been done for the vampires, but there is no point in the film of the insect. Second, weed-dresses are the weakest ever seen. Anyone in a wolf-dog movie should know that costumes and transformations of wolfhounds are something that critics critically evaluate, but some of these insects are just stupid. There are few few good parts. I really liked the result. Others mentioned tits Sibil Danning. And ... <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if such a thing can exist) I also very much liked the plan to attack the fortress of the insect. There are so many horror films that rely on characters to behave stupid, but in this case they first get a very reasonable and effective arsenal against the insects and go to slaughter the monsters. I mean, you can kill the bullets with silver bullets, and we've got pretty powerful weapons these days. It should not be too hard to connect two and two, hmm? But in a typical style, this movie passes over the top and adds some other very funny and fun anti-licanthrope weapons.
