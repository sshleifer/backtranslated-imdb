Well ... all in all, this film was pretty worthless, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up as a comedy. I just hired this movie last night when I and my friends went to the blockbuster in search of a scary movie. This is definitely not what we asked for, but it suited us for humor. Actors in this film (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. Especially she's a Girlfriend whenever she's in the boarding room and tells the clown to go. They do not show almost any emotion, and it's so obvious that they act. And also, when the clown looks through that paper in a black box and grabs Mark, he does not even seem to be scared even though the clown caught him and started attacking him. And seriously, would you be JOGGING if you were persecuted? I would run for my life! (Although he probably could have escaped that clown because he was about 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effects are not as big as when a clown cuts Suzanne's head into the woods, and then whenever she throws her head in embedded boards with Denise and Tuck whenever Denise returns his head. Also, as in the commentary of the previous type, the beginning has absolutely no meaning and I do not see why it is even included in the movie. So what, was this film made in 2003? Music sounded like it was made in the 1980s, and the camera (?) Does not even look professional. Half the time, it seems that the camera can not even remain calm when it's needed. All in all, I must say that I enjoyed the film. I would not recommend it if you are trying to find something to scare you, but if you are looking for something you may be laughing or laughing, I would recommend it safely.
