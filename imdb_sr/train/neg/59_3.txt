The protocol is an incredible movie whose only rescue grace is played by Goldie Havn along with good acting actors. The story revolves around a wacky waitress who becomes famous after she inadvertently saved the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill to half the film, and Goldie's charm just does not save this movie. Unless you're a fan of Goldie Havn, do not go on the road to see this movie.
