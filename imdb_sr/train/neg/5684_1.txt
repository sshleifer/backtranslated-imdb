poorly managed garbage. a central nihilistic sadistic topfest ... if you are the person who loves it ... see a psychiatrist. Even if you are that person, it does not make it a good movie, the acting is really bad, the story is full of complications, the director should really give up and find the right job because there is no talent for this. I see why people do not like getting sick ... we had a few of his films lately and this is the best of them, which is really sad! The complete absence of any humanity seems to fit some people, but here they just go away. Horror films can be full of devastation, they can be miniature works of art, can only be good looking when there is nothing else ... SEED is really very poor.
