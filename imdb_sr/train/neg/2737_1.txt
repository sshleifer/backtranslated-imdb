There is no spoiler in this review. There's nothing to mess up. No complication, nothing; Most pistols show a bar attempt to tie clips with the plot, but they did not do it. Clips, three lines that lead to the next endless sequence of boring snippets ... OK, they may have had little time to produce, but it would be better to skip this episode. What a waste of time. I'm not sure how this is done. Scrubs is usually much better in undermining the tropics, but somehow this has passed .... Thank the heavens that they have returned to form until the next episode.
