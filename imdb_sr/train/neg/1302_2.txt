This film is just like every other Dutch film, so if you enjoy movies such as Turkish fruits and de Kleene's blondes. then it might be ok with this (although these two have a lot better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts strong enough, but even that one good scene ends with no connection to the story. There is a lot of nudity (but I and others simply could not think that this girl is attractive), the dialogue is ridiculous (as we have done a lot for harassing other filmmakers), and some scenes are so accidental that this is more than an unintentional comedy than anything else (as a random scene in which an eye oozes someone's eyes ... it has nothing to do with anything and is mentioned only once later in the sentence: "Did you hear what happened ... I was there"). The only reason I gave it was because some of the places they look nice ... that's it. The reason I saw it was because we went to a brief review (here in the Netherlands we have a weird system that relates to spy checks, then you pay less money for a regular movie and you do not know which movie you will be All you know is that this is a new movie that is not in the cinema yet. My advice is to stay away from this movie if you really want to see a good Dutch movie theater or a zircboek.
