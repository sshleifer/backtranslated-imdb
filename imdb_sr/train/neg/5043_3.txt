I'm a big fan of Ziii Zhang and I go to any movie to see her, and that's what took me to Purple Butterfly. As much as I wanted to love this movie, I have to agree with many others who commented on it. It's very confusing and very slow. Since it seems that all the film is shot using a handheld camera, significant parts of the movie are out of focus. The film has very little dialogue and what does not tell you much. There are endless scenes of people just standing around cigarette smoking or sitting in a room that stares at each other without talking. The way in which time changes in the movie is also very confusing and difficult to track. Even after I read a number of reviews in advance and had a general idea of ​​what the film was, it was still difficult for me to understand what was going on. Previously, I knew that the film was not similar to Ziii Zhang's previous films, but I rejoiced what I would look like in something different, but unfortunately, in the end, I was disappointed. She never laughs in this movie, though, though, most of the time she has nothing to laugh at. I could have no sexual scenes like they were without sex and without any apparent feeling among the participants, as you can hope for.
