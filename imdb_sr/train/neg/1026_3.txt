Vov. I do not think I've ever seen a movie with so many big actors that have played such a key role, so that's wrong. Justin Timberlake was perhaps the only worst actor to have played a major part in the star-power film and the money behind him that Edison had. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, hell, even LL Cool J was fine because he had a number of small parts he could cut his teeth. As the director and film company realized that Timberlake was ready for that role, there is no way to understand it. to cover his sad ass, and he should be a hero ... I would not spend money on this in the theater or on the video. MOST, if you have HBO and you have nothing else to do on Saturday night, and you are drunk and stoned, this may be fine. Frog 'acting in the Hollywood blockbuster, simply did not work at all.
