This must be the cheapest film made in the 21st century. That's all at a low level, but ultimately it falls below ... everything. All cheap tricks - such as flash and darkness - are used to hide these crappy computer effects. All actors are below the average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene, to which Anne asks: "Why do you look so careless?" The correct answer is because it can not work. No matter what happened (the world will be destroyed, her friend dies, she is fired), she has the same stupid smile on her face. It's not just a movie, which is B-quality. This is also a description of the back (at least in Finland). The text mentions things such as Lorica Grai-vessel, Capital-News and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like a different movie, a figure that is called Fletcher and sea monsters
