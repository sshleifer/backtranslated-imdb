Mighty Morphin Pover Rangers must be the worst television show ever made. There is no complication, only a bunch of stupid costumed kids using martial arts while dressed in another class of spandex. Special effects seem to be from the '70s, costumes look like something bad comedy, and the show is simply terrible. The only thing that is worse than television shows are toys, just plastic waste that is given to other children. It has much better performance for your kids to watch! Try to give your children something like Nickelodean, and the shows actually have some intelligence behind, unlike the Rover Rangers.
