I tried to watch this movie without the opportunity to really go through it, because it is supposed to have a "good" message; The problem is that it is obviously produced in accordance with one particular interpretation of the Scriptures. In my opinion, the interpretation will entice many people. In addition, I was a film maniac and acting in this movie was completely unacceptable. Never before did I want a negative rating to evaluate the movie. So, if you want to be constantly preached by those who have no authority, then be sure to take this film. This commentary is also a warning to people who love or love scifi, because the title will deceive many people. It was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had opportunities and these opportunities were scattered. The only redeemable movie is that I realized that the character in "Time Machine" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage over the strange behavior of those in his future.
