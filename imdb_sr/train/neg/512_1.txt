It comes to my mind that some of the films that were banned during cinema were actually very important and very good films. I would argue that, instead of banning challenging, controversial films, censors should consider banning movies that are so bad to pose a threat to your IK and your common sense. If they did, one of the first films to be hurriedly shackled would undoubtedly be Stroker Ace. This film is horrible with the main 'A'. It's the worst movie in which Burt Reinolds ever performed ... pretty good for a man with Cannonball Run II, Cop and A Half, and Rent-A-Cop in his CV! The story of a tiny story introduces us to a successful driver, Stroker Ace (Reinolds), a man who loves fast cars and quick women. He will be stuck in a humiliating contract with the distorted promoter Clide Torkle (Ned Beatti). The contract requires him to do some degrading promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants, such as dressing as a huge chicken. Lugs (Jim Nabors), Ace's imaginary friend and Pembrook Feenei (Loni Anderson), a bimbo with a brain that is fractionally smaller than a pea that spurs Aceom, is added to the mix. Hal Needham, director of this low-quality garbage, used to be a stuntman and made a number of films that rely on his expertise in setting up spectacular acrobatics and auto racing. Some of these films were fine, such as "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but with "Stroker Ace" he reaches his career. The characters are so dumb that you really feel sorry for the actors who play them. Anderson is particularly burdened with such a stupid role that he makes you melt his teeth from despair. Humor is bad and infantile throughout the whole time, and the stunt and racing sequences are incomparable. Even recordings during the final points (which can be found in all Reinolds-Needham's) are mostly unusual, which gives the impression that the movie may not have been fun. "Stroker Ace" is a stink of considerable size.
