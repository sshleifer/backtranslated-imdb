I only had the luxury to watch this movie once I was pretty young so much of the film was blurred in an attempt to remember it. However, I can say that it was not as funny as a movie called Tomato Killer should have been, and the most memorable things in this movie are the song and the scene with the older couple that talks about the poor Timmy. In addition, the film is actually just a scene of small tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people behave frightened and exaggerated as people should work in a movie of this type. However, just have a very stupid premise and an attractive song not a good comedy to do. However, this film should be film B, nothing should be taken seriously, however, you should make jokes that are funny and you do not try to expand the mildly fun premise into a full movie. Maybe a short one would be good, because the trailer showed the older couple mentioned above and the man who desperately tries to lower the bigger tomato is actually quite good. The trailer itself looked like a fake trailer, but none of them made a full movie, and pretty weak at that.
