I read a man from Kings books as Bachman and I felt like the main hero of John and his family. This movie could have been much more. Issue? It was set up during a great action game. I watched a movie and I was in pain for the whole thing. I did not feel anything for the character and less for his thing. Yes, she had funny scenes (or funny) even though I do not think it saved a movie in my eyes. If you read the book, you can feel the climax and fire in the heart of John until he receives his final vengeance. Maybe it was not so low that I did not read the book.
