Nikolay Gogol's "Vii" story was re-recorded and released on a home video in the United States via Faith Films. The original story refers to a priest who has to watch the body of the witch only with his faith to protect him. Expanded and set up in America, although clearly recorded in Russia (houses, clothes and furniture are wrong in spite of English characters), this is an unusual movie that does not work. It's hard to be an American, but it's obviously not. There are some strange, deliberately twisted moments as the main character that the journalist at the beginning and the priest are shortly afterwards. I'm not sure why they did it, even after watching DVD recording. Another problem is dubbing that is out of fear. This is done so that everyone speaks when their lips are not on the camera - or if the voices do not even match their lips. I do not know if his fault is Faith Films or the producers who made the film hoping to throw it in the West (discovered in the making of pieces). The film is not very good. As I said, there are all kinds of technical problems that just make this strange ball. Despite some really hot horror images, the movie never works as a horror movie. As a film that creates faith, he is too confused in this conviction that it would make everyone feel closer to God. Given the choice, I would give him a pass, even at a reasonable price. My advice would be to find the version of the sixties, called Vii, which will bring a little trembling and a little understanding of belief in God.
