I went to see this movie in the movies and I was shocked when I entered the room. Only me and my girlfriend! This sounded to me that this film is not very good. Not to my surprise, the film was horrible. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. It's a very foreseeable story with which he falls in love with a girl who hates him. His acting is okish, but for the comic aspect of the film it's not very good. The plot line is bad, and the comedy is almost nonexistent. However, there are some good things. For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny. Hope this review prevents other people from spending money. I was very uncomfortable when I left the room !!!
