With an absolutely incredible acting and team, this may have been a classic. Instead, it is a repeat of the paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories that existed in 1979 about the killing of the JFK, quite absurdly, on the vaguely incoherent story of the killing of the fictitious President Kegan in 1960. Enough to do - Sterling Haiden or Eli Vallach, for example, or are asked to go pretty crazy at the top - John Huston. However, Jeff Bridges and Antoni Perkins are able to make a very good statement in very different ways. The photo is wonderful, but it does not justify the hour and a half of your life, not the price. DVD purchase.
