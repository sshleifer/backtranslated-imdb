It's hard to believe that the film from this book has managed to surpass his horror! The plot is so fictitious and incredible. . . starting from laying a tone of guilt on a little child to spare her pain! Then we have a secret behavior of at least six, and maybe more people (including priests) involved in what is everywhere crime. Then we have a woman who looks like a ferry ride from a relatively happy to very short hit in the tracks. Very unpleasant and cowardly mother, supported, supported and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving a place from the island off the coast of South Carolina did not help the story, although it may have helped the film makers' budgets. Very beautiful buildings, allegedly located in the monastery, appeared to be not matching a logical island that was small enough to require a golf cart and so small ferry service. Kim Basinger, whom I really love, is painfully skinny in this film, and her hairstyle certainly belongs to another decade. Also, there is no chemistry between her and any of the male leaders at all. I completely dislike the book from which this was taken, but I read it all. The film that I continued to surf back and forth, I had to go whenever the music of saccharin became too much. Unless you love an incredible story, a wooden act, a distorted mix of religious / mythological / allegory, my advice is to skip this one. Oh, and maybe a little criticism, but would not a caring father have a life jacket for a small child on a small ship? The best part of this movie is a scene
