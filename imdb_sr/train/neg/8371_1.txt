I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made. When I saw the trailer on TV, I knew immediately from the other one that it would be a piece of **** and that it was best to avoid it, but I kind of got in the way to see it from some friends, I entered the cinema with low expectations, but I was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs that would keep me awake during this film. The so-called "jokes" in this film bring confusion to the face, mostly consisting of people who hit the face and the balls, the baby looks weird and behaves like a pink gangsta and typical jokes on a race that we see so often in today's garbage. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe, it is also predictable and boring. The characters are extremely boring and very stereotyped. I will never have to see this **** movie, I'd rather throw a bullet in the foot than be exposed to this fucking fuck ever. If anyone I see says he likes them, I will physically hit them in the face
