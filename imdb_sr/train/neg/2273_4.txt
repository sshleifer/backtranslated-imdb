It was not the biggest disaster I expected, but it is as positive as I can be in the description of the movie. I'm not sure what's supposed to be funny in this movie, but I guess it's all a matter of taste. Personally, it does not seem funny for me to watch the morons who live their idiotic lives or the real fools of themselves on television, but again, I am not a fan of the pathetic daily talk show of Jerry Springer. I was not too bored watching this, but definitely I never enjoyed it. If you're in the mood to see a bad movie, but one that is not too painful to crawl, this is a good choice.
