It's obvious that many people love this, but I found it to be a infantile and quite offensive codsvallop, preserved from Jane Russell's forgetfulness and several unforgettable music numbers, especially the opening ones (but in the later invention there was a pronounced sauce). I do not work with Monroe - she should play a stupid blonde that's not that stupid, but only comes as stupid. Russell can not convince himself when he claims he has never been in high school, but he is otherwise quite beautiful. Men are astoundingly uninteresting, as is the plot. It is by no means terrible, but so messy that, if this is a classic, God helps us all.
