this film is simply one of the worst films ever made and represents a convicting indictment not only for the British film industry, but for talented talentless people who are working today. Not only did the movie get mainstream distribution, it also has a good British actor, so what's wrong then? I do not know, and it's just not enough for me to get involved in the debate because the movie was so scary that it does not deserve any thought at all. Be warned and stay away from this garbage. but obviously I need to write ten lines of text in this review so that I can describe the action in detail. A man is set up by his evil friends and associates from his father's company and thus leads to a meeting with the Russian mafia and touching accents and stupid, very stupid complications. I should have been looking for my money back, but maybe I was still in shock because of that experience. if you want a good movie about the crime, watch the usual suspects or the coups, what about the lock, the stock ... it's the pinnacle of contemporary British cinema crime ...
