This movie is horrible. The story refers to a woman who is trying to find out what happened to her sister. The film combats its identity, going from Noir / Thriller to eroticism, with elements of horror that have been inserted for good measure. The film has a very confusing structure, for example, with frequent use of flashbacks, without being bound in the story. The action was badly developed, and because of the characterization, it was difficult to distinguish who and who played. In many films there are some inconsistencies, but the scene in which the main protagonist willingly follows a virtual stranger into his home, then agrees to go up (where he says he will find the phone), minus the gun he brought with him, to call the police, was too much hard to believe. Some of the cinemas are very bad: we watched on a 42-inch TV, so anyone with a smaller set could discover what is happening in scenes shot in almost complete darkness above me.
