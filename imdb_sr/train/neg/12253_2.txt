I never thought that the movie could be so cruel, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrible acting, horrible plot, terrible effects. The Crocodile was horrible and as far as the stupid sex / murder of the scene was in one, it was a bad move from the word. It was really shocking and it's not a compliment! How can one make this film, watch it back and then actually say: "Yes, that's a good movie.
