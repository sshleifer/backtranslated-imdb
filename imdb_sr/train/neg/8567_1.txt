When I rented this movie, I had very low expectations ... but when I saw it, I realized that the film was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... that she could work for a Disney movie (except for murder), but this is not a comedy, it's a funny masterpiece of stupidity. The title was well selected, except for one thing: they could add a stupid movie after Dead Husbands! I give her 0 and a half of five.
