There is no possible reason to understand why this film has ever been shot. Why does Hollywood have to continue with a terrible change of one classic after another? (Cases: Mister Magoo, Avengers - terrible!) Christopher Lloyd, whom I normally enjoy, was so miserably wrong in this role. His manly portrait of our beloved "Uncle Martine" is so inexpressibly unsuitable to be almost criminal. His rumbling, groans, grimaces and hystericity give us no reason to take care of his character except as a dimensional cartoon character. "The slapstick had some similarity to the comedy." He obviously said to EVERYONE that they act like they have red ants in their pants. The guilty must lie with an irresponsible letter. I think the author used "It's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" as an example of a fine comedy scenario. As a classic in 1963, he is far superior to this trap - in fact - suddenly it looks pretty good compared to that. to like the little kids. I'm just not sure for whose children it's made. Surely you do not know a child who is confident in carrying a card! If they had to process "My Favorite Martian," why did not they add some timeless charm to the original classic? Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not factor "zero" as a rating for its readers, it's the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty. One good thing came from this movie, the actors and the team were paid - I think.
