The moment you give 'art film' 1/10, you have people who are working for your ignorant, half-ass, art retarded blood. I'm not going to try to justify that I am not an aesthetically challenging retard, listing all the 'art house cinema' that I liked or mentioned as an unknown 'cult classic' 10/10. All I ask is for someone to explain to me the point, purpose and message of this film. Here's how to make a movie: Opening three unrelated urban legends that show almost absurd levels of coincidence. After that follows (in short, it saves you 3 hours of pain) the next - Children's playroom dying from lung cancer tries to patch things up with your daughter who is dependent on a coke that she may or did not rape when she was a child, and whom the police officer is involved in problems with the connection, while the contestant of the star of the game decided that she does not want to be an unsuccessful wonder of the child, the fate that hit another game of the 60s competitors we see now is now a homeless, jobless, in love with a bartender with prostheses and who needs money for a 'corrective' while the producer of the game, who is dying of lung cancer, is asking his male nurse to help him patch himself with his son who left a few years ago, and who later became a guru for self-help, even while the other woman's wife the producer suffers from a pain of guilt because she deceived a dying man; and oh, in the end, frogs fall (you have read correctly). And I spared you incredibly long and meaningless, virtually wandering monologues that seem to make each character come on the move without any rhyme or reason except that it is possible to make sure that the movie is over 3 hours and to be classified as a 'modern epic'. You probably think that I could better make a movie compression (and not confuse me) that I wrote the damn thing a bit more coherent, perhaps in a few sentences instead of just one ... Well, now you know how I feel.
