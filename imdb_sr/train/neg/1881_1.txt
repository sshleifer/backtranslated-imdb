This movie is bullshit. Something about a heat wave in a European country, a complete garbage. Nothing is happening for this movie. Maybe 30 seconds of sex, but that's it. There is a very boring fish that drives people and really irritates me. This film is a complete rash and you should not subject it to watching. I'm sorry it's very boring. I would evaluate zero, but I can not. No body in their common sense should see this. I'm sure you'll regret it completely. How could they come up with something so bad. Even the Mystery men were better. MISTERS MEN. It's bullshit. That movie is not worth making. completely wasting time. The characters in this are very difficult to understand and I'm really very boring to me.
