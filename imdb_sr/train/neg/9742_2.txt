This is a pretty boring film about a scientist who creates a teleporter and becomes terribly disorganized when using a transport machine. A simple action made before the flight and others. Not only is he disfigured, he can also electrically hit people by touch. What is really stupid in this movie is that we are expected to believe that the place where this man works against him. He could probably earn millions for the institution he works in, but the head of the institution is trying to sabotage his teleporter at every step. Finally, a projected man throws three people out for no reason, then goes for those who hurt him.
