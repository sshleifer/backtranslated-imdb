It was the third attempt by Stroheim's director - he's pretty rough and shows nothing of exceptional talent for the camera and master assembly that he will show a few years later with his masterpieces, GREED and THE VEDDING MARCH. In fact, we have three graffiti masked as a Russian count and two Russian princesses who rent a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use counterfeit money for gambling tables and win the fortune. Part of this plan is that the Count (von Stroheim) is imposed between the American ambassador and his "foolish" wife, sucking her up and hoping to get some money playing on her weaknesses. He makes a mistake by taking the life savings of a maid, whom he promised to marry. When she sees them together, she lights the room, (von Stroheim and his prey are on the balcony of the room). Here Strohajmen first establishes his personality as "the man you love to hate." He is completely bad, and his character traits lead him to a very bad and deserved end. The film is rude in its cinema and montage, and it is not worth seeing it unless you are fascinated by the director. Sweet piece - when she first tries to meet her ambassador's wife, she reads the book - we see the title - FOLIC WOMEN, Erich von Stroheim. This was originally conceived as a 210-minute film, filmed for 140 minutes in the studio and finally released for 70 minutes. Renewing Cinema Video returns surviving footage (damaged in some way in most scenes) from an alternative earlier to give us a 107-minute print.
