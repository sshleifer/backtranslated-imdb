Keenan Ivory Vaians is probably one of the worst directors, I swear she has no right to know how to make movies. he made a brilliant film and it's a scary movie. Scari movie 2 was also fine, but everything else that Keenan made was real disasters. Avoid such addresses as if you are not a threat to the southern center while you drink your juice in the hood ..... I know what a title !!! Obviously this film, all that Keenans has in his rewards. It was an hour and a half on the stupid stupidity that never made me laugh. just believe me this, maybe women might like this movie because of some things that happen, but in general this movie will never love anyone with good taste in movies ....... ....... jd Seaton
