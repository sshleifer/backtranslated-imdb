I was very surprised to see that this film had such a good rating, when I looked at IMDb after I saw it. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen many bad movies. It looks like a good movie in the beginning, but when it comes to surgery, I could not believe how bad it was. This voice interrupts EVERYTHING! Imagine that you are so open and then listen to what he says. I saw a movie in German, so I do not know what he said in English, but ironic things like "Yes, do not hurt"? ... what is this? Speaking to yourself, "think about something else" and then forget your pain just thinking about your girlfriend is just ... stupid. And his mother ... how the hell does she understand something like that? Somebody came to tell her, her son died on the operation (what she somehow expected). In addition, she found some letters in the bag of Jessica Albas. plus "she knows the hospital" ... and then she needs "one second" to understand it? What the hell? ^^ And the end ... why the police break them? The patient died in the operation, that's all that happened. This drunken doctor knows nothing else ... and then they break them all, even the girl ??? Why??? Despite all this, I think that Christensen did a bad job, but that does not mean much for me ... and the mistakes and nonsense I have written above are a problem. I watched this movie with some friends and we were all very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... Just do not watch it;)
