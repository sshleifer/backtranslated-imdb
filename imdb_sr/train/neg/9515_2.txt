OK, I was watching the original French version. But I can not imagine this is better with the subtitles. All I have to say is that this is the most boring film I've seen for a long time. In this film, there are almost no redeemable qualities. So I can not understand all the positive reviews. It can be realistic in the sense, but some true stories are best left to unknowing. Usually I like movies in a slow pace as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. Solaris Tarkovsky is extremely slow, but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film, for example. But, in this case, the film is just submitted with a foolish dialogue that makes us talk little about the characters. I could not identify or worry about anything. In many scenes, I realized, "When will he shut up"? The acting was pretty bad. Not in an excessive way. But none of the actors seemed to care for their characters and everyone seemed to want to be somewhere in most of the scenes. That could be due to the uninspired dialogue they received. The whole stream of the film was quite mechanical. Moving from one scene to another. It seems that this film was only written (bad), but it was never addressed. This is one of several movies that I can say that they did not produce any emotional response from any scene. No tension, no fear, no expectation, no sadness, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest whatsoever. Perfect example of what I call anti-film.
