I admit I may have seen five minutes "Jerry Springer". I do not consider myself a snob, but I really think that I am above watching what is in his show. And you should rise above that. I saw this film as part of a social events event that I was leading. I'm told that this film really does not have much to do with Springer itself, but that it is focused on the lives of those who will appear on "Springer". Sorely better, this film may have been a fascinating look at how much the lives of these people are really poor. I admit, I felt the excitement of empathy towards Kony (Molly Hagan). That's all there is in life. How sad she feels she must go to Jerry's play to solve it. I'm really sorry that Molly Hagan appears in this. Have you noticed that after this film, it is mostly broadcast on "B" roles on TV? I'll tell you about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I do not doubt that she is very serious in her acting and is trying to play her role with much empathy. The problem is that Hagan can not carry the scene alone. It simply does not have what it takes to play the lead. Her best work will always be Angel's "Herman's Head" (a show that was not great, but his heart was in the right place) and when she was visiting "Seinfeld" as sister Robert.
