I must say that I am really surprised by the high marks for this film. I found it absolutely idiotic. Does the mother receive "visions" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice did her vision to continue ... It looked so funny. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was terrible. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori had a good job and most of them supported what they had to do. Usually I like LMN and I am very open to movies, but this movie seemed to have a funny plot over my head and it just was not for me.
