The event is not worth the discussion, even if it suggests corruption, murder, power and other topics related to the thriller. The characters are sometimes interesting. It's not real but interesting. Development is slow as a tea tasting ceremony. Visual images are not amazing, but good enough to alleviate eye strain. Good movie for watching after dinner before bed - nothing too shocking, nothing exciting exciting. Sitcom style. I loved Voodi - great performance. I had to fight the inadequacy of the shop and did the job pretty well. The rest is tolerable, though very predictable. The whole is visible and better than most TV shows.
