...... in the horror movie. Okay, first, let's start with Kate. Its main goals are to put George Clooney, it looks good and last but not least. I have to love her. She had about 3 pretty good chances to finish this game, but ... instead she ran. I mean, she did not want to take Gaya for 10 minutes and when she did it, it was too late. I mean, the guy tried to rape her. I can not get into those movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean, who would have sincerely sympathy for a guy who ends up with everyone who is meeting at night. The movie continued. And as a result, he lost his credibility.
