The return is one of those films for this niche group of people who love films that at the same time carry and confuse them. Sara Michelle Gellar plays a poor business woman who does not kill a vampire or does not cheat anywhere. I was willing to deal with this, but I was not willing to deal with the worst editions ever combined with meaningless flashbacks. In the end, it turned out that she was breaking the car in her while she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong and it was just a flashback. With this film it's impossible to say. Can you trust the same guy who made the Army of Darkness produced this shit? It's a much better idea to stay at home and watch the Darkness on the Sci Fi channel. That movie had everything: whores, zombies and a guy with a power chip. The forgotten did not even have one of these things.
