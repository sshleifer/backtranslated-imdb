If there were a scale below 1, it would get -10, following the steps of Godspella. The act (if there was such a thing) was terrible, a complication of confusion. And Rene Russo was a painfully sweet guy in his role, enough to retire. Ten inches for a stupid movie. Saving grace: kudos for era costuming.
