Ana lives with her family in a new residential area outside the city. She and her husband, Sebastian, have not spoken for years. While she was on a working visit abroad, her colleague committed suicide. Anna was deeply impressed by her death, although she hardly knew her. No one seems to know why she took her life. For the first time Anna understands that one of your loved ones may be unknown. Ana does not mention the incident at home and begins to look at her husband and child. Guernsey is a story about a woman who suddenly begins to look at her life. And she wondered how much she had separated from the people who were closest to her. (This is my translation of the synopsis on the cover of the DVD. I hope it will be useful to you because this movie does not have IMDb Plot Summaries yet on this date.)
