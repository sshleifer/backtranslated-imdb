Ah VINTER KILLS, based on the Richard Condon novel that deals with the plot that killed the president of the United States 20 years ago. I knew that Kondon wrote a MANDAR CANDIDATE that dealt with a similar topic and rejoiced to see the intelligent thriller. THE WINTER EARLY WAS LEFT TO HIM. It's not a thriller - it's a piece of useless crap, probably the worst movie I've ever seen this month and a boy I saw a lot of bad films in June. The problem lies in the direction and the scenario, and since Villiam Richert was responsible for both, then he should blame it completely for this unbridled Farce. There are two things in this film. First, the way everything is shown in a completely superior manner. It's not like an OTT as it's something like a James Bond film with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but it all has a fake advantage in the fact that the actors are completely mugging their performances. This may have been justified if the movie was fun, but it's gone. As a satire, it's very stupid, so silly that it becomes almost invisible. Second, it seems that the scenes are so cut out that they have become meaningless. Take, for example, a scene where the hero faces a rotten leader of the police called Davson. Davson tells the hero that he has 30 seconds to start, and then switches on to the hero on the plane. Scenes begin and end without rhymes or reasons <br /> <b> The awesome movie that's hard to try
