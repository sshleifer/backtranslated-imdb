There is a remark that one of the heroin was raped on a "drunken assault" by Russian soldiers, which is completely untrue. This film should not only be shown for this reason. Also there is a statement by someone that the KGB has processed "Jews, Gypsies, etc.", which is "worse than the Nazis". The KGB asked the so-called. "Zionist" agents, who were (KGBs) imperialist agents. This is completely different from targeting the Jews as an entire nation, just as the Nazis did. Gypsies have never been processed. The KGB was a political tool and was used politically, but from an internationalist point of view. Communists did not really make a difference between nationality. Full movie smells like fake. The main hero does not speak Russian, signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, the general KGB looks completely fake. Some so-called. "Russian proverbs" are completely fictitious, and the list continues. It is not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies and false things. Instead, go to the "Good Shepherd".
