I am a fan of the previous best films. But this was terrible. No wonder it was hard for me to find him. I tried 4 video rental shops, until I found one with a copy of this movie. The acting was terrible, the action was a joke, and the action was bad. I really miss Alek Gradi, Travis Briglei, and the original kikboks characters and the theme that this film had with the first 2 films. John
