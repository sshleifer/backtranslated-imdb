... which is not exactly a bell-approval. All in all, "DinoCroc" was a much better movie. Certainly, in that film, Matt Borlenghi played a complete bag that cried the whole film about his little brother who ate DinoCroc. But the special effects in "DinoCroc" were better, the drawings were better, and the performance better. Here's the problem with "Surfing the Blood" - 1) The Crocodile Killer looks like a children's model with a forked fork. 2) The action is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. experienced a shipwreck on an abandoned island, in which they encounter a furious group of ugly Filipino residents trying to impose on women in the group. It was a complete loss of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there is not enough time for crocodiles. There are several redemption qualities of "Blood Surf" - the actresses are quite attractive and Matt Borlenghi ate the crocodile at the end of the film. But if you are on a bedside bed and you only have enough time to watch one Matt Borlenghi / Crocodile Killer movie, skip this and insert "DinoCroc" instead.
