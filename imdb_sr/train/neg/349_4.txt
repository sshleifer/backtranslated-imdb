A boiler for a pot if I've ever seen it. The supposed thriller who borrowed from "A Time to Kill," "The Silence of the Lambs", even the reverse "In the Heat of the Night" with a slight reversal of murder, and "Strangers on the Train", thrown into it, collapsed where all the above stated to a great extent succeeded. Namely, in the delivery of excitement. The action seemed to be condensed out of a larger book, making the plot obvious and uninteresting, while the direction is lacking in rhythm and weight. In order to conceal any honor, a big reversal had to be delivered and this can not be felt here. Coneri obviously slows down in age, barely trying to try to accentuate the American accent, and in addition, it seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of those who cursed him. He even has a father who is younger than him. Laurence Fishburne barely gets a chance to play his role and from the beginning you are confused whether he is a bad or a good guy. Someone once said that they should not lie to memories - they do it, confused, here. The rest of the play is only an average reasonable role in their stereotyped roles. And the superior climax managed to turn around by leaving me firmly drawn in the back, not as it should have been, the front edge of my seat. Certainly the middle negligent Hollywood movie.
