This film was probably the greatest loss of my life ever. The acting was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show any disturbing emotions. At the beginning of the film, she should have been discouraged. Instead, she pulled her head off with her lower lip. She cried grudgingly without tears for the crying scene. I almost got angry that all the girls who wanted to be actresses had to get it out. All others also suffered from excessive action. It was embarrassing. It was also an insult to skaters. It took Jordan a month to train and they dropped her as a person making the Olympic team. He practically spits on real sliders in his work. Poor excuse for a movie and a poor attempt to connect hockey and skating. He does not lose his life. He does not deserve even one star.
