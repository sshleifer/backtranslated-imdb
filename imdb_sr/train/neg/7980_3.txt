This comedy service, for which Peter Marshall (brother Joanne Drew and later Hollywood hosts) and Tommy Noonan were disappointed as "the new Levis and Martin" is just shy of horror: a few random eye gadgets are inserted, everyone is talking fast and nothing works properly - there is a scene in which Noonan throws shells on officers and politicians in anger; they are about five feet away, Noonan inserts them between them, and the complete reaction is that they all grow. In the midst of the horror that was freed only by the attraction of Julie Nevmar, there are several lightening moments: Marshall and Noonan engage in occasional double-talk and argufiing attacks, and their timing is almost perfect-obviously they were well illuminated comedy couple. It's not enough to save this party, unfortunately.
