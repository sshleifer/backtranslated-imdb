As a South African, it's an insult when someone is really paid for the production of this nonsense! Despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original Shaka Zulu mini, this "addition" to the series is terrible! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played a major role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. The action of this film, however, is nothing but stupidity, written by a writer from the bottom of the barter. While Omar Sharif and Henry Chele are good actors, what David Hasselhoff works here , saving the drowned slaves with their red buoy and a smile? I was constantly expecting a blonde, a woman's fury to emerge from nowhere and running across the screen in her little red swimwear, for no reason. It was not that it was anything more bizarre than the fantastic line of intrigue that was probably conceived after a beer beer at the fan's dress, where someone's cavity costume inspired the writer to return to the African theme for his next "blockbuster".
