I thought "Intensive Care" was pretty bad and very inadvertently funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it's a bit tense, but it's never a good shoker. SPOJLER BACK The fun lies in funny moments. But the classic moment of all time is the following: Peter (Koen Vauters) was stabbed and beaten by the killer. He lies lying in the corner of the hallway. Ami (Nada van Nie) kneels next to him and asks: "Poor Peter, can I help you?" This film is filmed in Dutch and English. In order to save on costs, all license plates are USA, and the backbone in the newsroom is the Manhattan horizon. Very funny if you are Dutch and watch the original version in Dutch.
