This film is a very bad attempt to use the classical theme for money. I loved Superman movies, but this made me kill myself. Very bad acting, unusual special effects and plots equal to zero. To summarize: Superman leaves the country because scientists have discovered parts of his mother planet, some have been in the universe (spirit), they do not tell their girlfriend anything before they leave (ghost again), summer in a spaceship (?!?) Back, I think 5 years later, and I am looking forward to reunion with his girlfriend (who now tears my son, which son, in my humble opinion, has at least 7 years). What about Lek Luthor? Are you trying to develop a new continent to sell land? Please! I vote for 1 out of 10 for this movie, just because I'm not allowed to vote 0. If you have something else to do with your time, do not go to see this movie, and even if you do not have anything Other to work, stay home and watch TV!
