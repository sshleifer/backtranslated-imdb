Arg. The mixed dinosaurs have come back to take another bit of our common sense in this terrible third film. This time, European terrorists (to say IRAQ) had a military convoy that should transport uranium. They get into the shipyard, they open a truck and discover our old friends carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes to visit when rubber dinosos are leaked by terrorists, police officers and some marines. It seems that the entire movie (again) is mostly inspired by Alien (like Carnosaur 2) with pathetic Marines who went through a "claustrophobic" shipyard? weapons ready. This third opus is probably the most beautiful and the most popular movie, with just one blood spike when a rubber dinar decomposes the head of a marine. The dynops are stiff, they change the creatures as usual, and T-Ray sounds like an angry elephant when it gets stuck (it also seems to have no eyes). One of the most beautiful scenes of the film is when the policemen arrive on the scene: they enter the building where the truck is seized and hear some strange sound coming from another truck. At the opening, surprise! Gang for reptiles exploded and swallowed them. Why are the dinos locked in another truck after they escaped from the first? How did they lock up, because the door of the truck could be locked only from the outside? What was the purpose of shooting this scene ???? Oh, bother, who cares? Both thumbs are for big size Iguana.
