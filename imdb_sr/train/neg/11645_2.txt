This is a preview of 'Freddi Mercuri The Untold Story', a theater release, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the finest, non-inspired and most boring biographical documentaries I've ever seen. If the film I saw on the movie was originally posted on TV, I would ask its producers and distributors not to deceive the paid audience with the false promise of a cinematic documentary film. Even as a documentary made for TV, a sentimental solo piano accompaniment accompanying interviewed individuals in front of floral arrangements in hotel rooms and pompous, pseudo-literary narratives were more about the dormitory Infomercial bed. The only aspects of this "untold story of Freddie Mercury" - or, uhm, were "The Untold Story of Princess Diana" original concerts, videos and TV shows - uncovered Freddi Mercuri and Kueen. Experiential interviews with unimportant eye-catching eyes, such as: "He was a free spirit" (really ... I thought Freddy Mercuri was a man in the company ...) disparaging those Freddie's statements, from Brian Mai or Montserrat Caballe who threw a new and kind light into Merkur's complex life and character. And ... what about Harry Potter as a school boarding school? How did the interview with the first girlfriend-in love ("... now working at the travel agency") and members of Freddie's first school band contributed to what I really want to know about Merkur? The vital milestones of his personal life, of his sexuality, of his artistic style and of growth, Kueen, the band remains unexplored. These filmmakers do not pose any provocative question, nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their topic, instead of completing the boring montage of politely clean and very empty comments about an enigmatic and great rock legend, which does not deserve. To remember by the biography of the historical channel, your grandparents can fall asleep Sunday night.
