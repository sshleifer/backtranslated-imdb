He must agree with another reviewer. This must be the worst movie, let alone the western one I've ever seen. A terrible acting, a dialogue that was unimaginable and pathetic (let alone completely inappropriate for the alleged existence of the 1800s), and oh, did I mention a battery that was pointed at the back of one of the characters? I waited for the boom microphone to fall in the middle of the scene. And the end? The least I can say is that it was in line with the rest of the movie ... totally awful. And yes, it contained every clich√© in the book from a slow walk to an empty dusty path to a funny "remember when" when the main character died. Fortunately, I saw it on a free TV. Do not waste your time.
