This Italian action / sci-fi hybrid with budget, which is a starving budget, is characterized by David Varbeck as a reporter from Miami who was elected by the ghosts of Atlantis (!) To stop the evil businessman nominated for the Oscar-winning John Ireland to use telepathic the fetus using spores from the asteroid to rule the world. You got all that? Despite this desperate plot, this is actually pretty boring and RAIDERS ATLANTIS are scornfully contemptuous. Frankly, the most (deliberate) creative thing about this movie is the small processing of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the initial titles. The most unpredictable creative part involves a scene in a lab that is unexplainedly displayed twice from behind. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted us to play in the adventure of the dusk of his career? I wanted to proclaim this worst film of Ireland about his biography, but then I saw that SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS was there. I would also like to say with certainty that I am probably the only person in the history of the world who made the dual character of this and Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
