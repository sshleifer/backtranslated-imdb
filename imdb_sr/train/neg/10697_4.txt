At first I thought it was wrong to say in the story that the story and script were made by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood scriptwriters until his talent disappeared and he withdrew. However, they were not Preston Sturges, but Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was basically based on the Robert Stuartson's short story "The Bottle Imp". A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will give him every desire, but who will eventually condemn him to hell. It is okay. Nobody said scenarios must be original. Actors are generally quite competent with regard to the central writing that they had to translate into the screen. My biggest complaint is coming to an end. The hero thinks he has discovered the way out of his dilemma, but he tries to solve the problem in a slightly different way in an attempt to save the innocent person. At first it seemed to be working, but it was true with the codex of modern horror film, they feel they have to provide another horrible food at the very end of the film. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films were well-suited, allowing the hero to win in the end. There is nothing wrong with a good triumph over evil, no matter what the current crop of filmmakers seems to think. You can give the audience a good healthy fear and still make them happy at the end. In fact, I think it's better.
