OK, I knew it would be a F-movie from the background (much below the B-movie standard) that enters it, so I thought, "Man, I could make a good laugh, so let's see how some of these beings are killing each other "Well, what I got could be found in your local store. Accidental lesbian scenes, very small fighting, and no complication. For example, one scene I remember in particular (just because of my stupidity; I saw better pornography on ABC) where the two main characters (I can not remember their names ... an excellent movie, a?) they ride, as they were mostly doing, and the driver was tired of driving and stopping: Driver: "Stop, I'm tired. Traveler:" Of course, I can drive for some time. "(Once stopped, the driver begins to catch the passenger's tits) Traveler:" What are you doing? I'm not like that! "Driver:" It's okay, everyone's doing it sometimes. "Passenger:" All right then. "(Continue to take off shirts, caress, kiss and perform felation) Now, last time when I checked, horror films were not in the porn section of the Hollywood video (unless you do not deal with SCG, you go somewhere else), and definitely should not be in the main hits on the Blockbuster. Do not misunderstand me, I'm definitely not one of those who hate pornography, but I watch it only when it's appropriate and definitely do not want to watch it if I'm looking for a movie in m ainstream stores, because the one I hired was in one of the two vendors I nominated (and possibly with others, if I went and looked.) The worst movie ever, no one should need it rent, and I should buy it only for a public burning ceremony. If I could give it 0, I would, but I can only give * 10.
