"The wild tigers I knew." It will only be in the big cities, to be sure. It's one of those SO arts movies, it makes no sense whatsoever, except the director! I hate you! And all those oh-so-alternative / artistic people are trying to find "metaphors" in the fact that EVIDENT is a horse. No complications, no stories, no morals, no chronology, and nothing fun. or even a touch. For me, it was a bunch of scenes that were connected together and that had nothing to do with each other, and all were for "showing" to show how "visual" and "visual" could be. It was ATTEMPT on another film about teenagers, but it missed the sign at every level possible. Then get credits! I was waiting to make SENSE! I waited for "a good deal". I have about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could be called "art house". This will not be among them. You will be very angry with yourself paying for this movie, and even less on DVD.
