This is the only movie I've ever seen that made me write criticism on any internet site, which is a significant statement from someone who likes "Monolith Monsters Attack". This film is perfect for anyone who wants an unusual movie. He is, for example, deprived of sex and violence. I believe this film is safe for children of all ages. This film is perfect for anyone who does not want to entertain, challenge or stimulate in any way. Adults could easily catch their dream in front of the television while children watch this movie. Do not be surprised, however, if you wake up to discover that the kids turned off the TV and started playing the board. As an adult who enjoys a party that enjoys everything, from earthly to fantastic to realism, drama, comedy and action, all those adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate imagination, this movie has no offers.
