The only thing that's great in the movie is the title. In this case, "Snake on the plane" is an example of not condemning the book by the covers, the title does not say anything about the film. When I went to the theater, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I expected Independence Day, a film that was a pure popcorn, but instead I got this horrible movie Roi Liotta called "Turbulence". . The only thing that makes SOAP look better is its title. And it's not even a title for a movie, it did not even have an insight into the "snake" or "plane" for 40 minutes in the movie! What a false advertisement! Had it not been her title, SOAP would be another unforgettable cheap B-class summer movie. A R rating? It must be the least-rated R rated movie of all time! Movie producers just add a few words to do this, all violence is at a level of 13. You know what's really R rated? The R rated the superstar Edge! You see him in Summerslam instead of spending money on a snake!
