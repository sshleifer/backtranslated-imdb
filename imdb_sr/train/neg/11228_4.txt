The biggest drawback in the film is his unspoken scenario. Swim back and forth between Betty's vintage story and re-create short films of Klav. While the Reconfiguration Piles are well made, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their almost complete integrity. Page Richards, although not an incredible actress, generally does a decent job. And sometimes she has incredible similarity with Bettie. Also, you need to pay attention to the details. Costumes and clothes are well done, as is the direction in which they are. The sets are mostly rare and feel like a phase, but they feel in the era. Sometimes it is surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly designed to give a lively, retro feel to the whole look.
