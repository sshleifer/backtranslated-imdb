This movie is horrible. No quality of this movie. I would think that the mountains would be good, but it's bad. The effects are worse, and acting if you can call it acting is the worst I've ever seen. This film is apparently shot on your camcorder and is running on a budget of about $ 500. If you want to watch a good Zombie movie than watching Dawn of the Dead or the Day of the Dead. If you want to watch a good cheap video on a Zombie movie like this one, but better than watching Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at any cost. She is invisible and meaningless. You are warned. I have nothing else to say about this stupid movie.
