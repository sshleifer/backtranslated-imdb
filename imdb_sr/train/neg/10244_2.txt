I work as a hotel portrait in Washington and I say there is nothing precise in the face of Michael J. Foka - we just do not walk around with pockets that fill the theater tickets and banknotes of $ 100! # 2 If I ever allow someone to use a room during 'afternoon enjoyment', they will be fired on the spot! The organization I belong to (Les Clefs d'Or) has very clear ethical standards and behaviors that we take seriously. # 3 Likewise, at the end of the film, Dag simply removed his gold key symbol and handed it to another employee - we make those keys and this is a sign of honor and knowledge that is allowed to carry them. There is a whole process of application and checking to join our organization. This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of the receptionist as nothing but a robber who is hiding money. In short, it is detrimental to our organization. I welcome all comments.
