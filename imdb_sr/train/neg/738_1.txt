Let this serve as a warning to all who want to draw attention to themselves in the media by linking their name with the name of loved ones and respected, not to say a respected author, to draw attention to their home movies On DVD. Hidden from the heavens without apparently powerless creators, they actually lied only to discover, finally, as absurdly incompetent in every department, lovers of Wells and his book The blood of her writer-producer-director since he appeared on DVD. Other user comments on this page have made many good points. Especially the one about the use of this teaching resource for pupils of the film school, since this "film" does not even use the basic grammar of scripting, editing, continuity, direction over the entire 3 hours of work. It is possible that the director appeared on the recording. There was certainly no one who knew what they were doing. The unbroken thread continues to evolve on this IMDb page that at least should provide viewers of this stupid stupidity with a few laughs for $ 9.00. Much is promised. Absolutely nothing is delivered. In addition to "Monti Pithon", he meets "War of the Worlds" with all the humor that has been extracted. Indestructible garbage. Just incredible. There are genuine independent filmmakers People who are actually trying to work on a high standard instead of waving tires about how their movie will be great. People could do worse than watch the Brit movie creator. Jake West, "Alien aliens," for example.
