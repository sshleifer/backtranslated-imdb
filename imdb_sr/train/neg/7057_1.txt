This is one of the most devastating, pointless films I've ever had to cope with. Every time it began to look like it would be good, more sepia of tones would emerge, followed by paranoid idiocy that masked as a social commentary. The main character, Maddok, is a manipulative, potential rebel who lives in the house without any parents or responsibilities. Support is far more cozy and more interesting, but unfortunately it has never been developed. Likewise, we never understood the character of John Stanton, who allegedly influenced Maddox to rebel. At one point, I thought, "Yeah! Maddox is just crazy and secretly invents all those communications from the dead mental patient Stanton! We're here now!" but of course, it ends so that it does not, and the whole film turns out to be meaningless, both from Maddoka's perspective and from the viewer. Where's Ferris Bueller when we need him?
