I wanted to love this movie. But it breaks down in the middle. the whole premise is good and well-knit, but the middle is tangent. The people I watched became agitated as he ran from the course, hoping that it would end earlier than it was. Another person fell asleep during the middle segment! I found a day of dreaming elsewhere in the Schtick parts that had nothing to do with the plot. I bought it for sweets and it delivered it well, but Pikar's writing and soul are missing. I think that children 8 and below will enjoy riding on the face while they miss the plot. People who are old enough to follow the action will find themselves too far to get back quickly and easily. Change most of the middle part, do it for 50 minutes and it would be a solid blow. I wish I had better words. But I do not know
