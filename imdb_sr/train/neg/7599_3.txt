My friend told me about John Fantue last summer, after talking about Charles Bukovsky. I did not know that Fante is a favorite Bukovsky writer - an author with a similar blade and humor except for one generation earlier. 'Ask dust' was the first book I had read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. Roman was a great piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer who presents himself and the outside world to a self-satisfied, masterly talented author who had no idea how to write about real world experiences he had nothing. In the novel, the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the merits of women whom he desperately wants to write in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camille, satisfying his first sexual experience with the 'wounded' fan, and finally losing sight of his unsuccessful attempts to make love a nasty and real, without a touching Hollivooda ending. Film adaptation remains faithful to the book for some time, but it merges into a movie trap of love that runs through racism, illness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is crazy, and their love has never been and would never be the right thing, no matter how many of them wanted to find one in each other. This film extracted the true meaning of the story and replaced it with a flick. I can not believe that a man who wrote the Chinese Quarter could read this book and make a film about what it misunderstood.
