In the tradition of 'Carrie' and 'Heathers'? Try to be shameless, not just those two films, but also "The Evil Dead" and "The Shining". However, they no longer make bad horror films like this one, and that's a pity, because it's gas. Rainbov Harvest is a substitute for Vinona here, and although it barely makes you more than miter its lines (and occasionally scream, "You're INSULATED!" into its cracked mirror), it's Goth's Way Before It's Modern , so you have to be respected. (And she's pretty creative about it, in addition to black leather scarves and some kind of Hawaiian-punch-hat with black skin. Eat your heart, Cher.) Karen Black is too little, but she is not completely without dignity, and you do not You can help, but you feel sympathy. (Except if you are a friend of mine, who asked: "Who is it, horse lips from" MASH "? First time came on the screen.) There are decent accompanying performances Kristin Dattilo (as a square girl who fights with Rainbov), Ricki Paull Goldin (in his stamped stupid role) and Villiam `Larry, Darril and Darril Sanderson (like some kind of pet, or something like that). But it's sad to see how the former rifle Ivonne DeCarlo reduced to playing what can be imagined only as part of Charlotte Rae. The 1980s were the peak for hours celestial, grossly aggravating stupid horror films like this, "Mirror, Mirror" was one of the last of its kind. It's definitely worth a look.
