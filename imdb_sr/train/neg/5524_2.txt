I did not like this film for a number of reasons. In the first ten minutes of the film, I became extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this film is to be saved, at least for me, it will have to get out of the huge hole it dug. . Unfortunately, this did not happen. The two drafts for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about the work of Lindsey Lohan that I'm interested in what will bring the film. After that, I felt disappointed for all three of them, although there were "moments" in each of their performances. I assume that each of them has found his "moments" a very difficult task in view of the fact that there has been an incredible lack of character development and non-inspiring dialogue. Although the action is interesting, the film is generally poorly written, directed and arranged that any performance as an actor will suffer and be infected. I disagree with the way in which I dealt with sexual abuse and the banal and offensive view of America in a small town, I think, were two main reasons why this film was not able to hit its mark. As one reviewer noticed and I would agree, the film is almost impossible to place on the market as it is finished. I suppose, or at least I hope that (in any case for the actor) on the floor of the room for cutting there are some real jewels. It's sad for us, but if that's true then the actors can run into it and feel good in giving their talents and time to such a flop. Oh, and something else ... I just wanted to go out to watch an American film that included a sad disappearance but a beautifully boolean environment like the one in this film where the main characters were not absent and / or unfairly thrown earth with pop cans, broken CDs and other such garbage!
