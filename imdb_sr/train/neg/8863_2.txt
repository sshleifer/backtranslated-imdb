Hovling II (1985) was complete 180 of the first film. While the first film was camphor and creepy. The other was weak and cheesy. The production values ​​on this one are pretty bad and the acting is terrible. The ancestor brother anchor from the first part wants to find out what happened to his sister. The "scene" of the first movie is hard to recreate. A thin, ordinary woman follows her brother (Reb Brovn) in the old country (Romania) to uncover the mystery of her sister's murder / transformation / death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears now and then as a kind of wise man / guide for the two of them. Sibil Danning and her two greatest assets appear as Stirba, Romania's main inmate. He also suffers from a bad case of a morning face, a Jew! Bad film. There's nothing good about this stinker. The surprise is that Philippe Mora directed this painting because he is usually a good film maker. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (not, not content already, film material itself). To round up the movie, you will get a bad "punk" play from Damned Van Babel. Perhaps, if they cleared up a couple of extra dollars, they could get the right thing instead of imitation. to change the channel.
