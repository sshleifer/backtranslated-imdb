Yes he did! ... No, not because Pintilie loves to pull off his actors and publicly show his personality. Pintilie is naked "car" - so to say ... It's a great time for someone to tell the truth. This file is a voyeur, the bug is locked in the body of an old man. His wealth of bare scenes has no artistic legitimacy. It's 100% visual perversion: it gets its shots by casting the actors into the skin and looking at their excitement. And if you do it in front of the audience, he might be looking forward to harshly! Did you know that, on the set of "Niki Ardelean," he embarrassed the poor Coca-Cola, saying to her, "Oh, Coca, how do I want to sleep!"? She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she has become indescribably embarrassed - for her petty pleasure! And as a worrying alarm signal of the degree of vulgarity and the lack of education in the Romanian audience, so many people are so stupid to declare these visual obscenity as "works of art"! Will anyone ever have the power to discover the truth about everything?
