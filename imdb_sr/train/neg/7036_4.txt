I will not destroy anything when I let you know that you will see that a woman has sex with a goat in this movie. If that's your thing, then your film is here. The wife and her husband leave to see her alienated sister in a family villa in the woods. Her sister is, at the very least, a creepy lady and seems to have interests overcoming family love. On the page there is a group of unruly characters who begin to apply all kinds of pagan rituals. A woman is also held after her husband starts pretending to be an asshole and hang out with pagans, even continues to have sex with him. On the exploit side of the stuff, there's a lot of loose meat and a couple of folds, but nothing that's been better anywhere else. Oh, and the above scene with goat sex. Most of the viewers will not reach the end. Exploitation fans will pull it out, but it will stay longer. 4/10
