So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big plague and I was afraid to see this movie at the beginning, but when I see it, it's neither horror nor thriller. Basically I mocked the movie at my seat because it was so predictable. You could have predicted what would happen next. Young actors were fine to play their characters, but I must say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wisely. It was good, but not exciting or scary. There was almost zero "scene in your seat". So, do not waste ten dollars watching it in cinemas, wait for the DVD.
