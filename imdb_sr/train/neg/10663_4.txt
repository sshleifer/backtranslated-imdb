The film was not a waste other than some boring scenes between. But the actresses gave a pretty good idea to the men who were ridiculous. But Krista Allen really shook the film. Her voice was so seductive and sexy. Scenes in bed with Christ should have been shortened, but she made her so visible and sexy than any other. He is really one of the best in such roles. She also went into a quiet game like baddie in the last 5 minutes, which is an interesting part of the movie. Burt Reinolds was not so good and it was He could not choose a better script than this. I really think he worked for money.
