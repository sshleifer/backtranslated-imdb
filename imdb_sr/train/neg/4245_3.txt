This movie is based on the actual fact? I sincerely hope not! We see how it looks like many armed policemen have discharged an equal amount of weapons in two guys who had only armored torso. It is a great idea; Target for armor! ... excuse me, but what about those big fat heads or feet for loud crying. Or were invisible tanks protected by them? Did I miss something here? This film began to be decent enough, but after 20 minutes of shooting, it really needed a line for boringlans. Even that documentary style was not good for me, but that's something that can be found or not. Very incredible, which makes it difficult to see through 'to the end'. br> 3/10 for fine editing.
