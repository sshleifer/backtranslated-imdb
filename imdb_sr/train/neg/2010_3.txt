Oh, it's a movie - I thought I was waiting too long to get a dog ... I can not believe I was looking at the whole thing. I suppose I optimistically expected it would be better. Horribly disconnected dialogue, pathetic acting and totally incredible events. It's as if Tobi's mom hangs in the time it takes Cola to go upstairs and go down to a room with a 24-inch ceiling, without chairs, counters or anything around her immobile body that she could use to climb up on her Little girl who played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole film, and the puppy of the first couple was close. The basic story has the potential with a good script and the director can be a serious creepy tune, but this version is unfortunately not that. I'm more scared when I open an account for electricity every month.
