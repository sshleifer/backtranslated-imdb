1 How can everyone be able to perfectly understand each other without devices such as universal translators or interpreters? Did the creators of this play realize that people who were taken from different parts of the Earth, in different time frames (Hunta Attila was not a contemporary of pre-lit Hellenic cultures, nor Vikings are modern pyramid builders) spoke different languages ​​and can never develop the language that is similar to modern English (except for those they do not use), influenced by Latin, Ancient Greek, Danish and French? 2 Cultural differences can not be overcome so easily, trust must be won, but wherever the team comes, they are welcome without any doubt and began to order people around as if they were appointed leaders. Of course, true fans would comment that they are being perceived as gods. The people they encounter should be shocked with their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like. 3 Historical background: none. I could visually remind you of Greek or Viking culture, but everyone can dress in a pile of tablecloths or go to a local costume for a plastic horn with a horn and claim to be a part. The theater group in a small town probably has better props. 4 Boredom! Another chromium production, which inexplicably lasted ten years. As the children show they could make a grade, but anyone who has little knowledge of human behavior and language could not bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of the first season, as I just did. I wanted to believe that I found a decent science-fiction show, otherwise I would close it and clean the computer of this shelter after the first five minutes!
