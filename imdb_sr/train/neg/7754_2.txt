The couples will be in this. The movie might be better if they just had a different script, director and CGI provider. Is not that okay? The film has a man who starts his theme park ... he's wrong ... a zoo on an abandoned island where people can see dinosaurs ... they're wrong ... Sabretooth and his name is Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I do not mind, because there are no genuine ideas for such films, but this only glides in your face, which is also the "creature in the shadow of a head in design". Sabretooths, who are not sabretooth towards Mr. Primal Park (Just the ancient killing of cats) are quite heroic, but the crowning success is the one I call "Sloggi". Because, after the disposal of one big cat, the hero relaxed a bit, because only one remained. Enter into a weird foster child who says, Nah, we made three, and the third is a monster tow with the front legs. Great, groves. A group of students is also on a mustard trap, there is a test to get into their clusters of frat or variety (He always thought he needed a short nickname). Of those who live, only one has completed the task, so I got out of it. Oh yes, the obligatory "evil capitalist must die" Klik is in force not with one, but with two! The death of Mr. Primal Park is the funniest thing you will see in one of these films, such as the Sabretooth statue loose dentistry (Sloggi's kindness), collecting several sizes and pulling the person through the throat. That I was so easily pulled out. I like "Sabretooth" more than this spin-off.
