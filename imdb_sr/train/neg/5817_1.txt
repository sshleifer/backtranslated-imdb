The hardest thing about this movie is to say something positive about it. The characters were a stereotyped "white trash", the film "plot" was ticking from the beginning, and the worst characteristic of this film was that the nakedness was so obvious from the doubles in the body that it was funny. Unfortunately, it was the only funny thing in the movie. Mrs. Jenkins would have been better served if she would continue to use her life story to "entertain" people in the future. It was just so bad. One positive aspect of this film (it has nothing to do with the lack of quality film) is that my brother has planted money for this stink.
