This film was full of endless surprises! Just when you thought it could not get worse, they added more joints and more pink fuzzy-lined vans with rude scenes of sex. As you can guess, I was the victim of the original version. They fooled us to look at how he thinks it's Supervan, a host of promising lasers, a pause in prison, and more. Who would have thought that the Christmas Gift of the Dollar Store could have been so much fun!
