The only reason I chose this film was to attend Oscar winner Ernest Borgnina. All I can say is that it was the greatest loss of a good actor ever shot. As far as I know, Borgnina was the only actor in it. Other performances were so uniform and terrible, I'm amazed that the studio really would pay "performers" to appear. Connect this level of talent to the acting department with a story that is so irresistible and irresistible that I thought that my eyes would start to bleed until the moment the credits turn, and you have the perfect film disaster. It is obvious that the film was made to attract the audience of children, and that he was responsible for this, was better than most original programs on Disney Channel and similar networks directed at the child. But honestly, that does not say much.
