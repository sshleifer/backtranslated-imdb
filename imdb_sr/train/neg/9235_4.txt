This woman never stops talking during the film. She remembered every line and delivered everything without a little natural emotions. She also has the most amazing banging, and the tone of her voice sounds like nails on the board. This film has too many Betsy Drake, and not enough Cari Grant, who took down the little that left the film entirely on his own.
