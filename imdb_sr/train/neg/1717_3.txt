Here we have 2 incomprehensible children who have never had a chance against a cruel, poor life: Robin Hoods was separated from the police for persecution because they were sometimes wild. Gad! According to this shame, Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of Missouri, which they learned to be a psychopathic killer of a fun boy who did not want to hurt anyone ... he just wanted things without much energy to get them. He behaved badly, recorded badly, incredible dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, which looked more like grape jellies than on the right thing. Avoid this bilge water. Thumbs up. -5 stars.
