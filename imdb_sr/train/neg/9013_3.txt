It's hard to boast this movie. CGI for the dragon was well done, but did not have proper modeling for the light and shadow. Also, the same shot is endlessly used by the dragon that runs through corridors that become somewhat tedious. I was amazed to see "Marc Aurelius" in acting, wondering what the former Roman emperor was doing in this movie! As "Vhoopie Goldberg", it must be a pseudonym, and can it blame him for using it if it appears in this stinker. The story could be interesting, but the acting is straight and the direction is tedious. If you need to watch this movie, go around to your friend's house and get drunk while you are doing it - then it will be nice.
