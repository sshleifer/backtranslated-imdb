Demi Moore's character in the film was chosen for SEALs because of her appearance. It was a bad start and the film went from there. The action was completely incredible. There is not enough will to do this in difficult military units. This film has not convinced me of the physical ability of a woman to perform the tasks that are needed. Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same, it's an insult to everyone's intelligence. The differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting.
