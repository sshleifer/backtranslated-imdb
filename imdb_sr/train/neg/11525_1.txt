Simpli terrible! Why do not you use the real actors? Look, this must stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want any kind of credibility or any message sent through these low-budget movies ... please for the love of God use the right actors! Most will work for free ... use it! Let's go back to my comment ... after all, humor was lower than that in the bathroom version and it was not funny at any level. As for quality ... in a scene shot on a public transport bus, you could see the reflection of the crew ... you know what? It was one guy who looked like a Sony camcorder and probably not his. Well, I guess the only audience for this movie is people with a fetish ... and it was not good either.
