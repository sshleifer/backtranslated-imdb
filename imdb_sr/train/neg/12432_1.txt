This is the worst broken Home Alone movie I've ever seen! See Part 1 and Two, but do not let anyone say this is BETTER than the first two! I mean, you really do not make a movie, then make a sequel with the same characters and actors, then make another sequel with different characters and actors! I mean, it would be okay not to be this "Home Alone" movie, but it was made with Home Alone. Culkin is too old now, so we should stop making sequels! God, this movie hurts me! Buy Parts 1 and 2.
