If you like sifi soap, this show is for you, as I'm concerned, not working for me and after watching 3 episodes I can no longer watch. It's bored and slow, and to show that the timeline is based around 100,000+ years, if you're based on the timeline of the galactic battalion for coming to Earth, it surely seems to have all the same things as the 100,000-year-old Chevi van that They are driving down. streets and people who watch 100,000 years old old brand LCD TVs. The same is true for the rest of the sets, as well as for the show, except that many of today's issues are not in question, I think they could have much better deal with these issues and yes, batlestar galactica had some of the same questions, but not so bad. Like the rest of the show, it's not nearly as good as the BSG was and that's a bad sign.
