I would like to see MEN IN WHITE to be able to watch it again. "What? You want to say that you really enjoyed Theo?" let me see again whether it was retarded, stupidly and shamelessly uncomfortable, as I recall. Many people claim that it was made for children. Can I suggest that the children did it? because the overall structure of the script lacks any discipline by producers and writers, and it appears that many sets are involved because it looked like a good idea at that time. I'm not helping, but I honestly began to feel sorry for you. Honestly, you can believe that during the filming of actors, they had to lie to their families to record a stubborn porn movie, such as their shame to appear in something so sad. To give you an idea of ​​how acting every time BAIVATCH's baby Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the narrative, I waited patiently for her to reappear, and a few seconds later I forgot that she was in the movie. He realized ? The star from BAIVATCH appears and seconds later you forget that they are in the movie. This tells you everything you need to know about the standard of MALE MALE IN WHITE Fair enough, it's an attempt to be a live action movie similar to THE GOODIES (although DISMALS would be a better adjective for this movie) although maybe the film deserves credit for it never went down to toilet humor, but given that this is a children's movie (this did not stop ITV from broadcasting it at 23 o'clock), then it should not be near humor anyway.
