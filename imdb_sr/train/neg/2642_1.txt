Slow, Slow, Slow ... There is no mystery or excitement in this movie. If you do not understand who the "mole" is in the first ten minutes, you must be dead. The secret service must have been too much, because they needed the entire movie to join it. There are no movies in the movie (not a movie). The film's tempo is slow, there is no tension. The hired killer is a great hit, unless he targets Michael Douglas, but seems to be able to hit big glass glasses. The most entertaining scene in the film is when a female president says the code word at the end of the anti-climate. It's ridiculously loud funny. At least six people got up and left the film early. I would join them not to sit in the middle of the row. I would not recommend this film to anyone.
