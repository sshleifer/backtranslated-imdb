Anyone who saw the original had to come out and destroy this horrible remake. Alec Baldwin, who is trying to mimic the late Steve Mckueen in remake words, simply does not work. While Baldwin did something wonderful, this is a flop from start to finish. McKueen had a charisma, he never tried to compete with the star. As far as Kim is concerned, Ali McGrava said enough. McKueen looked dangerous, threatening and convincing as Doc, the film had excitement and uncertainty, Baldwin and the company did this in comedy, and I only laughed the only time I saw this miserable movie. And this terrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of today's more exciting and convincing actors! Did people from makeup have this for Michael, what they thought. If you want to watch movies in the way it was in the direction of Sam Peckinpah, take the original!
