The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefski, finally makes a movie that does not go straight to the Plaiboi channel. "The Hazing" borrows much from everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to be visible ... barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is thin and the actors can not get out of the bag. Put it all together and have the tiny ball of the movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is quite similar. Spend 90 minutes and you have a strange taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.
