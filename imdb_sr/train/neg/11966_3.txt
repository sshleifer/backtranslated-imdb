Bob Clampett's 'Porki's Poor Fish' is a cartoon drawing material that is filled with terrible dirges and one or two lovely moments. Set in Porki's Fish Shoppe, 'Porki's Poor Fish' takes the uncomfortable space between the standard black 'n' white Porki cartoon and one of the books that come to life in Merrie's melodies that were popular at that time. Typical for many early Porky's caricatures, Porki is far from the star, appearing only in the slightly open music number and peak of the film. The rest of the time of the star is a skinny cat who sees a fish market as an opportunity for a free meal, but gets more than he asked. Unfortunately, the audience gets far less than they were looking for. As it used to be in a series of books-coming-in-life, the reflector throws on signs that could function equally well in non-animated media. Laughter is scarce and, while the cartoon is almost saved by Clampett's energy route, it is very unnecessary to recommend 'Porky's Poor Fish' over any of the other underpriced cartoons.
