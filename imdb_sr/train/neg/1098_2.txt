I got this movie in a $ 5 bucket. I would not recommend that you look at this move. I could give it to one of my friends if I'm mad at them and I want two hours. I looked at the cover and broke the summary and thought it was a war movie. I wish I knew this movie would be boring before I turned it on. My mistake was that something would happen in this movie. It's just about a group of people going from one camp to another. Sargent trainers treat soldiers very badly, and the main character is trying to help people get out of the fighting in Vietnam. All right, here's my talk about this movie: This movie is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies that you put in and stuck, watching because you want to turn it off, but to hold on to a series of hopes that could be fully realized. It's not. After the film went through it behind my T.V. because I was angry that I spent almost 2 hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes of writing this review to warn people about it.
