My friend bought this one pound movie, and even then he was overestimated. Despite great names like Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was as funny as taking a chisel and minting through the ear. It uses the tired, bottom chamber technique - the consistent breaking of the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience and seemingly meaningless editing of 'hot girls'. Adam Sandler plays a waiter on board who wants to become a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the resident comedian of the ship - shamelessly called "Dickie" because of his unmanageable success with the opposite sex - assumes that he is lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker gets a big break. Dickie is not dead, but locked in the bathroom, it is assumed to be a morbid illness. Maybe from his mouth he vomited the worst film of all time.
