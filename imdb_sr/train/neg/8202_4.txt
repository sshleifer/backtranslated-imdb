Whether it's a remake and a thing (1982/1951), I think there are so many factors from the previous films that deny it. the revival of the stars themselves, with its parchment and its somewhat strange thinking / movements, but that's all, other actors I have not even noticed. You do not feel familiar with some of the main characters. And the development of the plot is slow, boring, and I know what will happen in 30 minutes. Score / music is ultraboring, the name there is a lot of uberalent people who would make points for cocaine and credit, but this is great shit. Some of the special effects are beautiful, if it was made in the early 90's. If you like slick aliens, fever and excitement, do not watch this movie. his boring combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bai productions is really bad. Now this combination would be great if somone knew what they were doing and the only ones who knew it was, nobody. Although I saw a video upstairs, I would not recommend this movie. Anyone, but if you get up on one cold night, and you just want to look at something, it'll take time, slowly.
