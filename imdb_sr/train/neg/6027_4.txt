I grew up a Baptist and I know the story this film is trying to tell, although I no longer believe in the story. I will give the film praise that I am as good as the average movie of the Week. Mildly interesting, central acting, a bit slow, scenario is predictable, music is gloomy, and it's a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind must be the purest pure non-Christians. None of them cursed. But I laughed loudly when an actor playing a man running the United Nations pronounced "nuclear" as "nu-cu-ler", just like Bush. Is there a Christian code of honor that requires that after Bush claims that he is also called by God, that all Christians must conceal their ignorance by misinterpreting that word in the same way it does? LOL! It was really hard for me to seriously grasp the film after that. After the incident "nu-cu-ler", the film began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. In fact, I was looking for something that would lead me to thinking, but I did not find it here. If you're looking for meaningless entertainment, stop - it's good to kill the rainy afternoon. But if you are looking for intelligence, look somewhere else.
