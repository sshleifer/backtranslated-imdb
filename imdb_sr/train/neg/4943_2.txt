I watched 3 episodes of Caveman, and I have no idea why I continue, except perhaps waiting to be better. For me, this show is just pumping commercials, without real humor. As we sat and watched these shows, we all speculated about what would happen. Episode of female cave women with attitude was actually great, yes, yes, for us. She is rude in the theater and acts roughly towards strangers, and the truth is that she needs a slide. An old show, My mother, a car. I give him 2, just because they deserve 1 better than 1 because they actually spent money on it.
