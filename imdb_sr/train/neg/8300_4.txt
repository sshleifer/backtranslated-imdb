This is the sequel to "A Christmas Story", originally called "Summer Story". Ralphie tells her family adventures during the summer when they moved to a small town in the middle of nothing. Sadness, unfortunately, does not arise. The original was working because of its dishonest nature and honesty - everyone could have treated her. This is simply stupid and it's not funny at all. The latest film by Charles Grodzin - no wonder! It's one of his poorest roles. I regretted it. Marie Steenburgen has a bit of work, everything is formulated, and you have to wonder why they are even trying. competition with rotating tops?! Unfortunately, this is the best part of the movie ...
