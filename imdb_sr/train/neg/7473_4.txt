My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong beloved southern lady with a messy private life solves the crimes for LAPD. The first season had to see us. Unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season became so fatigued and unworthy of a strong character that we stopped looking. mother to the fact that she went in. But the switch was an episode in which she hid her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend, but she told her boss. Why would a strong middle-aged woman do that? The answer is that it would not. Besides, my husband and I choose a bad guy with almost perfect precision. It is almost always a white man or woman, introduced into a kiss on the scene of a murder or in an idealized family. Can the script writers do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer viewers. We prefer castings that do not betray characters and insult our intelligence.
