He attracted me the title ... I expected an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism, instead I got a rather boring and unkind story about an unhappy Scot. psychological depth, unless you are willing to classify cheesy teenage poetry as a psychology. It was a shame because the core of the story could be good, with a better effort to show the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth. Unfortunately, the general idea looks more like "I am such as I am, because I am so". And the ridiculously bad attempt to give some kind of poetic edge to a lower class man is even worse. Gathering excessive clich√© "poete maudit" stinks to a quick fix, an inexpensive way to make the boring film smart, artistic and meaningful. But "16 Years of Alcohol" is not very smart, artistic or meaningful ... The main character does not evolve at all, and a weak attempt to change does not work without a good explanation. Just as the initial attempt occurred rather than off the blue. The film is heavily indebted to classics such as Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but ultimately fails to restore their size, even for a few seconds. Jobson too emphasized the artistic side of the story, and the rest was neglected, giving us a movie that is nice to the eye, but uncomfortable for the brain.
