This is by far one of the hottest and most horrible stories of the early days of Adolf Hitler I've ever seen. Robert Carlile is a great actor, but playing it like Hitler is simply wrong. To insert Liev Schrieber as Hitler's long-time friend and help, Haefengstal surely broadcasts screams of desperation and anguish from Center Simon Viesenthal. J-V plays a Nazi cheerleader, bad bad bad casting. This was not a pleasant family movie with a good historical background. This was worst in Hollywood garbage, draining the power of the strong (but heavily used) support of actors who seemed to have nearly disappeared from radar in the last 5 years. False German accents (more vill vin zis var) insult German people everywhere. My mother was German and sat in the voice of the voices that were constantly exchanging from American / English / German in the same sentence. Supporters make better cropping of cards in a local video than on the screen. Jenna Malone, as fateful Geli Raubal, was wonderful, but she caught the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her life to escape from what her future would be in Hitler's shadow. If you want a fantastic and historically accurate explanation of Hitler's early years that led to the war and the Holocaust, the rent "Inside the Third Reich" in 1983, featuring Rutger Hauer like Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi like Hitler. It was good and it made more sense than this nonsense. As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you, this has led to books that have confirmed my innumerable inaccuracies.
