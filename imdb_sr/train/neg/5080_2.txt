This is a review of the Wizard, and not mixing it with Visa or Mr. By the wizard. The Wizard is a film from the late eighties about a serious quiet boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening of the loan. Viz is an unnecessary update of the Wizard's Wizard, and Mr. Wizard is the guy who has joined 100 straws and gave him something to drink. Now that we get all that Get Out of the Road, let me say this: there's really no reason to watch this movie. It's just a 100-minute Nintendo advertisement designed to use Poverglove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the easiest sense, because it looks like this film is written over the weekend. a group of people who never played Nintendo, and directed by a man of less style than my grandmother. Perhaps, if the writer and director sat and played some games together, they would realize that they were ready to record total nonsense and instead go to a vocational school to learn how to install stereo devices. I hope this has been an enlightening experience for you. It certainly was not for me. In fact, I think I may have lost several brain cells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you're in the video and see The Viz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz all sit on a shelf in a nice little row, give them everything to miss and play Duck Hunt.
