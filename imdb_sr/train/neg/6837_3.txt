Normally, I do not like movies about revenge .... PERIOD. But Double Impact has more than your typical vengeance space. You see, DI has action, precision, exotic sites (ie Hong Kong), terrible pistol fights and enough martial arts to meet your need for an impressive battle without weapons. Like all revenge, there are villains that you would like to throw out of a glass window on the last floor of a 40-storey building! However, Double Impact does not have a sensational shit that stifles the plot and the elitist, racist and poisonous social stereotypes that attacked "Eie for a Eie" and "Death Vish 2". But in the Double Impact plot plot is transparent as a sarak scarf. Chada and Alek's parents were killed by a coup that was linked to a family friend with money problems or at least that's how I remember. The explanation why the boys spoke in French accents is bad. It was not a water plot that made this film bad, but the use of clich√© lines and moves from other films (from Lethal Veapon to The Princess Bride) really made the situation worse. However, Double Impact is still visible. But why are such shitty movies like villains (for example, the greedy Briton who killed Chad's and Alek's parents and that deadly lesbian rhubarb) would like to hate the fibers of your being?
