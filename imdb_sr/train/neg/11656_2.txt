Scari Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Simply calling for movies, such as Mission Impossible 2, does not lead to comedy. The movie opens well enough with the funny scene of white people and the excellent use of James Voodoo and Andy Richter. Unfortunately, the film falls from there. The acting is terrible. Tori Spelling looks and works totally inappropriate. The film looks expensive and surprisingly slow. Some longer gags in this snail film, which included joints and the previously mentioned Tom Cruise film, were ridiculous for everyone in my theater. Fortunately, the film comes to a standstill in 83 minutes in a shockingly meaningless ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not try to end with humor) I do not know what else to say, except that it's a messy hurry that made Miramak do some more money on the back of stupid teenagers. All in all, a very bad movie.
