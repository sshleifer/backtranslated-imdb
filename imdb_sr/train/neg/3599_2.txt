Umm .. I was pretty surprised that someone really gave the movie high marks. Let's face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress ... and this film only proves the extent of her "talent". "The film's action was poor ... I bet the stupid one who came with this concept is a perverse virtuoso. If there's a good thing about this movie, I'd say it's Tommy Chong's daughter, just because it's his daughter ... and then it's the male soap opera and opera opera that looks good, which makes it attractive, but it stops helping with its dramatic abilities. * Why IMDb requires at least 10 lines? How many other ways can you just say: " This movie is bullshit? "
