Here I read the posts related to the costume of Vonder Voman for this TV movie. It should be emphasized at the time the movie was filmed, it did not wear its traditional clothes. Producers persisted on the concept of VV's comics writer in the early 1970s. As for the film, I have to agree with many other posters. Snoozefest! I was a kid when he appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was at the right time to appreciate the film about the hero of comics. Nevertheless, I was so "preoccupied" with the plot, I stopped watching him three-quarters of a movie. Naturally, I was not at the right time to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
