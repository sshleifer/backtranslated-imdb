An interesting idea that involves an alternative dimension within the hospital. He reminded - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and old episodes of the twilight zone. Atmosphere strong, the item was great. There were some very clever moments of "time loop" that always have this attraction. The story has had a lot of vague references that led me to believe that all the explanations that came out of it - time mistakes / ghosts / strange bats with wings and rather stupid heavy metal dressed in ghosts. And it was that the Dark Floors seriously let me down. Based on my view, the film does not give an explanation of what is behind the events. While some kind of ambiguity is always expected / welcomed in such films. Dark floors took him to new heights of uncertainty. I do not expect things to get wrapped in a beautiful tape, but I should not be left feeling "Huh? .. is that it?" ... Did I separate? Maybe I made a mistake in the chapter "? Dark Floors left me with a deeply unsatisfactory suspicion that "It was all a dream," which is a shame, since I was very in the game and enjoyed the film until the last reel.
