I am a horrible person in a movie about horror and film, and this film was so bad that I felt embarrassed not only for "actors", but also for the director and poor juice producer who actually invested money in this shlock. /> From the title you can expect some great slaughter, something from the story and the MINIMUM some direction or dialogue. Instead, you get something that looks like something more violent and more sexual episode of Three Stooges. At least I laugh Trim Stogam. As I watched this shit, I switched on another TV and started watching Howard Sterne until something interesting happened. Needless to say I was constantly watching Stern. Seeing this "movie" I understand that I could make a film with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $ 50 in free change and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration to start filming without a budget. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned ... there is a lot of it, but a lot of stories and very little action. That's why "KaZaam" looks like a movie by Meril Streep. I'm sure Germany did not bother him for sex or violence. Other countries have to pay attention.
