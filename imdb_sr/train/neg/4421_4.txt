The theme is certainly tempting: a group of people takes their love for playing one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. Vargaming is an interesting phenomenon that enters our collective need to "escape" from the reality and sometimes to the everyday existence of our existence - with which almost everyone can relate. The characters are a predictable mix of the Lord of the Rings and Stardust enthusiasts. That's enough for most people to watch. However, the film quickly turns into a insider-like vision of war with almost stereotypical nodding to the viewers who "do not understand." It seems that filmmakers are taking over the theme of war games, and this is a special, too serious, and not once in a while recognizing humor and fun in filming the movie about adults who get drunk in medieval equipment and bang one another with foam swords. It's pretty hard for anyone not sitting on your computer for 7-10 hours a day playing games or designing the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should be worried at all. However, the filmmakers themselves do not seem to want to focus solely on the theme of the game itself, but to build a strong narrative with a clear story that everyone can understand. Moreover, the characters themselves are not so convincing and quickly become bored with them: big no-no when you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
