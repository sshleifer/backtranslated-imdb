I just returned from this free show, and this "Osama Vitch Project" is the worst movie I've seen this year, worse than even "Catvoman" - which had the power to turn it into a fiction at least. In the "September tapes", the "film crew" of "documentary journalists" is going to Afghanistan - despite being completely unprepared for the trip, conditions and, oh, yes, the psychotic and funny revenge of their filmmaker leader who on September 11 will condemn the death of his wife - to find Osama bin Laden. They "made" eight cartridges on their journey, now "documenting" their journeys and, of course, their attempts to kill a terrorist leader. (Eight stripes, fortunately, all end up on points significant in narration, which is perfect for the "documentary." The psychic, idiotic protagonist - to whom is given a long, significant saying that he probably learned watching "MacGiver" - does not care anything for his life or the life of his innocent crew while he gets them further and still in danger through a series of totally stupid incidents. I do not know why he did not just carry a sign on his back that said "Shoot me." /> The translator of the crew, supposedly their sensible voice, does nothing more than whimpering and confused while idiots ski hero leads to ruin. Want to bring someone with them on their journey to call them all morons. About "Tape 4", I started to fight for terrorists to shoot a movie crew.
