It's a pathetic word. Bad acting, a pathetic scenario, cheese dialogue and hip hop music and fashion ... what the hell was that with? The director of this film works as badly as the film he made. If someone took some time and effort to process the whole thing, he might have had a chance. I bet the studios are still trying to figure out how I can screw it up. Absolutely the best thing in this movie was Stacey Dash ... Asian fish was not bad either. And these girls wore the whole movie. If it were not for them, I would destroy a copy of this film. If one of those who have not seen it yet and did not have a clue, do not waste your time ... you will regret later.
