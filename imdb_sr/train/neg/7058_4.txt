I came to NEV PORT SOUTH waiting for a surrogate film about a massacre at the Columbine school, similar to ELEPHANT Gus Van Sant and certainly a synopsis in a TV guide that says a student sociopath rebel against the system gave me such an impression, but this is a very boring film where a bit to consider yourself being warned The story is about Maddox, a high school student in Chicago who decides to retaliate what he considers to be an authoritarian regime. The main problem is that the character is signed, and the actor played by Blake Shields is not able to decorate any flaws in the script. You have the impression that Maddox should have an evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam or Bin Laden, but he never encounters anything more than a lousy, rude teenager, and it is impossible to believe that he could gather all the students. The subtext of casting out a manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious, which means that the NEW PATH SOUTH is a completely unpardonable drama that is not worth the sight
