With such a title, you do not have to expect a great horror movie. But it was very bad, even with low expectations. The action is really insulting and stupid: a fugitive criminal wore a mask for Halloween, so everyone around him thinks someone else is. this joke can work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the whole movie! Actors are not so bad, but their characters are pretty stupid and the story is boring and stupid. No tension, no excitement and little blood (very cheap). Satanic Little Helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and dramatically collapses. In the end it became so boring that I actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I do not care what happened. Amanda Plummer was great at Pulp Fiction, but come ... it was 13 years ago, and after that she did not do anything decent. No wonder she had to sink as low as this piece of shit.
