This film was one of the worst I've ever seen. Pure drivel. How can anyone develop a relationship with heroin, or have empathy for her, that's beyond me. I felt watching the history of a schizoid with a borderline personality disorder. Just terrible. In its most comprehensive light, this can be seen as an attempt of production and an "artistic" film - except that I could not, for my life, find any art in it. If this woman lived in today's world, they would be taken to a mental institution and given them several days of treatment with antipsychotic drugs. It, or simply allowed to wander the streets and become a woman's bag. Why other characters in this film found something that was bought in her - and tried to help her in her quest for an actress - tells more about their pathology than any convincing features that made it worthwhile.
