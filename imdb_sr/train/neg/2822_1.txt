OMG This is one of the worst films ever seen, and IV has seen a lot of the student of the movie. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did she need the money so much? I love AJ and I've seen almost everything that has ever been, so I watched this other. It was bad bad! not even bad bad, just bad bad. He had 1 or 2 ridiculous little moments, but everything was bad for 101 minutes. I can not even say that AJ looked good because it's not good. The action is predictable if you do not expect to repeat Romeo and Juliet, and then not. Frustrating. Maybe if this is your good movie, otherwise I do not recommend it.
