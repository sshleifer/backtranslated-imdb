The story was fine. Akshai Kumar was as good as ever and that was the only good thing in the movie. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There were so many colors and crying over her, but she did not look good. I do not know why the dam of Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role. There was not much work in the movie. Just because it's a movie that does not mean that the actor should accept the role as bad as it is. He said Ali Han was good. I think it's high time that Indian directors and manufacturers are beginning to think of Indian customers as an intelligent party. What are we? fools !!!! What they think will show 2 men who lead the SVAT unit in the rampage and we will trust them. Is the Indian police so stupid as to try to catch some criminals ... they take the whole squad of 100+ policemen and nobody was there to surround the palace. The action was shit and I never saw such a bad action. Akshai Kumar was between a circle of 30-40 policemen who fired at him ... and shot at them. None of the policemen touched him, but he killed all the policemen. Shit. CRAP. I think the director of the fight who was thinking about this scene should retire.
