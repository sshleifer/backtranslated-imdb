James Gandolfini is a good actor, so what he has ever taken a role in this piece of nonsense. Affleck is just lightweight that just can not cut it off, the rest of the actors are really unforgettable. I saw it in the US in an empty theater, I soon knew why the place was empty after about ten minutes. I came out before the end, it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I returned to England I saw a movie that had a great report from that ioio Paul Ross on one of the weekly markets. I always rely on Rosa to save me money on cinematic tickets, if she says that the movie is good, I'm checking on this site right away. This movie was supposed to go straight to a Â£ 1.99 DVD in a supermarket near you.
