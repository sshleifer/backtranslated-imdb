I just watched "El Otro". I have always removed the hat from the performance of Julia Chavez, because he is an excellent actor, but this film is really depressing and slow. I suppose it would be even worse if there was no Juliet. In any case, this is definitely a movie that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if it is, I would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a good time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends ... it is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make much sense. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is bored and impresses the audience with scenes that shock you a bit. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. All in all, I definitely did not like this movie.
