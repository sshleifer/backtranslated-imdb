I did not have real expectations in this movie and I'm glad. Even if I expected it to be bad, I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First, I think that 15% of the film consisted of footage of stationary scarecrows in the dark jungle. I understand. There are scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrow" was enough. Secondly, no damn thing is ever explained in connection with the scarecrow and paranormal events. I've stayed on VTF too many times? Third, the film is taken seriously. I'm a B-movie with buns of blood, screaming women and meaningless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But these movies often know that B-movies and even likes them, such as Dead Snov (hilarious Scandinavian zombie) or Evil Dead 2. But this film seems to be unconscious of his stealing. there should be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said. If you want to have a movie about horrors, do it with a murder. And if you have one hot and one half-hot girl, one of them should show at least one color at a minimum. So, as in the summary, skip the "Scarecrow". and just break into the eye. You will thank me.
