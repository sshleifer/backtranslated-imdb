I just came from watching this movie and decided to see what others think about it. I wonder if these people who give great reviews have seen the same movie! This is potentially a very good story, but it can not be guessed. The scenario is very weak - the shop has so many holes to make it an excellent fishing net. The characters were not well developed and the story was so excited that I wondered "How did we get here?" at least half a dozen times during the movie. There was a lack of any kind of chemistry between the actors. This is probably connected with the fools Lindsay Lohan during the shooting. It was pretty clear that everyone appeared and did their job, but did not devote themselves to their roles. This is not a movie worth seeing ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice warm bath and save money for something that's worth it!
