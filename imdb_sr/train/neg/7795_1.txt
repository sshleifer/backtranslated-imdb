First of all, I am not really a fan of the whole "stuff eating meat in disgusting new ways" of the film, but I am a bad film enthusiast so my neighbor said he had the worst movie ever. This one. We started looking at him. First and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder without a stand! The second voice of a thin white doctor is called a big black man! Third, no dialogue makes any sense. The fourth, zombie scene, though inconsolable and shocking of the poor makeup and tomato paste, suggests that I believe the director (and my neighbor) need psychological help. Funny is about 5 minutes, but quickly becomes old. It's so amateurish that it's like watching a poor-looking middle-aged schoolboy with zombies. A note to everyone involved in this movie - I want 20 minutes of my life that I spent watching this before I fell asleep back.
