A really horrible movie that left me hopeless when I looked for forty minutes to stand. It's not a mistake for actors, but the writer / director, producers, financiers, etc. Maybe he thinks it's deep. It's not. This rape and ultra-violence, unlike that central part of Clockvork Orange, has nothing to say or adds to the suspicion of human understanding. Not Strav Dogs, which I compared to him. Instead of feeling like something Pete Walker might have turned his hand on, even when he said that I was probably a little unfair to Pete Walker. has more to say about male emulation than about this poor effort. I do not think it is particularly misogynistic, just too cheerful in displaying certain details - the blood flowing down RA rape, a couple of examples. It is neither challenging nor confrontational, although I am sure that those who deal with the film are considered to be very "ridiculous", only deeply unpleasant. Is it as high as we can target? So why did those involved want to make movies? (I wrote here a Latin term that translates as Oh the Times! Oh customs! But a new spelling check on IMDb would not allow me to post a message until I removed it.Also, I had to remove square brackets sorted IMDb.) <Br /> Where is the sublime aspiration? The noble impulse? When you look at the British film - the joyous comedy Ealing or the Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed worked with Graham Greene at Fallen Idol, Our Man in Havana or the sublime Third Man (a film that has much more to say about the harm of a thousand Straightheads); work Povell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and male emasculation, see "The Offense, Dir." Sidney Lumet, from the original drama of John Hopkins, see "Tunes of Glory" for something worth making, it has something to say. Unlike the above , Straightheads, unfortunately, are totally crazy celluloid waste.
