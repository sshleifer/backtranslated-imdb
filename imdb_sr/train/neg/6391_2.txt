hg is normally explosive, and has never hurt me so far - I loved "bloodfeast 2", but I really do not like pseudo-science or playing heuristics. The entire film is based on a man who is caused by an electrical accident and a witch. I do not argue with witches, and I liked "Keri" (novel and film), but this has bothered me. I think this is because of the main character who is developing from the electrical line. also a university professor spends his time studying the cases. I was not alive in the 1960s to know firsthand whether or not the esp was a common misconception then, but I suppose that any theory of such a nature would simply be discredited. What really disturbed me was the way the police described schizophrenics as merciless, unpredictable criminals who can look like normal people 99% of the time, and then just burst. nothing can be further from the truth. I despise such concepts as they add to public idiocy. Many people still think schizophrenia is a disorientation of dissociative identity. whoever wrote this scenario did not know much about psychology. There were some decent concepts in the film. I liked how the witch used men; it was a nice change. I liked how she could make herself attractive, but she was not when she was around her forced lover. I was interested in how her other lover burnt his face. that the script was touched a few weeks before production and that it was not focused solely on making the audience dull, this may have been a decent movie.
