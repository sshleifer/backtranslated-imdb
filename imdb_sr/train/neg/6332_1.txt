I was looking forward to watching this movie when it came out, as I was a great fan of the SNL. When my boyfriend and I went to see him, the people who came from the early performance shouted: "Do not waste your money!" But of course, we had to find out ourselves. Although there were several funny items (laser bra 2000, Slim boy's roots), the majority felt as if it could be seriously decorated to a fun 1 hour show. It was pretty bad. When the opera singer came, many people got up and out. That's why I laughed because I realized that O'Donoghue deliberately pressed the buttons of people intentionally. Otherwise he was just crazy. Whatever - you do not have to waste your time watching it, it's so bad.
