Anyone who saw Tamuzin the Celtic knows that this is a director who can do better. Let's hope this was not the case too much in the pot (Telefilm anyone?) And that was the case of the second blink. The characters are one-dimensional and are used more. The landscape is incredible and beautifully showing the Pacific Northwest. The camera is great. Shown almost completely outside, the images are sharp and beautiful. Almost the smell of wind blowing through the leaves. Technically speaking, this movie is the sound coming - just miss the heart.
