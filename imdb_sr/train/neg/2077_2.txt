It had to be an excuse to get out of the house until the color was dried - leave the film after an hour to return and see how the paint dries. I do not remember that I had ever come out on film before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not ready for the actors and only went on to "go and go" bad - come on! Uma Thurman is doing this thing? Enough lame special effects. These were the older characters and actors who worked superficial pink lives of 20 years - just some boring and mischievous feelings. I had to go home and see if the color was dried with a darker shade than when it was continued.
