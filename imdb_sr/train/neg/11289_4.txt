Elizabeth Vard Gracen, who will probably be remembered only as one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo eruptions" (for which they now have pills!) Is probably the weakest element of this show. Really continues the tough formula of the Highlander series - The Heroes of the immortal meet the other immortal with the flashback of the last encounter, but there is some conflict, and there is a fight with the swords in the end where you have a cheap sequence of special effects. Then you have the character Nick Wolf. Basically, your typical unshaven hero from the '90s, with a typical story of sexual tension. (Seriously, why you Hollywood types think that sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) It was a joint Canadian / French production, so half of the series takes place in Vancouver, imitating New York, and the other half in Paris ... as Highlander.
