I had great hopes for this film, because I thought that CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature) was an absolutely brilliant, the most normal movie movie with a low budget I've ever seen. But many CLAIRE DOLAN is totally meaningless and straightforward. The scene after the scene looks randomly thrown into the micro, without much thought of narration or character. Is Claire trying to escape from prostitution or not? It's hard to say. Why pick up a trick at the airport if she wants to get away from that life? Then why not take tricks when she needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her afraid of hair on what is practically the same color? Why does Claire accept some Johns and not others? The director does not seem to know. I feel like everything is improvised (although I understand that this is not the case), and the filmmakers just kept the camera on it as if they were making a Verit documentary. After the projection I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narration as a politically conservative. It sounded like a learned rhetoric. I think it was a cop. I'm sad that a movie that was exciting like CLEAN, SHAVEN made such a lame movie like this and then defended it tired. old "political" clich√©s.
