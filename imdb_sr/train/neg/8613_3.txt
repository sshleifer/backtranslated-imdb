I almost cried watching this movie. Not laughing, but remembering the big Dangerfield movie. Candishack was his first and stole the movie, Easi Monei is at his best, and Back to School is by far the classic masterpiece of the 80's. Then there were bubbles and then it started to show up. Poor Rodney has aged (Meet Valli Sparks was a small step from Ladibugs, but he did not talk much). In my 5 spouses The birthday game Monte (the name he has to love, because his name was in Easi Monei) is rich (he is not always) a guy who loves women and marries like nothing. Now a huge piece of land is inherited and after the country was led by amish, he inherited five women. This sounds like a great idea for the Dangerfield movie. The problem is ALL. The scenario is so poor that Rodney seems to be talking about his camera lines and that all foreign characters have nothing to do. The movie seems to have been filmed on a video with some really bad cascades that are obviously not Rodney. Andrev Dice Clai plays a gangster that seems to be dying to say F-word (which should be because the movie is ranked as R, but it's like PG), and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2-minute game. Do not misunderstand me; sometimes I laughed at several Rodney's jokes, but a poor man becomes too old and too slow. We see his jokes coming from miles. And the movie turns into a PC that thanks to the terrible nineties, the 70s and 80s, Rodney simply does not work anymore.
