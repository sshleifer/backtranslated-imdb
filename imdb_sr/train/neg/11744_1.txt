After I finally looked at this movie as a whole, I am totally mysterious for the admiration of critics and online users. Is it the worst western ever? No, I would not say that. But "the last great American Westerner", the term that I have repeatedly applied to him? Not even close. A film that tries to tell a story like this, requires convincing characters that talk about convincing dialogue, and the dialogue in this movie is among the most open and most sensitive that I have ever seen. The film can be measured in rocks per minute; how many times is an actor or actress forced by a script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There are so many cases that this is disturbing. The siren lines come to you in the waves; predictable, non-original and often. If bad dialogue does not bother you, what about bad battles? A few Western ones can show you a fight against weapons that is absolutely incredible while desperately trying to seriously accept the action. It's okay if there is a comic edge of such a pistol, like in Silverado, but in Tombstone a very staggering and very rigid choreography of an early gun is just another reason to leave this film out of a good Western list. The final billing is somewhat redeemed by the director on this scenario, but until then I was so uninterested in the film that it was out of savings. Apart from those shortcomings, I can say that the visuals are stunning - the film is well recorded, and the settings look great. The acting is passable, especially given the actors' ability to work. However, if you are looking for the last great American Westerner, do yourself a favor - instead rent an Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
