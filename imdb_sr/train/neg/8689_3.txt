The main problem with "Pover" is that he also has too many pointless characters and sub-folders that do not add anything to the movie. It gets bored after a while, sitting up and waiting for scenes that do not connect to find something that moves the movie forward. Probably you could transfer all of this as character development, but they are all either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie, or are simply simple and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to allow any of the supporting lions to flourish. He had to cut several characters (hackman, woman) and concentrate on others (Billings). It could have been a big, heavy political thriller, instead of a messy mess that was losing any message in the sea of ​​bad writing and acting, which impressed me with the acting role. Even the performance of Gene Hackman was not level. Denzel Washington is the only real player in this field. Gere and the others did much better performances elsewhere. Sidney Lumet should return to the fierce one of the seventy people (ie, Serpico) and stop trying to regain success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". She still has not worked Sidney, and she probably will never. leave the Altmanu drama ensemble. 3/10 <br /> * / * * * *
