Good Earth is perhaps the most boring film I've ever seen in my life. The action is slow and missing. The acting is a border comic. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say that I have seen a movie that does not create a fair capability. The only rescue grace I found with this movie is its productive value. The use of hundreds of stats through the film creates a very convincing and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects that were used to create the illusion of millions of axes are easy to sell and then were revolutionary. Apart from the production value, I can say something else that is good or fun about this movie.
