Even worse than the worst "confuser" of David Linch, "Brain Dead" makes no sense. The shamefully lost talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Pakton) bounces around as if they were in the "Tom and Jerry" cartoons on acid. The character development is not significant. It just begins to climb a "strange rock", until it climbs to total chaos. Do not get into this because of the above-mentioned fine actors. They are not given anything to do, and you will be wondering what is going on during the whole, unbearable 85 minutes. I recommend avoiding "Brain Dead" at all costs, unless you break your brain into total stupidity. - MERK
