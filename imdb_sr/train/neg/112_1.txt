This movie is simply terrible. John Ritter works for pratt crashes, 75% of actors deliver their lines as if reading from cards, poor editing, terrible mixing of sound (the dialogue is difficult to pick up in places above the background noise), and a plot that is really going nowhere. I did not think I would ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 other people who drink more. Patti Hansen delivers his lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started wondering if she was dead inside. Even Bogdanovic's children are terrible (the eldest definitely reads her lines from the card to the sign). This movie is seriously terrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project until 4 years later. Please, do not look at it. If you see it on television lists, cancel the cable. If your friend suggests that, consider your friendship. If your husband wants to look at it, it's better to find another soul soul. I'd rather get my eyes with a dart arrow than through this piece of garbage again. If I could summarize this film in one word, that word would be: Suck-Tricks
