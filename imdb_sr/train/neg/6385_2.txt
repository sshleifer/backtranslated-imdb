Gainiggers from Outer Space are pretty summarized by their name. As long as it lasts only 27 minutes, it describes a spaceship of gay black people coming to Earth to free men from women. Although I see little significance for the plot, it's really illogical. However, it was supposed to be a comedy / fervor about society and science fiction. I laughed a few times, so it works there. Special effects are terrible. When a spaceship floats above the Earth, you can see the stars of the zoom for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown initially look fake, the equipment on board is illogical, the text has several spelling mistakes, the actors are unconvincing, the characters are puzzled; Generally, the whole thing is not taken seriously. If you go through all the aspects that make it a bad movie, it's very affordable and easy to see. Some parts are hilarious. But all in all, the only thing that remembers you is that it was one of the happiest concepts ever. . But his illogicality and a little long-term value. I can not really recommend it; if you watch it, do it for a unique concept, not for quality.
