Something poetic right to see a dentist. To pat them, in this gloomy, really horrible movie, but cause the audience to suffer from pain and from a non-toothy variety. If you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids, barfing kids, sick children, lots of long, long meaningful looks, dead woman and worried husband: everything is there for you. Boring, long-standing, stands out as one of those screaming examples: why? Is there a salutary grace? Yes there is. There is a short scene from Nabucco, with pretty good singing. Save money, or if it's on television or cable, save time. You can always read a book or make an omelette.
