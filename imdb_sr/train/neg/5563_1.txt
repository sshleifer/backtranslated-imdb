Dolph Lundgren imagined and frowned through this unrelated mystery / thriller that was not nearly as cool as he'd believed in the box. He's actually pretty good here, but the story is a mess of B-movie clich√©s (detectives, revenge, tycoons, whores, S & M) that seems to have been invented as they went along. The movie is picking up in the second half, but for a more decent Lundgren flick, RED SCORPION is rented.
