From the first moment, this "thing" is just a horrible sequence of extremely short cuts of blurred cameras. While the whole action has all potential for the thriller, the story is so badly said that I can not buy it. From the middle of the film, the characters' actions do not make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS. For example, Ed's idea that Edna made coffee for them after she fired from her son's arms was far below his alleged experience; It's just a very stupid idea. Domino, which does not question the fragmentary orders it receives from Claremont Villiams due to the breakdown of the telephone connection, is just getting out of me; should not you have long suspected Villiams bring them? It seems that these FBI agents do not think to show up with just one helicopter to something they have every reason to think about the capital mob shooting. In addition, what they do by denying and leaking information to Cigliutti are quite an incitement to murder; It seems like a forgiving justice if it's the way the FBI is investigating. In reality, they would have a case that would be untidy if they acted like that. We see an automobile accident that would otherwise have the least serious injuries if it did not kill most passengers, but miraculously leaves them with just a few bruises. On the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino, who leads love with Choco, who is from the Domino point of view in no way based on previous events, but only by drugging to the eyeballs. starting with a phone call from Claremont Villiams, it seems to me that I am eager to see the dramatic glittering. This in combination with the horrible, uncomfortable work of the camera just makes a piece that I do not want to call a movie. I am sorry about the futile effort of the main actors, whose talent is not taken into account.
