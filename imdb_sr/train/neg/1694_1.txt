This movie can look terrifying on commercials, but the real movie was the reason for vomiting. This is below average, (even lower than that) and there is no complication. I mean, every house can make you feel scared and safe, a dead Japanese woman would scare you, but then what? Make a movie that will attract viewers, not just display pictures of scared people and some hair (dead Japanese). Can you say "the terrible seizure of Samara (Ring)"? Do not start with a "dead child". Not even that terrible! So what? He has a cat and can imitate him, big thing! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential to be hurt by Grudge! 1/10! Iuck! >. <
