In a film based on historical personality, I was rarely subjected to such absurd nonsense. The horrible joke of the film, I hugged. Terrible, cramped, distorted and spilled with open lies and half-truths. Famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was originally a consultant for this film. However, he realized that the scenario was so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused, and also asked him to stop using his name as a source (it was unpleasant for him to think that people would think he was involved). One scene shows Hitler fighting his dog. There is no one source for that. Hitler loved animals above humans. He passed stringent animal welfare laws in Europe, banned animal vivisection and experiments. He was also a vegetarian. The film converts its iron cross into a farce, including a bribe. Utter lie. He received a reward for courage over a long period of time. No historical documents show that Hitler has ever had a sexual relationship with his niece. Not one. In addition to these, Hitler is portrayed as a furious dumbbell in this treacherous garbage. If he was even half ignorant, crazy and dense as he did this stupid movie as in real life he would not have known that he had ever existed. Do not forget to become a German leader. Honestly, this film was extremely terrible. Take a look at Dovnfall and give it this very wide bay.
