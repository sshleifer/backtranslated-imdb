This had to be one of the worst movies ever. When Kate appears and Jade is with a bunch of guys and everyone starts to clap ... and Hollivood. Another bad scene was when Kate ran her hands on the pavement and seemed to examine the texture of the pavement. Andy's acting is so bad in this movie - I could not connect with them or feel love for others. The other two women were very good and they were shining with Andie. In any case, this was such a film. I usually like these films, but I just could not get into this movie. Too incredible situations, and again Andy's acting did not help the movie. Also, it's all right. Lancome needs to put makeup with a knife because it looks glamorous in the stores.
