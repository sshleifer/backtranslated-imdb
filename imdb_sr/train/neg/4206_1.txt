I was at the premiere of this film at the 1997 Toronto Film Festival. After the screening, when the writer / director and some band members offered to answer questions, nobody could even ask. Rarely, the film was so badly focused (why, for the name of the world, random frames were cut out of some scenes?), Glupo glumio (David Arquette, paraphrasing Dorothy Parker, does not run an emotional gamut from A to B. Brings lunch) and totally meaningless. The characters behave completely beyond the character for no reason, except to force the plot to move in certain directions. Finally, the film comes to an entirely random and meaningless end that should "really think". Unfortunately, what makes you think: "Well, there are 90 minutes of my life, I will never return."
