I'm not one of those people who just go to the internet after I look at a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made. If you are suspicious of me, check out my other reviews. However, for the first time ever, I saw a film so terrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was over. I love bad movies. For me, Ed Vood is a genius, I thought Bloodi Murder, Jeepers Creepers and the most terrible horror films were good. However, there is not any good thing I can say about this movie. The plot is basically not available. If someone reads my review to spend my money to see it, they can understand themselves what it might be, but I advise you to make money more valuable than watching this movie. Special effects are bad. The act is bad. Two traces are attractive, but that's all there is to it. I'm not the type to spoil the movie for everyone, but I invite everyone to send me an email to fokbarking@iahoo.com to ask me for an opinion about this movie before spending ten cents on it. I'll tell you everything. I love bad movies, and I love horror and I like new inventive films. I even love horror porn things like Hostel (some reviewers claimed it was, but apparently they just thought it was the reason Roger Bart was in this and hostel 2). But this is perhaps the most painful and dumbest and dumbest EVER movie ever made. Before you ignore this review, this comes from someone who has not only been sitting through the entire Premiership of the House of the Dead. , but he actually bought a copy.
