Documentary about nomadic Persians who made a dangerous transition to massive mountains to get their herds in the grass. Watching these quiet, black-and-white characteristics, partially covered by tvink-tvink-tvink of an oriental music score that could not be used in the original show, is even duller than it sounds. A spectacular scene is lost on a small black-and-white screen, and there is an ultimate failure to establish any line of intent. I loved Nanooc from the North and March of the Penguins, but I despised this film, regardless of the similarity of the theme. Only physical difficulties are not very interesting.
