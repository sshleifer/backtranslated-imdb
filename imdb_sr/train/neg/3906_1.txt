One night I managed to sneak out and go to the cinema to see this, thinking I was ready for a treat. Boy, am I wrong? Given the talent, this must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Everyone in it was wrong, and I find it incredible to read on this site that there are people who really loved it.
