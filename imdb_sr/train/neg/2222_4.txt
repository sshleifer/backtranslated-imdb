Carlo Verdone once managed to combine top comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism. Then something happened, and he turned into another boring "holy-from-you" director. Il Mio Miglior Germany can more or less summarize in one row the "working class = kind and warm, while the upper class = snob and cunning, but love eventually wins." Banal clich√©s for such a smart CEO. There is not much in the film about which one could talk about. Each character is a stereotype walking: a self-confident man who forgets his roots, but who will again become "good", overlooked a woman, a rebellious rich girl who falls to a fair but poor type ... The act is barely average. Very disappointing in every way.
