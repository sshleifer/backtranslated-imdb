How many times do we have to watch bad horror movies with the killer in the Scream-ripoff mask? Bleed's action is original, but the film is a complete failure. For one thing, the dialogue is poorly developed, boring and spending too much time on trivial details, acting is bad, and so on. I want my money back, this rental stinks worse than stupidity.
