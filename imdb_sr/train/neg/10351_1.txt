This film barely followed the story of the movie. All the fascinating points in the book did not even exist in the film. They ended up turning it into an unusual "tweed" film story about the Disney movie "Meg" and "Calvin". It was so bad that Hillary Duff was playing a role, or one of them. This film was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can not believe that Disney could get out with such a cheap, basic performance. If you've ever read a book, I think you would agree that this can easily be turned into a film about the equivalence of Lord of the Rings. This film could never use the title A Vrinkle in Time. Badly done.
