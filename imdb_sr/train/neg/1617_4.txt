What an unusual movie. Absolutely no concessions for "Hollywood special effects" or entertainment. No background music, no special effects or enhanced sound. The facial expressions are usually covered with thick beards, and the Spanish language is a strange monotone lint that sounds the same in the middle of a battle or a conversation about campfire. I kind of watched these films (Parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not just something I should go and have fun. It is very long and somewhat boring. But I suppose, given the lack of any development of the plot, I do not even think it is very instructive. to spot any story from the film dialogue - it would be a good idea to read a little bit of history to understand the context of what is happening, for the director for some reason did not consider it necessary to inform the audience Che's band was moving in the way they did it - As a result, groups appear to be sneaking around the forest without any special reason and shot. I'd like to give more star to this movie for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing the depth of character, but somehow all of the characters in the end were still strangers. The stars they get are for realism and show the difficulties of guerrilla warfare.
