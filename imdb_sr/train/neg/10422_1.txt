First, it's not easy to scare me ... Everything but my few phobias, but this movie is absolutely horrible. This is not suitable for children at all! My mouth was opened all the time until it just shocked me. I could not believe how much it was for a children's movie, rabbits that were brutally killed! It's just unnecessary to be so horrifying and to be ranked by G. I recommend that I be more than 8 to see it. But do not misunderstand me, it was probably a good movie to not hurt me mentally as a child. I can not believe that the parent would allow a four-year-old child to look at this. It's just intense and complicated, not to forget that blood is for young children. I was just over 4 and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend
