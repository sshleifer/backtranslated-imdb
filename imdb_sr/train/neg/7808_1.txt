I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen, so it's unnecessary to say, I bought this movie, even without renting or anything ... This movie was so scary, I did not even bring it to the store, I would not want anyone else to be exposed to this human poison, I just threw him into the trash, no matter what the money, it was worth throwing it away. The acting was not so bad, it was not good or anything. The story was terrible, and the end was something I despised. He was a broken man, an alcoholic. his life was a bunch of garbage. I thought that his horse, peanut, was a horrible device to show his innocence in childhood, the dog would be much better. I also hate religion, so this region has undoubtedly ruined me. Jesus heals all ... I hate to know people like these great Christians and Catholics, and time will show that God does not cure everything, or anything. It was a horrible movie, if you have the ability to see it, go through it, or even better buy it, or rent it, and throw it in the trash, and leave coffee at it in the morning
