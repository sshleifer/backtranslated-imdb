The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word "Woman". I do not know if it was deliberate or not, but if it was certain that something of the German audience was at the Fantasy Film Festival last year, when it was shown. movie got. It's not that the goal was to laugh, it's a horrible movie for God's sake! A terrific movie in more than one sense. It's a shame that such a premise was futile for horrible and unbearable moments for the viewer (definitely not for a bad heart !!)! It was not necessary to show all the things that were shown. I do not even engage in a moral obligation (because movies do not actually have such a type of task or function) a discussion of what is shown here, but this is a new series in the whole "torture movement" that has risen over the past few years!
