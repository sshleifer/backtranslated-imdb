I recently watched a movie and it is similar to what the book is based on. I blame this for a bad scenario and direction. Some parts were forcibly introduced (gai rape scene) for no apparent reason. I actually read the book after watching the movie and about 20 years after I read it for the first time. It was hard for me to read and a bit clumsy. Too many different ideas introduced without any benefit ... except for the sensational parts of the time. Since it covers things that were considered "sensitive", at least during communism, I see the fascination it produced at the time. It's no longer the case, or maybe now I see things differently or little of both. The film is too busy to cover many aspects of the book, and is the result of a fabrication of scenes that can make sense for someone reading the book. Even so, this is a movie that's hard to watch and maybe it's never made.
