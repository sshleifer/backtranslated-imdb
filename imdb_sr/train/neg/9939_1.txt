The intellectuals of the film school can drop everything they want about the important (imaginary) meaning of this film, but it is only: intellectual glory. This film is creatively bankrupt, and some mistake is infinitely self-indulgent vanking as a substance. Yes. Obviously, Godard was not a Stones fan. Too bad, because this could have been great. He records the birth of this timeless song and decides to cover music with a guy who reads from a real detective mag or some kind of shit. Then there are endless footage of what looks like librarians of the 60's who spray painting words on people's cars. And there is a seemingly endless "interview" where the actress was brilliantly directed to answer only yes or no to all really deep and intellectual issues. There's a guy in a purple suit who reads more shit out of a book that lasts, oh, only about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something in the dump. It almost sounds intriguing? Well, it's not. But for unwanted movie schoolboys who do not care about squabbling about lost opportunities to have complete access to Stones who bring sympathy for the devil to the world and prefer to hear some English guy reading rather than looking at the covers of nudist magicians, this The movie is a real winner! More precisely ... may Godard just hit.
