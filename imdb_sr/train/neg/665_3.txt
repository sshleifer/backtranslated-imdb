In Bridgeport, a disturbed high school teacher, Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech), was obsessed with teenager Donna Keppel (Brittany Snov); the witness killed her family to stay with her, but Richard was arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, traumatized Donna feels better, but she is still under psychological treatment and takes pills. At her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobbie (Scott Porter) and two friends in Pacific City Hotel for fun. But the psychopath Richard escaped from jail and was placed on the same floor at the hotel in search of Donna, pounding his friends and hotel staff over his way. collection of clich√©s with complete lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and stupid, with the bad acting of Johnathon Schaech as a crazy killer. The predictable scenario is incredible because it is possible to predict what will happen in the following scenes. My voice is three.
