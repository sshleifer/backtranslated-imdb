Nightmare on the Street Elm: Child Dreams This is a bad movie. No escape. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror films. But even if I'm a fan, I can not see this film is central. Even the effort to make an interesting story and strong characters. So far they have just given up. They're not trying. Of course, they are manufacturing, hoping for a few more light dollars. The story does not attract your attention. He's just almost absent. Alis, survived from the fourth, is now pregnant. Freddy returns through the dreams of a child. At first, we learned that Alice had to stop him. And that is that. The story progresses slowly because it has such a small parcel, which means it's pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogs and terrible acting. In fact, it's the only scary thing, acting, because death is not even a bit cold. The characters are so uninteresting that they do not care about them. Girls are unattractive as much as possible. The whole head reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I saw better actors in school performances. It's really embarrassing. Lisa Vilcock still manages to introduce some class into this. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. But the material did not allow her to shine. A pity. Stephen Hopkins's work is not even near the glittering direction of Rennie Harlin in the Dream Master. He tries some imaginative footage at the end, but this tension that Harlin and Craven did so well in the previous films was not where to find it. It's a movie that gives the horror series a bad name. End to one scary Freddy. It's sad that I see him now. Clown it's not funny. Bad joke. Goodbye Freddie.
