I only saw Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco) and I do not remember her, but she did a great job like a naive girl who posed for pictures because she made people happy. She did not really think she was doing wrong, even when she left the job and found her religion again. The photos she made were certainly tantalizing to today's standards, and it's ridiculous to watch men with cameras getting excited and politicians pontificate the evil of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night and Good Luck) has played a great role here. Mari Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed a remarkable biograph of the most famous pinup girl ever.
