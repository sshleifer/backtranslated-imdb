To say that this film smells would be insulting to the dumbbells. As another commentator says, this film offends everyone who is over 7 years old (especially incredibly offensive to homosexuals). It's terrible - not so "bad, funny", too - it's simply horrible. No, I have to say that. (excuse the skunk). From opening to ending the title, it's hard to find more than 10 seconds for this movie. The "action" is incoherent, the characterization is nonexistent, the acting is at the top of mugging "look at me funny!" school and so it continues. The sets are awkwardly set (if at all) and are badly done, it's simply terrible on every front - except for music, maybe I do not remember that the music was stink (except the songs). To be fair to producers, they pretty quickly set up their cards at the table: the initial credits include the title "Also starring Ertha Kitt as Betti meteor" (since the never-seen meteor Never say anything else except that you occasionally provoke the noise that may have contributed to Mrs Kitt's contribution from one of her boards), and the second line of the film is running something like: "... and scientists have discovered new facts about rings around Uranus." Uranus - "Your Anus" gedit? gedit? huh? huh ?? Your Anus? Humor is really so cheap. It writes strange things about the "comedies" of that period because it is perfectly permitted for the hero to deliberately shoot dead people on the street but not to say "sh *" I paid for fifty pennies (about $ 1.00) for this movie on sale. I feel like dressed.
