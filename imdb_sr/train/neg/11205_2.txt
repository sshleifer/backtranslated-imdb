Yes, well, I definitely regretted that I gave up on Saturday night watching this strange little but very long movie. Apparently neither the main character stole two hours of my life. Here's the antichrome content in "No Regrets". We have this jerk, so confused, so wandering, so selfish, pointless and inconceivable that it was extremely difficult to go through the attraction of a strong businessman who became a talented son, Jaemin, unless it is only physical attraction. He claims otherwise, that it is love. But after watching this, it's like I love Charles Manson because you're digging a beard. (All right, he's not that bad, but there are still no real characteristics that can be eliminated.) I could never go for the reason of the endless trees Jaemin Sumin. It has never been shown, just said, that Jaemin likes Sumin. Maybe it's a cultural thing that flew over my head: crazy / uhodna = crazy love in Seoul. It must be, because more than half of the film is what lures the other, and the last part lurks back and forth to the point where I thought it turned into a comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named "baby" to appear. Okay, so Sumin does two jobs while going to school, so far so well that someone is trying to improve himself. But after his first taste of the appeal of his stalker, he renounced his daily business for some kind of prostitution ring. What? OK, well, as already mentioned, the obsession does not stop because of a change of work / career, and if you cast a bunch of other very angry characters, you will get a shuffled movie in which incredible appearances appear to occur only without accumulating. A basic movie, not 100% horrible, but you can work better with foreign gai topics.
