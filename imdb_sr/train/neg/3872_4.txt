The movie never becomes unbearable to watch. And to say, there's nothing to show, except perhaps partly sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nervous character in discovering a sexy dress. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see it in any way. There is no tension, little action, impenetrable dialogue, unsatisfactory sensuality, the same boring locations, and very stupid behavior. Kevin Dillon is totally worthless. Silverstone ... well, I did not concentrate too much on her acting, I admit. However, as I said before, if someone has nothing but watching a movie, it will not look so bad. 4/10
