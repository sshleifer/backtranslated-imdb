On the cover page (showing a man with a terrible pellet) it would appear to be a martial arts movie. (Difficult.) It's interesting that the real title of the movie is Trojan Varrior. (Trojan is a brand of condoms in the US) This film is full of homoerotica. If you like these things, then this movie is not that bad. However, consider the following: There are a number of big plans of acting grooves and fences (One scene even has every actor with an erection that bursts in the pants.) Colors such as lime, peach and red . From the point of view of the cameraman, this film is dear kueen! Several scenes are featured by characters standing close to each other, occasionally touching as they speak. Also, a cousin of a hero likes women, and every other guy in the film is trying to kill him. Is there a message that the film's authors want to convey? To go to the fight scene? (Yes, somebody's private parts are buried in one battle.) Martial arts scenes are short and unimaginable. There are no fancy stuff here, just your standard moves you would see in Chuck Norris's old film. There's also a car hunt scene that can be the first ever recorded LOV-speed chase.
