After enjoying Jean Arthur in the film "The Devil and Miss Jones," my interest was at its peak, so I tried to get through this second bolt on the investigation of the death of a jockey - but I did not get to the end. Arthur, photographed in an insightful, film magazine, or wants alimony from his former husband, Villyama Povella, or another bullet in a marriage, but I never felt for her because the figure is just a wise man (she is the type of heroine comical curiosity, but once in a morgue - like all the women in these 30's comedies - she faints). Villiam Povell allegedly had a lot of time to work with Miss Arthur, but you would never know it from the end result; they look awkwardly standing to one another, indecisive about their joke. The actor who plays Poel's boyfriend is sick, and the pause for spectators laughs with discomfort.
