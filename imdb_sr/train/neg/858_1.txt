I hate this movie! It was nothing like a book, and I was just thinking about it. If you watch a movie before reading a book, then yes, that's a good movie. But King's book was AMAZING and this film was nothing like that. I mean, the general meaning may be similar, but most aspect of the film is completely different. Place for an example! So it's extremely intense in the book, and Danny and Wendy go out a second before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible version of the movie as it leads them through the stupid labyrinth ... yes, there is no labyrinth in the book and there is no reason for it. The other part that made me angry was that Jack just kills Mr. Halloran! What is it, he is essentially a hero of the book and they just kill him as if he does not matter. All in all, it was only bad that the film was so extraordinary.
