Almost equally boring to watch as well as to read, the Evening is a magnificently produced failure ... until Meril Streep goes in and quietly shows other actors how these things behave. Vanessa Redgrave is shockedly excluded in her role as dying Ann and Claire Danes. Perhaps, if Vanessa and Claire had replaced roles, we could see the vibrancy of young Ani who gave her an entry into the divorced world of the story, and we could imagine that older Ann is actually dying. I was hoping that the addition of Michael Cunningham to credit for writing would put an end to nervous tale, but unfortunately. He gave me a headache.
