I watched this film with some friends a couple of months ago, still laughing today about some of the ultimate nonsense. The first few scenes were just hilarious. I will not spoil anything to those who want to see it, I do not want to ruin laughter. Needless to say that I watched this movie all the time, I tried to understand exactly what the meaning of the characters in this film was. In the end, we all got bored, because the initial cheerfulness and shock of the film was accidental. There is no plot, not a trace of decent behavior. The characters are as well developed as those in the book Learn to Read. They even managed to make the lesbian scene uninteresting.
