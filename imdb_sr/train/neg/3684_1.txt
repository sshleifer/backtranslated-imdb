It was sold as a horror movie, it should have been a thriller, but I considered it quite funny (comedy? I do not think so), I laughed out the whole movie that I think is because of the funny acting and complication. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy". I loved his acting in Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams .. Wow! she is a beauty, and a good actress, but let's try to be a little objective, telling mm mm ... the direction mm mm ... she's missing a lot of good suspension is actually a boring film, but there is one good thing, it's short film, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (I'm 10 minutes under water !!!) Just do not know why this film is rated so high, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher, what is not in line with good, rational and objective criticism?
