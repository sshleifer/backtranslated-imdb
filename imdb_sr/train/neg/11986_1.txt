What a terrible writing and acting. No personality. What, can not you make a good one-character movie? Hmm, this was done in Castaway with your own dialogue. So this kid goes on the road to see his father. The kid, Jason, takes the plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies in the middle of the summer. So the kid breaks down in the lake and survives. Then he runs around, surviving in the wild until he is saved. During that time he twice fights with a bear. For the first time it fights in the lake. The second time he makes a spear from a branch and a spear of bears. Two shots of fake blood that broke out of the bear's breast reminded me of Monty Python's "Holy Grail". Geg.
