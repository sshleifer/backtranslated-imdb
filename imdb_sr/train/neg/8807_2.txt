I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie just like "28 days" or so ... but not at all. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens, except for a group of women who seem to be infected with a strange virus that causes them to eat human flesh in order to survive. This plot leads to a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism ... Very bad film. * My Rate: 2/10 - - - - - - - - - - - - - -------------- ---
