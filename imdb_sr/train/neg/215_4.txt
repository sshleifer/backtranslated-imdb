I'm not as much a love sick as I do. Finally, the film expresses the sexual relationship of Alek, Kik, Sando, their love triangle is full of intensity, frustration and jealousy; at last Alec woke up and realized that he would not have the result and the future. Director Tudor Giurgiu was at the AMC Theater on Sunday at 12:00 am 08/10/06, with us watching the film together. After the film, he told the audience that the intention to make this film that should express the sexual relations of the Romanian language is somehow complicated. In my opinion, sexual life is always complicated everywhere, I do not feel any special impression and effect from the film. The love process of Alec and Kiki, Kiki and her brother Sandu, were some kind of story from the neighborhood. Two main reasons why I do not like this movie are, first, the film did not tell us how they fell in love? It sounds like Alec, after he entered the building where Kiki lived, fell in love with two girls. It does not make any sense. To make the girl fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too many fragments, it is necessary to imagine and connect these stories with their minds. Secondly, the entire film had no sexual intercourse with Alex and Kiko, which I expected. However, some parts were still deserved to be recommended. Part of the "ear piercing" was interesting. Alek was prepared to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate Kiko's love. It was a touching scene that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. Also, the scene that lay on the football field, the conversation expressing their love is true and passionate.
