I was disappointed. the film was a little predictable and did not lead to a hypo plated across the box. Having said that, the characters were well developed, the vintego myth was used in a single room, and the house was quite scary, but for me it simply missed it. I've always been waiting for this great AHHHHH or BOO! But it never came. In addition, the film was hit by bad recording of bad special effects. In this way it turns out to be very bad and does not use the atmosphere and imagination of viewers to create horror and uncertainty. Try movies such as Session 9 or Cube if you are looking for a cheap but well-designed horror movie.
