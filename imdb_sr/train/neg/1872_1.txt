BE WARNING. This film is such a mess. It's a disaster. Do not waste time with this. I warned you! Acting, story, dialogue, music ... essentially everything is so on the top, it's absolutely boring and funny. It made me vomit (if the dialogue / act / story did not work, everyone shot at fault). You will feel like watching a comedy. The problem is that parts that are supposedly funny are not even funny. The acting, story, cinema, you can feel that everything just tried VAAAAI too hard - but it never succeeded. Practically every shot is tilted, but what then ?! This film only feels like a student film. No wonder they recorded this in HD format, because it would be a waste of money to spend more on filming on the movie. clich√©s, all you have been forced into your face, oh and did I mention bad behavior? (well, actually, not all this is the actor's guilt - this is the director!) then I guess this movie will appeal to you. I'd turn it off right away if I could. If you still can not say so far, I hate this movie. It made me regain and regain time ... at least I did not have to pay for this garbage. Jeff Goldblum, you know ... Jurassic Park's guy / Independence Day is in this film, but he has since gone downhill - accepting roles for movies such as this disaster.
