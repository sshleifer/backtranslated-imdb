What a damn thing that Alan Clark must be connected to this bush. However, this does not exclude; gather a group of guys and some Stele, and for some time be constantly on the move and slide the floor in tears of laughter. Great nightmare lost. Al Hunter dominates the well-publicized theme of the late 80's - that hooligans are well organized and that they are not really interested in football itself - often with respectable jobs (real estate agent). But as Clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors who leave from other low-quality TV productions (Grange Hill) or soon cross over to a bad drama (Eastenders), he can convince us that heavy football robbers are ridiculous for the nanosecond. Do we really believe that the ICF (to which, of course, the drama is based) EVER go to another city to fight with only six? ICF will discharge tubing stations and the like. HUNDREDS. Andi Nicholls' Scalli needs to read before thinking about the story of this nature. The acting is terrible and gives most of the laughter - Oldman is such a camp that it's incredible. Most of them seem to be in the bath g. Mateija. It's a real inspiration for anyone with a digital video camera who thinks it can make it.
