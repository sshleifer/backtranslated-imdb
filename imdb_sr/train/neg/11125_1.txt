Hey, look, he's doing it, there's a lot better showing of the difficulty of black America than this. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the bad execution of the story, which I mentioned, strikes. score department. It's funny to see Oprah as the last type of whore whore. The scene in which the Chamber puts Elizabeth McGovern into the burning-room. Pure classic cinema. First, I do not care how drunk you are, you will react to the flame of 1200F (no matter how bad you play). But they really blurred the scene ... she was comical. I'll tell you, however, I was very pleased when I saw Elizabeth McGovern burning in a fake death; annoys me.
