This ghost movie Kiioshi Kurosawa is pretty wild, and he had at least one jump that caught me. But all in all, the film is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to find a suspected serial killer, only to find out that he may have committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by the beautiful spirit of Asia and has no idea why (and even the viewer). While other murders have been committed, it becomes even more confused as killers are easily found, and this spirit is still being pursued for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, it is also the spirit of the crazier than anything, especially when suddenly flying over the city, like Wonder Voman. And the ending does not make much sense, in fact, the whole movie makes little sense, and I can not recommend it at all. If it were not so serious, I think it should have been a black comedy. Outside the "bright future", this is the worst film directed by Kiioshi Kurosawa, which I still saw.
