Another great Costa-Gavras movie. A great presentation of the situation in Latin America and the participation of the United States in the politics of Latin America is great. The facts may or may not be true, but the fact is that the United States has been deeply involved in strikes and the support of Latin American dictatorships. In spite of this, the spirit of the film follows typical left / communist. Cold War propaganda. Kosta Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, it represents US actions as brutal and inhumane, while Tupamaros's extremist activities are something positive. As it turned out, it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the United States turned on. Europe is full of poor Eastern European prostitutes. I have never heard that the poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls are massively prostituted as it happens in most Eastern European countries. The United States fought in the dirty war and God blessed us, all the monster of Soviet communism was defeated. Unfortunately, the United States had to do what they did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world like Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe. If Matamoros came to power in Uruguay, we would have another Ukraine in Latin America. Right.
