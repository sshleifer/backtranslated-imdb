The sound for this film has always been about incredible graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Unfortunately, they stopped there. They should have continued to lose the script, then a silly set, and finally every visible element of this movie. There is nothing else that could be shown. Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlow are listed as credits for writing this movie. I really do not think they exist. I think they bought this scenario in Scripts-R-Us, where you're buying a standard empty Monster Movie script and just fill in the gaps. The monster is haunting us. Let's split.

He's not dead yet. You know, standard things. Even the minimal number of elements that were specific to the invisible film of a human (IR glasses, spraying something like a color) are poorly processed. What is sad is that there were many opportunities for this to be a fascinating movie. The psychological problems of the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, the treatment of the invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched usually less than 2 seconds and would be much more interesting. In the end, there was a desire to save Kevin Bacon, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it falls. I would mention some incredibly stupid elements of film finishing, but I do not want to do any spoilers. It's enough to say that these characters are so dumb that they do not think about pulling the connector on the machine than ...
