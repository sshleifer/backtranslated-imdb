Trying to compare or present this "beer" as something "Hitchcockian" is an attempt to deceive Hitchcock fans to spend $ 7 on this movie ... Poor Performance Low Poor Poor Scenario. No real tension, no excitement. You are waiting for the weakness of this film because of the high profits or even any kind of payment ... You stop thinking about what this is about. And please, enough with the movement make the "alternative lifestyle" HIP and politically correct !! ... I can not recommend this to anyone ... Did I mention how stupid the act? Villiams worked better than Peter Pan and "Moore". But these are much more innocent times ...........
