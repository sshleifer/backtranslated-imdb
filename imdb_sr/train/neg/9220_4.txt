When the film began its first 4 minutes, it looked like a travelogue in California, I wondered if my tapes were mixed. Then I breathed in relief to see Paul Thomas in the scene with the beautiful Joanne Storm and Laurie Smith. This was spy Jimmy (young Tom Biron). Jimmy Wilder is worried about his behavior and is being hired by a private teacher (Kai Parker). I could have no animal, robotic role playing or aspect of the incest. There is one good scene of sex, between Biron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie. My Rating: D +
