In the autobiographical story "Romul, My Father," Eric Bana, of the Munich glory, plays the impoverished German emigrant struggling to raise his son, Raimonda (Kodi Smith-McPhee), in rural Australia from the 1960s. The main obstacle to the stability and happiness of the family is his wife Christina (Franka Potente), who grossly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly messing with other men. Despite her highly unconventional behavior, Romul refuses to give her a divorce, she is masochistic in the hopeless hope that one day she will return to him. It is, unfortunately, benevolent and benevolent Raimond, who must testify to all these marital turmoil - and that is his memoir that serves as the basis for the film (Raimond Gaita will later become the author). Although I admire "Romulus, my father" for what he is trying to do, I can not honestly say that I enjoyed it, because while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions, this is simply not enough to counter the cruel story and funeral, which leaves the audience as desperate and depressing as people on the screen. A serious drama of life is one thing, but this tirelessly uncertain rolling in adultery, madness, and multiple suicide (let alone suicide attempt) is something else.
