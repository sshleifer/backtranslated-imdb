VOV! Pretty awful things. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Tailor appears in Sardinia and links with art director Joseph Losey for this incredibly imaginary Fiasco Tennessee Villiams. Tailor plays a rich, dying widow who holds a fortress over her servants on the island, where she dictates, very loudly, her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary. When Nick Burton appears who claims to be a poet and an old friend, Tailor realizes that time has elapsed. Madness in an extreme situation - it is difficult to determine whether Tailor and Burton behave badly or if Villiams intends to make their characters so unassailable. If this is the case, the acting is brilliant! Burton murmurs his words several times, including the word BOOM, while Tailor squeaks. It's really terrible. Like Noel Covard as the Tailor's curse, "Vitch of Capri". I guess BOOM is about how it's a passing time and how fast life moves - two standard Villiams themes, but it's so wrongly directed by Losei, that Tailor and Burton wrote it for the audience during their main meaningless monologues, every substance the film has had would be completely diluted. BOOM has a stunning photo - the camera should be out of focus in order to ruin the beauty of Sardinia! Supported actors are Joanna Shimkus, great Romolo Valli as Tailor's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf ... and he and his dogs work on Burton!
