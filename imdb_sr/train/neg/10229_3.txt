I base this on my observations of an episode I saw last night (9/27/06). I do not think I'll look at it again. The plot was completely wooden, the plot is completely predictable, the end is completely unrealistic - I think who would believe in a $ 30 million judgment for the death of a recovered drug addict with terminal cancer? The main actor (Victor Garber) looked so embarrassing, almost embarrassing in his role - perhaps he realized how bad writing was! I am fully aware that the drama offered this season is pretty bad, but I can certainly find better writers. Maybe they wrote in India or China !! I bet we will not see the next season!
