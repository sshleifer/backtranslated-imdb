When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Obviously not. I have no idea how this movie is allowed to appear on this site. FearNet is a site that displays terrible horror films. Playing is wonderful of all actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The film starts with a man with a shield with a signifier. He interrupts the seal and catastrophic events occur. The water turns into blood, the oceans die, the moon becomes red, etc. The female figure is also boring. Many things she did not make sense. Like seeing a piece of paper with a date. Incidentally, this is the date when it is expected that he will give birth to his baby and begins to joke about it and begins to investigate and ask religious people what that means. Warning * The two worst things that happened in this movie were the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God had told him to kill his parents and the place where Demi Mur died after he gave birth to his baby and transfer her soul into it. br /> Here's what's happening. A mentally retarded person is shot and killed and an apocalypse begins. Demi Moore enters the hospital amid a massive earthquake and gives birth to his child. He touches the head of his child, shifts his soul into a child, and then dies. Then the apocalypse stops. Why does God suddenly have a change in his heart? It becomes angry when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man, and then is it all about forgiveness when a lonely woman transfers her soul to her baby? The end of the Spoiler * The film is pretty stupid. This is another religious end to the world's propaganda work. The acting of Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else is great. It's about everything that exists. I give this movie 2 stars of ten. Good acting with a lot of stupidity!
