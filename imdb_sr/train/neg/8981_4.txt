This top-notch / ripoff version of OKLAHOMA! / ANNIE GET YOUR PIÅ TOLU / CALAMITI JANA is not all that is unusual or innovative. Marketing and introductory comments can be there to save what is truly a badly musical musical western clip on the sound stage and as a live TV show. I do not find that there is a backdrop of cyclones, illuminated in different scenes with yellow, pink or red, or ... all this innovative. As already mentioned, it seems to me more like a movie that is produced on the TV budget: All sound scenes, with minimal sets of supported backlit cycles! However, actors are moving pretty well, and this style is much better achieved when Paramount recorded LI'L ABNER in 1959. think?
