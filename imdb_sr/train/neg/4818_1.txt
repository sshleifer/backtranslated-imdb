I was about seven years old when the film DIRE MONSTROSITI came out. In the United Kingdom, it was featured on television in the summer of 1977, weeks, as if it was an incredible movie hit. It was actually the first movie I've ever seen in the movie, and I've been postponed for years. Next week I was invited to go and watch a new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. To this day, I have never seen him, in protest, because I had to watch Saskuatch! Seriously, even at age 7, I knew I was watching the trash. It's so bad, it's almost unbelievable. The thunderous nonsense that NEVER should get to the cinema. However, I was amusing to read all these years later that the director never directed, just as far as I'm concerned. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!
