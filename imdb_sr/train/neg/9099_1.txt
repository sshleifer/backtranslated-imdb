This review also contains a first movie spoiler - so if you have not seen a single movie and want to, but do not want a spoiler, please do not read this review! While this film should be the first time on the Christian and Kathryn meeting, the film is a bad copy of the first Cruel Intentions. Actors screened by Kathryn Christian and Rian Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar are very poor substitutes. None of them can pull away the diminished, snootian attitude of the rich kids that the original actors did. It's absolutely horrible that some of the dialogue is literal - not so much between Christianity and Kathryn, but if you listen carefully enough, you will recognize it. There are inconsistencies in conspiracy - if this was indeed the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, why is a Christian in love with a girl at the end of the film? He allegedly should have been in love for the first time in his original film (with the character Reese Vitherspoon). Also, the comment on a photo / "It could be a model" commented the end was totally chrome and did not add anything. All in all, this film was a waste of time. I can not believe they have committed cruel intentions.
