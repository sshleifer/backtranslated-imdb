Two stars out of a possible 10 - and this is overly generous. I thought with the actors of James Voodoo, Cathy Bates, Randi Kuaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. to miss. I was wrong. I can only wonder which drug Sam Shepard was at the end of the weekend. I have long suspected that Sam S. somehow crazy, this film, based on his performance, confirms this. It is a kind of artistic bs.s. Actors like to drench their teeth because they give them a chance to endlessly emotionally. However, for the viewer who sits through this pointless waste, there is absolutely NISHT to love this movie. You have not seen a dysfunctional family until you see this pile. Dad's crazy, Mom's crazy, his son is crazy and his daughter is, oh yes, crazy. They also have a mouth on them to pronounce words that would make the blush of the sailors, especially the daughter of a teenager. In addition to the above, as if that was not enough, the plot - and it's so skinny you can read thoroughly - has a hole in the size of Alaska. Ma is committed to selling its failed farm. As it turns out, so is Pa. Now I am not claiming to be an estate expert, but the last time I checked, the joint ownership property must have both signatures of the owner to sell. If only one of them possesses property, then another can not legally sell it, so it would be useless for that person to do it. Mr. Shepherd likes to ignore this basic fact, and because of this, his action does not work. It's not that anything else really worked. The only possible reason anyone could watch this movie is whether they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can not imagine why someone would want it.
