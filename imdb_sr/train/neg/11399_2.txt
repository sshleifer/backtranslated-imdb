I can not believe I lost 80 minutes of my life watching this horrible movie and I hoped it would be better all the way, but the boy I made a mistake. The action was terrible, the performance was extremely bad, and the special effects were terrible. Even two beautiful girls could not revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. However, I can not lie, some of the lines in this film were very striking, as when the Asian boy said "I lost the innocence to a babysitter so **** **** stereotypes" do not waste time with this accident except if you are ready or you want to make a good laugh .. maybe you can watch it in this way to make this movie with some friends
