I love Columbo and I've seen almost all episodes, but this is undoubtedly ranked as the worst. A wise, boring, senseless, confused crowd of an invisible bastard that consumes both the time of the audience and the acting talents of the extremely boring look of Peter Falk. It seems that the "plot", like that, is just fictitious because the film goes along with even the slightest hint of ingredients in the formula that has shown that the show is such a brilliant success. One part of the process that I found extremely confusing (or perhaps embarrassing) was the image of Peter Falk who was presented to guests at the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If producers insist that Columbo be kept secret, why did not they leave this line at all because it sounds ridiculous? As I said, these are pits and all true Columbo fans would do well to avoid him as a plague.
