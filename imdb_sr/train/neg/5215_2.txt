It's the same old, "If I can not get the money for my project, I'll inject" a monster movie. There's nothing new here. It's a lot like Jeff Goldblum's movie "Fly". Man manages to retain some illusion of common sense, but in the end he is subject to the effects of his experiments. The acting is pretty bad. People act stupidly all the way, putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason. The guy returns to a laboratory where he is forbidden to enter. Then there is his relationship with a young woman and her son. Well, he looks good, but looks like a lot of trouble. It's a pretty big waste of time. Even his suit with the tyrannosaur seems to have gotten off the stand at the Star Trek Convention.
