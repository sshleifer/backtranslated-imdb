"Nada" was the most appropriate sequel to "Les NOces Rouges", now seen as the last good Chabrolov golden age film (1967-1973) "Nada", Chabrolov's first real attempt to fully political film his previous work, "Les Noces Rouges" it was also political elements, but it was more psychological thriller with a common view of society in the French provinces. "Nada" includes terrorists, ambassadors, taking hostages, plenty of blood, not exactly Chabro's heterogeneous actor gives the movie a hit: only Duchaussoi, who has already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel are all to the end. Viviane Romance, one of Duvivier's actresses ("la Belle Ekuipe", "Panikue"), Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are terrible. With "Hope" this is another period of infertile inspiration for Chabrol. That would be "Violette Nozieres". before he was at the top of his game again.
