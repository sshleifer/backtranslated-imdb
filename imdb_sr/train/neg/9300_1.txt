Spoiler Alert I think this film is probably the worst movie ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Vood (without heart). Lightning is terrible. Music is very bad (piano and orgas ... come on!). It's acting ... so it does not matter! There is a guy who actually goes to the forest to search for his missing wife and take time for sex with a stranger. The killer is a fat, inattentive clown who could not beat the turtle! Every member of the cast is stupid and the director puts every slash of movies on the movie without any effort. The place has been dumb ever made. Think about it: the guy (ken hebert) who is acting is about the same as his writing (he's the brain behind this failure) invites an associate and two of his friends to his cabin for the weekend and kills them. He returns to the office on Monday morning as if nothing is happening. The tragedy is that Mr. Hebert is trying to convince us that this is a family affair that lasts a generation (his uncle is a clown killer). Well, of course, there are no police officers to question him after his associate disappears ... WHAT WAS BIO. <br /> <br />
