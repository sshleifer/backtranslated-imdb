This movie is pretty bad. Action is utterly and completely forcible. Moreover, by filming the document as a docudrama it does not necessarily make it more convincing, you can not get out of it so easily, Mr. Dir. Do not let my comments mislead you, because I would recommend that you watch this movie, because it throws some light on psychology or non-existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However, the peak of the film is absolute trash! There is no other way to say that! It's pure and simply fails to conquer any sense of the atmosphere! What happens to me does not mean that I feel despair, panic, fear or fear that I would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances. Instead, it leaves you the jaw that falls "Was that it?" They come out of your tongue, and these boys are not being persecuted by you. Instead, you feel uncomfortable for another movie that started with potential, but eventually fell to the face at the most significant point. Zero Dai really .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
