Unfortunately, this film, 54, was a pathetic attempt at the true story of 'Study 54'. The only thing that was good about the picture was 'Mike Miers' who was happy to watch. "Neve Cambpell," although her role was small, unfortunately bad. The conclusion is that the movie lacked a good performance of the actors, except one, and that the conversion of a true story is a desperate attempt of a good script.
