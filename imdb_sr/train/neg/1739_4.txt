Looking at that lady in Ermin I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed at Marlene Dietrich. Someone from the 20th century may have decided that one sexual symbol is as good as the other. Darril F. Zanuck needed to know better. Betti played a 19th-century Italian counterpart whose domain attacked a company of Hungarian Hussein led by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. The palace's palace, together with the rest of its prominent family tree, sees little resemblance to Doug now and another conqueror about 300 years earlier with which she dealt with the army's fall. In addition, the present Betty was just married to the Emperor Romer and the invasion came in at the most adverse moment, before things were over. This will give everyone a bad attitude, I guarantee. Fresh, Healthy American Betti is NOT an actress to make it seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich could have put this to an end, but with Betti it's less than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks do not even have chemistry at all, although Dag is as charming as always and someone I can look at in everything. Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin have written the score for this film, and This is the Moment has been nominated for an Oscar for Best Song. One of the chances of this lady in Ermin's Oscars glamor was Buttons And Bovs. Ernest Lubitsch died in the middle of the road, and Otto Preminger finished this lady in Ermin. I can not believe that Lubitsch had in mind Grable's for guidance here. You will not even see that lady in Ermin.
