Some of these commentaries are just funny. It's not painful to watch with your significant other? I apologize to my boyfriend for the whole movie. It was so slow and terribly weird. Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were not ready for this, especially when Vanessa worked on this ridiculous American accent. Claire Today was the same unpleasant girl who was in handcuffs, and she was in my so-called life. It's still in any way. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! Mary Streep was one of the only redeeming parts of this film, she was on the screen for five minutes, and I swear to God, she stretched out the screen and slammed me. Oh! And Hugh Danny, who gets better every time I see him. Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in their two-and-a-half scenes. I mean, this was a well-recorded movie, it was very nice, the settings were interestingly dressed, providing relief for the intense boredom that I felt. I do not know, it's pretty pathetic when a movie that consists of actors "The greatest actress of our time" is so much shit. He must have had more than a few notable mistakes in editing, and the main character (Ann) was a big jerk. I was glad she died. But that's because I felt bad about Lila, Annina's girlfriend - mostly because these two ladies were better actors and because of which I felt a little compassionate. Ugh. BAD job, Evening the movie. You were not funny and you did not even wake up. I hope the book is better, so it does not waste people's time. 3/10
