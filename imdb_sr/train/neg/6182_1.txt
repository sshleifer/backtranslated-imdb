This film makes Peter a dwarf in Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in a probably-not-Robin Hood costume and ignores all the personality traits in him that really matter. This film makes Wendy a funny idiot. A poor Captain Hook TOTAL clown. And of course, every Disney cartoon must have a character that had too many blows to the head, and made one of the Lost Boys. The only character that is not embarrassed in this film is Tink. The only star is for her. And the story itself? Darling parents do not even get time to receive their children! Probably one of the most important points in the original story and they have destroyed it! Also, the famous scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is an amazing thing. - There is no threshold and no grain - one of the little things that makes the original story so unique. It's a miracle that he even lost his shadow and helped him to stab him. (Even if there are no shoes on his shoes, it does not make sense to me.) Smashing such a big story just to entertain children should be illegal. So know now if you did not know him before - this Disney version has nothing in common with the original story - which is not really a children's story, but a great, great story. This only makes me nervous until the end.
