I was not nearly as affected as many other reviewers. Of course, there are a couple of great girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two lovely hooded toys with a razor that go to the car on the road, take off with their home (at dusk) and invite prey .... What's going on there ... well, after being torn apart and mostly kissing, their visitors are killed. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has flashes with his camera. Some of the scenes are pretty spooky and effectively captured, but the sex does not hold the movie to the end (no intentionally ... at least consciously). There really is not much story here. We have two girls. We are shown an unexplained and unexplained start, where we see them shooting from a gun. Why? What does it mean "Why do we have a guy who's been staying a few days to greet a guy at a hotel that insists he knows him a few years ago? Does that have purpose? Of course I have more general questions like a couple of nice girls who work like vampires in the countryside in England and have a wine cellar filled with wine from the Carpathians In any case, the scenario is full of such defects (in a literal sense), and then go to bed in the crypt. The end goes with some more juicy scenes, but it is anti-climatic, I said, some effective scenes of the director ... \ t Like they are devo They dressed and recorded in the woods for their prey, the house is also the most impressive set, and both girls are, as I said, very beautiful, and Marianne Morris is especially prominent - in a number of ways. The older film lovers, the silent screenwriter Bessie Love short movie t film's end.
