After the quasi-Gothic, all-fruity music video, the film begins with Cassidy, which sings on the head. In the perfect world, that would be the ultimate loans would turn. We do not live in this world. Famous band members decide to go to a clown to contact her dead essence. When I say a clown, I mean the real clown. He told them that everyone would die over Cassidy's spirit (the spirit possesses Dora, one of the bands). We do not care when all the characters are boring, empty and extremely terribly acting. Written by Adam Hackbarth (incredibly appropriate last name if it ever existed) and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who after the Servant, and the Blood Tower, KNOW that he knows to be crap for life), this film is a constant battle between the inability of the movie and the needs of the viewer to stay awake. There was not enough blood to calm the mountain-riders, nor enough nudity to satisfy the perverts. This movie has absolutely nothing to recommend to anyone. My Rating: F Eie Candi: Amanda Carravai gets Toplesu Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
