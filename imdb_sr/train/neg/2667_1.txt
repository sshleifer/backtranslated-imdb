California is disturbing. I believe there is no reason to apologize to this story. It is not fun or has a social value. Technically speaking, the film is very good, performances are top-notch and first class. The story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest. But in the end, this film is troubled and disgusted by its power. I do not recommend California to anyone.
