I just got back from the movie and I'm totally horrified. This film is the absolute ridicule of all humanity. The theater where I was maybe has 4 more people. This film was recommended to me and I could not believe that this person liked it. I can not believe that every healthy man would like that. There was NO PLOT AT ALL. That was a joke. How can you make a movie about nothing. This film only shows that Hollywood is in such ruins. I can only look at the spiral of the industry of horror movies and giggle. What a tragedy for all film footage, this applies to all new "teenage films". It's all trash. Do not support this kind of stupidity!
