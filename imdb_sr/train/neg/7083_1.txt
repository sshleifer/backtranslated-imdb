My husband has rented this from a video store thinking that this is uncertainty. (He never reads the synopsis). Well, it would be ridiculous that the thing be visible. It's just not. The same thing over and over again, without intrigue, and WHERE did they find the leading man? The leading man, Michael Des Barres, is not very handsome, especially for this role he has given him. Also, sexual harassment at work is something if you want to see the "Disclosure" by Michael Crichton. At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90's. Alekandra Paul, who is usually visible, plays an unpleasant scene here. There are also light effects that are cheaper than your webcam. Do not even waste your time by hiring this. 0/10.
