There is no spoiler here, but I've been a fan since Vaking the Dead started, but the last series, of which only 3 have been horrible so far. Stories do not resemble the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the last jaw series quite funny. As a BBC license, after the show I called BBC's complaints to convey my disappointment. I'm amazed that actors Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did not oppose the story. These actors were with these characters of the 8 seasons, and they can see that it is lost in all directions. It's a good job, it's the latest series or next series that can start with a team that investigates the death of Father Christmas! Paul Bentley, West Iorkshire, England.
