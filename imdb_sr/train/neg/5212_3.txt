For some time I had a movie on my shelf in the Mill Creek collection, and one night I decided to watch it; although he does not expect much. As they began to accumulate, I am surprised to discover that this film was filmed within the company Filmiraga. The filmmakers brought to the world incredible stinkers like "Troll 2", "Ator Invincible" and "Quest for a Powerful Sword," so I had to watch. As the film began, it had the potential to be pretty decent, although it was non-original. Upscale scenes could be improved if they were expanded and more often. But after some time in the film, the pace began to drag and I found myself thinking how to "Okay, somebody better be killed soon" or "Someone better mutates." At the beginning of this drawback, when I had such thoughts, although someone may have been killed or mutated, however, as noted above, the effects were not very good. What worsened things was that transitions on the scene were confusing; For example, the first doctor Houseman would be in the zoo, and then he would have a moment to kill someone, finally wake up in a cold sweat in his bed - he forced the audience to ask "Did he dream he was in the Zoo?" Like the movie pace, these transitions in the scene are getting worse. I could try to say that the character development is dr. Houseman was pretty good, but at the end of the movie, that is, once you 'I've seen what the doctor has changed, I hope you'll laugh - which is really the only reason to look at this movie at least once; this film accidentally runs like a long joke. The costume mind, the thing that Dr. Houseman becomes, can be seen in Joe D'Amato's Quest for a Powerful Sword, which was made the same year. You have to love movies, they always use the same things again!
