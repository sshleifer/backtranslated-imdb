CK was the worst movie I saw this year. Almost every movie I choose to see in the theater is at least fun or has something to say. This film looked like it was directed by a film student for his Intro. on film lessons. His father makes great movies. His sister was good. But brother Roman? NOT! One critic had the courage to compare this film with Godard's Le Merip (contempt). While Coppola, Jr., took the same idea, a film about the film, he tried too hard to make it European, artistic and witty, when it was just a kitsch. The main actor carries the same expression throughout the film, as if he was either in awe or in shock when this film was filmed around him. Schwarzman somehow manages to withdraw the role of the acting director. Depardieu is fine. One scene that has real movie humor is humor, which is surprising, not the B-film scene, but the one that takes place in Italy; mounting images of several different characters in a very small car, riding around picking up and throwing away random people. It was the only thing that reminded me of a movie that I guess was trying to deceive. Or scratch. Or both. A documentary with the main role in the camera and recording of various objects was shot, the ending is marked because of "twisting" or artistic value ... I suppose the funniest thing in this movie was a movie, not the way it intended. No wonder that this film was returned after screening at the festival to reorder or re-record or whatever, which makes me curious as it was before. I can not believe it could have been worse than this. If you want to see a good parody of the movie, watch Austin Povers movies. Any of them. The opening of the third is more fun and more ingenious than the entire film. Lil 'Roma, for the sake of the movie, please go back to directing the music videos of your cousins. Leave Father Daddy's.
