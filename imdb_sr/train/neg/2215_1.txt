This is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex, whom she likes so much, is probably dead, but his dad from a scientist just gave him a spell to turn him into this really sweet guy. Like in Beauti and the Beast. She could probably use the dance scene and maybe some singing candlesticks, but instead there are some pretty quick plants. They make this girl very rude, so she allows herself to eat a shark man instead of scratching her entire film. The scientist is a good father who tries to merge his son with a fish with the woman he was engaged in, even organizes them to have private time for sex, but the woman is really a shallow snob and thinks that shark - the guy is a nasty, strange monster and He does not want to have anything to do with him. She gave up love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was pretty sad that all he had to do was kiss him and return to normal and that he would live happily for the rest of his life, but that's not such a film.
