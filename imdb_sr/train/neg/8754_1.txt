This movie is really terrible. After I saw a commercial for him, I thought she might have her charms ... but she did not. Girls can not act and can not sing. The soundtrack for this movie is full of their songs, and this is not a nice scene, Terrible Story Line, an incredible plot, one of Disney's worst FAR films !. Ally is not a bad actress on the movie "Phil of the Future," so I do not know what happened in Cov Belles. And her sister, AJ, seems to have just passed her "glory" to her sisters, and she does not show any talent what ever it was. At the end of the movie girls finally learn some clich√© morality, but this is too late to save this movie about the wreckage of the train. Terrible
