Phil the Alien is one of those films in which humor is based on the strangeness of everything, not on real blows. At first it was very strange and quite funny, but as the movie progressed, I was no longer jokes or strangeness. It's a low-budget movie (it's never a problem by itself), there were lots of interesting characters, but I ended up losing interest. <br /> <br> I suppose this movie would attract the stoner that is currently taking part. For something similar, but better try "Brother from another planet"
