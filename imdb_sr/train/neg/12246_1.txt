*** SPOJLERI *** *** SPOILERS *** If someone were to review a movie based on the room itself, one might think that you are looking at an average animal-driven horror. The action is next. A group of documentaries move to the island to record a documentary on surfing sharks or surfing the blood. (I live in South Africa, so it's published as "Blood Surf.") However, this seems to have something interesting behind it, which, if explored further, could improve the film somewhat. However, this is not the case because it is part of the film that surfaces with blood is minimal due to the fact that their documentary interrupts quite a large crocodile with salt water. The script is absolutely terrible. A good example is when the crocodile is eaten, which is a common occurrence in this film. The best thing anyone did in a movie was to augment the victim in a scene that was supposed to be touching, but in the end it was funny because the dialogue in this movie was very suspicious. Another thing that really irritates this movie is the fact that they bring characters that are completely superfluous for the film itself. They represent a pile of pirates that can only be seen to add another 10 minutes to a gracious short film. For the acting, it can be said to be central. It would probably be much more impressive that they do not have such a terrible script to work. All in all, no one had a terrible effect on me. It seemed that every single star was a caricature and in that way none of these actors had any influence on me. The Crocodile itself said it was huge, exactly 31 meters. and this sense of size is well represented by the obvious fake crocodile they gave us in the film. The death of the crocodile at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and fictitious that it seems to turn the stomach. With a huge scream of bragging, the hero of the film announces that he has a plan that is falling down the hill and that the crocodile pours on a happy-set spike at the bottom of this hill. All in all, I would say that this film is one that must be seen so that you can believe how badly it could be. What at that time seemed like a good idea, it suffered from a terrible script and a huge feeling of a low budget, which all contributed to creating a really horrible movie.
