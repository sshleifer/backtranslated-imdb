Down to Earth is Lance Barton, a black comedian hit by a truck. He goes to paradise and gets another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Vellington, the white man. So Lance does several things in Charles's body. The film has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a Chris Rock fan. Better is Madagascar, an animated comedy from 2005. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done better things than this. It will only make you smile about 4 times the entire film. And it's not funny-loud funny. You will laugh at yourself and you may laugh, but you will definitely not laugh at the floor.
