The young man sees his mother killing, and his father hangs. Twenty years later, he gathers a bunch of friends to exorcise himself, so he will not turn out as his father. All the characters are in place: a nice couple; "fun" type; solid (but sensitive) hood; smart girl (she wears glasses - so we know); nonsense and two blondes without personality. All this includes a stupid wooden statue that revives (do not ask) and kills people. I knew I was in trouble when, after a great introductory scene, we jumped 20 years later - ALL bad horor films do it! Palmer - why Betsy?) And murders are stupid and / or non-immune. My favorite scene is when two people allegedly have sex and the statue is stealing a guy from the bed to show he is fully dressed! A really bad, stupid, unconscious horror movie. Avoid at all costs.
