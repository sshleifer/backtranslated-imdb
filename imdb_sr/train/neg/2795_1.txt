Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a pistol in her mouth, dropping her head on boyfriend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the lead singer of the "band of demons and deaths" who could not shake the sad feelings of neglecting her boyfriend to her (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve this except to shoot you a bullet in the head). She returns, however, with the soul of Dora (Jill Small), her friend who will replace her on vocals, so that the group can finish the album stopped by Cassidy's early death. But Cassidy settled down with the dark, and the souls are gathering .. she is pervaded by this rage mostly towards Neal, but all members of the band or anyone in the music studio dies when they become victims that they believe is Dora .. and Cassidy returns to back. Bad micro-budget fever movie looks cheap, has an inexperienced actor who should make plans in another type of work, and can boast of cheap scenes of killing that are not effective is one bit.
