One of my best friends brought this movie one night with the words: "Do you want to watch the worst horror movie ever?" I always enjoy a good laugh because of bad horror and I say yes. I was expecting your typical b-slasher cheese, but this was above B. This is Z-slasher, the lowest of the low. With an apparently low budget, extremely bad acting, bad lightning, no complications, really bad so-called 'special effects', clumsy cameras and a terrible sound file, movies like "House of Vak" look like masterpieces by Oscar winners. The only good thing about it is about 15 seconds when one of the characters in Toples - she had some very nice tits. Much of what I said during this film was modeled on 'This is actually BAD', 'This is the worst movie ever' and 'I'm not drunk enough for this.' In conclusion: do not waste your time (or money!).
