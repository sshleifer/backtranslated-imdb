Underneath the surface lies what? Simply horrible movie is what. As other viewers justified commenting, storm sequences are simply meaningless. cuts already peeled wood in the rain? Now it's smart. menace? foreboding? sexual tension? for those who read boring and fictitious, boring and fictitious, boring and overly hurt. I want to thank God for the scene of the show Mia Sara, but in retrospect, I think the filmmakers, seeing how they ended up messing up, realized that they had to put something in order to pay off at all. so it becomes only one more invention. Do yourself a favor and give this a break.
