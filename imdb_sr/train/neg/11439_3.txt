It was obvious that this film was designed to appeal to the audience of Chick Flick, to which I went through and enjoyed the most. However, this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Rian (who became irritating in his name). Her acting was exaggerated and seemed to be exorbitant in relation to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. This film may have been more, because there was an appropriate budget for the environment, actors and a decent story. My wife and I agreed that it was "Muck" in the end, because the film ended in a painful shameful high level! Better luck next time, I hope Miss Graham is holding the types of films she belongs to as from Hell.
