A funny horror movie about the rich man (John Carradine) who dies and leaves all his four children and his servants to split in the same way. One condition - they must spend a week in his property to get the money. And if one of them dies, others get more. Guess what's going on ... I saw a brand new imprint of this movie on the cable. The colors were brilliant and colorful, and the house itself looks great. These are all good things that I can say about it. Let's just mention some of the problems this film has: the killer is blatantly obvious; servants are called Igor and Elga - come on! some of the soundtracks were so bad that I could not understand the dialogue (without a big loss I'm sure); blood was scanty and very poorly done; other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible, and this movie contains some really nasty acting - so bad you just look at the screen in disbelief. Even Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only pretty good acting was the Faith Domergue trophy (which deserved better than this) and John Carradine (who looks sickly old and fragile here). Still I have to admit - the final line in this movie is a gem! Why this is renamed "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me - there's another horror movie from 1978 with that name! Br /> No matter the name, it's a bad movie. Should be avoided at all costs.
