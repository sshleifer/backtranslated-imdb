I usually only comment on the movies I like, thinking about "everyone's taste," but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this film, which seems to be lost in an earthquake, is that these two self-made adults have the perfect right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, marry, and inflict costly suffering on their members. the children. Even if culturally sanctioned drunkenness is permitted, they also have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and to annul what they have initiated. After all, "love" is all that matters, is not it? To hell with everyone else. Whether things work "at the end" or not, it really does not matter; in fact, this is completely irrelevant. The point is that disrespect for others, especially if they are young people, especially if they are in a position of dependency, illuminate and thus strengthen this film. There are many more harmless behaviors that these "parents" could do, who would for a moment strike the army of social workers on their heads.
