I recently seen this film at the film festival. It is the romance of a former alcoholic unemployed man who just left the big depression and a middle-aged woman working in an employment office (INEM). I thought the story was very simple and full of clich√©s, taking the 'social' theme of the film and turning it into a romantic comedy. The main actor has done a good job, definitely looks like an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not convinced as a working-class woman, she looks, works and talks very much like a 'high' woman. I want to say that Ana Belen is playing herself. He does it anyway in all his films. The entire movie theater scene was very bad. The photo is ugly, it is not used in general with a panoramic attitude. The dialogue sounds completely scripted and boring most of the time. The comical situations are typical of Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not ridiculous at all and are poorly resolved. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereirina's previous movies, you might enjoy a little bit of this. Anyway, I got out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The director was at the end of the door. I wonder what the director's feeling is when he sees someone who comes out of one of his films, especially one that is made to please everyone.
