"Unhinged" is a strange little movie, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre. It's hard to really write a satisfactory overview of this movie simply because the film is so unique. The plot is quite exaggerated - three young women on their way to a rock concert enter into a car accident and end up in the castle of an eccentric old woman and her daughter. Very quickly, ladies realize that something is wrong when they hear strange breathing and noise from the attic. In addition, it seems that the mother and daughter have a very, very strange relationship, because they intend to argue intensely in front of their hosts for dinner. The old mother even goes and calls her daughter a whore and a whore and accuses her of having nightmares in the night with the guys to sleep with them. Halfway through the movie, when a girl finally decides to go better to find help, killing begins. As for acting, this film is at the bottom of the tube. None of the three stranded girls can act, especially the "lead" girl. It's almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same, woody tone throughout the film. Mother and daughter are better, but not much. The film is also quite boring in parts and really is very drawn. Murders are terrible, but nothing we have not seen before. However, as mentioned here, the movie really gets points with a brilliantly disturbing and bloody ending. Comes completely from the left field and has the same shock value as the end of the camp classic "Sleepavai Camp." Unfortunately, the rest of the film is boring and suffers from terrible acting and boring, boring pacing. The isolated, creepy look of the house and the dark, vicious illumination give the movie a grainy realism, but it breaks rapidly when one of the characters tries to act. Maybe it would be worth it if you can throw it to the end, but I tell you it's better to just pass it fast 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
