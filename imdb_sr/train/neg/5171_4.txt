Just a horror movie about a beautiful suburban family that deals with the deaths of their parents and "things" in the basement to continue feeding people who are lifting off the street. Of course, there is more to this, but to say more, that would be said. For me it simply did not come together because it is trying to have it in two ways and as a family drama and horror. Movie. The film is trying hard to pass through the edge between the two genres, but it seems to be more disturbing everywhere because it's trying to be shocking, something that it's never been. It does not help that ultimate revelation is less fearful than "oh", like "Oh thats it?". Perhaps I have not watched so many horror movies lately, it might be better or it seemed like I would not compare it with so much. Pass. pass
