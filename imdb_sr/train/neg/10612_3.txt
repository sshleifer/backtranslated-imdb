Wow, what a great premise for the movie: Put it around the movie director with a writing block that decides to go on tango lessons. Hey, and what better idea throws a central role to the movie creator who is interested in tango. I wish I had that sense of genius. Yes, I'm sarcastic. It makes me feel like this type of zero potential for making money for money making. Come on, unless you are fanatic tango fans (I admit they exist by comments) or the stubborn member of the Salli Potter fan club (?), There's nothing in this movie that will make you hurry to see the movie. Even if you enter the tango, a large part of the film is handled with meaningless scenes like a house that is being renovated or a wheelchair man goes on the road. A LESSON OVERVIEW Coming soon a failed scenario from Scotland comes in front of a computer that writes very sarcastic, but very entertaining reviews of the movies he has seen. A shock in shock when Theo Robertson puts a boot in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, cries with sympathy as he receives another letter of refusal from the film company, falls into lust while bathing and rubbing the soap through a well-strained body. A REVIEW OF LEARNING soon in the movie near you if somebody is stupid enough to fund the movie PS Salli Potter is not in a relationship with Harry Potter
