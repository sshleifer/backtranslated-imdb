And I mean ultra light. This film contains four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing more than that. Really not too much to say about this stink, besides that although there are a couple of really good things bits, most of that is not so funny. It does not even function as a romantic at all. How about a romantic comedy? Not your life. Most dialogues are too straightforward to be sophisticated and even less fun. What really is Asham's premise is not at all bad at all. This film could have been much more, especially with all the recent focus on some of the false ways in which films are promoted, along with false quotes from critics. The film reveals the irreplaceable territory of the press - all of which are paid to journalists who almost always write nice reviews. But instead of exploring what was supposed to be a mother joke, she devotes all three minutes to this territory and continues to search for the romantic romance of the film. The same is true with Catherine Zeta-Jones. character - vichni, self centered film star. Zeta-Jones is doing a good job with what she has given, but practically she does not give her anything. It's all homogenized garbage that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about the stars over the years. In the end, it's hard to understand what Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Cristal signed on this failed ship, which sank as a repetition of the "Love Boat". In fact, as the old joke goes, they had to forget the script and record the job. Probably would be a better story. So tell us, filmmakers, what do you have on these stars that caused them to appear in this?
