I was forced to watch a whole series of films as a child and I was told they were REAL! Talk about child abuse. I would be less scared than Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is good only for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children to believe in the same. In addition to the obvious issues of brainwashing and indoctrination, there are also bad behaviors, bad writing and bad "special effects". They are just about horrible, terrible movies. Yes, convincingly (and terrifying) for a child, but I can not imagine adults buying in this shroud. Although, I must say, I would be interested to see them today as an adult. Maybe they have a certain midnight / cult movie that feels towards them.
