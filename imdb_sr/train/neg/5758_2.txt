It could be said that the actors will record a movie, but this clearly shows that the statement is wrong. Most characters in this movie are missing anything that they would hold. They play part of the cardboard that moves in a predictable and uninteresting way. The story is very simple. It can be summarized in a few words, but I will keep in case someone wants to see this movie. I had to accelerate the parts where Jack showed us how to be a obnokious eater. I must say that 70% of this movie turns around cooking, eating or preparing for a meal. To be honest, I would rather not spend my time watching Jack chewing with my mouth open. Personally, I could even have no references to footwear and jokes that appeared in the first half of the film. Outside my personal dementia, the movie really misses something that's worth the time. There were countless scenes and photos that seemed to be dragging on. When something happens, the characters' reactions are vague and dry. Best not to watch this.
