I watched this on the afternoon afternoon because there was nothing else, it would be more fun to chew on my legs and probably less painful. I invite everyone to watch this only to see how a movie can be tense, it was certainly intended. I grabbed on every vain attempt of humor in such a childish, unconnected, poorly executed way that it was incredible. This is a movie that Spicevorld looks like Goodfellas, I think I exaggerate? Give him time and think again. Terrible, extremely terrible. If this was not a joke, then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and shot immediately after being forced to re-watch this movie.
