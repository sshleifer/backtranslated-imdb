Two types of films we love are (1) Western, and (2) movies of 30 or 40 years ago. We should have loved a man called Sledge; ALI ..... ALI ... this picture is unpleasant, boring and stupid from start to finish. Since there is no one (good or bad) in the story to warm up, there is no one to motivate the necessary uncertainty in order for the viewer to be interested. There was no difference between the guys who were trying to steal gold, or any kind of friendship among those who tried to protect it. Sledge has a nice friend, but there is no reason why she is struggling with the whole guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this pig without a bill. The film also suffers from intrusive behavior. and an incredible music score, and from extremely bad writing and directing by Vic Morrow. From the last 30 older movies that were leased from Netflika or Video Vault, this was the bottom, the only real dud in the crowd. .
