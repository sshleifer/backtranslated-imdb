I watched the Canadian video of this film as "The Witch", which somehow broke into New York. The audio was pretty bad, I had to raise it to around 7/8 just to hear it, and the soundtrack often overrides the dialogue. Orson Velles was a mumler, worse than usual, and some of his dialogues and others passed through the echo chamber. A spiritual figure that constantly appears that her voice is distorted. Some indoors would really help! Group of witches or satanists (in the end it is stated that the group was not supposed to represent the right group!) Have a ritual in which they are naked and cause an abortion by sticking the doll. A woman who had an abortion and her husband moved to a city called "Lilith", where he was offered a job at a toy factory. In spite of the fact that one of the AKA's films is obviously a Toy Factory, we never see it, and this is only occasionally mentioned. her questions about what his new boss, Mr. Kato, wanted to know about their religious conviction. He drives aggressively and causes another car to leave the road and explode. After the police arrive, she takes the doll that came out of the car, the other of many hand-made puppets in the movie. It turns out that they are g. They caused her miscarriage, although she did not understand it. They want it because it has an innate talent for non-romance, for which it was not aware. Some of the pictures in the movie have a certain impact, but in general the film does not involve much. The movie seems a bit messy, and this is no doubt mainly due to its re-edit and adding new recordings. The original version, according to the final points, is called Necromanci - Life for Life. DVD magic would allow us to see both versions on one disc, but re-publishing this movie is probably not a priority.
