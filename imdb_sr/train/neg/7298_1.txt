no redemption can be expressed. I'd like to come back. The beautiful head of a person is really laughing really, the lights on the camera when the disease has already made enough havoc on a badly informed letter. I was (spoiler)) happy to see that all the characters are dead or seriously disabled until the end, especially the party poopers who drink the infected juice on the way to the alleged sunset. Eli Roth does not glow for moments of perhaps a dozen, exposing the theory of how good weeds smoke in the woods when others really enjoy the consumption of beer. all in all, I found the majority of that pointless, though not without undue violence and insufficient nudity, happy to be the witness of the death of the actors, in a way, however, wanting that trip never happened (it probably should have been laid instead of watching TBS late). night, uf).
