There's this girl and she runs into the woods, but she ends up in the clinic of this woman and wants an abortion. Her dad is out in the van, and she is so angry about it. The whole episode is taking place at and outside the abortion clinic. I'm not exactly a pro-choice, but I wanted to kill this episode. I laughed when I saw the baby coming out and she walked into the corner. The part where the ultra sound was done was also quite fun. I was really sorry about the poor father in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter, and I could not blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to him at the end or what happened to another father and daughter in the waiting room. I just laughed too much and suggested that I watch "Pick me up" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode, but it was not that big.
