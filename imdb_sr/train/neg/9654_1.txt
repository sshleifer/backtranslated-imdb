The movie is bad. Simply awful. A lot of bad films from Bollivood have no end! They must run out of excuses for making such horrible films (or not). It seems that the problem is mainly with directors. This movie has two good actors who in the past have proven to have the ability to deliver excellent performance ... but they were so badly focused. The poor script did not help either. This movie has a lot of funny moments and very poor editing in the first half. For example: After his first major concert, Ajai Devgan, he meets with Om Puri (from whom he fled 30 years ago and talked to him again) and all Om Puri finds to say is kept his friendship with Salman !!! What a shit. Seriously. Not to mention baaad soundtrack. What happened to Sankar Ehsan Loh? Ajai Devgun is totally wrong to show rock stars. Only savings is a good performance in the second half. Ajai shines until his character shows his dark side. Like Salman as a drug addict. See perhaps only the last half an hour.
