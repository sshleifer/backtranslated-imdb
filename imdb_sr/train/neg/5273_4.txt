*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw a preview for this movie, I thought it would be at least something wonderful story. But, like most superstitions of original movies, I was disappointed. This lucrative family ends up in this "abandoned" city to stop and find this video camera that shows that these people are doing everything they have done and discover that everyone eventually disappears, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never reveals or displays Devil's chasing them. Their voids are more than I can count and do not explain anything that happens as or what. It ends where the family gets into a car accident and gets or rinses the brain or something (which is never explained). The next thing you know is that they hope to find out somehow how it all happened, but it ends up leaving you completely confused.
