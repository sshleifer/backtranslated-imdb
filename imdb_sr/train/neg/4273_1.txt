There is nothing unique either in the TV series or in the movie. It is a preface to a TV show that can not be found everywhere in life and entertainment. Even before David Linches's disgusting style of telling stories later. From the moment, the body of the poor girl who mismanaged was floating on the beach. And get acquainted with some of the most aggressive suspicious immoral features of Twin Peaks. Mindu who diminishes almost pedophilia a disgusting way seems to be filming romantically about the destruction of human life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the film Twin Twink Peak: Fire Come with me. All I looked at was just to make sure I did not miss anything. I'm not. It's simply an obvious sexual fetish that stretches across long series, accompanied by a funny, excessive pornographic film. Keep an agony of tension yourself and watch anything else at all that at least has the ability to tell the story, not to mislead you into some kind of mental pornographic film. I heard many reviews, rants and rave about how big David Linch. Because of his ability to define misery and tragedy and to turn it into a wonderful thing. It is not an art that imitates life, like a sickly knit version of art that does everything to inspire a complete mindless life. Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.
