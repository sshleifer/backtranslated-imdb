No doubt one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women who were brought to looting banks that we kind of sympathized with. It's hard to sympathize with characters who constantly make such stupid decisions. Oh no, the cops are on us, they know who we are, what to do? What!?! Each character is a stereotype and it's easy to say who ends up dead.
