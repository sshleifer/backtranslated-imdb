Doppelganger has its moments, but few are far away. In essence, this is a combination of a British thriller, a story of ghosts and horror. Drew Barrimore plays a young woman who is being persecuted by demons from her past (most of her family is murdered, and she is, at least in one case, the main suspect), or is there really a bad case of multiple personality disorder? George Newberry is her new friend, and most of her actions are centered on him. The New York character is pretty cute, and he and Barrimore are doing a decent job (though not very good). It seems that the central (sometimes) totally horrible scenario and the immersive directing of combinations to sink the rest of the plays into oblivion. Character Leslie Hope is unforgettable, but so irritating that you will want to forget her. The operation breaks into bifurcation in time (one-story arch is a psychological realism, the other is a supernatural horror) a strange climax that has been so poorly designed, acted and photographed that effectively counteracts most of what the film has achieved before. All in all, the movie has the feeling of what one might expect to be the result of the first prize M. Knight Shamalian. undergraduate film time. The acting and script for these two parts are good enough to care for you a little bit - at least until the film is completely popping out. My recommendation - send your duplicate, but avoid the first -Person meeting.
