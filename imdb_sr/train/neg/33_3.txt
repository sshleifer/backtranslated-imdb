This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever produced. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was a couple, even though I liked the original cartoon. There is one scene I remember when a mafia monkey explains to his subjects who have rhetorical questions. That's terrible. Many fans hate a series to include a female turtle, but that did not bother me. So much so that I did not even remember her until I read it recently. All in all, it's incredibly forgetful. The only good thing was a themed song. Guilty is a pleasure, they call him ... Nanny ninja ...
