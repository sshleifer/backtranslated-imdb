As you all know, JIGSAV did not reach Blackbuster because of Full Moon's staff, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells all video chains. He recently released BLEED, which sold Blackbusters at the same time as JIGSAV. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to take JIGSAV, and to double the BLEED number. The result is that JIGSAV looks like a flop, and BLEED looks like a hit. The main problem with this is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever, and as we all know, JIGSAV is, well, gold. I invite you all to go to the BLEED website on the internet and vote for the film that insulted JIGSAV, and all your talents. Likewise, you need to go to the JIGSAV site and give big voices to her (if you have not already). We need to bring Jigsaw to at least 8 or 8.5, and BLEED to about 2 (by putting it on the 100 worst movies on the Internet). Also, try to convince your friends and family to do the same. I hope you are all well, - Matt
