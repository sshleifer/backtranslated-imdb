Oh my God. How can I make movies of such beauty, but it's so terribly bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll does not do this shit. There is not even a sign of a decent story, multilayered character or attraction. It's just a coincidence sequence of a senseless chat with an associate to make a 'movie'. I suppose that only children up to 3 years could enjoy it, since the world is so completely dimensional, and the story is so inconsistent, that everyone would be angry about it. But again, it's too scary for anyone under the age of 6, that there probably is not anyone who should watch this movie at all. Your little daughter can make a better story, and although she probably is not able to draw pictures of this beautiful, her stories are much more valuable to listen to. And please, in the name of the one you believe in, do not expose your children to this work. I'll give him 2 out of 10, and that's exclusively for graphics, because the development of stories and characters are so scary to earn a negative score. ... remember that I warned you.
