An indecently directed, foolish comedy that allegedly lies in "classic" films from the "alien invasion" of the 50s, but it's really no better than them, of course, in a purely technical department (good effects of makeup). And every scourge that is worse than his target is condemned to failure ("Casino Roiale", "Our Flint Man" is worse than almost any James Bond movie). After two hours of listening to the alien voices, you will pray for peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
