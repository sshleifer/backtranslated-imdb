"CIA Codename: Alec" is an absolutely terrible discovery of Luc Besson's classic "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is basically a woman taken over and dressed by the CIA and forced to carry out a secret mission for them. (Almost the same story about the structure of La Femme Nikita) The cast of Lorenz Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in the history of the film. Lamas's "acting" is simply a poor imitation of Steven Segala. Watching Orenthal's act in this movie is a terrific experience. Writing and acting in this movie are so bad that they are sometimes ridiculous. There are so many action movie "conventions" in the movie that it's ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, bad horse tails, etc. , which encourages Steven Sego's theme of this film. The film has a lot of martial arts, and it's pretty well done for American production with a low budget. The foolish action over and over never gets over, and I have to admit that I was mildly entertained. Lorenzo Lamas looked like an action star at the beginning of the nineties, but he certainly is not an action star, so he works soap, not an action blockbuster. My recommendation is to skip "CIA Codename: Alec" and look at "La Femme Nikita".
