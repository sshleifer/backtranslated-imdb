I really wanted to love this movie. He has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, a bloodthirsty zombie, a perfectly disgusting touch of the 80's and that's the directing effort of actor John Saxon, who also plays bad (guessing) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very wooden and there is no moment in the mood / intimidation. It only continues and continues, and then (logically) it must end. More uncertainty and bold visual effects and his fate as a cult classic would be sealed.
