Oh God. Some of the best talents in British television have made this series, so I can only assume they worked under incredible weather pressure, and had to adhere to the first footage of many scenes. There are some scary out there. scenes in this mystery on the hills (mostly when attacking "monsters" and we see it from his point of view), but I am afraid that I have unintentionally amused most of the story! As when a hero reveals a corroded corpse in a golf course: Oh, look, there's a hand ... oh, there is another hand ... hmm, this is a little confusing ... <i> Dugi For many years fans of British cult TV shows have fought to release this series on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said no. Now I think I understand why!
