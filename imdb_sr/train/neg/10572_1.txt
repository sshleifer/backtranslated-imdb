*** PICTURES SPOILERS *** Bold 15-year-old boy loves a very sweet 15-year-old girl and eventually gets sex for the first time. After the act, he lies in bed, and she does not touch her. The next day, he concludes that he does not like a lot of sex and does not want to try it again for at least a few years. This is a seemingly fine opening for teleplai about how a boy reveals his homosexuality. or, perhaps, a medical drama about post-pubescent teenagers with a serious lack of hormones. However, as the action takes place, there is a story about a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by His mother's preaching. At some point, his mother preaches to his associates who are not as understandable as they could be: "Every step in this, my son was incredible ... I was never proud of him ..." The older sister of a young father, who is otherwise cold towards his brother, begins to show pride of his brother, "You were cool this," while giving him a warm, warm hug. 15-year-old father wants to be a father. He wants to be a parent. Why not? We see a "new" baby a few minutes after birth - it seems to be a healthy, happy four-month-old baby. Just like babies born on television in the 1960s and 1970s. When the young father is a parent, he found happiness. He insists he will change the dirty diaper. We see that the 15-year-old father is genuinely happy to keep his baby while the teenager is busy = the mother's mother spins over her shoulder. Push it.
