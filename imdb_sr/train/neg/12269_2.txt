The Japanese sense of pacing, editing and music styles must be different from American taste, but it is certain that this film could have been much more with a little more post-production work. Someone in Hollywood must re-create this movie and I think it would be a big hit. The story is interesting and creepy. There is something about the edges of the city, dense policemen, earthquakes, sanitation and mysterious killings of sea water, which is enough to amaze. However, this story has to make only a little sense and it may be about 40 minutes shorter. I must say that the effect of "sixth sense" was in full force in this film, and that was obvious from the very beginning. At the present time, only those who claim to be tired of Japanese films should try to see this boring movie.
