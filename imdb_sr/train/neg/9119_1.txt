I actually saw this movie in the theater in the original edition. It was painful to see Peter Sellers so embarrassed. The story was incredibly chromatic and difficult to follow, and the end was ridiculous. It was only sad to see how powerful they were. I will not say that I'm a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I fully enjoyed the Pink Panther series and I felt that he gave a strong performance in Battle Beats there. But this film should never have been made. From what I read, he tried to produce this film against the advice of people around him. Good, but it still does not justify the study that actually leaves the movie.
