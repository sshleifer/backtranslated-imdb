It's definitely a bad movie. It's so funny fantasy with lots of bad special effects, lots of quick scenes (aerodrome example), and really awkward time. (Charles Dance) is terrible as a bad guy and he is much better at (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphi) does a non-comical joke, and I heard this was sunk already, a great success !! I will never understand why or how ?! In one television interview, I heard (Eddie Murphi), when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, sorry for that in a comic way !! One of the comments was said (Hey ... it's the 1980s!). Well, no friend of mine. It's a movie nonsense that has made many RAZZIE movies over all these years, whether it's the 80s or 50s! There are 2 reasons why I wrote about this movie. The first is that I will never forget the fascinating long thin legs (Charlotte Levis), especially when she was on the bed before the bad guys attacked her house, wearing only a blue shirt and OH BOI that the camera convinced her bare legs as it should be. But how strange! As I watched it in movies, and again it was not so beautiful? !! In any case, the other reason is that I've found the title of this movie lately on my list of the worst 100 movies ever! Lower score: Poor film, Greeeeeat legs.
