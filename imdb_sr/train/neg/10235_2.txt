The only reason I gave it to him is that filmography is so stylized that it has at least something to comment on today. This film is dark. It's like many other fodder foods from the 21st century. Up is free and simply disgusting. I did not care about any of the characters, but I was worried that some jerk tried to wash this shit: I would complain about the money I spent, but my appointment and wisely I went after 40 minutes and went to the neighboring theater . to watch the adventurous and fun "Live Free or Die Hard", which probably got a much better rating from me just because I endured the ultimate hook of "captivity" for 40 minutes.
