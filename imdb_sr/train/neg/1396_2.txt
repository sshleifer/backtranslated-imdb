This film about secret government experiments of the mind and corrupted use of citizenship by mysterious and disgusting shady figures had the potential to be a really interesting movie. But it did not work for me. I will not elaborate much about the confusing line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment from "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description of it. But it's not working for me. I thought it was slow, which would be fine, but because of the fact that it seemed that it was not going anywhere. The viewer stays in the dark about too many things that could really be tackled with this film - in some films, it can be argued that the filmmakers intended to provoke thoughts and that's why things are blurred. I do not think that's the case here. As for the frequent long recordings of two buildings that other users have often mentioned ... I see that they have a point - give the viewer time to get another drink without failing to miss out on any "action". I suppose many viewers would be satisfied with the possibility of having a few drinks on board to go through this.
