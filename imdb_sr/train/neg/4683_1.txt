As a former submarine, this was one of the worst submarine movies I've ever seen. First, a rebellion on any ship of the US Navy, especially the submarine of the nuclear power plant Trident in an inconceivable sense. These people are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is terrible and very seriously understand everything from the captain to the smallest crew members. I could never see that the crew of any ship shared their alliance between the captain and the executive officer. The executive officer who played Denzel Washington, would be released from his duties and the court military court, and then he was drunk from the Navy. Not surprisingly, the navy refused to send a technical adviser to assist in the making of this film. Finally, if any member of the submarine crew made the noise that was going on this ship, they would be seriously warned. Submarines learn at an early stage in their careers to be as calm as possible to avoid detection. They do not close the door and even speak quietly and carry soft-cushioned soles when they are in progress. I was amazed how loud the team was showing while they were in progress. Loud music would never be tolerated. I know that showing the submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets, but this is above all to the extent that it's ridiculous. I would not recommend this film to anyone.
