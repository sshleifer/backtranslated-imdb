Hello everyone. If you've seen "Singing in the Rain," you remember the scenes of Jenny Kelly dancing in the rain. You also remember the dance number of Donald O'Connor, "Make Them a Laugh". If you see the "Royal Wedding", you will remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. If you've seen "Jailhouse Rock", you will even remember the dance titles that the King himself choreographed. This is what is missing here. In this presentation, there could be some dance numbers. The closest was Chuck McGovern's movie "I Can Do It". the mere fact that you have some talented people on the moving scene does not make a big dance movie. Richard Attenborough is guilty of this failure. He showed the camera on the stage and thought it would be a good thing. Screaming for people at Audition for the production role at Broadway is not fun. Michael Douglas would be equally stupid if he were in Western or comedy. It's OK when it's in Michael Douglas's movie where we see him shouting to someone we would like to yell. It's not working here. The actors were good, except Michael, of course. A good movie could be made even by using the songs that were produced by the stage, but someone should have thought about how to record it. . Tom Villett
