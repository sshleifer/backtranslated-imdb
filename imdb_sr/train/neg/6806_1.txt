In addition to all technical errors .... How about a female steward who is able to kill, by itself, 4 of 7 terrorists (including former marines), 2 of whom without even using a gun . Then perfectly master the plane. We are not talking about Sigournei Veaver or Linda Hamilton; we are talking about a regular, frightened but very well-assembled stewardess. : D A leader in charge of an attack / rescue squad, which has a comprehensive (according to the logic script) plan to extinguish the dream, and everyone from his team flies by plane. Only he decides at the moment to change plans and instead leads an attack on terrorists, guns blazing, not knowing where the terrorists are, or how much, and not securing the position of advantage, so that his entire team is easily deleted. Yes, it's the use of an old spoon. Only later, they decided to use gas for sleep. And it turned out to be useless for all intense purposes. It's bad that this movie was, however, I could not stop watching and wondering, what else? : D I can not but imagine all the great, unemployed writers of the scripts who think for themselves, is not fair. lol! : D
