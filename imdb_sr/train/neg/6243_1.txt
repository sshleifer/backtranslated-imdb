Do not drink cold help. This is a piece of thought disguised as a documentary. And to call it "the truth" is just plain shit. The debate on global warming is far from over and will only be finished when eco-zombs begin to recognize the mountain of evidence against their beloved theory. Only Google's "Global Varming" and "Hoak" or "Junk Science" and you'll find a word of information that kills almost every link in the logic chain at Gore's locations. The reason why it is so important to educate people is a disastrous economic impact that could have measures to prevent global warming. Wake up people. Anyone who has a computer, a little time, and some common sense can find many reasons why this theory is not even near credible. Do not just read articles that support your current opinions, read everything you can find. There is no depth analysis that should be done. There are simply too many alternatives and counter-evidence that theory has even the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so incredible, in fact, that it may be the biggest scam during human existence. It's time for people to speak against this kind of propaganda, and it's time for people to recognize themselves and others that you can be a conservator and recognize the obvious conclusion that the global warming hysteria is a big lie.
