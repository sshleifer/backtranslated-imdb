I just saw her yesterday at the Sao Paulo International Film Festival. Just before leaving, I came here to see how it was rated, and then it was 7.4, pretty good rate ... After 15 minutes I was dying to go out (I never did it), but it was me It's unpleasant because the movie producer was on the screen. In general I did not like it, the dialogues are shallow and do not lead anywhere, the characters are dirty from the dialogue, nothing leads anywhere, and the worst and worst: a lot of Siemens and Organics commercials on the movie. Despite the fact that I already paid to go to the cinema and have fun, I still need to be bombarded with the main character who chat on the Internet and Siemens mobile popping up all the time on her lap-top; or some other figure that is batting or cutting your hair just to show the Organics shampoo on the screen! Everything would be tolerable if the plot, characters, romances, anything was good, but it was bad, really bad! "I do not know how to do sex" in the city. Do not waste time and money.
