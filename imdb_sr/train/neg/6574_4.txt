I got this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons. Once I went to the city of Matevan, West Virginia, and in a small museum there I saw a schedule for the city theater of the citra in May 1954. The movies would change in the theater every day. Since in those parts there would be no television for another decade, it was a big part of the city's entertainment. It seems that "Raid" is made for cities like Matevan in the fifties. Although not quoted for that month, I'm sure it was on Monday or Tuesday night for an audience that was probably not too demanding. The historic attack - brave and incredibly successful - does not seem to have been well researched, so the film is full of Hollywood decorations, including the loose top played by Lee Marvin. Marvin takes the opportunity to deal with Liberty Valance. And it looks like St. The Albans had more Iankee soldiers who were coming and going through the city than Washington DC had. Only in difficult pictures from the Civil War, Rebel uniforms look so intact. When Anne Bancroft's son caught Van Heflin in the uniform before the attack, I expected the boy to think it was Witch Night. And then and Anne Bancroft. While watching the movie, I actually looked at the IMDb to see if there was another Anne Bancroft. The then studio actress does not look anything like her later films, and there is nothing of the presence that will later have in "The Miracle", "God Agni", and of course the "Diplomant". Br /> Worth to see if it is only 1). live in St. Albans and 2). You have a couple of hours to kill the Hollywood fiction of the biggest news about your hometown.
