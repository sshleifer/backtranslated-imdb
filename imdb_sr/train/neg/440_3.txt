** HERE WERE SPOILERS ** Recapitulation: Mia (Helin) returns home from Stockholm to a rural Rattvik to celebrate her 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest child and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petren). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rattvik, and Gunilla has divorced and moved out of the city. Mia is still herself and is focused on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost hostility between sisters and conflicts occur everywhere around, because they conflict with one another and each of them has personal problems that they face with difficulty. As the party continues (and consumes alcohol), more and more secrets are being discovered and more and more conflicts ... watch this film in the same tracks that follow old Swedish comedy / drama for years. There are really no new elements or ideas. This film relies on three basic areas. 1) Uncomfortable humor based solely on characters who make a fool of themselves. 2) Sadness and 3) Anxiety. This move focuses on the last, almost forgetting the first point as the film goes on. No loss, because humor that's not funny here. The performances from the acting team are good, I suppose, although it is lost behind all the pain and it is soon forgotten. I was hoping there would be new ideas and impacts, but there were none. To conclude, there are better ways to spend some time than to look at this. 3/10
