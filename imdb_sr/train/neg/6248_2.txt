Something very strange happens when you talk about global warming: science comes out of the window, and "belief" and "consensus" become the topic of conversation. It's because of the fact that I give the unsuccessful sign of the documentary Al Gore. Instead of promoting intelligent discussions, he held a debate at the level of "belief" and "consensus". Naturally, when trying to sell the world into spending trillion dollars to "stop global warming" you can say that the problem is to tell the scientific truth: we do not know how much the current warming is caused to people. Perhaps none of this, maybe some of that, or maybe did not redistribute the next ice age and we were lucky we did not invade the planet. But the fact remains that we do not know. So we are asked to "believe" in "consensus". It does not matter that any scientist who leaves the "consensus" is rejected. It does not matter what a scientific inquiry is about the withdrawal from consensus. Einstein did not "believe" in the consensus, nor Copernicus or Galileo. So why put so much contempt on those researchers that would improve the field by asking difficult questions? If global warming is so undeniable, it is certain that several people are testing this theory can not be so threatening. What's going on here? It's a movie that I hoped Al Gore would do. Instead, he chose to support the true "believers" of the "consensus". Sure, really.
