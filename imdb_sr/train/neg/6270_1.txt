Somehow a woman working with a scientist puts metal balls into the mouths of people who alter their personality, but in reality turns them into crazy, zombie-like killers. The "guinea pigs" for the experiment were scarce-trained, nubile young women in desperate need for acting hours. This film is terrible, horrible and stunningly bad. The script has little or no logic. You'll really have trouble tracking what's happening. No special effects. The computer screen that supposedly represents enormous scientific advances does not look anything more than the old Atari screen. And worse, there is also a puppet with hair strands (looks like a lonely child at a summer camp) named George, who is a personal servant / trustee Jessica (the leading "actress"). Through the film you will be subjected to the idiotic, sophmoric sayings of this doll. But wait ... you get a lot of soft, nervous, barely naked scenes with girls with some guys from the bar. As long as the most lucrative musical background is played in the background as some kind of spiritual discovery. None of the actors are good. There are only different degrees of badness. The above and "horrific" aspects are especially clumsy recorded. The movie really looks like an adolescent put it together. It's no coincidence that Henri Sala, director by name, but not by trade, did not make another movie. I was bored almost in a coma watching this stupid, stupid, shit! And how does it end? What happened? If you know you let me in secret, because in my life I can not understand. All I know is that I've wasted my time watching this garbage that made my weekend a real nightmare boring!
