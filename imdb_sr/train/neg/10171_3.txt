Comparison with American graffiti is inevitable, so you save money and time by renting this timeless classic. Speaking of timeliness, there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff competed on who could find the most anachronism in the film. I would love this film all from some songs, and some of the clothes was wrong. There were cunning references like "They paved the paradise for parking." The filmmakers hoped to make a smile, but basically they made me shiver. Almost as smart as people who were in the thirties and forties when they wrote the movie. Very few of what the characters said, it was convincing. Combine bad writing and bad acting, this movie just does not work. Although there were two exceptions, Kelly Villiams revives things as a future flower child and, despite what another critic said, Rick Shroeder was pretty good. Showing this dark feature that would be completely heated in his eventual appearance in "N.I.P.D. Blues".
