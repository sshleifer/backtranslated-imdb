this film brings. it's best when an unfortunate teenage girl tries to move away from the baby's backyard and in the background she seems to have never been close to a bicycle in her life while trying not to fall. But this film does not stop there, when less than 5 minutes later delivers a scene with only a hand that breaks through the fence and the cooler draws a beer. Stereotypic grilled baking tattoos, several lines of plots that do not go anywhere, and former actress SeaKuest with a bluetooth mobile phone all make this a perfect Saturday night at home.
