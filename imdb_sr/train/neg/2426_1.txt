Believe me, this is a movie you wanted to avoid, and it comes from a huge fan of Denzel Washington. Frustrating is that 1/3 of EXCELLENT movie. The first part of this film makes an extraordinary job of placing characters and a new relationship between Creasy and the girl he paid to protect. Trailers for this movie mention that she was kidnapped. So, I do not take anything away when I say that the film is degenerating into an almost unpleasant mess after being abducted. Whatever the director was trying to achieve, everything that he succeeded in was to literally refute the audience. Quick, angry and agitated cuts the next half an hour until Creasi finds the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and painful that they just kicked you out of the story. I am sure the director thought that this disturbing way of presenting a story meant a change in Creasy's character and marked that he would follow another film. He was right. The film that followed was a complete and unsatisfactory shit. The result is a depressing ending that destroys even the first forty minutes of the film.
