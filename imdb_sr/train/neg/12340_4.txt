"Transylvania 6-5000" is insignificant, but occasionally funny and charming parody of horror in the mid-'80s, with some very well-known names in the acting team and a handful of real opportunities to laugh in the script. Two of the bosses of the newspaper with colorful tabloids sent out, very against their will, to Transylvania to make a story about the alleged return of the crazy scientist Frankenstein. There are some wonderful little tricks and details in the movie left and right, like a small guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory tubes used to put cream and sugar on a breakfast table. However, a healthy movie is not as successful as it could and should be, with jokes and parody situations that are too long. Production "Roger Corman" Transilvania Twist, which came out four years later, is much more fun and much more recommended. The film specifically parodies classic universal milestones in the early 30's, so it's better to be sure that you saw them if you want to understand all the small jokes and references. There is a fairly original craft that indicates that Frankenstein's character only acts as a crazy evil scientist when he enters his lab. It has also been discovered that he is more than Messiah's father, Damien, who only deals with the state of the exile monsters. Michael Richards, a weird fellow playing Kramer in Seinfeld, plays a psychotic butler that appears and disappears at the most adverse moments. I'm pretty sure that the image of John Turturr in Mr Deeds was inspired by Richards' role.
