What Hopkins thrives with this effort as a writer and director gives us the feeling that we do not know anyone in the movie absolutely. However, there may be a problem in that. His film has many ambitions and his intentions are obviously complex and drawn out of depth, but so impersonal. No signs. We never know who it is, so there is no investment on our part. It can be about a scriptwriter who mixes with his characters. I'm sitting? Maybe. So I do not think Slipstream is ambiguous; I do not think it makes any sense. Hopkins' movie is an experiment. At first glance, it could be said that this is a potential scriptwriter who at the time of his encounter with fate realizes that life has been hit and missed, and / or success is a blind chance because he is thrown into the "current flow" of a collision between points in time, dreams, thoughts and realities. However, it is so tirelessly cerebral that it leaves no room for any indication of emotions, even a small, completely rudimentary limit to enable us to tie in with its characters. and the glittering of the school of climactic work, cameras and editing with a machine gun, has separated me, but thinking about the film I begin to realize that it has much to do with it. There are so many films in the past decade in which the camera's cuts or movements have sound effects as well as other technical doodoes that deteriorate in the atmosphere. I suppose in this case it is justified that his purpose was to compose an impressionistic dream reaction. However, I hardly knew something about Slipstream when I watched it, and I came out the same way. And I do not care, because Hopkins did not make any effort to help us. There are interactive movies, and there are movies that sit in a rocking chair and knitting, unconscious of your presence. Slipstream is the second.
