I can not believe I was actually going through the whole thing. This film has the worst offense of Killjoi. Here's a brief overview of the action: The film starts with Joyo and the other fish sitting on the beach, celebrating over a skinny blonde beach "piece" that looks like he was not at the gym day in his life. Somehow everyone knows it, and every girl in the movie wants it. UH OH! Here comes the competition! Stereotypic "Hot Fish" and her best friends, who are driving an ugly pink car. We soon found out that Joy's mom got a lifetime job in Australia, which means that Joyo will have to move and leave his best friend behind him (oh no, I think I'll cry). A great storm is coming and its pool filled with unpleasant water. Somehow, for no apparent reason, a small fish falls into the pool, and face face to face, yes, you have guessed, MERMAID! This is where the "story" really spills. Basically, they want the siren to fall in love with "pieces". It's pre-flick with the acting so bad, it makes the 80's look like the climax of the Oscars. This movie has all possible cliches ... best friends, "pieces" that everyone wants, "hot" bad girl and her bitchy friends, terrible old man ... what's your name, there is. I took one for many people looking at this. Think about my watch and 40 minutes for the sacrifice for you. Please do not watch this movie. Do not do it so I suffered in vain.
