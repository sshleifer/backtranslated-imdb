VOV! I just got this movie from one of my friends, who bought him for 1.98 in Valmart, and felt he was caught! It's more than boring, most of the scenes are being shot in front of the green screen, the performance is a little improvised, almost as if they do not have a script. Martians are CGI, who seem to have been made by a newcomer, or a film produced by Fan. I can not say how much this DVD is really bad! Example: In one of the scenes, the Martians torture a local prisoner. She goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a CGI copy of that woman. The change is totally noticeable, and when killed, you can see that it is a computer figure, which looks like something in the game in 1990! If it is possible, avoid this movie plague! You can download two trailers from their site, and see how really horrible it is!
