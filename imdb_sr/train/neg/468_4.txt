Before I comment on this movie I just watched on YouTube, I must admit that the reason I checked this was to look at something I first saw on TV advertisements in the 1980s: décolleté Barbara Bach. And since the film got a rating of R, I expected to see her goal. Unfortunately, there are no dice for her or for another beautiful actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin who should be a teenager, but she actually had 20 when she did this. She looked in her bra and panties, and later in her belly dancers' clothes, it was as exciting as Mrs. Bach. They provide some of the scattered laughter that this film provides. In fact, I do not blame Ron Leibman for his name being removed from the loan because his role as a lizard is rather embarrassing, although I like the "seduction scenario" he did with Miss Nelkin. This is also the debut of Ralf Macchia, who is lonely among unmanaged schools. The rest are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and Mrs. Bach, a Arab who loves motor oil, and the son of a politician who loves his girlfriend Candi (Nelkin's character) so much that she risks to sneeze in the middle of the night sees her in the girls' academy. Among the supporting actors, Tom Poston plays a humorous character named Sisson, who was partly amusing. With the scripts by Tom Patchett and Jai Tarses and directed by Robert Dovey (whose son Robert Dovei Jr is at an early stage on the football scene), Up the Academi is uneven with a politically incorrect humor, but if you're not really offended by skatological and sexual content, this is actually a rather harmless comedy by Mad Magazine and his trademark - Alfred E. Nevman - should not be ashamed even though they once had their name and character removed from the picture. .PS Another of the "misfits" was Harri Teinovitz, who was born in my hometown Chicago, Ill. He played Rodney Ververgaert. He also says one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come in."
