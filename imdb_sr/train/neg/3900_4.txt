As someone who read the book, I can say that this is significantly less than the big American version in which Gwyneth Paltrow plays. There are various reasons for this. First, Emma is too embarrassing. Yes, she has flaws, and she is not the easiest person she likes - but the viewer should not begin to despise her. Second, Mr. Knightley is wrong. His thoughts and melancholy in this version are better suited to the adaptation of Bronte or Gaskell than to Austen, and reject the mood of the whole event. Thirdly, Samantha Morton is a far-reaching actress who should be included in the role of Harriet; And why was she so sick? Harriet should be blond and blooming - she does not seem to be spending it in the next scene. Fourth, the structure is crushed, and the scene is cut. In the end, when Emma decides to love g. Fifth, what exactly happened with Ms. Elton's emphasis? She passed from a sound like an American actress trying to push her accent at the beginning, all the way across America, and then eventually to English. Finally, this got out in the end. The book and the big movie version end with the wedding of Emma and Mr. Knightley. This version pulls confusingly after the announcement of the wedding, and does not actually show us the ceremony.
