Perhaps it's duplication, or perhaps the endless scene of people who cry, mourn or otherwise continue, but I've found Europe '51 as one of the worst (and therefore boring) movies I've ever seen. The film starts promising if it's known, since Mom Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with his spoiled derby son (Sandro Franchina). While Mom and Dad (gentleman Alekander Knock) entertain their guests for dinner, a young man tries to kill himself, running a series of events that change his life and find Bergman spending his time showering compassion for the poor and needy. Inspired by the editor of communist newspapers Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon spends more time with the oppressed than her husband, who soon imprisoned her in a madness for her troubles. Bergman plays the role of a saint on the handle, reflecting his 1948 role as Jane of Ork, and Rossellini's fantastic work of lighting and shooting in the best way. Unfortunately, the script pulsates with its point, while Andrea and Mom have declared Marxist and Christian ranks in the order. After the last scene tired of tears, I had more than I filled these fatigue characters. A real step towards Rossellini when he moved away from neo-realism and still accepted the mythical and mystical themes of the Flowers of Saint Francis from the 1950s.
