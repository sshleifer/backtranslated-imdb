Terrible! Absolutely horrible! No complication, no sense, no end. It looks like the director turned on the camera, and then the whole team went to lunch. Every day. I'm trying to give this video, but nobody will take it. I give him 2 instead of 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I'm gonna have to say a thumb on this one. <br /> <br />
