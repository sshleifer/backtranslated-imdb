Absolutely funny movie. I live in London and the plot is so poorly investigated that it's ridiculous. No one could be terrorized in London's underworld. In a short time, it was not in the service of every evening that teams of maintenance workers there checked the tracks and made repairs, etc. Or that it's even possible to lock in and have no access to the mobile phone at this time of the day ... Worst thing that can happen if someone is found there after the last train to be able to get the graffiti on them. Although this was under control because of the huge number of security cameras on the network, another thorn into the side of the story. (Remember in London as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) If it's set up in a city that I'm not familiar with, I might be able to enjoy ignorance, but that's not a high quality movie, so I could not make it stop my disbelief and I try to enjoy the banal little story that it is. if there is such a rating! Probably the most devastating film I ever thought I'd love.
