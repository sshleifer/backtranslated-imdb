This film is a copy of Warren Beatti's 1978 film, Heaven Can Vait, but is written for Rocco's stand-up comic style. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) was shot before his life was completed and he was working with God's representative, Mr. King, to go back to earth as someone else. As in Beattie's film; chose Charles Vellington, a rich white man, all because he likes Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who appeared in Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea of ​​turning the old white multi-millionaire into a permanent black comedian trying to please the Sontee simply does not work. Also, the intercuts that were used to show Rock as Wellington, and then as a real 'white' Wellington, broke down poorly. The improvements could have been made on the original Beattie complication - which in itself was not masterfully depicting the idea of ​​life after death - but certainly they were not found in "Dovn to Earth".
