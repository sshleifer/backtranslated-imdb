The Mulva was put in the footsteps of Teen Apea. When she wakes up, she's considerably warmer (parts played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel), and for revenge on those who made her mistake. As the subtitle and hi-art mean this is really a take-off on "Kill Bill" movies, but this is a Chris Seaver movie, it's a wild incompetent satire (and I'm using that last term extremely loosely) to say this is better than the first but the truth is that I was so incredibly drunk from my ass when I saw the previous movie that I can not even compare at this time. But I had to enjoy it from when I bought a sequel (I see when I'm drunk, because of the lack of better word, complete and total film exhaustion). Bonejack is more entertaining. Well, at least for more than an hour, it's very fast for what's worth.
