I have not seen anyone in this film yet, and I think I'm the first. It was terrible. Actually, I did not see the end. It was like looking at a boring soap or really good (all the soaps are shit). The actors were poor and the story was bad. The person who rated 10/10 has no idea what it is about. The scenario was terrible. People were in an angry conversation that included threats and you expect a good guy to say something really good and beat him, but no. He says: "If you do it ... I will hurt you" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, be careful. Please do not watch this movie because ... It's CRAP !!! Summary: Bad acting, bad fighting, bad scenario. Do not Look! Of course, this is in my opinion.
