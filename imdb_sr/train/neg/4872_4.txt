A collection of production lines from frog jokes that pretend that 'Babe' has never been made; the writers clearly hoped that the trick of watching the animals would be enough to sustain the film. It's not. Eddie Murphy is again sold as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift to understand the constant and foolish chatter of guinea pigs, tigers, rats, dogs and pigeons. The voice is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Cavern, Rennie Santoni, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Reubens, Brian Doile-Murrai), but the scenario is so unimaginable, charming and depressingly unfortunate that the whole thing is bin chute pretty fast.
