this movie is terrible. The characters are completely incredible and wildly inconsistent. The action is terrible and some of the classroom scenes are deserved and unpleasant to watch. In fact, the quality of the scenarios and characterization suggest that this film was written by a high school student, only the complete lack of credibility of the school environment suggests that the authors probably never went to high school. Actually, in most cases, the performance was poor, although there was a lot of bad scenarios and complications, I'm not sure that any actor could make this movie visible. He said that the sound of the track was fine, and the cinema was pleasant in some places (although the editing was bad).
