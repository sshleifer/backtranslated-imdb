I'm sure that deeply in the jackings of Jack Blacks, the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious, but he is not. You can say that Jack has a whale of some time playing a humorous, slim Mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler, but this movie is a total skip in every department. I just sat through most of the movie thinking "Did This Should Make It Funny" and "This Is A Tip From Tenacious D?". It's true that this film NISTA does not offer. AT ALL! It's a bad script with shitty characters and really acting and directing. You will watch endless moments in which you think something funny will happen, but that does not mean it. I was bored dumb for about 10 minutes, but I would definitely pick it up. It's not. 90 minutes later, I barely managed to dissuade aneurysm that was so painful. It's like, you remember the years when you saw something with your fauna in it, even some of your really early popes before they became famous, and it would be really embarrassing to you that it was said that the actor is actually in such a load. Yes that is correct. I enjoyed some of Black Jack's early films like Shallow Hall, and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny, but come to man. If you do it to us again, Jack, I need to come in there and I'll hammer your knees or something. At least give a serious conversation. I know it's a clich√©, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for many reasons.
