First of all, the reason I gave this film two stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic play as Lieutenant Columbo. Only he can get 10 stars for an attempt to save this altogether worthless attempt to shoot a movie. In the beginning, I was scared to read the comments of one poster that Andrew Stevens gave in this film "the performance of his career." For me, this was the ultimate performance of Stevens who absolutely ruined this film, so I was ready to throw all sorts of insult on the person who made the comment. Then I thought, what else does Stevens have? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo film was made, it is obvious that every of the 33 projects Stevens has since been the ultimate crap, so it's doubtful that anyone even saw the rest of his career. <If you like Columbo, take a look at each of the 69 titles before watching this. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for the last.
