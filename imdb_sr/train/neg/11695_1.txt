Calling the movie "Thinner" is bad as to call round Earth or Pauli Shore not talented. There is no news, but the way they get this way is what people want to know. As for this film ... The book was good, even if it was a small derivation of other stories from "Be Wary of What You Want" genre. Burke plays a lawyer with excessive weight who kills his daughter's gypsy and curses her father (Constantine from the television "Room 222") a few pounds a day. As I said, it starts well, but why involve a mobster (Mantegna)? Why shoot so many automatic weapons? Why turn it into something so highly dependent on FKS? I thought it would be much more effective if I focused more on the subtle consequences of the madness of losing weight, illness, death, knowledge of Roma, and so on. But no, it will not be. Remember, this is Stephen King we're talking about. And end ... almost the same as the book, but a bit loud. In fact, the whole movie speaks too much, feeling that it has to explain every plot. It was not that I was expecting a Dead Zone, but I could without the other "Five Sematars", thank you in any case. One star at least tried to make half the work. However, the rest of the film remains to be ... tell me with it ... "Thinner".
