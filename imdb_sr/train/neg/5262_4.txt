We had to go to the meeting, so we turned on the DVR to shoot the end. After finishing it, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?" He shook his head. I said, "That's how you made me look at the end of this movie and I have no idea what just happened." He did not "make me", but you know. The film body was pretty good. There was a lot of uncertainty. That's what you were asking. Then the end came. The ending was ... and it's just over. You did not give up what happened or why. Until the moment I thought something, something could be explained, but it never was. I came here expecting someone to understand this, and I simply did not pay attention. Nope. Here four years later, and I'm unknown as Tomer was. I still have no idea what's going on. I'm just glad I did not spend $ 1 to buy it because I'd be crazy. OHHHHH! I understand! The end of the movie is what's gone! ROFL
