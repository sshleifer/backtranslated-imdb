I was glad to watch Dreamgirls for a long time ... with all of her comments, nominations and media attention. And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! Then she really showed a black music scene. However, as the film was taking, I and my whole family were bored. Singing just came one by one. I mean seriously, just another music number and he would even break with RENT. Moreover, I noticed that in any character there was no character development; I just did not care what happened to them! Even when the character Eddie Murphy died of a drug overdose, I knew that I should have been sad, but I just could not feel the emotions for that character. The faces were given a thin background on singing in childhood and the like, but there were not enough people out there to attract me. which goes with the lack of character development. This film reminded me of a copy of cats based on Rey, Chicago and Renta (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). All in all, I think this film best suits someone who does not care about the overall story, but would enjoy two hours of fun and entertaining singing performances.
