Oh, God, what a horrible, horrible movie. I should have commented on the situation in society, this is only a reflection of the worst of the worst in real TV. Interstitutions led by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most resistant part, written in a tone that may have been thought to be reflexive and discerning. Instead, these moments are disturbing the mind while talking to a dialogue camera someone wrote with love for an offensive, lenient speech that pushes the "meaning" of the film through the throat of the observer. points for future filmmakers: Long duration and quiet scenes are not equal to art. Neither extreme angles or logic stretch to the absurd. If someone is interested in watching this movie, do not. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
