Drop your back or you will be in great trouble with MI BOIFRIEND'S BACK! Only a happy ending can flourish your innocence full of darkness and ruin at the moment you look at this. It can be said that the whole film decays, the sarcastic approach and the honor of zombies show that it's nonsense to the maximum. We often get the name "Johnny", and this "Johnny" has no place to go. There is no specific reason why our "dead body" comes out of his grave just to survive the prom evening, so the film is completely useless. Without a sense of sadness, his mother is convinced that he is telling the doctor that he is dead. Johnny then separates Eddie's hand. The viewer is asked a difficult question: Why should a movie be a ball? There is an answer. Any resemblance to all people who live or are dead is completely coincidental. "Living" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing to do with the movie. Show this to your girlfriend and she will skip the matura, turning your life into an abandoned ruin. Blah !!!
