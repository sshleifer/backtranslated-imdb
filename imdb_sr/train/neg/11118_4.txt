This was a popular movie, probably because of the humor in it, the fast moving storyline, the character who lost all the voices, etc. Interestingly, you probably could not make a movie with this title if you replaced someone but "white" like everything else would be considered racist by the PC police. However, Voody Harrleson as a white man who turns out to be good, if not better than any black basketball player, is as interesting as his main colleague Veslei Snipes. Snipes had many funny lines, giving a lot of humor. The bad part of the film - which does not hinder many people - is the ultimate profanity in this and the slimness of all the characters. This includes Voodie's girlfriend Rosie Perez. There are not really clean people in this movie. For this reason, I can not sincerely recommend a movie, at least not to friends or those who are offended by unclean curses
