Every year, I watch hundreds of movies, including many low-budget amateur straight films on DVDs that nobody would want to see in real life. I've seen thousands of movies in my time, many great, very forgetful. Zombie Nation, which I will forever remember as one of the hopelessly funny 'horror' movies I've ever seen? In fact, I have not recovered from watching experience yet. Day after, it seems like some kind of weird dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why does the police work from the warehouse? Did Voodoo Priests really recommend that 'zombies' eat a cheeseburger? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? I would not recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a "good" movie, nor would I recommend it as "so bad its good". However, if you are entertained by the possibility of looking at the probably most irreproachable film that has ever been endless? this is for you. Now, whenever someone asks me which is the worst movie I've ever seen, I'll tell Zombie Nation. Seriously? I think it's a bigger crime to make a boring movie than bad, and Ulli Lomel deserves the merit of producing a movie that actually fascinates you with your inability. He's really Ed Vood Jr. from the digital age, and I can not wait to see if he makes another movie totally funny like this one.
