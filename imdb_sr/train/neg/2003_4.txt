For all your visual pleasures, how much a renaissance would be better in live action. The animation is fantastic in a wide picture, yes, but the characters are cool and hollow, similar to the story and style of this movie. With real actors, maybe the film world would not feel so lifeless. There are many things to admire here, but in the end I discovered that I can only admire. I have not enjoyed the movie so much, and it clarifies something that I have not seen before: that visual elements can be a decisive positive aspect of the film, but without good stories and powerful characters, it can all be in vain. I will not go so far as to say that this film does not come to nothing, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I love Dark sci-fi thriller. Blade Runner and Dark Citi are two films that I thought were great. But Blade Runner had his tragic bad guy, and Dark Citi had his own story that made him think. The Renaissance has a shadow and a light, but a little else. I wish this film was more of a kind to me, but the bad story and empty characters stood in the way. Renaissance was a historical and artistic burst of color and life. How, then, is it ironic that one of the darkest and most lifeless films I've seen this year has got its title from the Renaissance.
