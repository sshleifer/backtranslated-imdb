Tattooed Stranger Edward Montagnea should play as a criminal criminal thriller with a small movie nicer mixed in taste. Instead, it's a bad acting, reckless look at low-budget and uninspired film work. The plot is absurd, and the performance is very stiff and amateur. John Miles, who had a fairly sluggish resume in industry, is scared and crowded, and everyone else behaves with the same grief as the characters in a movie filmed by the government on driver safety. The film envisions performances such as "Leave it alone" and "Father knows best" in his unnaturally healthy look at New York in 1950. Why, the viewer does not even see anyone turn on a cigarette until a cute woman half-way through the film is interviewed. The only thing that a movie has about it (in addition to short duration) is the excellent location of the shots coordinated by Villain Steiner. The low budget of the film works in favor of the cameraman, because the viewer is treated well-framed images of the interior of New York and spacious exteriors. If you do not want to enjoy the movie for selecting the settings and the angle of the camera, I suggest you practically watch any other movie.
