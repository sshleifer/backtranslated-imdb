This is probably the worst excuse for television shows, because, oh, I do not know, WHAT IS NOW? Nothing has ever happened to this funny "series." Although they were mostly shot by Britney and Kevin, you do not get any good details in their private lives. They mostly make nonsense, humorous stories and act like white garbage. Look, I love Britney's music just like the next grandmother, but this show is just a full fill for a nation that's so dependent on Britney to watch her fingernails look on her nails (yes, that could be the real episode). Thank God that these two broke up, because they were together sick. This show is TOXIC!
