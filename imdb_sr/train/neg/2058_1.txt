I can find very little to say about this movie. I'm sure the idea and the script looked good on paper, but filmography and acting I'm not afraid of are the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I doubt that this is high in their CV filmography. Michael Caine appeared sometimes as a wooden in his role as a doctor and at no point did I believe in his character. The plot was incredible, especially when it comes to the son of the victim. Some of the scenes were very similar to other films, that I sometimes wondered if it was actually a burst of thriller. Lighting was sometimes dark, and it contributed to the feeling of watching a low-budget movie with some big-known stars, wondering why I was trying to watch it at all.
