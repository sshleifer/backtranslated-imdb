I watched an episode. Yes, I sat down through the whole miserable experience, and I must say, this comedy mark is one of the worst you will get. Imagine Peter Griffin, the glory of the family. Imagine that Peter Griffin is a woman (though slender and minuscule glasses), except that he is missing something that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know he's an idiot. Sarah does not have a true character, nor an actor's ability to extract her character. Perhaps it is itself a banal, formulaic joke that pulls her comedy even lower than her character. Perhaps this is a lack of convincing foils. Her insensitive, intolerable personality can appeal to insensitive, intolerant people, unlike the massive attraction that does not feel the impersonal, intolerable character of Steven Kolber. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an unpleasant, meaningless character. She misses something that is necessary for the genre of satire, let alone the whole world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman does not have, is noticeable. And when you do not believe it and identify with it, it's no longer ridiculous.
