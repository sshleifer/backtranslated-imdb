I was aware of Rohmer's admiration for the late work of those he considered to be great sine-men, and that normal viewers generally considered artistic failure (such as the last films of Renoir or Chaplin, yes, "Politician of auteur" also has his dark side). But with "Les amours d'Astree et de Celadon", it's as if Rohmer wanted, for what he may have been the last film, to overexpose this tradition of the great directors who made the last senile film, adapting Urfe's "L" astree, "with funny aesthetic codes, which just look like a parody of Rosselini's latest films (the ones he made for TV from Descartes or Marx's life). In his version of" Perceval ", Rohmer refused a film of true landscapes to allow the re-transcription of what may have been medium the classic classical representation of things. The director obviously changed his mind about the XIV century, and acted in films, dressed as 1600 peasants who recite their ancient text surrounded by modern trees and landscapes, but all this looks even more funny than Luchini and his false trees It's not that the story itself is stupid, but the way Rohmer interferes with naturalism with skills seems so childish and amateur that he quickly becomes inexcusably funny (and I'm not even talking about the irritating excuse of actors, boring and sad attempts and the humorist of Rodolphe Pauli, the funny soft-erotic tone, the bad musical tentative, or the strange fascination for the travesty!). Radical aesthetics of the film eventually makes it look like a joke, which mixes a soft-erotic film made for TV with theological scholastic discussions (sic!). At the beginning of the film, Rohmer teaches us that the original French region of the story is now dismembered by modernity, and that's why he had to shoot "L'Astree" in other parts of the country. However, I'm sure the movie would look more modern and interesting, that Rohmer still recorded the same story in a modern area with the same narrative codes and artistic decisions. This movie may be of interest to several historians, but most of the cinephiles can laugh at this last and sad Rohmer's film.
