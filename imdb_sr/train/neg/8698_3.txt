All right, I remember seeing the first, and the boy was sucking. After watching it, I just laughed and said to myself: "Oh, boy, another B-movie of a low budget. Then, about half a year later, the second part came in. That was even more. But I'm just he laughed again and said: "There's no way I can ever see part 3 of this." Then, about half a year later, the third part came out. I was stupid enough to rent him and the boy, I just broke after I watched him. I did not realize how many movies can come in these days. Save $ 7.50 and do not rent a whole lot. Believe me, every penny is worth it.
