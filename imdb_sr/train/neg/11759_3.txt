For those who want to continue the fine South African mini-series of the '80s, this is not it. Nor is it a historical drama. Instead, it's a ghastly little fantasy that has nothing to do with the historical Shak, but only uses his name to give a certain seal to Sinkler's idiotic story of an African superhero, a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela. On the other hand, there are several moments for laughing, when Shaka breaks the cross to which he is bound and throws out some serious slaves. You know, as Jesus would have done, he was not such a humble man. True, I've seen only a version of 98 minutes, but I can not imagine that it's twice as much of this shit. it would be better. And what is the name Mungo?!
