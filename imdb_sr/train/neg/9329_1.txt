One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My only thought was, "How can I get my money from Hollivood Video". This is not worth four dollars or any dollar. I think it was an attempt to break the Mexican, or Vin Diesel movies, but that did not work out. Something better with your time. The story was ridiculous. We called lines in front of actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican emphasis of the leading ladies was offensive, exaggerated, burning from a cartoon film. Skip it.
