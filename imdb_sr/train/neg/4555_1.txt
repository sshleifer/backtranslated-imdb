This movie fails to capture any mystery and intrigue that the book offers. The main point of the book, the insights, hardly touched, leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is making such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives. Character development is not at all good at all. No background or personal development leaves the audience to really care about what is happening to them, so the action lines break down. leaving any sense of satisfaction for what the whole quest was. This is one of the worst adaptations of the book I've ever seen. It's a terrible and waste of time. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you have read the book, skip the movie and read it again. It's almost like the purpose of filming the film was to discredit the book, that's how it's done and funny. It's also a pity because it could have been good to capitalize on the peak of your success and that you could probably get a good scriptwriter and some good actors. Please do not waste your time, READ THE BOOK !!!
