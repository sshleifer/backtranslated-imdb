In this extremely low budget (I saw home-made movies with a better production value) Australian final rip "Burning" and "Fridai the 13th", the band plans to make a musical spot while on board. They were persecuted by a serial killer that was upset many years ago. This film was even declared the "worst Australian film ever made" in its DVD promotional material. This is the only point of sale! Fully and completely garbage in every significant way. Perhaps a couple of smilies are there for the bad movie lovers, but it still made me burn out retina.
