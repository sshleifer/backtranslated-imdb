As a Turkish man now living in Sweden, I must admit that I often watch Scandinavian films. Most of all, if I never understand them. I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched a movie called "Polish Wedding" along with my friend from Poland and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched. Unfortunately, I made a mistake that the film "House of Angels" is still worse. None of the actors can play, absolutely not so female star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so stupid that nobody can believe it. I think the whole thing is a mess from the beginning. a lot of bad acting except Selldal and Voltter. Ahmed Sellam
