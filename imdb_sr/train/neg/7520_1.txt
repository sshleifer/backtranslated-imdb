This film proves that you can not judge the film by doing great works on the DVD cover. It also shows you need to learn more about the movie before you buy it (or get it for someone on Christmas Day). The beginning of this movie looks promising. Well, until you get to know the characters. Bundeva Jack (the old guy on the street) brings the college co-edited a book full of witty spells that he leaves in his annual house with haunted (where the film takes place). After that there are some drinks, fighting and pornography of a soft core. Then the action of the film finally takes place after more than an hour. Overall, Hallow's End was predictable, insensitive and reminiscent of soft pornography. This film is probably best seen with a group of friends who do not have anything to do, because it's a good dashboard. And for viewers who are watching for the first time, it's really fun to anticipate the order of people who are dying.
