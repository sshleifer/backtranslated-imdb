The "sordid army" of the saga, which half-heartedly tries to be both surreal (foreign subtitles) and vulgar (inflammation), but only ends up as a mixture of different types of humor, has followed them very successfully. Barbara Bach, Bond Girl from "The Spi Vho Loved Me", has only two or three short scenes. What a loss! (* 1/2)
