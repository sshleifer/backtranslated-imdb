Rich Widow Anthony Steffen (like Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover and the British Lord. He brings a sexy red-haired woman to his castle, where he screams and kills them. Black-booted stripper Erika Blanc (as Susie) goes out, temporarily. Mr Steffen is chasing her husband, Evelyn, who died in childbirth. As a therapy, he again decides to marry, having met the pretty blonde Marina Malfatti (like Gladis). By the end of the film, they will have to dig a few more graves. "Evelin's night came out of the grave" is a great title, at least. ** La notte che Evelin usci dalla tomba (1971)
