I do not see what everyone loved in this movie. The setting was too long and the story, and when done, the main character remained flat and opaque as in the first scene. After the film finally got Cusack in the hotel room of the same name, I had to ask, okay, what will happen here for the next hour or so they keep me together. Answer: Not much, only John Kuzak has a long, exhausted, mental breakdown. Perhaps if the Cusack figure had more depth. . perhaps if his fury was a more fundamental refinement of his everyday life. . . Maybe if the movie or better developed its half-sized topics about loss and faith or did not touch them at all. . . Perhaps if the film made the choice to be either a psychological horror or horror of excitement and that it fully accepted one of these styles. . . And dunno. All I know is that I watched this movie with two more horror fans and none of us liked it. such a dumb guard of the crypt in the air channel, on all three computers does not take more than five minutes of screen, this film was boring. By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from shine and uses them here for a much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now being reduced to stealing ideas from himself?
