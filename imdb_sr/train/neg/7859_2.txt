My God. This film was terrible. I can not complain too much about it. I went to see him just to get out. It was enough, somehow. It is strange that the most distasteful part of the film was at the very beginning, when a woman is extremely lively forced to give birth to a terribly mutated baby. I also think it's ridiculous that the most reputable actor in the movie was a Hispanic soldier who was an auxiliary actor in the next Friday. Everyone in the movie did a terrible acting thing. It was the worst thing I ever paid to see. I also expected it to be much more terrible than the first one. It was not. I expected it to be even more terrible, since the continuation and continuation of horror films are usually much less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be even more terrible, as violence and violence usually sell horror films these days (Grudge 2, Sav 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but it was actually not as creepy as the first, there was another disappointment . The mutants in the first were disturbing, but the directors made so much effort to be creepy that they were absolutely funny. The whole concept of showing a shot of a female soldier's son on her camera with a camera saying, "I love you, Mom" ​​Four times. It was stupid to show this in the first place because they were just trying to feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the other soldiers, and it was even dumber to continue trying to show us even STRONGER SHOW to show it to GORE. three more times for no reason. This movie was a joke.
