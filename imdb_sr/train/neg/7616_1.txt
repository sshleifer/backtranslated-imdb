The good news is that a film was made, which is based on the assumed Aztec myth and contains an unusual Aztec-American (such a word exists). The bad news is that he is dead at birth. If Ed Vood stepped out of retirement and trained George Romero through his classic "Night of Living Dead", that's what we could think of. with. "The Diablo Legend" is obviously the food for any future resurrection "Misteri Science Theater 3000!" I do not think it can be called "B" movie. The production values ​​are so incredible that I have the feeling that I am watching either a long skit from a variety or an 8-mm film made by a group of school children. SOME SPOILERS The basic line of action sounded interesting enough to attract me into renting. A Californian sheriff finds a box containing a demon from the Aztec and is accidentally released in a community that does not doubt. His daughters, one hot and one ugly, team with a gringo FBI man and priest, to try to re-demon the cage. In the meantime, every zombie scene you've ever seen in previous films about the undead is being re-implemented - bad. These zombies walk more like the Nutti army's army than the undead! The alleged infrared scenes from a demonic viewpoint are nothing special? and he / she / she / she / she / she / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / ona / she / she / ona / ona / ona / on / ona / on / ona / on / a back up a lot (much more than turning around the movement forward). And the scene in which the priest takes a demon from a cave in a fast movement is ridiculous! Really, it seems to have been done for a comic effect - although I know it's not! I was constantly expecting that Benni Hill's music theme will begin to play and that the entire gang of zombies will begin to persecute the priests around the beach! Of course, the voice of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams, who calls the FBI agent becomes quite comical. So again, so is most of this cheese! Robert Napton, director and script writer, should win something for this effort! (In order for you to experience blackballing, such as 'Hollivood 10?') This, I see now, has a score of 1.5 on a scale of 10. I'm afraid this will be a little generous! Is there anything good in this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty hot as the younger daughter of a dead sheriff. This is probably the reason why her older sister (Calvi Pabon) really ran away from home! Fred Estrado is pretty decent as an FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, was the same Mario Soto who set up for Cincinnati Reds? If so, it should have kept baseball. In fact, they could not worsen the situation that they went with the theme of baseball and called it "Demons in the Field!" Cinema class, I will apologize. It could be good enough for B or even B + as long as the gang got a camera in a college campus in one piece! "The Blair Vitch Project" proved that a cold, camp movie could be made on a small perimeter. "The Diablo Legend," however, did not seem to have made the smallest number of points. It was low-budget, low-talented, low-all. The final scene itself - and I mean the last 10 seconds of the film - is ONLY a mildly creative or interesting moment. I paid $ 3.45 for rent. I could spend it better on a burger!
