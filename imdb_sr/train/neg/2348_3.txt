Ashlei Judd, in the early role and I think her first role is in the lead, shows her realistic rebellious nature in this slow feminist soap opera. Wow, is this a means of political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? Being a true feminist in real life, she certainly nurtured this scenario. No wonder the critic Left Ving loved this film; Unlike the reviewers here, I'm glad Judd has risen from this moron puff to the better roles in the movies that have been having fun, and did not preach a difficult liberal agenda.
