I grabbed "Sorrovs Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I guess I had some great hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, this is just another Visual FKS calling card. The story is pretty poor. Poor lighting and camera work, along with less than excellent editing and music, make the movie look bad. technical production is at FKS level! You can not just get away with cool FKS in short trousers, but it's been 5 years since the "405" made a big bang. At least so short, cold and even funny! None of this can be said about "Sorrovs Lost."
