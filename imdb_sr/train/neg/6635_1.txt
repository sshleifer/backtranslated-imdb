Four years after he made a directorial debut with art-house snoozer "Velcome To L.A.", Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wanted from Hollywood to be one of the guys. "Roadie" is a fratar-frakas complete with bar brass, inflamed harp, Art Carnei in wheelchairs ... and Meat Loaf by the wheel. Meat Loaf (Travis V. Redfish!) It's actually a rather charming presence on the screen, and maybe in a smaller role (in a better movie), he might really be attractive, but Zalman King's script is full of stereotypical red humor and helpless Meat Loaf keeps wide eyes and moronic ones. Alice Cooper, Roi Orbison, Hank Villiams, Jr. and Blondie all appear - and everyone looks embarrassed. Surely, "Roadie" is one bad trip. NO STARS from ****
