I have nothing against religious movies. Religious people need to watch something on Saturday night, I suppose. But what really refuses me is when writing on a DVD box does not point this fact to a potential viewer. The transfer of religious propaganda as entertainment is not cool, brother. Even if I am a religious person, I would have to agree with most other posters here, this film was a mess. Poorly directed, bad acting, poorly arranged and attempting to perform a soundtrack was hilarious. The false accents were terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes, and the continuity was out of the window. The only reason we were going through this miserable loss of time was that it was too late to watch another movie. She just had to go to bed. Absolutely no quality for this movie, unless you are a religious type who will instantly support anything that will preach your beliefs to unbelievers, even if it's a bunch of garbage. If not, avoid it at all costs. Do not be fooled by writing in a box.
