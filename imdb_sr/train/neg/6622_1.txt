I, like many other Bachchan fans, eagerly await Sholaia remake. This film was not. Thank God for not allowing them to use the name "Sholai" in the title of the movie. Remake Ram Gopal is not worth the title. Work on cameras, locations, costumes, a total out-of-place dance, a dialogue all combined to make the worst movie I've ever seen. You wonder whether the actors agreed to make this film because they needed money and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the actors. The only unpaid actor, an ant, was the only similarity to the first film. Abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, do not bother with this movie or DVD when it comes out.
