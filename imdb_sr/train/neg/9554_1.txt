This is the worst, and I mean the worst movie on the computer I've ever seen. The whole shop is completely inconvenient and full of stupidity. I think ... The type in this movie can speak with a computer as a real person. Now you probably think this is a super super high-tech computer, so it does, but it does it with another very bad and weak computer that does not even have a graphical interface. And the main idea of ​​how to overburden the "super" computer by merging it over computer games on the Internet is really stupid. My mobile phone will turn off lighting to conserve energy, but obviously this genius computer can not decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to download computer games. There are some other things about it, but I just do not have time for this. I just can not believe that somebody could film the movie stupid
