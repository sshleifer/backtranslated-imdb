0.5 / 10. This movie has absolutely nothing good about it. The act is one of the worst I've ever seen, which is truly amazing that EVERYTHING is terrible, not just a few here and there, everyone. The direction is a joke, the low budget is hopelessly obvious, the result is horrible, I would not say that the film was arranged, brutally cut out would be a more appropriate phrase. Combines serial killings, voodoo and tarot cards. Glup. Glup. Glup. It's not scary at all, special effects are hopelessly lame. funny bad. Writing was terribly bad. Cinema is really cheap and sometimes very grainy, and camera work is terrible. Again, what a film really does is how all the actors are strong. Cheesi.
