I am an irreconcilable skeptic and agnostic, and I was expecting to enjoy this film. However, after watching it, I sincerely believe that I myself could make a better documentary. It seems that his arguments have only four false sources (despite being listed in IMDb points, and Richard Davkins I have not seen anywhere), he is roughly decorated with ridiculous amateur computer effects and does not make even the slightest attempt to appear impartial. Narration is permeated with an entire mockery, an almost adolescent anti-Christian feeling, destroying every possibility that the film really changes one's mind, instead of just preaching the choir (ie Menu). Although there is some interesting discussion about the history of Jesus, the film encounters an intolerable obstacle when it begins to hold strongly on a Christian school that the director has attended as a child, an institution that obviously psychologically caressed him because he is possessed by this Though TGVVT apparently had a low budget, there was still an opportunity to make an intelligent comment on the very suspicious roots of Christianity. Certainly there is a lack of skeptically oriented religious documentaries on the market, and this film could help fill the void. Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage, which in the end seems to be a kind of therapeutic exercise for him. It is a pity that his Christian education has traumatized him, but he should not subject the audience to his confrontation mechanism.
