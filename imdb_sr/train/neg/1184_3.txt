this film had a pretty good sound, but the paste was very slow ... really slow. even if someone thinks it's a cult classic, I think there are many better movies from that era to watch. the sounds are fine. light OK. I would still not recommend this to anyone other than a film student. Make it good. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was stupid. No winnings here, skip this boring boredom. I saw it up, believe me, but this is just a waste of time, and I do not get good reviews here. especially high ratings ...
