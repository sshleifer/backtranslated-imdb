Uwe Boll did the impossible: he created an adaptation of the game that remains at least a bit loyal to the game; turned the game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, that is success. Unfortunately, it's still Uwe Boll with whom we deal here, so do not expect the movie to be really good. while it has its moment, "the Postman" very soon carries his welcome and becomes a pain to pass. In its foundation, it has sent a satire to the United States, as it is twelve years. It seems that Boll thinks that the offensive is linearly proportional to the comical value: what is more abusive, smsier, and more excessive. This results in a film that sets new levels of taste while it is extremely hit and missing. Yes, some gags work, but it seems to be pure luck. High points include a self-satisfied director, and people who are heavily attacked by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include .. everything in everything. After the initial surprise calms down, Postal simply becomes bored looking. Yes, it's a good joke for 10 minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of boring characters that shoot and shake all over what looks like eternity. It would probably work as a short film, but that's not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long). It has nice ideas and nice attempts, but they are hopelessly losing in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive only because of it.
