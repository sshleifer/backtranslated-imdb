I've seen this movie recently and had more hope. Not so much based on a director who did not record a cinema earlier, but rather based on his acting. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Vasson (starring Bodi Double, masterpiece by Brian De Palma) all performed in excellent films. Not together, but this fact has not changed much for this. The film is incredible, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that could attract attention a little is the choice of the location where it was captured. In my humble opinion: do not waste time on this.
