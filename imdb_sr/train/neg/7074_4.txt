My God, this film is very boring. I'm a big fan of Gine Gershon, when I rented this film I expected a romantic drama, and some great performance from Gershon. Gershon is as big as ever, but not a real actress for that role, it is too good for Rade Serbedzija. The romantic between the characters of Gershon and Sherd≈æija is too unconvincing. And I absolutely hated Sherbridge's character (organizer of the winner), he is not even charming in the movie anyway. How is dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) is beyond my comprehension. Maybe Sean Conneri, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would do a better job in this role, but they do not have a European look. Anyway, I was so bored that I was hanging out with the movie. If you are looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, look at Bound, her best movie so far. If you are looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman and an older man, try some Harrison Ford or Sean Conner movies. Gina Gershon is so underrated, and deserves a better chances than that, I want her to make a better choice in the future.
