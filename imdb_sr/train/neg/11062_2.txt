The way to go ash! You've just made a passionate, highly intriguing story about a necrophile cannibal in a soft, soft, drama. Apparently, a movie called Dahmer would be one of two types: Horror, or documentary? This was neither one nor the other. It was not close to any detailed facts, (in fact, it hardly had any substance at all). It was not very morbid or scary or even not even trying to be very disturbing. !!) What the hell was this writer / director thinking? Here is one of the LARGEST examples of sick serial killers ever, and we were badly shot, behaved badly at the bar and raped and long searched for memories in time at his old parents' house. I think Jacobson was actually trying to present (or invent) the soft side of the "J. Dhahmer."
