I'll tell one thing to Jeanette and Nelson - even when he's stuck in mirthless, vitless, painfully inept music like this one, there's still to be glimmered in their eyes. Yes, chemistry between the known twin exists even when the material is thin. Even when the result is a practical throw, there is no one depending on just a couple of appealing melodies. Even when the circumstances are so incredible - yes, even for fantasy. The truth is that she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her real husband Gene Raymond in SMILIN 'THROUGH, I'm sorry, I like Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but this is the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is more than embarrassing in her "hep" issue with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only come up with an empty look when confronted with the happiest situations. It can only be asked what it is Like on Broadway in 1938. It surely had more wit and style than it can be seen in this weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton appears in an inconceivable role and none of the supporting players can breathe any apparent life into this mess. It's like an amateur evenings in the studio, even with a few professionals who are sprinkled among the supporters. In a nutshell: Painfully clumsy showing the musicals of Rodgers and Hart. I can not recommend it, even for fans of MacDonald and Eddie. Even if Jeanette's big plans continue to shine with her beauty, this film is very bad.
