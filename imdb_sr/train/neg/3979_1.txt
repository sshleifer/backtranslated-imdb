OK, this is 2 of the worst excuses of the 4 films I've ever had to cope with. Like all other Olsen twins films with a possible exception to Minority in New York, this film did not have a story, a hugging hole for works, a disgusting stupid acting and a bad recording even !!!!!!!!! in case you have not hit yet, I hate MARI KATE AND ASHLEI !!!!!! The only reason I was watching this was because I was bored and nothing else was. I wonder if the twins will ever stop making the same stereotypical films in which they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day in the meantime with the help of two sweet guys who immediately fall over them. The least they could have are the type of them 4 or that they both fall with the same guy. The story in this story was so imbecile and just stupid. Even one child could see the omissions in it. Perhaps they should split and start making films individually or perhaps movies with a different kind of story. Anyone who loved this movie was not offensive - or really dumb, really artificial or did not see any really good movie. or they may be really smart and have only bad movie choices. in no case would I recommend this film to my worst enemy for a good film experience .. the only thing that's good is that some laughter is cut in pathetic attempts to cool down. If you're looking for a laugh, that's ridiculous. basically I give 0 or less.
