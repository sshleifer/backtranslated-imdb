I love bad movies about sharks. I really. I hysterically laugh at them. and the Scifi Channel had a marathon of them, culminating in the premiere of their new original pictures, hammerhead: shark frenzy. on the basis of the review, it looked as if it would be great fun. in essence, it's a remake of Benley's creatures. it is hinted at the attack of shark 3: megalodon, which is at best fun in the shark movie. I was moody; I was ready to go. Bring him, crazy scientist-man! Oh, God, was that a wrong movie? Wrong, Wrong, Wrong. Sick. twisted. This is a theoretical reproduction in the worst case, my friends. when the drugged girl is pulled out of suspended animation and tied up with a screaming head, because a hybrid shark fetus is an absolutely crazy "scientist" deliberately implanted in her womb wants OUT ... Jesus monkeys. that's what I call disturbing. It's actually the way the store works: hmmm, think a crazy scientist. my son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life with a combination of his DNA with that shark with a hammer, because the sharks are not subject to cancer, and the further heads of the hammer are reproduced through the placenta. Oh Look! perfect amphibious creature! I created the next evolution of the human race! I KNOW! Let's make it play! but damn if all the genes of the shark made my son bloodthirsty; Instead of raping hot pieces I'm sending to his little paradise in the jungle, he's constantly eating it. but look at this! among the random people who, due to some unimportant plot, ended up on my research island, is the woman to whom my son was hired before he died! I bet she'll do HER! all this leads to a very touching and honest reunion: woman: will you fertilize me? crazy scientist: no. he is. (indicates that the shark hunter is in the tank) how sweet it is. Do not watch this movie. ever.
