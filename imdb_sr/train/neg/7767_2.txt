Anyone who is not familiar with c.S. Forrester's book of this film should be interesting. It is colorful, it behaves well and displays a great adventure, but for those of us who know the original stories that are terrible. I could barely sit through it. For some reason writers on the screen seem forced to write the stories they work on. Of course, the spoken word differs from the written word, and there are some episodes that would be difficult to record. But why do screenwriters copy the story instead of just adapting it? In this case, the writers pulled out themselves. Just a few examples: There was no riot at Renoven. The cops took over the boat after the half-crazy captain was completely crazy when he fell through the hatch - for reasons they implied, but they were never given. There was no military court. The investigating court was held in an almost congruent atmosphere. Captain Pelle does not appear to appear in this part of the Hornblover saga, nor the wife of Ortega. Hornblover himself was never in jail, neither on the ship nor on the coast. There are many such manipulations of the Forrester story. On a purely technical basis, I think that the repeated use of the flash on the film damages the continuity of the story. > Why, why did the screenwriters have to mess up a good story?
