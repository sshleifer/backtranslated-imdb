I am giving 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest is ... pretty boring. In about 50 minutes, we have a contusion plot ... In the war world, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10 minutes? Then there was real action! This is something like: "Let's take a walk through the sauna and breathe in front of the beautiful sunsets!" And maybe deliver a message, like, "Do not kill the elephants!" Very ecologically. I would expect this from the "new" film by Steven Segala, not from this ... The lead actress makes me think about artificial sunbathing, colored hair and too big a base! And I did not see a scene in which her hair was twisted, or sweated, or her clothes were dusty. She just does not look like a 19th-century woman! And at the bar, where our hero wants, Svaize comments on the commander to look like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 and became known in the following years. Livingstone and other researchers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So, if the action does not take place between 1896 and 1900, Houston, we have a problem. :) Svaize leaves a nice impression ... as briefly - hard on the outside, but soft and umbelly inside. Not to get caught up with the queen, but you realized the point. He really thrives on the face of this beaten puppy on several occasions. The movie smelled. It's too long and boring. do not look! Do not buy! It's a waste of your money!
