This film is really something of Kurat's egg, well in parts. Unlike other reviewers, I discovered that the main mistake is that it is not able to draw the attention of viewers to characters and complications. I sat through it because I'm interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of the bands, but if I rated it solely on the basis of its merits as a movie, I would have to postpone it, a few warnings: Jason Behr is good at John Livien's work and quite convincing as singer; The narrative of his childhood trauma is unclear, although we are given a hint in Livien's good relationship with his parents, but his behavior is ultimately bizarre for the viewer (which should not be). However, the idea of ​​using a theater personality to solve internal conflicts is interesting, though not new, or fully explored as a topic in this film. Allusions to John Lennon were irritating, but I admit I'm not a fan of the Beatles. In any case, Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that there was something derivative in them. Another frustrating thing in the movie was the way in which it opened up to some interesting - though middle and middle-level - philosophical reflections on the main character, but left the topic of its thinking there, only to re-pick them up in the middle of the movie is very short Livien says, "Before God, there was music" (ever watching this ad for Tia Maria in the 1990s, "Before time, there was Tia Maria"? It seems an idiotic conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he came to him, but he has right on it. Fortunately, his bass player and friend, who is involved in the side Monica Monaghan seems to admit the misconception of this thinking when she replies: "You do not know that." Overall, the limited benefits of direction and complication could go either to future projects, to meaningless banality, or to interesting and a mature perspective.
