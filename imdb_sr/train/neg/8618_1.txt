Incredibly horrible movie. I recently saw part of it on T.V. The jaw dropped as I watched an awfully imaginary plot and listened to a deadly mess. No line from the one-liner master could have approached the creation of any similar laughter. It was so bad that I wanted to exhume the body of Rodney Dangerfield, spit it and scream: "How could you?" I know that many movies are made in a hurry, hoping to cash out the popularity of a given actor or theme. But please, Hollivood, show some respect to the audience. It's sad and frightening that people were expected to pay to see such a bag. At the bottom of the septic tank, even on the television standards of the Sunday afternoon.
