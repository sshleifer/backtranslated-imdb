A terribly incredible and stupid potboiler, which at least has a redeeming, sharp location photo, but it's too unbelievable to generate a lot on the path of tension. I kind of hoped that Stanvick would not come back in time, because she was actually loaded with wet, more than one husband, and she had an idiotic child ... why not run with Meeker? But the question remains ... what sort of wood is it from which consent was made, if the broken piece that was drawn did not float? Stanvick, always immaculately professional, does the best he can with the material, but it's worn out.
