I just saw this movie and I have to say it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can not function at all. She read her lines very unnaturally, and she had a very non-natural expression of the face throughout the film. Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand is natural. She played her role with a great perfection. SPOILERS! The story was simple - we saw it many, many times before. She breaks up, finds another, becomes jealous, breaks up with another girl, and eventually reunites. There was no surprise at all, it was known that Eva would stop and that Adam would connect with Peter. The only thing nobody saw was that Peter told Adam to go to Eve for a party. She became serious, the side of Petra whom the viewers had not seen before in the film, and told him to conquer Evina's heart, which was really sweet. An actor who gives unforgettable performance. This is a central movie with central actors, so I do not recommend it!
