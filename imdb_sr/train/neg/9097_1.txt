Who actually created this shit is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it's a waste of time and money. I hate to create low budget cuts with D-Lister's actors and a story that is similar to that of the first one. I found this film in the cheap bin located next to Vild Things 2 and Death To Supermodels for $ 2.99, what a fool I actually thought might be good instead, I looked at the depression as bad action stereotypes that are cut out of the story and the scenarios from the first. Anyone who thought it was a real-to-video production was actually half a decent movie, you have to be on a crackd or something, because I think most people who have seen this the film was thinking about what it was the CRAP load !!!!
