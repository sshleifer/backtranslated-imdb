The premise of the film is that Thomass Archer's son was murdered, and his wife is brutal - and given him a chance to get revenge when (after posttraumatic stress disorder), he was put in a room with a man tied to a chair and said he was a culprit. He received a large board with which he could offer retaliation: drills, bats, nails, bumps, torches, everything you can imagine that someone might want to physically injure another human being. Too many tortures take place before we realize that Archer Man is not the one who committed the crime. The two then create an unpleasant alliance; who put them in this situation and why. Well, when everything is said and done, we do not worry ...
