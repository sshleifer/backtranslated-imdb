Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly entertaining in this turkey from 1970, but the script is so miserable and offensive that even the young Goldie Havn (right after the Oscars) can not start pulling this out of the mud. As a 40-year-old celebrity, Sellers are mostly confused to n-degree. A 3 out of 10. Best Performance =? Nicki Henson plays a young type of study. I hope Havn and Sellers are well paid, because I do not see another reason for this like in the 1970s (a very good year for movies - CATCH-22, MASH, HUBS, JOE, VESA, PET EASI PIECES and many others). You can not beat them all!
