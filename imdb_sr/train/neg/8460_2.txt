I rented this film only because of the promise of Villiam Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that after watching RR on the cover (as an actor), this film would be good. It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would make so that if he wants to call his name, then he must be good right? VRONG VRONG VRONG. By far the worst mounting of the "Manos Hand of Destiny". The way it was edited did not make sense and made the movie impossible to track and after the first 30 minutes you will not even try to track it. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this movie, they may have owed someone, but that's a good way to do it. Besides, they were only in this movie for a few minutes, and Rodriguez did not even speak. So, if you want to watch a movie with a poor montage, a bad acting and a confusing story than being my guest, but do not say that you were not warned.
