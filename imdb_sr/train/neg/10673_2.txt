This film was a bad indie with A-list talent. The action was stupid, all the way to the end. It reminded me of something that went into the home video market in the 1980s. I would give him one, but there were short moments when you could see how the actors are really working hard to make it worthwhile. I think the worst thing was the underwater scene that was kept at the dock. The underwater lighting seemed to be unheard of, and whenever someone we needed to worry about was close to air discharge, this air reservoir would somehow appear. I would have avoided that, unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Good day.
