This is the story of a young woman who is seduced and then dismissed from her elderly, married lover after she remains pregnant; is she refreshed against him, and all of his family, through black magic? which, disappointingly, she does not work alone, but has someone else for her. Good production value for the Thai horror. But a mild scenario never creates uncertainty, the director approaches the material completely conventional, and the final act loses the sympathies of the spectators towards the victims throwing the logic to the winds. At one point, the character has a great opportunity to simply kill the dead villain, and instead she gets up and runs away without taking a pistol. Bad vriting ?? you absorb it! Some adverse effects, including a really inept late late fetal corpse and one man who dies of hundreds of living eels broke out of his stomach. It is recommended only for genres that simply have to watch every horror film produced in Asia in the last 15 years.
