The story and performance were good, but it was really depressing and hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really made a superb performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and beautiful. Seriously, I thought it was Carmen Electra until I see the IMDb profile. I can not say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading Vronski chronicles, but I'm glad to see a movie before reading a book. This is a bit too "real" to me. I prefer Lestat and Louis's witty little typhoons in the fight of slaves. Earth Kitt was so scary and after her character did what she did The film was destroyed for me; I was barely standing to watch the rest of the show. (I'm sorry for ambiguity, but I do not want to say anything) I'm sorry, but it's not my type of show.
