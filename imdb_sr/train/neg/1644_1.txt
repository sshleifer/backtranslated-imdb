Put down the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought nothing could overthrow hero's last action, but this is easy. There are about 3 singles in the movie that meet on Sundays to talk about their sex life from the weekend. The fourth man - who was married and - who was once part of the group, appears and talks about what he and his wife are doing. Nothing works in this movie. Jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the film. The big kicker at the end of the movie is ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.
