Ira Levinov The Broadway hit appears on the screen with almost no meat on the bones, a mysterious plot with only a few tricks and turns, but no one can worry about. Frustrated writer Michael Caine seized to steal the work of a brilliant young man and to transfer him as his own; his dishonest plan may involve the murder of a talented kid who has Keine's fierce wife in his arms. The first act into which everyone is introduced is terribly dead, and Caine does everything an actor can keep pacing. Dian Cannon is as wrong as his wife (she is too smart and smart to surrender as a ditz), and Christopher Reeve (in the middle part of the film) seems extremely embarrassing in the role of a better writer. These three characters, as well as the boring neighbor, Irena Vorth, are so undefined that what happens after posting is barely recorded until the second act begins. The direction of Sidney Lumet is stagnant and unclear, the scenery is unconvincing and poorly lit, and the final is a total disaster. Actors are struggling to give the scenario some substance, but with so thin material, everything we see is their hard work. * 1/2 of ****
