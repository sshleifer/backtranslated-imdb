The exhausted action of a man who takes a tail for a woman in the event of a murder + an equally exhausted plot of an outsider that is ultimately excluded. The case would have thought that the film would rise above its hacked origin. But the scene for the scene takes place without changing the intensity, with no personality portions and inexplicable behavior. The theme of homosexuality was completely unnecessary-or completely unexplored. It seemed to be included only to amaze spectators. When will Hollywood know that having gay characters does not automatically make a bigger picture? Unfortunately, horrible movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I was expecting better than her and Kristin Scott Thomas. This is definitely one to be missed.
