I admit I do not expect much from Roger Corman's film. Generally, I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. However, in this case, I am pleasantly surprised. Gunslinger is a story about a woman (played by Beverly Garland) who takes over the sheriff after her husband was brutally murdered. Mrs. Garland is a pretty good shot, she killed one of the killers the next day at her husband's funeral. Her first task is to close a local bar that violates the city's police time. The owner of the bar is trying to buy land in anticipation of the purchase by rail. However, Mrs. Garland is pervading her plans, and at least the matron hires a man to kill Mrs. Garland. to go to Suzanne Somers "She's a sheriff" joke. With the exception of a couple of failures (the doors of the open-door apartments, the jeep track, and the two horsemen waiting on the screen to tell them to drive around the corner), the film becomes quite passable as a movie card. However, Corman could not resist the fact that his movie captures horsemeat, similar to other films. Sterne says Gunslinger is a horse opera that is worth your time.
