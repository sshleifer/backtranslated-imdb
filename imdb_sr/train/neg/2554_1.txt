Frankly, I do not even joke when I say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This film does not have a unique ounce of originality in its poor dialogue or its apparently plagiarized story. I can not even begin to count things in this movie that are obviously downloaded from "The Omen" and other films like that. For example, the nanny "Luci" in this movie is actually one of the devil's servants who is sent to lead and protect Satan ... ... does that sound like Mrs. Bailock to anyone else. Another thing is that the orphanage first got a child burnt to the ground just a few months after it was adopted, just like in the "Omen". However, fortunately, a priest survived a fire and escaped burns all over the body .... another accident? And finally, the burned priest remains in the hospital room with pictures of Jesus on the walls, just as the priest in "Omen" had the pages of the Bible plastered on walls such as wall papers. Please, do not even begin to draw a comparison between the end of this film and the "Omen" for you, because as I already mentioned, there are too many to mention here.
