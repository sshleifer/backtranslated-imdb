With no affinity for any kind of filmmaking, and a healthy appreciation of documentaries, I can honestly say that I was angry at myself because I tried to sit through the full length of "date 20". I will not waste time with complication, you can read other reviews. I will say, however, that Berkovitz's hyper, Voody Allen's narration was extremely boring. Or you wanted to leave coffee or get some restraint. And Berkovitz is potentially obvious that this film is a bad idea, because in his details he describes his trials to fund a documentary film. Forgive me for concealing insults as compliments, but I will confess to Berkovitz that he had the skills to persuade an idiot to finance this horrible piece ****. We appreciate the boundaries and intentions of the film here, but even when it comes to the standards Berkovitz sets for himself, he shoots and misses at all levels. In the end, I'm sure that many of these women's friends were not cautious about meeting a tough filmmaker, and that is why I question the authenticity of the film. Hey Miles, I loved your movie the first time I saw it ... when it appeared as a Seinfeld episode or a film directed by Voody Allen or Kevin Smith.
