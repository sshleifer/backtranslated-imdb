This film talks about a very sexy Olympic star who is engaged to train a basketball team of high schools. Similar to VILDCATS, Goldie Havn, she plays Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and she works as much as possible from the script. I think Rakel Welsh would have been a better choice, but given the apparent film budget for the movie, he probably would not be able to afford it. Cathi Lee looks great in every shot, but we never see a complete nudity. The story is, at the very least, quite predictable and does not offer any surprises. Young and happy Michael Biehn has a major male role. He is a star in the team and a love interest for Cathy Lee. Keenan Vinn has several fun scenes as a rich old man running a sports program and does not think that a woman needs to practice sports. This point appears during the whole movie and, to put it too, is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not put his team through unusual training; does not do anything the male coach does not do. There is a funny backdrop that involves a tall and not very good player going through a hypnosis to spend hours and playing as a professional basketball player Sidney Vicks. Everybody seems to have had a good time in filming this movie, but the only real reason to see it is Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not such a great actress, but she has a brilliant smile, beautiful hair and a very brown body.
