Why, oh, why not learn? When you have a nice, juicy exploit trick, use it! Do not get tired of trying to be deep and careful; You'll just look stupid. Christmas Evil is a story about Harry Stadling, who has seen too little how his mom loves (Daddy-dressed-as-) Santa Claus back when he was a kid. Thus, of course, Harry grows obsessed with Christmas, and finally, when his disappointment becomes too great, he turns around, dresses like Santa Claus, and walks in the city by giving good toys to the toys, and wickedly kills anyone he considers to be unscrupulous. Easy, and not bad to start. (By the way, how many other horror flixes related to holidays are using the same schtick?) Unfortunately, this movie wants to be more "Santa, Portrait of a serial killer" than "The Silent Night, the Deadly Night." Two thirds of the film is spent on documenting Harry's slow, but inevitable breakdown, if I were ready to buy a premise until the moment the addresses were opened. You know that the movie is in trouble when you find yourself killing a killer, you already do it. Perhaps Harry's descent into madness could be tempting in the hands of a competent director, but hey. , we have a guy named Levis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only film, and it shows. The action jumps vertically from scene to scene, without setting footage or clear glances of actors to let us know where we are and whom we see. Even when the film is launched, we are still treated with a bunch of aiding Harry's self-pity, insecurity and neurotic behavior. More depressing than frightening, Christmas Evil is what needs to be avoided.
