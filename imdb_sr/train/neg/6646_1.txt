It is so sad that the Romanian audience is still filled with vulgar and uneducated individuals who enjoy such cheap and demonstrative shows, superficial and brutal like the "Garce" or "Vacanta mare" children's game ... The difference is that Mugur Mihaescu , Dora Octavian Dumitru and other such sub-craftsmen never assume to claim that their performances are "art." Pintilie, who made a very good movie 40 years ago ("Duminica la ora sase"), and then another, good enough ("Reconstituirea"), tries to declare his film lengths "works of art" - but, unfortunately, he manages in some ways too limited the level of specific cinematographic means of expression. As such, "Niki Ardelean" again offers a "HOW NO" sample - this is merely his merit.
