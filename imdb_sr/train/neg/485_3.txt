When I reviewed the video, I thought: this will be a great movie. And it really could have been. The actress who plays the protagonist was very credible, and the beauty of shooting is undeniable. However, the dialogues cast a dark shadow over the whole picture. The level of language was too familiar and too modern for the action that took place in 1610 and took away most of the magic of the film. However, I have to congratulate the interpreter, because the English subtitles were more sophisticated and more appropriate to the original French characters, and this probably explains the good rating that the film got on imbd!
