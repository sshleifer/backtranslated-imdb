This was a painstaking example of cheap, boring and unoriginal broadcasts of Australian TV stations to meet local content quotas. Writing was really terrible and I'm not surprised that writers are responsible for the worst Australian film lately, Honorable Valli Norman. Mild fun. She was just tired and bad, and worst of all, she really thought it was funny. It was simply embarrassing to watch. There is something very passionate about this show that is given 10 out of 10 to the IMDb. Try to find a (true) review of the (real) Australian emission watcher (not many) and this is impossible. Or crazy. There are bread loaves that are funnier than this show. Avoid emissions at all costs, and if that happens on DVD, remember that the laugh that deserves to be unintentional.
