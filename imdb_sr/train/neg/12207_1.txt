I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, I had Commodore 64 and I loved playing Ramba on it. That's why I was really thrilled when I bought this movie really cheap. I put it in my VCR and started: Man this movie is really bad! Silvester Stallone says 3 words in the whole film (except for that terrible sentimental speech at the end) and has the same expression on the face to the end. And this stupid love in the middle, it's so incredibly predictable. I just finished quickly by forwarding the whole thing and went on to exchange a movie for something else.
