Last weekend I bought this "zombie movie" from a cheap bin and watched him with some friends thinking that it would be a budget version of the "Earth of the Dead." Boy, I was wrong. It seems like they spent a good portion of their budget on cover-art, which is very wrong for lovers of the zombie genre. We watched to show where zombie chickens sprout and enter a car with some iuppi who is outside in the middle of nothing talking about work on a mobile phone. They actually talk to the guy before one of the girls kills him; but when they started driving the car, I could no longer stop the incredulity. Some people actually consider it "such a bad, good" movie, they are liars. I did not finish the film, but one of the other reviews mentions that they in a way became police officers at the end of the film, which is why I'm glad I did not see it all the way. This is worse than "Zombiez" DO NOT watch!
