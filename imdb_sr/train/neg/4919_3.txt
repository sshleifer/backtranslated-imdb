I was rarely so upset with the lead as I was in this movie. God, is she bothered or what? She says it all in the same tone and is terrible, so terrible that, on the contrary, Rian O'Neal is brilliant. There are not many stories. It's rich, it's wood, they both have to sacrifice a lot for love. His father is Stounvol Jackson, her name is, in case you did not notice the difference in the two of them that they won in the name of love. Nominations for the Oscar for this film indicate that it was a bad year. John Marley is as good as a wooden father, but supports the nomination? But Ali did not win. I still think Katharine Ross should play Jennifer, but again, if it's up to me, Katharine Ross would be in many more movies. She's certainly a better actress than McGrav. I did not even cry when I got sick, I never fell to grief. It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones who seems to have about 15 years, and the result is good. But this one is so old now that her beard has a long kilometer, and the sin is not her old, but she feels.
