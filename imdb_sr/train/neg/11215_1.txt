At first, this movie looked pretty good even though it was moving pretty fast and although they only had a budget of $ 60,000, it was good, but if you found your sister dead in the lake and discovered who might have killed her why they would go hunting He is here and pulled the pistol at him with just one bullet and destroyed him and eventually ran from him all retarded and killed? Plus, after finding your sister dead in the lake and finding a trail and discovering who the killer is, why not surrender that trail to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie when she behaved like a sister who was a waitress, and she talks to a bad guy, she should have met him somewhere and recorded her dead and what happened because of her "evidence". I do not know that I was not happy with the ending. This movie could be much better that it lasted longer and the acting was better and the end was not so bad! Do not spend your money on this movie, because if you do, you write a review here and you will not be happy.
