I was very unhappy with this move. Everything was terrible from the beginning. The comedy was immortal, the action was exaggerated, the songs were without a melody. Even the story was insignificant. From the writer who wrote successful scenarios such as Guru and Dhoom, I had great expectations. Actors did too hard and did not help the movie at all. Of course, Kareena rolled the bikini screen, but for two seconds. I think Hindi stunt directors should explore how action movies are working. They're exaggerating too much. In Chinese films, this style functions because it is their signature. But the signature of Hindi film are songs. A good action movie should not last longer than two hours and can not look unrealistic. But, in the future, I'm sure these action films will be much sharper. It should also be noted: Comedy and action movies do not mix unless they are properly implemented. Good luck, next time.
