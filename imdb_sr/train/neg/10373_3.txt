This is one of those films that I could only do once. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in script, dialog, direction, editing, sets, and special effects. Well, this was 1933, but it really screwed up. Part of the problem is that actors such as Richard Arlen, Garry Cooper, V.C. Fields and Cari Grant were not recognizable (people were asking for a confession that was not there). The movie was just gathering, without any cohesion. Lewis Carroll's spirit, humor and continuity are missing. What a shame! That's such a great book. I would recommend Disnei's version of 1951.
