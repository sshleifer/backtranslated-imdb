The schizophrenic escaped from a psychiatric hospital in New York, and soon teachers began to go to the University of St. The new teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to deal with the confusion of red herrings. In spite of the time of 78 minutes, this cheap spoon is pulled and continued until the lame ends when it is discovered that the person you suspect is a killer from the very beginning. Director Richard Haines is barely sweating from a lame stalk-n-slash track, but brings in an audience from the early 80's, which was probably eager. For all of our amateur anthropologists, this was filmed in Nev Iavku in the early 80's, so you can check all the cultures, beliefs, and practices of living people from that distant place. The film receives credit for rejecting "Final Girl". You rarely see it. Also, it's always nice to see a horror movie where the priest is a killer. Do not you trust the clergy, my favorite film industry? Luckily, this is just a fake priest and he is caught. Still, he still works on moral high ground.
