This film is a shit from beginning to end. You probably do not get worse, acting, story, photography, working with cameras, etc. It's all bad, very, very bad. But that's what makes it 'glossy', it will give you more than enough good laugh. What's worse, the better! I really have no idea what these people thought they were making this movie. A serious Viking movie? The story is damn ridiculous, it's more like a disguised comedy, somehow like a mafia, also meaningless, but damn funny. Take care of the end of the film ... uhum.
