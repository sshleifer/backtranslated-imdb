I waited for this film to play with great anticipation. Assuming it will be more accurately depicted as a movie "Christmas Box" based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent many messages to friends and family asking them to watch this show, hoping to better understand a small amount of my "new" life. After I saw this film, I was so disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain, I hoped this film would illuminate the parents who "think" to understand the grief through which the parent passes who lost the child. This film was a very bright film and the nonsense of Diane Keaton was plaintive to the parents who buried the child. It was very unrealistic from start to finish. I had a few calls after the movie, every call was the same, "It was so far away and I thought you'd be back on the road for a short time and listen to songs on the radio and life is coming back" a bunch of bulls! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because none of them would make the film so inconsequential. I suppose it's Hollivood.
