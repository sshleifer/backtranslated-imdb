It's not about gymnastics; Replace occasional training and it can be as easy on archery, or microbiology, or a booger-throwing tournament. Instead, like any other Rockie / Flashdance derivative that overflowed the market from the 80s, it's about conquering the misery of style-to-it-all, making all the social / personal realities irrelevant to your loner-with a love interest, of course. Ronald Reagan from top to bottom, briefly; so as part of the movie, it's all the way to the detail. Some of the actors are strange enough to revive things - especially the love interest, which was given to you by no other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, who is warming up for Ted; the heroine Olivia D'Abo is a sneaking alki dad and a half-sister with a big hair more interesting than a sick mother or her completely inert bitch-mummies / matchmakers, of which it seems to be of porcelain. It's my instinct to be stunned by the blacks who fight with comics, but on the other hand they're at least in the movie. But D'Abo does not bother with his awkward girl and, in the absence of any other narrative focus, the lack of interest in gymnastics itself is really important; These are just bodies that move around, and not only the outcome of the big tournament is completed, but everything is done by the obvious double.
