I had pretty high hopes for this film, although it was bad in the paper. I was extremely tolerant and went through the whole movie. I felt sick all the way. Although I'm not even the least indecent or particularly sensitive to the rude cinema - I enjoyed Voodoo Allen's all you ever wanted to know about sex. and Michael Hanneke's "Fun Games" - I found an obsession with the director of this 10-year-old who wanted to drink female milk completely painfully. And when the film peaked in an "orgy" where the boy drank and his mother's milk, and the woman he had been craving for the entire film, I almost vomited with a pity for total perversion and a sentimental pope. Do not misunderstand me, I enjoy the vast majority of European films, as well as independently recorded films, so this film was extremely pleased with me. Avoid this film at all costs, you should transfer it to anale history as a bad movie lesson.
