After leaving the popular TV series The Andi Griffith Shov, Don Knotts gave the film glory a courageous attempt with a series of senseless, but comic comedies. Unfortunately, "The Reluctant Astronaut", recorded inexpensively (like most Knotts movies), is much worse than others. Don plays a small town that receives an astronaut training camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel - they want him as a new home-owner! Some might say that poor satira capitalizes America's then fresh fever for a new era of technology, but the film is actually a dull excuse to troubled the restless children. It's a good start, with OK settings and nostalgic locations, but it's becoming more soulless and idiotic. * from the ****
