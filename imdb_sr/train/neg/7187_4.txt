Here we go with another slasher movie, Good people and actors of all were really good! Few kids who play funny phones are called and parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids! 20 years after they are still friends, they go to a huge house, have fun, drugs and sex (no nudity) at least half an hour of film! They start making phone calls again! and then the killer returns kills them one at a time, and the killer is in the GREAT BLACK DOG with a hammer just like the Urban Legend movie, The death scene is truly weird, and really weird times. Beautiful slasher movie in this part would give you 7/10 but it's tvist at the end of the movie made the whole movie somehow meaningless Twist killed the movie for me and I'll give it 4/10
