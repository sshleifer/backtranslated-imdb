This film was a waste of time, even rented on a DVD. If the camera's super quick shots show faster, we could pay twenty dollars to get into the laundry, get popcorn and watch how the dryer is turning. Jet Li is much better than this. One can only hope that he will not conclude contracts sooner to make another clich√©-filmed film such as One.
