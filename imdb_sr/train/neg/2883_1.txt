This movie is so horrible. It's so bad that I can not stand to spend anything other than just a few words. Avoid this film at all costs, that's terrible. None of the details of the crime are implemented properly. Many recordings of slaughterhouses. Strange cuts and edits. There is no continuity of the plot. The acting is absolutely the greatest amateur I've ever seen. This bomb movie is obviously made for some money regardless of the accuracy of its content. Camera operation is sometimes out of focus and always rattles. It looks like it was filmed on a video. Actually, now that they have received Denis Rader with life in prison, I would like those who made this horrible movie to prison as well. Seriously, do not even think about watching this. I'd give her a negative star if I could.
