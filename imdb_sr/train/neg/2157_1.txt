Siskel and Ebert were great in this show whether you agreed with them or not because of the real conflict created by their separate professional attitudes. Roeper took this show a few degrees, because he was not a film critic and because he replaced the snide for stubbornly. Now, when Ben Lions appeared, I feel I'm watching "Teen Nevs" - you know, the children's show, run by children for kids? Manckievitz is not much better. It is obvious that throughout their lives they have come across only the continuous feeding of mainstream films. The idea that these two ranked amateurs have anything of interest or the consequences to say about movies is ridiculous. If they are considering a film without a formula, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they just consider it "confusing". Wait - I think I understand ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney produces movies for children. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper promoted independent films and were only hit-or-missed with large-scale production of budget studies - what a surprise: these two guys love a big studio and only manage to tolerate several Indies. In addition, everyone knows for whom TV advertisers are in the age group. A flashy nepotism is a cream on a cake. In what alternative universe do these people qualify as film critics?
