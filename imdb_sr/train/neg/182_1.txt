This is the worst continuation in the world of film. Once again, this does not seem. The killer continues to kill from the party. But this time he kills people who make a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means it's the dumbest movie ever. Do not look at this. If you appreciate a valuable hour during this movie then do not look at it. You want to ask the director and the person next to you that made him do it. Because it simply does not combine the original actions of horror, action and crime. Teenager, little child or young adult, this film has such an impact on people.
