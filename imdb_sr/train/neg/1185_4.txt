Another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children's story, La Bette (1975) aka The Beast is trying to imagine (in a very graphic and what may look insulting and disturbing, but in reality rather stupid and comical), what actually happened between Beauti and the beast? I am amazed by many reviews and comments that look too deep in this movie. I would not go so far as to say that it is a serious and dark study of such subjects as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment or a satirical critique of the Catholic religion. I would not even call a horror-erotic movie. It's more a parody of all the genres it touches or mentions, although it has some shocking moments in all departments that will surely remain in your memory. woman and supposedly terrifying, but the funniest I've ever seen in a movie creature with a really impressive ... well-anatomy, is set on Scarlatti's claudic music and is hysterical. My husband and I laughed loudly to the exaggerated details of the encounter. Morale scenes - beauty can and will win a monster. The question is - who is the target audience of the film? For an erotic picture, it is too extensive; for an artistic film - there are too many unusual scenes of insanity and I would say a sudden ending. IMO, the filmmaker did not think it was a serious drama. As a parody of the art house / horror / erotic, it is funny and certainly original. Make a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning. This story of curious beauty and lusty beasts is certainly not recommended for a shared look with children. An introductory scene that can shock an unprepared viewer much more than a notorious scenario of bestiality can be successfully used on the Discoveri channel for a program such as "In the World of Animals - Couple Hunt and Horse Ritual".
