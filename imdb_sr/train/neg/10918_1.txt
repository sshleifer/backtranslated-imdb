Manmohan Desai has made some entertaining, though illogical films such as AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but made some craps like COOLIE and MARD, then GJS. This movie is one of the worst films ever made since foreigners. Mard ko dard nahin hota, but the movie is so bad to fight The British have made cartoons, and the movie looks so strange Scene at the British hotel is a goddamn stupid movie has a lot of nonsense like Amrita attacked Amitabh, then the whole scene plus the climax of the movie gets even worse There are more gems like the statue of a horse that gets a life, masks Amitabh haha ​​and many more Direction by Manmohan Desai is bad Music is OK <br /> Amitabh is doing his part with style, nothing is different from COOLIE, LAAVARIS role of Amrita Si ngh is fine Satien Kapuu is fine Prem Chopra is as usual, Nirupa Roi is again the usual Dara Singh is the same as usual
