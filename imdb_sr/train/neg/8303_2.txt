Since its release in 1983, "Christmas Story", the story of Jean Shepherd about her alter ego, Ralphie, has become a true classic. "My Summer Story," however, still has Shepherd as a narrator, but there is absolutely no charm, and the characters are not even close to the caliber of the original movie. The "My Summer Story" is basically a mess of the central and just not very interesting stories, which include the hill neighbors and the tops of the fight. Charles Grodin, whom I usually love, is extremely unsuitable in his father's role (as Darren McGuin better edited in the original), and his character never seemed anything but forcible. Kiernan Culkin is a bad substitute for Ralphia, and the little brother is here forgotten. It seems that only Mom has some value here and maybe it's because she waved a cinema manager with a boom overflow when she's too far throwing happiness with angry hostesses at a "free dinner". The stories in this are mostly insignificant and stretched. It can appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a continuation of "Christmas Stories", it is very poor and does not cost much of the time. 2 of 10
