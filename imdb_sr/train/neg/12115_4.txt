Recently, I broke through the collection of Lugosi's films, and only a few days ago from the combination of Lugosi and Boris Carloff in the film "Black Cat", I really enjoyed their cooperation in "Gavran." Unfortunately, this simply did not work for me, and until the end of the film I was pretty disappointed. For the first three quarters of this film, I thought that the story had no real uncertainty. Lugosi was pretty good at keeping things together like a bit crazy Dr. partly because she is already engaged, and partly because her father (Samuel S. Hinds) does not approve. To deal with this situation, he gets the help of Edmund Bateman (Boris Karloff) - a terribly ugly man who wants Vollins to make him more acceptable. Except for Lugosi's performance, I found a bit of what I was interested in. Then, suddenly, in the last fifteen or twenty minutes, the film changes completely. Suddenly it became quite disturbing, but I thought that Lugoshi's performance had collapsed, mostly because the film tried to get him out of the crazy and crazy - and there was a difference. He plays a "crazy" role very well controlled and controlled, but evil. "Insane" is more than an evil control, and I did not think that Lugosi did it well. At one point, he offers some maniacal laughter that appears as a fake. In the meantime, Carloff was a great disappointment. He never grabbed me. In addition, he must have realized on Lugosia that - in films in which he plays - Karloff gets the most prizes, although in "Gavran" it is clear that Lugosi is the main actor. This certainly gives an indication that Universal has ranked their two great horror stars - inexplicably, I would add, because I've always thought of Lugosi as a better actor two. In any case, there is no real connection to the story of Edgar Allen Poa "The Raven" - except that Vollins is a fanatic Poe, who is trying to reconstruct some of the techniques of torture from Poo's story. All in all, disappointment. 4/10.
