This movie is shown over and over again on the cable, so ... There is no excuse for these two attractive women to fight either against Luke Wilson or the equally rude "villiana" in this movie. Female actresses are very sweet, and this is the only reason to watch this movie. I suppose it's "funny" that Luke's even uglier / stupid / stupid friend is nearby, but well, that's what we get. None of the female leaders would ever have spoken to any men in this film for more than 5 minutes. What we get is to weep and cry and fight, and so on, more than 2 guys who are best described on Friday 13. 4. Dead * @ $ #
