Great west. I hear you all say! Great first effort! I'm not sure what movie you were looking at, but it must have been different from what I saw. Great Western or really good movies of any genre have characters you can trust and did not have this movie! The acting was the weakest and I did not care for any of the characters, which made the entire film meaningless. the story was too big for the creators and maybe you should try to make TV shows at a low budget as you see on the FACT OR FICTION programs on sci-fi. Look for a good movie, a great Western or even a pleasant hour and a half, look elsewhere.
