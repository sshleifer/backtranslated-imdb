"The Cobveb" is an example of many examples of films that feature powerful, sometimes significant performances and high scores, but unfortunately they are drastically shattered due to a dark plot and very little for the public's interest. This is Richard Vidmark as a doctor working in a mental institution whose life turns into anxiety over family issues and a rather ridiculous and overburdened conflict that does not seem at all serious. . It is time for the institution to get new curtains for the windows of the library. An old woman wants to put curtains over it, but many patients want to make their own. And somehow, this ridiculous and inadvertently crazy conflict arises where the lives are in danger and the families begin to disintegrate. It sounds more like a conflict that would emerge between very young children. Examining the logic of complications and whether it really could have happened, it's so massive to wonder if only the crazy could look really bui it. Do not misunderstand me, there's nothing wrong with acting. Actors who follow Vidmark are composed of other great actors, many of whom are nominated and rewarded by the Academy. And occasionally in the film there is a moment that shines greatly, but always excludes a stupid story about window blinds. Unfortunately, it's too much of the curtains, so the film slows down. Many deductions are long and made from one point of view of the camera, adhering to slow pacing and lack of interest in watching. why the viewers are essentially as soon as the action comes into focus, which makes it pretty fast. It really does not sound like fun watching and I tell you it's not fun to watch.
