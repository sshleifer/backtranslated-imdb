There is no reason to watch this movie. A good idea of ​​land is very bad. Everything changes in the middle of the film, and from there nothing makes sense. The reason for the killings has not been clarified. The acting is terrible. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. He was great in the bedroom, but here he is terrible. Amber Benson of Buffy, one day has to change her character. Even those of you who enjoy free sex and violence will be disappointed. Although the film lasted for 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this movie), there are no deleted scenes on the DVD, which means they have never tried to fill the missing parts with the characters. /> Do not waste time on this.
