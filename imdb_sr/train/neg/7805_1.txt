The first actor's movie is usually something you can afford to miss - it's often the first job where the lack of film experience of all involved is really shown, and this film is no exception. that even until 1982 it was so bad that it was hysterically ridiculous. Shotted entirely in the Chicago area on an apparently small budget, the majority of the acting of the entire actor is rigid, woody and cartoon - a cross between high school and poor theater in the community. Noise from nearby traffic often suppresses dialogue, and the dialogue is really bad, very declarative in a way that is forced and quick, not natural and organic. The scenes are fictitious and thrilled, and even though the characters go through a period of several years, neither children nor adults do not become at all. I believe it is possible to make a Christian movie that is a tasty large, secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on the 'message' or in this case, their autobiographical links to the project that they are good film productions values ​​rejected. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and a member of the acting team.) Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting and convincing to watch in his later films. Careers like him have certainly not been built on such films.
