The action is so manipulative, that it fully counts on the most unlikely and unpredictable decisions of adults in every parent's decision. Children are great about charm and delivery of lines, but as I said, the whole plot depends on whether each adult is complete idiots, and therefore in that case, more sense than their actions (and at the same time it is the only way to explain boys who act on total distrust). Why would the charming little boys take the baby from the shore? How did the baby get to the shore and at the same time explained that it was the LAST place to search? Why would not two boys NEVER be informed instead at the same time as the baby is missing? There simply is no justification for the audience to ask for it to believe. Seeking to believe that it will then be at trial (even an informal environment) is too offensive for nakedness.
