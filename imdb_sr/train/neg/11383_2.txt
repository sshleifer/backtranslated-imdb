This is a really horrible "B" movie. It's foolish and often shameful. The plot, the basic routine of "turning into a show business", almost does not exist. In fact, the film is just an excuse to push war effort and accentuate some of the popular 1942 music groups, including Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddie Slack. Each group gets a standard three minutes, except for the Mills brothers, who for some reason justified two numbers. Ann Miller can not dance until the last couple of minutes of the film, and she has little to do but shut her stuff in the middle of a barricade of patriotic propaganda. The most interesting moment in the film, in my opinion, occurred in the Duke Ellington segment. The band seems to be playing on the train, standing in awkward positions. (At that time in the deep south, the band was separated in a railroad car when it traveled.) Johnny Hodges was seen next to Duke, and Harri Carnei could also be identified. In the last moments of the film, the trumpet / violinist Rai Nance runs down the passage to the camera and makes "Uncle Tom", listening to his eyes and waving his head as the Best of Radio works in many films. For modern spectators, especially jazz lovers, this denial to segregation is really sad. Some movies are best seen.
