Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (cemetery), and produced by the legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now with this mix of great talent, you will think that this film would be a genuine gesture. It can not be any further. The massacre falls on his face, as one of the boring films I've seen coming out of the Italian film. In fact, I tried to be awake during the film and I never had that problem with Italian horror films. This scene was used in the Fulcius Night Concert. This is not a bad scene and it raises your expectations that the movie will be an ax in the massacre. Unfortunately, the next hour of the film is so boring. The movie goes over to a movie of horror film that is filmed and has many character development throughout all of these scenes, but the characters in the film are so boring and have behaved badly. The last 30 minutes of the movie is not so bad, but it could have been much better. The blood in the movie was pathetic and since Fulci used most of the upstairs scenes in the Nightmare concert, there was nothing new here. The end of the film left a nice turn, but there were still not many answers and the continuity was falling through the floor. It was not a very good movie, but for a true Italian horror (like me) this movie had to have because it was very rare. 4/10 stars
