At first glance, this movie has everything that a psychiatrist wants: a story about a vampire with "not under 18" restrictions, filled with hyper-violence, drugs, blood, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatic zealots, and even gai necrophilicem cop ! But then, this film is a series of bad stories (so thin), bad acting - with a funny English accent that tells you to believe that you're watching a bad Monti Pithon, bad music (hard rock 80s), shooting is terrible, the end is right shame ... plus scenes of sex are funny, the gore is not very impressive. And those vampires are reflected in the mirror, and there is no fear of daylight! You can be very disappointed, unless you see it as "Space Mutini" or "Troll 2". I hope that Krvavica will one day reach the bottom 100, because that is its rightful place. I would say that it is still fun to watch, if you have friends and enough beer. 3/10
