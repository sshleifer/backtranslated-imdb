In fact, the movie is neither a horror nor an Sci-Fi. With a very strong Christian religious theme, this film brings minimal content and no uncertainty. Actors of the second order work half decent jobs reading boring roles. The only good performance is Sydney Penny, who plays the role of mother ... I will not spoil the movie, it's either Christ or Anti-Christ. Avoid watching this movie if you are not a Christian religious fanatic obsessed with the apocalypse. It is a pity that the Sci-Fi channel had to broadcast this film at the peak of the evening.
