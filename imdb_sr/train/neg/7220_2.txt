Where do they get money for such films? I mean, nothing can be used for this movie. None of the actors are known, the writing is terrible, the photo is blurred, the story is wandering between the bad version of the repo man and the nickelodeon of the west and the acting is incredible. For someone looking at all kinds of films, good and bad, I must admit that this film is the worst I've seen since the attacks of people around the 50's. I really do not like to ruin the efforts of people who try to create some kind of entertainment or, God forbid, art, but this movie does not seem to attract anyone. The story bends on the mystical contamination of a person who is a bad version of the Celtic soul, although it functions more like a male succumb without a sexual tone. The bad guys have to get together with the good guys in a city where they can not escape. Take it from here because this, unfortunately, is the best part. My advice is that, unless you are in bad mythology, amateur writing, unconvincing acting and tedious settings, it will best serve you by leaving this on the shelf when renting videos.
