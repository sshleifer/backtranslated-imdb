By imbibing a long title, the film finds ways to approach the 90's. Beautiful sets are here with everything that made Hammer's production a valuable brand, yet Paris is sunk into the fog is a sign of indolent neglect. The story is obvious and can be summarized in a dozen words, so nothing comes unexpectedly and nothing worth more than 5% of your attention. The director is tough as a direct transfer from a scene game, the actors are mostly rigid as wax figures (okay this is a Hamer function, it's just sometimes better shown in the whole package). My conclusion: this film is garbage, it's not worth the time I spend that evening. Eternal life is a boring thing and I should have hoped that people who are in charge of programming in Cinemathekue would be better informed.
