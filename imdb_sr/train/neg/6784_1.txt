I tried to watch this movie twice, and even then quickly flipping over irritating parts, but I still could not get through the end. I think that these people who give such good reviews only try to promote the film for marketing purposes. Their reviews look very unrealistic and seem to be an internal business, making things poor. Movies should get real positive comments on their own pair, not on fictitious ones! The act resembled a siren porn movie, not in a funny way. I do not mind movies with a low budget with bad behavior if they know how to work with it. I discovered that the main character is irritating. His expression of face and humor were unbearably childish. I thought it was deliberate to make the female conspiracy seem more pleasant and well-founded, but it was even worse. The script was also very inconvenient (his bosses overstepped his business speeches) and frivolous sarcastic remarks. I did not find anything that could be said about this movie except for some attractive women. I am interested in her premise, but frightened of everything else. Of course, look if you want, but I just did not want anyone else to realize my hope. Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
