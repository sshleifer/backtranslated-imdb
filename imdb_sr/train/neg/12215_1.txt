In what I can say, it was the stealing of my time when they took me to see this movie and I must say what a terrible experience. Fai Ann Lee is a horrible actress and is inconceivable in this movie. Larrijoe76 is an obvious critic. The plot is the smallest, the Cantonese dialogue is not ridiculous. Watch this movie at your peril. David Tang from Shanghai Tang should watch the movie because of the little or no income that this movie will create. The banal shop attempts to compete with other roms, and it just fits into the scene. It was like looking at dry paint. In short, this film was a total waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on iTunes.
