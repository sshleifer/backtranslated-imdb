I never thought I was watching a movie worse than "Lisa Picard is famous," but this is pretty close. As is often repeated during comments, it was predictable; Five minutes in the movie you know you will be trapped on an altered outcome. This film painfully mentions / discovers everything from "Something About Mary" to "Pink Panther Revenge". Writer Greg Glienna (Meet Parents) needs new material. The only turning point is a disturbed boyfriend / cop who is led by internal jobs, but even that opportunity is lost. Many images taken in a space needle in Seattle need to hide the obvious Canadian shooting site. Some of the worst rides in automobile scenes without any effort to conceal the fact that the car is dragging through the city on a trailer. Jesus, at least turn the steering wheel or put brakes once for a while. Selma Blair is an inert and a short hairstyle is a crime. $ 3M Jason Lee, for what? I guess he's winning skateboarding! So, here's who should see this movie: Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors singing 'Islands in the Stream' bad; People who can not get enough Julie Stiles. 1/10
