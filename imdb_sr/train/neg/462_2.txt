This has to be almost as one of the worst movies of all time. Terrible acting, horrible script ... and that was good stuff! One to definitely miss! Jokes, if you can call them that way, they were so predictable that they were pathetic. Pamela Anderson still rely on her body to dissuade her from the fact that her acting is just as plastic! I sat down willing to give her a chance, hoping that it would improve, which, unfortunately, was not! If it was a choice between this and the book, I suggest you calm down for good reading! I like Denise Richards, which is why I gave this movie, but why did she let herself throw in this movie is beyond me!
