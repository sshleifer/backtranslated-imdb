The girl's girlfriend is denounced to bring her back to life. Frankly, this is a film plot. He tried to bring her another body searching through the terrible area of ​​the city for that perfect body. For some reason, it looks ugly in the wardrobe in his cabin. The sweet film style is ridiculous. Nobody in the movie can play. The monster in the closet is a man with a bound mask and you can say. The action is slow, weak and the end is so bad. See Misteri Science Theater 3000 version of this move. Believe me, people would not watch this movie alone.
