'Fok and the Child' is the new film by French director Luc Jackuet, who brought us an Oscar-documentary 'March of the Penguins'. She focuses on a young girl (beautifully played by Bertilla Noel-Bruneau) and her pleasant friendship with a fox. There are some truly fascinating moments here; badgers who are trying, a lynx that catches foxes through a snow-covered forest; One scene especially when the fox is struck by wolves is quite intense and sometimes scary. However, they simply are not enough. Beautifully photographed; Cinema is great. The witty look of the movie is wonderful. It is indisputable that it is a very lush production. The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet, but the little bit that has already been the dialogue is very badly called. The result is too overwhelming, or at least for me; and the script, while subtle, seems to jump from one scenario to another, eventually leaving me almost confused. Pretty nice, true star is fox. These amazing moments that focus exclusively on our furry little buddy are huge. However, again, it's simply not enough. - To keep up to date with the latest movies, including reviews, news, discussions and more, be sure to visit vvv.miblurai. com.au
