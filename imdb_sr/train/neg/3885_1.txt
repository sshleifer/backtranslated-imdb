This film was not only bad - it was horrible. After I watched it, I actually felt the need to SOUSE SOIL to get rid of dirt from myself. There is a running 'gag' with the older couple, which is, it's not funny, but it's disgusting. The monster was cool, but that's all. Only continuing mistakes will make you angry - at least I was. Editing is very bad. Almost everything else you could do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends is in "bad movies", this is exceptional in its inability, I could not even laugh about it. You are warned.
