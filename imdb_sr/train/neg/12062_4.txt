When it comes to combinations of big directors and actors on the J team. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson are not usually mentioned. Probably because the emergence of nine joint ventures between them two moves the scale from really good action entertainment to the central one. Unfortunately, Kignite: Forbidden subjects fall into this other. It's sad because the Kins could be much better. But for my life, I do not understand why it took father to disappear a Japanese girl, a guy who used some cheap joy, because the romance in his marriage expired. It may have been good for another movie, but it did not make sense here. Simple police drama with Charles Bronson as a vice-policeman who has seen too much in his business and has strong prejudices against the Orientalists. That part could also explain a bit. But he will have to overcome him if he and the patient Perry Lopez find a jailed Japanese scholar. Bronson's time in the deputy was exactly told where to look for the kidnappers. A stylish killer macro playing Jaime Fernandez is a guy, and he and Bronson have some history. In fact, on the best scene of the movie, Bronson forced him to eat expensive watches and burn his car. His role snack, he sprays a place with Uzi who kills everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that this little incident would have more than a couple of vice-policemen from LAPD after Fernandez. But this is another terribly big hole in the soil. There is still extremely crude justice for Fernandez. I wish the whole movie was better. This was the latest film by Bronson Thompson's team and last director J. Lee Thompson. He should have come out with something better.
