This is a strange sexual comedy, because it has very little comedy, but a lot of sex, most of which take place in the back of the car, and it's so graphically that it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like the release of TELETUBBIES. I do not kid you, sex in this movie is so in your face that it can only strangle you, especially if you are watching with your grandfather. As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO there is nothing else worth mentioning except for the language where each sentence seems to contain the word F. This pretty gloomy hyper-realistic British film shot at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British films that explains how it was made for television.
