This film talks about a group of extra-earth gay niggers who exterminate females on Earth to create a gaius universe. I watched him intent to see how bad it was. Still, I was shocked at how bad it was. It looked more like a movie made 50 years ago. The act, if at all, is ultra-bad. Kits and props are so absurdly fake that every movie in the college makes a mega budget. Special effects are ridiculously simple, the jaws really fall as others commented, but the jaw drops intermittently. \ T When I was from Denmark, I would be very confused and humiliated that my compatriots produced such a terribly bad movie.
