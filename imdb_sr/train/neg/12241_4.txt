This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an unquestionable mistake in telling the story. While working on the Ralphie situation, Christopher says he heard about the death of Pie-O-Mi in a fire. This is an important detail, because in this context, it is quite obvious that Christopher from the beginning knows that Tony is the one who surely killed Ralphie. However, there is no way Chris heard of the accident. Who should have told him when and when? Until the moment when Tony's call was taken out of delirium, nobody else was informed. Tony knows that - which makes him worse! Having heard Christopher talk about Pie-O-Me's death, he could only bring Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself had planted a fire. Given the impressively elaborated writing process, as the writers themselves said on DVD, I really wonder that none of them understood the problem there. The story simply does not work that way. It is not necessary to add that I am a great fan of Sopran. Otherwise, I would certainly not care.
