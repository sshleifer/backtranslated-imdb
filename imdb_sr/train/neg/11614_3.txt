The lady in cement is a real course on social anthropology of the late 60's. Writing, not acting, is at the center of attention. Did I say - clean camp! Prepare to offend if you are female or gay. Wide and ladies are standard terms, and gai baiting and bashing are represented for what they were during the day (in the camp). Most of the lines were discarded, although it has wonderful performances of a very small number of prominent art actors. Action scenes are terrestrial, but it's fun to see how Dan Blocker plays a powerful guy who loves to hit. And Lanie Kazan and Rakel Welsh are at the sumptuous height of their career. It is amazing to note that they both had 28 years and a year. Sinatra was 53 years old. . . Were there any points? Well, you've got a point. Watch out with friends who want a good laugh. It's full of them.
