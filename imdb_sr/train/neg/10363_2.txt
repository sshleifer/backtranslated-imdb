I grew up to cover the intertwined stories of Chronicle of Boron in time. My dream was that one day the screenwriter would come across their child sitting on a large sofa reading Winkle and Time, and he would think of what an incredible movie would do. Unfortunately, it is enough for the scriptwriter to fail, changing characters, throwing humorous humor and destroying the plot. I know it's a tough job to change a loved novel into a movie. But why can not you stay a faithful book? Why do you need to change the way in which the characters think and act? For those who have not read the book, pick it up, find a soft sofa and let your imagination at will.
