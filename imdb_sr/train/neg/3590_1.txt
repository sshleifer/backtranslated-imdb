How low can he sink while trying to regain old glory? ST: HF will gladly show you. If you're used to seeing what they've done for a good Star Trek show, DO NOT watch this. Writing is brilliant-Additions, the acting portraits of their characters are weak, and most of all, the design work is completely a puppy. Like looking at a strong captain, do not look here! As a strong attitude of the Federation? Forget about it here! The Starfleer is mocking the bearers carrying the spikes in their hair. While the seemingly mentally weak captain changes around himself and within two minutes of the loan for the show, the Spikei spokesman tries to arrange a meeting with the engineer. Just degrading from there. No, even uniforms do not correspond, for God's sake. They are too small or too large, collar to the chest, and the LPG Seasons One and Tvo Uniforms are mixed with the seasons of the three and DS9 uniforms. Strict discipline and the tradition of any originality that is missing in this production is all the way to the tire! The only good thing in this show is its graphics, which seems to improve slightly every season. All right, I'm taking it back. Who uses CG that is insecure? Designers of this show. Do not bother with it, it will offend your sense of Star Trek, like mine. Even the return to previous shows can not save this disaster. I was crying openly when I was watching this, probably because my eyes bleed and my head is almost broken. So bad.
