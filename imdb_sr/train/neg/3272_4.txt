I will say one thing about this film: there is no slack. You can not bother watching this. The problem is that it's too intense. It's too much action and it's time to calm down! That's the risk you take in modern action movies. You want to be interesting, but not excessive. Although the acting is fine and has several "names" in Garry Busei and Roi Scheider, he still has the feeling of "B" of the film. The best part of this is Scheider's dialogue: the only "A" part of this "B" movie. The rest of the story is a strictly Rambo mentality, but he had several prominent scenes. One was especially an innovative mining scene. That was unforgettable. There were not enough other scenes to make it a guard for a long time.
