I tried to love this movie. Looking at him, all I can imagine is: "This guy gives me a damn, I get a ban on admission." It also invokes the COURT in capital letters. Was this really a conversation before filming? "Let's make a movie that puts two chronically depressing, socially incompetent people into a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" From what I've seen in my life, the last thing on earth that we find appealing to a potential partner is constant self-pity. The mood of the movie is distinctively 80-ish; calm and slow. Do not misunderstand me, the movie has its moments, only a few of them.
