When we were in high school, some of us boys would occasionally start with stinkbombs. Then it was considered ridiculous. But the producers, directors and actors of "Semana Santa" ("The Death Angel" in the DVD section of your local video rental) have grown up and they are sending them. As the previous reviewer who wondered if actors wanted to leave the set and at home, I doubt that more than one was done for any scene. Mira Sorvino, hot in "Powerful Aphrodite" and other top movies, seems to have sold this project alone. Her acting does not exist, it is mostly limited to imaginary views that should indicate how much she is "sensitive" to the situation of various victims of the film. But let me warn you - do not be the next victim! Get out of the DVD if you find it on the shelf. Tbere are not many good footage of the Miras (the only high points I could find in the movie), and the auxiliary acting setting is of poorer quality, delivering a mess of poor dialogue with the shameful "Spanish" accents worthy of the best high school theater production.
