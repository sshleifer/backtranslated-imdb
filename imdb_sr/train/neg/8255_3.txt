At least not full of frivolous violence or hair. It's also not a lot of thought or a smooth story. This story had a certain potential, but the director seems to have lost the place where it is green. The story is unconnected and goes in strange directions, without conclusions. I also do not believe that the director spent much time around the golf club. Some of the views are absurd. Not really interesting.
