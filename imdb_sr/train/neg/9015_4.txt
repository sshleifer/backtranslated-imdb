The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are completely acceptable and surprisingly visible. The characters are convincing and interesting. The cloning laboratory looks really high-tech. After that everything collapses. The characters begin to behave idiotic, and the new underground part does not appear anywhere in the fusion reactor (and this is supposedly "today's day") that goes critically, the only justification that is to conclude that it is necessary to kill the dragon - it does not do it . The ending is incredibly weak. You wonder what a film that was so good started to turn so badly. All characters except Dean Cain play Russians. This results in some strange situations and details, such as the character Vessel Dimitrov plays "Bailey Kent" despite his hard accent (and in spite of her, on one occasion, unexplained transition to * Spanish *!). Due to a decent start, I was thinking about evaluating this film 5, but it was really disappointing, so I just gave it 4.
