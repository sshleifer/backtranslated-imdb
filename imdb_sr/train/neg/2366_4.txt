I'm a fan of the Nightmare series, but this is terrible. Deaths are so modern. If you look 20 years later, the entire Nintendo scene is obsolete. I like flashbacks. I think we should only make the occasion when he was still alive. That would be more interesting. This is a movie that you can take or leave. It depends on how much free time you have.
