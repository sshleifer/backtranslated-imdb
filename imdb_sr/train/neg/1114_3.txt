At this time of the day and incredible special movie effects, this was a very disappointing. The actors seemed stiff and uninspired, as did the dialogue. Hollywood's Westerners are not a common occurrence these days, but movies such as "Silverado" prove that someone else still knows how to make a good one. In view of this, it is hard to imagine that anyone would ever go to any cost in liberating, and even less so, to creating such a bad movie as this one. If you love and are looking for a good west, keep looking!
