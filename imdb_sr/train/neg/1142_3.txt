You were nasty and beaten under my sharp statements about the movies "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals"! Now there is another race in the disappointing rediscoveries: ninja movies! Many of the ones I've seen before, and let me tell you, are not everything that should have been! Usually, they do not hold a point. This, among other things, has no originality! What does the ninja have to do with preventing the Holocaust in Russia? Should not that be a film about "martial arts"? Do many shootings sound like an incredible action movie? Is blood the number one reason to love this to death? Would you like to spend some of your hard-earned cash through a lady singing in her transparent tank top? The answers to these important questions are found in MISSION NINJA, which should be in the martial arts section of your video store. For even more meaningless ninjas, try checking those Godfrey Ho movies that are released by Transworld. You get what you deserve, and that's the promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja drug addicts!
