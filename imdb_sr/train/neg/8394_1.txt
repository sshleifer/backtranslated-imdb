Apparently this is the Z-movie DTV Horror. But with lines like: "It's easy to die, I have, many times" <br /> <br /> "Why are you reading this book ? " "Because it makes the plot more interesting" </ strong> <br /> <br /> <b> "You've reached here, now you can get out again! "(after leading a man to the basement) (and listen to what they sing) - it's not clear what this movie, made in an era known for poststructuralism, actually, or it's just a bad movie. The acting is terrible, but some actors I know, are they banned? The old house, apparently with a modern apartment, is a place of murder. , and the story recurs again.
