If you hope ANITHING nev, you have chosen the wrong movie. Who can think that a movie that is a virtual reproduction of its predecessors can be good. Maybe the producer and maybe the director, but I hope they were not serious when they did this thing. The whole of this movie is like making DVDs of the biggest hits of the first 3 films, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
