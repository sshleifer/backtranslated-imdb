A stupid, mindless move around an airplane made up within an hour by mechanics who never worked on planes (piloted by Burgess Meredith) in pursuit of a Porsche racing car that has been working for decades in the old petrol sludge, driven by Lee Majors and Chris Makepeace as technologically escaped - who can plug McGiver spare parts into a radio receiver that can simultaneously pick up all the frequencies, and who in some way learned how to procure and use chemicals to create high explosives in perfect peace society. Like moronic, it sounds. The terrible loss of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can at least be forgiven on the basis that it was only his second film.
