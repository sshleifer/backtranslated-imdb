(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "actioner" (and I use the term looseli) that I've been trying to watch over a year. I finally came to an end and now I would like that I did not repeat the effort. In an attempt to save two hours of your life, I will tell you that a guy who has the ability to pull the long blade from his hand cried, he is returning home to see his mother. Things get ugly after being beaten by a mafia boyfriend's old friend. Get back to the guy when he brings the girl home. The mother of the mob sends her men to revenge, while the police begin to search for him. Very little is said. No explanation is really given for anything (such as locking an id-girl in asylum) and action, mostly out of the screen. The movie essentially consists of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody who looks intensely and does not say anything, killing people (out of the screen - most of the action is happening outside the screen). It looks good, it behaves well and there was some form of reason for what's happening, it might have been a good movie. Damn, I would like some sense to develop the true character or the story's return (all we know is that the guy was buried as a kid). The film lasts for more than two hours and looks like it's his six. If they did not say anything to us, they could at least raise the rhythm so it seemed to move too fast. No, instead, we'll get the hero on board. The hero on the bus, the walking hero, the hero looks troubled. That was really annoying because I think this could have been a good movie that they simply did something or someone actually said something meaningful, except to instruct them to "catch this guy." 4 out of 10 About four hours (all my attempts to see this) I will never return. Only for those who want to see a peaceful Russian action movie with very little action
