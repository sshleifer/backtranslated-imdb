This movie was rented by a friend. Her choice is usually good. First I read the cover and I expected a good movie. Although it was a horror movie. What I do not like. But no horror occurred when I was watching a movie. It was a boring, not a fun movie. The appearance of Denise Richards was once again a pleasure for the eye. But that's it. We (four of us) are a bit disappointed. But feel free to watch this movie and evaluate it yourself.
