I saw this film in the early preview, and I can not say enough about how bad this film was to me. From the very beginning, the audience groaned over Pacin's terrible southern accent. Poor Al looked really, really exhausted, and I can not decide whether it is deliberately part of his role as a publicist of drug addicts, or maybe he just did not fall asleep before coming to the recording. Much worse than Pacin's close-ups, however, is a poor pretext for conspiracy. Early in the film we have indications that Pacin is a gay guy, and I presume that this is what the scriptwriter originally envisioned. Later, however, we should suspend our disbelief and we believe that Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both are squinting through poor roles) of lust for this older, half-dead, female man with a ridiculous accent. The worst part as a whole was the main dash, which had to do with some corporate espionage that was never fully explained, and we have never had the least worry. Since this was a review, I will keep my final judgment for the possibility of re-recording and editing, but you can bet that I will not pay a cent to see it in the movies.
