During the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was something like a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in his position get the film roles that exist only in order to use it. I have no idea what Tomas was paid to make this film, but I would have to pay a large pile of money to agree to make a national fool of myself in the movie. The film was apparently derived from "Enter the Dragon", as well as most of the martial arts. Instead of real martial arts, they invented the absurd new martial arts, which one critic precisely described as "the cross between Kung Fu and break dancing." The gymnast (Thomas, of course) is engaged to save a lady from a bulletproof fortress, but each room has a backing that is exactly what Thomas needs to get out of the assistants. Of course, he also fights for a leading scapegoat, and of course, have a fancy-day fight, with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a Marshall artistic film. There are touches that will appeal to nostalgic types, especially the hair styles of Thomas and many of the male stars. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you are angry at Kurt Thomas, who now wants you never made a movie set.
