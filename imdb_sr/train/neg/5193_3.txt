Another turquoise action / adventure from Kuinn Martin Productions. Roi Thinnes plays the hidden agent Diamond Head (Mr. Head for you), working for his G-Man handler "Aunt Mari", looking for the "Tree" on the mission ... well, just watch the movie. This is earned and got full MST3K sendup. As boys and various reviewers pointed out, the film "Fargo" had more Hawaiian locations than this movie. Apparently shot with a poor budget, this movie highlights Hawaiian sold shops, gas stations and cheap hotels. Zulu - who later became the Star of Cono in Hawaii - Five-O - appears as Thinnes's bulky, incompetent assistant, while France Nguien modeling Jenny Craig's diet is terribly wrong. Others acting on the flicker screen are drunken Richard Harris, an imitator George Takai, not a very smart hit man with scattered Sansabelt pants, and a scoundrel "Tree" that deals with the British accent. You can pretty much grasp the land halfway through the initial loans, but relax - enjoy the dizzy mid-size 70s movie. Whenever I think about this movie (and I often think about this film), I catch myself as a buzzing theme written for a flute and a tube ... nobody knows why. Trivia Notes - The diamond head was directed by Jeannot Szvarc, one of the three contract director in the Universe who would continue to make much bigger films, in his case Javs 2. The rest were John Badham (Rat) and young Steven Spielberg ...
