Contrary to the other reviewer, I think that it is well written, especially as it is more fictitious, because it would require greater imagination; and he acted well, because there were no other characters with whom the focus of these ten minutes would be shared and well-done monologues. But I do not have fun with such serious, pious memories. Everyone has a story to tell, and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems, and some are more intense than others. These are just ten, not just atypical stories and problems, which illustrate how any life (or part of it) is food for the film. And again, I think TV shows are not very good. So, if it's your bag, you may like this. It's kind of stuff that would be good for phone and / or internet gossip; but absolutely without another verbal action. And although each of the speakers is female, I will leave the genus from this.
