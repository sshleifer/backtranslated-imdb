This is a movie that's bad in every way possible. Of course we like to know what happened 12 years since the last movie, and it works on some level. But new characters are simply not interesting. Babi Melodi is terribly terrible! Unfortunately, while the logic that people can not always keep under water remains, another basic physical logic is ignored. It's cold if you do not have cold weather clothes if you are in the Arctic. I do not know why most of the comments here return Jafar is even worse, I thought this was more terrible.
