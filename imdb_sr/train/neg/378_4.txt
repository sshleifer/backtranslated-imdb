... but the keyword is "usually". I know that I love films that everyone thinks are stupid. But in the world of B-rated movies, THIS IS Z-rating. Absolutely funny. What I respect with most of my favorite B movies is that they do not take it too seriously. Producers of such films treat the film lightly, even if it is a difficult topic. There is an impression, however, that the producers of this film took themselves seriously, as if they were composing a 10-star star, complete with bad attempts on moving lines and stupid recordings. Nevertheless, despite all this, I WAS SINGLE one 4 out of 10 stars, because I'm inclined to such films. However, if you are a fan B rating, I would rather try to find it.
