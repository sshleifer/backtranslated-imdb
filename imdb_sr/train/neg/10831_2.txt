I suppose that this director / writer had something to say. Let's see what could have been ... a. Frogs would be creepy? b. Can I get someone like Tom Cruise to say "C" many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? c. Throw my wife and make her pronounce the word "F" every 2 seconds. This aside, I liked the beginning and storm of frogs. The rest was merciless, long-lasting (insufficiently arranged), overly indulgent failure. I'm glad that many of you enjoyed it! <br /> <br />
