Cruel, sometimes rude - I am summing up the latest work of Madhur Bhandarkar - Page 3. He has no point of view - only shallow, funny copies of stereotypes. What is the movie about ?? Whether it's about reporting a clan of people (the so-called guys) who are so busy with socializing and progressing their profiles in life-that they do not have time for anything else. And you are either in or out of it. Is there no news at all to report everyday incident? Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there are major newspapers and that it is just an add-on; Maybe an entertainer to check who is who and what is what. Do not mix two. And then there is a power of power - which would have happened in every step of life. So, what you said at the end of everything - nothing - just a few rude jokes related to the otherwise smaller film.
