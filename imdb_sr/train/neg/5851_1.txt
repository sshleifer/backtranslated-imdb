I doubt that Jigsaw was at that time even that the entire LSD was a theme for the mystery of murder, an apparent apparent attempt to capture a young audience of the time, and at the very least it did not show any understanding of the 1960s counterculture. Apart from the aspect, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including an overwhelming acting, dull and stiff dialogue, LSD flashbacks stretching in indelible length even after the point was knocked home in the first 60 seconds, a failure to create the truth of the truth even though the real idea was , on paper, a great tool for it, and a place that is so banal and predictable (not to mention many bad TV shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. If it was a better movie, we might be able to suspend disbelief in several things that would help ease it, but the weaknesses are so obvious that they only serve to highlight the incredibility that otherwise viewers might ignore. I saw the Jigsaw on TV and it is definitely a nighttime dinner in TV designed to fill the airspace and pass the time to kill someone's insomnia, not something that anyone should actively seek. At best, three out of ten.
