Chemical spill turns people into zombies. Two doctors can survive the epidemic. This is Andreas Schnaas film, so you know who the par is for the course. Bad acting, horribly terrible special effects, and no budget for talking. Shooting is ridiculous with a big R and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write one word about this feces, and even less than a dozen compulsory because of the guidelines given to me by IMDb. My original overview of just one word: Shit would not fly so I have to revisit it and go more to how bad it is. But I do not know if I can, so ... wait, I think I can have enough words, or words, not to make this assessment. What's cool, I guess. So, summation: This film is a shit ball, do not watch it. <br /> <br /> My Rating: F
