This film was fine, but it surely wins the claim that homosexuals are "born in this way", especially when a woman can get out of an unhappy marriage and simply fall into the hands of another woman. It almost seems as though Kate's gender preferences were turned on and off as a switch, making this film a bit simpler. that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval of gay lifestyles were labeled "bigots". And there was no happy media. Or Kate's friends and relatives hugged her completely or completely avoided her. This is not typical of the interactions between gay and non-gay relatives and friends. It is usually a mixture of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect, without necessarily approving the choices they bring. Unfortunately, the film did not show any of these types of interactions. For a movie that tries to show tolerance and acceptance, it has turned out to be a very intolerant movie! Then in the end, Kate obviously decides after all these years that she wants to be with Mac and that everything is fine - is what really is gay? Come on!
