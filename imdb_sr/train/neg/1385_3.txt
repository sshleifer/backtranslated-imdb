"Hak Hap", or "Black Mask" (in English) was a disappointment. I'm told that this is some kind of "Japanese version of Matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The film was either badly named or a sound recording did not go well with the movie. The other thing is that the dialogue was pretty bad. There was very little thought about the English version of this film and attracted only a genre of "senseless actions". Not a movie that I would like to see again.
