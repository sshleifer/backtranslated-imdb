This show is painful to watch ... It's obvious that creators had no idea what to do with this show, from constantly changing "jobs", boys and actors. Apparently they wanted to throw Amanda Baines into something ... but they had no idea what, and they came to this shit. They threw her like a teenager, surrounded twenty-thirty times, and put into the situation of mostly adults the unsuccessful unsuccessful comedy attempts. They soon realize that she needs a "click" and throws people in the late twenties to try to pass as teenagers. How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me. Somehow, ABC now decided it was a "family" show, and threw it into the afternoon of the ABC family.
