This is a really bad movie. I broke my brain and I can not make any positive comments. The acting is terrible. I've seen more convincing performance on cable access. The action is ridiculous. The stolen diamonds, the secret record of the president, and the shark that attacks everything that approached him was supposed to make for cheerful entertainment in the worst case. The night of Aikul is not so bad that it's good. The dialog sounds and is delivered as if it was written a few seconds before it was recorded. And finally, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I'm surprised that my ears did not start bleeding from the techno-synthesized 80s sounds that somebody actually recorded. Sharks are like the last nail in the suitcase.
