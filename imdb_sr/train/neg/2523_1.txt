Shoot the masters. Grotesque scary. Endless; Totally and extremely worst movie ever made. Replaces "Pluto's Adventures" as the worst film of all time. I hate this extremely inactive, unregistered, unsigned, unmerited, unproved mess of things called "Robot Jok" - and I just found out - they made the other one!?!? I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for the hatred of her movies. This mess of things makes these films just bad - it's not terribly terrible and grotesque as this thing. This is the only movie I've ever said - REMOVE IT FROM NETFLIKS - NEW !!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this review helpful.
