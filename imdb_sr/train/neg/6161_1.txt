This is perhaps the worst fence, fight swords, a movie ever made. This is not only because the so-called sports fencing is poor, but because the plot, the characters are so weak that they have to throw themselves in the naked naked sex scene, and later, the alleged group that dances around the swordsmanship scene at the fencing club, I suppose to keep the public's interest. What a loss of talent F. Murraia Abraham. You better be with too many movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, everything Basil Rathbone was a bad guy. As a swordsman, I recognize almost the impossibility of shooting fencing as a movie on the film, but if it ever happens, it must have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.
