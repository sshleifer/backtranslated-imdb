This movie is hardly good, it's not good at all. A few unforgettable scenes and an unhappy selection of pairing Norma Jean with the current actress. Jane Russell has everything for her, Marilyn's smaller woman and / or actress. One can only wonder why this is considered one of the peaks of her sullen career. 3/10
