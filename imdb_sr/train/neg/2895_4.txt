The premise of this film is revealed on a DVD box. A textile worker develops a miraculous fabric that does not degrade. But the movie does not work out. Instead, he packs 45 minutes, kneeling the preamble before making a big discovery. Since audiences do not benefit much from watching a big kid thinking about things, this is a strange choice: the movie has been successfully prevented from incorporating any topic. When the fabric is discovered, the film suddenly establishes that both industrial workers and workers in blue collar want the invention to swing, leaving a film with only two weak movements; inventing a chemical, and running from the oppressor. I can not understand why someone would describe it as a comedy. The tone is not ridiculous or ridiculous. It's more like a serious social criticism of days: capitalism also changes supply chain and production. What in turn prevents innovation to reach and improve the world. Yes, that's probably true, but without anyone playing with the attitude toward that fact, the film is just a serious argument. You need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find it here. This is more like a British meeting with John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
