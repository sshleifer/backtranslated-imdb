Only the most overwhelming fan DORIS DAI could find this even tolerable to watch. When considering the wealth of material available for the story of the city's best-known disintegration, a film that could deal with numerous real stories about what people have to deal with, it creates the bottom of the bar because of the lack of Doris is once again bitter because she doubts she could to be compromised on the night she disappeared when she returned to her apartment in Connecticut, took a sleeping beverage and woke up in the morning with a man who did the same, mistakenly wandering into the house. No one can save this mess - not Doris, not ROBERT MORSE, TERI-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT. As Hi Averback directed, it's the weakest vehicle Dan found, dedicated to making a movie for men's sorrow and can not get out of it. A pity.
