This Italian movie from the '70s is not even in class with dog soldiers, screaming, or even that horrible American insect in Paris, or ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the main actress, the stunning blonde, to be angry in the birthday party. We are talking about graphics, complete nudity ... it is obvious that the real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is a rush, SFKS is childish, and acting (mostly) stinks. The only redemption value of this film is everything (and there is also LOT) nakosty and sex scene. It's dark in HBO standards, but it's still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. OK ... Here is SPOJLER ... There is no Werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine (??) ancestors. The girl just imagines that the inferno ... in other words, Clinical Lycanthropus.
