- The film opens with a meteor falling into the lake. Without the knowledge of the local population, the dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake. The meteor warmed the lake, transforming it into a huge incubator. You have guessed, the egg is lying on the liberating dinosaur that continues to terrorize the community. - What a bum. It's not that I care about the dinosaur from the stop-motion clay, that's all about the film that bother me. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is extremely funny. Comic relief is just not a comic. Logic does not exist. Any similarity between "scientists" in this film and the real scientist is quite coincidental. I could continue the whole eternity on the bad aspects of this film, but you get an idea. I think it's pretty safe to call this catastrophe "MST3K worthy".
