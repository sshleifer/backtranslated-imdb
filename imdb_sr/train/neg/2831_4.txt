I've seen it recently with my husband and found that it's better than Caine believes, although that's not a very cop. The UK's greatest actor who has ever been on the scene does not seem too interested in this role, which is a shame he might have raised with more conviction in his playing. Rek Harrison seems even less upset, perhaps not surprised, because his character is very badly written. Villiam Holden is better, but his time on the screen is transient and, again, his character is not well scripted. Beverly Johnson is a beautiful woman as I've ever seen, but given very little work, the movie may have gotten much by focusing more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but essentially playing a comic character is quite unsuited to the serious tone of the film. The music is bad, and Omar Sharif makes one of his senseless cameo (his career is based on it for decades). Richard Fleischer must be blamed for not directing this, he was a film director, and that's one of his weaker films.
