It is unnecessary to process and can not get closer to the original charm. The extreme length causes more than a few parts that cause a tear. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film has no style, and mostly lacks talent, not just acting, but the direction, sets, costumes, etc. There is an unusual disregard for the details of the period. Vanessa Villiams is the only actor who shows any talent, Tina Dali is not bad. They should have gone well enough. She sings well (Vanessa Villiams) for the poor (everyone else). See the original version of 1963 and skip this one. There is not much to recommend here.
