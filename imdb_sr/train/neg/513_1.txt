Burt Reinolds came to a point in his career, where he seemed to just go ahead. He would appear, entertain with his friends on the film, and take home a big salary. It did not seem important to him that the product it represents is pure shit. No single film represents this more than "Stroker Ace", which makes the "Cannonball Run" look like a classic and "Cannonball" Run II looks. In addition to several racing scenes, there's absolutely nothing which is not worth seeing here. Even beautiful Loni Anderson is as nasty as a stupid blonde that it is embarrassing. If Burt thought that it would happen with Jim Nabors and dress like chicken it sounds funny, then this is your movie. Otherwise, pick up almost any other movie comedy and there will be nothing worse.
