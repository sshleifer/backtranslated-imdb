this film is obviously done bad and hurry. I realize that it's hard to get the resources for any such film. However, if the plot had any source, someone would see that it had received the necessary funds, this was not the case, and films like this do not need themselves and have no purpose in the existing one. The action for this film has been done and done better and I could add, many times before. There is no reason to make a movie that has no chance to compete with any other. The computer told me that I need at least ten lines to submit my comment so the following lines are just a bullet for filling up space. In my opinion, there is no need to talk about this film yet. what I said is enough and if you lose enough time to read this review, then for God you do not waste more time watching this movie. The only exception in this case is a person who likes to watch shitty movies that are played on the female entertainment network at two o'clock in the morning.
