It was the worst movie I had seen at VorldFest, and after that I got the smallest applause! I can only think that this recognition is based on the number of famous actors in the film. It's great to see J.Beals, but she's just in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than he permitted. The rest of the acting is difficult to judge because the film is so funny and predictable. The main character is completely insensitive and therefore boring to watch. There is no real emotional depth of the story. A movie that revolves around an actor who can not get a job does not feel very original to me. Neither the development of a policeman. I feel like one of the many direct films I've seen in the nineties ... and even not good in those standards. <br /> <br />
