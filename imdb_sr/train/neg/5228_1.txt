I saw this movie some evening. I can not even say how this film was sucked. Writing, acting, even clay. Terrible, terrible, terrible. It's like watching the 24-hour C-Span for comedy. It just does not work. It literally falls into every possible place. Also, film animation is of very poor quality. I know this is a film made by one person, but if I think he could make 97 minutes of shit, he might be able to make at least one second of a funny one. cake for the worst movie of all time. Iikes. It was really so bad. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh, stay away from this horror. My advice: Do not buy or search for it. Your brain will be from you.
