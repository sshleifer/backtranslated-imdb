Have you ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Well, this really should not have begun. Where to Start? The weird boring scenes of our heroines who sit around the house, and in fact do not have any sense of threat or even anticipation, were created even during apparently constant storms (which are unusual never heard in the house - a lot of double glazing)? A house that is obviously just a few miles away from the city, but is a few hours away (?) Or a third girl who does not make sense for the shop, except to provide a surprisingly quick killing of bloodyness, just as anxiety becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning pointing to a flood of 20 murders in the whole area, although it's obvious that the killer never goes far from home? Or a bizarre ritual with salt and pepper, which mostly collects most of the films that are inherent in the lack of direction. Add the main actress who can not work, but at least she is ready to do something completely naked naked shower scene and this video is really nasty, but not in the way you hope. Since it is banned in the UK in the '80s (mainly due to the ultimate surprising widespread murder), it offers nothing but the values ​​of curiosity - and a classic "crazy" murder (do not worry - its telegraphy is at least ten minutes earlier). After walks in the forest our victim comes on quite steep slopes that are obviously struggling. Half the way they see a figure on top, dressed in black and waving large hair. What they are doing? Get down and run like we did? No, of course not - they fight to the top and stand perfectly well and upright in front of the weapons of murder. It's really just a movie as they say ..
