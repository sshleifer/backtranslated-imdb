Do not ask me why I was watching this! The only excuse I can say is that I'm sick of bronchitis and that I'm too weak to change the channel. :) It's too terrible for words, a movie that is not, and not for bronchitis. Operation was sad, Richard Grieco screwed him up as a serial killer who was a lucky trigger, with a tendency to discard police. Nick Mancuso telephones in the show while the policeman on his track and Nancy Allen manages to make the only cute role in the entire movie. The script is sad, baked with clich√© lines, "Are you ready, Pardner?" survives Richard Griecow to each of his victims. Dire. Avoid.
