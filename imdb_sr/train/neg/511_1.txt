I was one of a few stats of this big bomb. I was accidentally in the right place for safety to work on the scenes of the race in A.I.R. as it was then known. Thank God on my stage in the first few minutes of the movie and I do not have to sit through the whole thing. It was more than a great fun than a movie set, but hey, the salary was good. Attention to detail was not a strong point for this, but who knew it. really slow speed, then in the movie accelerated to what was close to normal speed. Many scenes were changed while they were filmed.
