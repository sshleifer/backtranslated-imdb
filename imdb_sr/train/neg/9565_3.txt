I can not say Vargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen since it had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent film I've ever seen. Not once did the plotter present itself without assuming that it was 10+ minutes ahead. There was no subtlety or anything the film did, there was no intelligence that could be seen behind the scenes. Every intent of the spoken or typed line was so obviously obvious that it was impossible to "enter" the film. I was considered laughing at the terribly deliberate line of action, and bumbled with attempts to regain the audience much more often than I enjoyed the movie.
