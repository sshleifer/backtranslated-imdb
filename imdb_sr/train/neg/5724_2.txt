I agree with the last reviewer that this film had a terrible acting. Yes, it was a lot worse and some nudity. But it was overshadowed by slow, meaningless complications and stupid ending. Where was it to be filmed: Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? The hostel was a much better movie, and I would recommend that we see it. The technical anger I had on a DVD is that if you turn off Spanish subtitles, they return after several scenes and then you must return to the main menu and turn them off again. Also, do not waste time on the deleted scene because there is no sound and it looks like a tourist clip.
