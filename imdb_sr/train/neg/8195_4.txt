Every Christmas night I made my children to submit another show "It's a wonderful life". I also enjoyed Bad Santa. Suffer me. I admit it. I love siren movies. I love both excellent, intelligent, but as with many things, diversity is a good thing. What would be the Christmas season without the annual movie ka-ching ka-ching of Santa Claus in all its forms, from Edmund Gwen to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will not forget anyone, but I do not believe a Christmas movie should reach a cult status to succeed. "Fred" is a perfectly fine vacation movie, with enough humor for adults and enough charm for children. My wife and I laughed a lot, although most of the humor was obvious, and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was a great Santa Claus, who helped a lot. It's not a great move and it's unlikely you'll have to look at it for any annual Christmas tradition. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed what was, a schmaltz holiday with a little spice handle. There's nothing wrong with that.
