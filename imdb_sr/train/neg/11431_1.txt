It is important that we are not offended by the lack of logic or common sense, and those who have any "gray matter" will agree that this movie simply does not work. choice and lack of depth in character building. The word comedy was very difficult to say when I expect to smile when these words are used. Let's look at problems in the direction / scenario. Brother and sister in the mid-thirties seems to be well-adapted. He encounters a full alien in the park, and Heather Graham approaches her and asks the most intimate questions to which half a reasonable person would run to the other side or at least scream at the police officer. He then goes awkwardly and makes some stupid statements and falls on him. Then, after a day, they all go out together and fall in love with her and decide to get married in Vegas in a week. Hello, does anybody feel stupid? He comes out with thousands of women and meets one person who says about 10 words we see on the screen and wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry, it simply makes no sense. I'm sure it's a romantic comedy and I want to believe it could, but the direction has made it perfect. a kiss or more to the extent that it was the dumbest kiss that he could be there. I found that it was irrational and immature, and while many say that Heather can not work, I think that Heather is obviously the wrong person for this role. This was Sue Kramer's debut as a director and I was too chewing for me. It should be a lot of craftsmanship for this film work and IMHO to be able to deal with better writers and casting and directing.
