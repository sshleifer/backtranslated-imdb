This direct video is another nail in the box of Rick Moranis's career. As Disnei tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of quick payment; this is a lazy renewal with Moranis that is accidentally decreasing and a few cousins ​​to be able to repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. Instant dated visual effects and messy dialogue abound with these cheerful lamers, who have done nothing but fight for the days of "The Incredible Man Who Declines" when such things are done correctly. Shockingly, this is directed by top cinematographer Dean Cundei, who should either adhere to a day job or choose better material the next time.
