Beating bad guys ... It's a sign for this movie, it's a lot of truth about it. Sam at home one and two, movie classics. Sam in the house three and four, a good movie if you are three! Like Sharkboi and Lavagirl, no matter how much he tries to be ridiculous, he is not. Culkin replaced Alek D'Linz or something else. He is a very dumb actor with mild performances, but not entirely his guilt, writing required a mild vocabulary and a mild expression. Jokes are just copied from the first two with different thieves, and you would have to be blind to think that these chickens are real. A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which this film is shown on a rainy day. And to make things the worst, completely different actor, go see if you do not believe me, but you will regret it.
