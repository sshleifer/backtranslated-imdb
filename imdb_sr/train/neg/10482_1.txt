One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How to define the "worst"? I'd rather that both of the eye balls pulled out, and then they were forced to tap into the dance than ever before. Somehow, One-Hit Vonder Zvick manages a movie that at the same time offends fans of Elvis, merchant Mari Kai, Las Vegas, homosexuals, FBI agents and the rest of mankind with any intelligence with a bad, messy farce that is forced to be abandoned. As Elvis Presley Enterprises can allow the rights of real Elvis's songs to be used in a movie with a central premise that seems to be "the only good Elvis Presley imitator dead" is beyond me. The worst part of this mess - and it takes a bit of work - is a distorted letter: in 1958, Elvis's words and poems will be quoted / spoken in the 1970s! The worst special effect? This Oscar would go to the moron who decided that the Elvis tomb, potentially the most photographed / recognizable grave in the world, resembles a pyramid with a golden inscription on the top and somewhere in the middle of the park. Potentially, the greatest audience of this film will be fans of Elvis. However, unbridled nonsense (Nikon gave Elvis a DEA badge and not an FBI accreditation ... and I could go on and on) actually undermines the TO's conventional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. This is a really terrible, horrible movie.
