It's a shame for everything and everything that's used in a joke. I personally do not care in one way or another to Jessica Simpson and her talent or what many people find fascinating. Just like a movie, it's something that would not even get a passing grade at a film school. The script is a mess, the acting is terrible, and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-writer "Bottle Rocket") did this I wonder what the hell he thought. He did "Old School" for loud crying! This does not even belong to the same country as my "Old School" DVD! Please do not look for this for any reason! I see that there is a comment that it is so bad that it is good, but that it is sincere too kind. When we stop seeing singers who obviously can not continue to try, I hope it will soon end. The worst part is that there are really decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of this landfill. As for the plot, it is almost non-existent and so badly made and written (to know that it is another rehash). Please, whatever you do, do not waste time, but if you do, feel sorry for the current actors who took part in spending their time on this bomb. Jessica Simpson is beautiful, but keep up the singing, although I'm not really a fan of it either. And whoever filmed this film, I would not put it on your resume. 1/10 because you can not give zero.
