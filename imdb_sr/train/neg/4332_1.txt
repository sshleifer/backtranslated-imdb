This film is a bad attempt to make the original fans feel complete. One thing that people have forgotten is the fact that the reason why the original was given such a recognition, is strictly done on the fact that it should have made you feel incomplete. in the toilet. I'm not a negative guy, but the man was playing in this movie .... no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlit Brigante and I'm sorry I had two hours of my time and my money spent on this movie. I still love the original and I will do everything to not allow this film to ruin my opinion about it.
