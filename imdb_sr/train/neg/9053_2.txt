Simply, I found a television show "Mash" banal, preacher, oh, so "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious and the greatest sin of all, and that is,? that it was incredibly boring. You have Alan Aldu as a starring, "(star)," who is so in love with herself and her mind, that it was actually unpleasant to even try to sit through the episode. The original series also had McLean Stevson, and Vaine Rogers, for whom I would happily admit that they had some sort of panache and style in their presentation of character. However, Harry (Henri) Morgan, and Mike Farrell, both individually and complexly together, are like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Vonder Bread. Loretta Svit, which I also thought was boring, also for her own guilt was not a miracle to look at, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at the film, was tired of looking and acting as the show began. It showed me watching one show annually. Jamie Far was a "comedy" of a low eyebrow and it was not at all worth it. The reason why I did not give one (one) rating, anyone who has read this until now, was asked, that rating of any kind is not only subjective, but relative. Television is, in addition to relatively few exceptions, such a rough one. In relative terms, Mash had some production quality (television standards) and the era even today, and so he earned two.
