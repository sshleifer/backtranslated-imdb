My kids watch the show on a daily basis. It's a great program for younger children. However, they have to stop showing repeated runs and make even more recent shows and get rid of Roonei and Deedee's IELLOV TEETH. Moe is the only Doodle bop with pure white beads of beads and kids are noticing these things and asking them if the two never brushed their teeth? Is this show ever pervading the United States, and if so, where can we find its schedule? And one more thing if we could add. You must stop hiding. Sometimes when you jump from a place where you scare younger children and what about pulling a rope? What it means? Others then wet all the time. They need to add newer things to their show instead of the same oils of the same ole. Children lose interest.
