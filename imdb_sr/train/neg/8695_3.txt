Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of all law and order, and her acting is even worse. Her attempts to accent in Texas are amateurish and unrealistic. Neither can adequately call the intense emotions needed to play the mother of child abducted; Sometimes, while her daughter is gone, she only sounds unclear, as if she can not remember where she left the keys. The acting of the actor distracts a lot from the message. The rest of the actors are talented enough, but they simply can not overcome Rohm's tendency to simply lie on a particularly dense imitation of a southern retreat whenever a real act is needed.
