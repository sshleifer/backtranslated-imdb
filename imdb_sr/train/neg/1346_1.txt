Dear friends and family, I assume that if a teenager wants to become biblical with other teenagers, then this is their eternal curse - just remember the children, "birth control" does not mean "oral sex", not I'm interested in what the honor student says. On the other hand, even if senatorial help is cited as a "piece of romance," he still strikes only a high school student. If it were my sister, I would have eaten these guys on my knees. Besides, I discovered that the Mongols do not like the same thing as the French do, and that baseball players call the Zoo as delicate underwear. I think that I would rather watch Richie Rich more often than to humiliate this slip, slapping. Thank you and good night.
