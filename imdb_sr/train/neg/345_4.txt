This can not be the last film by Mandi Schaffer. Somebody do something! :-( Argh. <BR> <BR> What little life this could have had, the direction was over. The brother was pretty well done, and he did not even enter the film until half way And, please, put Mandi in some other films! Two specific criticisms, if anyone cares (apparently nobody liked this movie). See what she was supposed to see and she was never seen in return, she was very boring, Hollivood: please stop giving crime the perfect weather luck that points out exactly when the peak arrives.If your script is not good enough to raise Without it, then do not make it. Other, Carmen would not fall for one of the fake tricks that Traci pulled in. She already had Tracie fingers. More bad writing / directing there. </ p> <p> I could still destroy this movie, but grace prohibits it. In fact, I did not hate him as much as others have. He simply did not have much reason to do it unless it was a clean vehicle to show the wonderful Mandi. For those who did not think he was sexy ... the character was not very well written, but how can you say that she was not sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses, and I think that's not me. MORE MANDI. (Do not mess with "Moore, Mandi" - although I would like to see her again. ;-) P.S. Did I mention that I hope Mandi makes me more movies? <: - D
