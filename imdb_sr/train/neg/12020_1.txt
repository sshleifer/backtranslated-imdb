This was a waste of time. Danger: If you watch it, you will be tempted to take your DVD out of the wall and throw it through the window. line of flat paper; wooden design; Luci Lavless was pathetic exhausted. Seriously wrong story, completely incredible characters. The two worst concepts in the film, etc. are: (1) evil twin, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. Plot "curls"? Unusually simple and obvious - like watching a train that descends down the path in the middle of the day at the prairie. It does not even work properly. Evil is not punished for the original crime. Please, please - do not look at it even if it's free and your only other choice is to go to the synagogue.
