This film is actually worse than most films I've ever suffered, and I've suffered a lot. Absolute nonsense. There is a terrible, forced dialogue; meaningless development of the plot; the scenes of "spooky pictures" are really drawn, which resembles an art project of secondary schools rather than a horror film; 5/10 among the best attractive women; long, boring sexual scenes with those women (forget what you know about virgins, especially those with fake chests); mumbled, difficult to understand speech from some characters; and they actually used masks from Killer Clowns from Outer Space during masturbation, which should be a savings because the movie was pretty fun, but it's not. Veden Fell is the worst bad guy in the history of the film. Absolutely give this flaw.
