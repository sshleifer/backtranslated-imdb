One of the earliest films by Frances Farmer; At 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is in excellent voice, but his songs are not the best. Martha Raie and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great in their time, is really a banana today. Roi Rogers also appears in a singing role. In my opinion, it's worth watching only if you're a fan of Frances Farmer and perhaps a fan of Bing Crosby.
