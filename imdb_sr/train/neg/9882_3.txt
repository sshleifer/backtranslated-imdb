There are exactly 2 good things that can be said about "Fantasies" (both mentioned by previous reviewers): a) Bo Derek's outstanding, poetry inspiring beauty. She has footage in this film, where even Catherine Zeta-Jones gives money for her money, and that's a really big compliment. Her nudity is short and discreet, but only looking at her face is enough. b) The setting of the Greek island, with its sun and crystal clear blue sea. Other than that, there is no story, the dialogue is insignificant and sometimes unintentionally funny ("He touched you where you are!"), and the figure of Peter Hooten is a slippery jerk. It will build on naivety of its character, but then when you have to work with dialogue so badly, it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that in almost every sentence you have repeatedly pronounced the name "Damir" is a great irritation). Oh, and although the movie is set on the Greek island, it's barely heard the Greek word - obviously everyone there, from children to the elderly, speaks English English all the time. (*)
