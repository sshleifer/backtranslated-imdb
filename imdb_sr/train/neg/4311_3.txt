I watched this movie when I was a young guy full of frenzied hormones and he was such a sexy movie as I had ever seen-or ever been to see him. Maybe it was not a great movie. I suppose it is not. I do not remember much, to tell you the truth. I only remember sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in any movie did it for me as incredibly sexy Cathy did in this movie. I have not seen him since the first time I caught him on TV in the 70s and I do not think I would like to see him again, because I'm sure it would be a disappointment - my hormones are not so furious and I've become poorer over the years. Still, when I return to the shower scene, I still remember how great it was. Later it was added: After I looked at the film again, I found it dangerous to return home. What was once erotic is now pretty pitiful. The older woman-younger man still works for me, but not as much as she used to be, probably because I'm no longer a twelve-year-old. This old woman is now younger than me. Likewise, the amateurism of the whole thing was not observed by my twelve-year mind. Moral: Sometimes it's better not to go back to the past.
