This must be one of the 5 worst movies ever recorded. The action looked intriguing as the passenger 57. But with this film, it somehow worked much better. The plot is worked out in the worst possible way. Just a few horrible moments in the movie, the stewardess stands at the open entrance of the flying 747 and tries to close the door without sucking the wind 250 miles an hour?!? After that, the plane moves a few miles, starting at 8,000 feet, which is impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When on the runway (perfectly straight, of course) she got instructions to pull the flaps, HUH !! Come to the flaps to ensure lift at low speeds, when using the throttle back throttle on the engines and give maximum power! I can continue to talk about small and mostly big mistakes in the film, but then my answer will become the size of the English dictionary. This is the movie you want to miss, take my word for it!
