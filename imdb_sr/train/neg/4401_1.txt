We went to a movie with a group because the show we went canceled. It's no doubt one of the worst movies ever. It's not that I do not like the cult movies I'm working on. But nothing is happening in the film. There is no connection with the characters. endless times without dialogue. And the car. How every day in that car carry a large tent and deck chairs and clothes? It's a two-seater! I must say, however, that the landscape is beautiful, but not in the film, the director was supposed to film the film, so we can skip about 80 minutes of useless time in which nothing is happening. <br /> <br> I would not recommend it, because it's a waste of time
