Freddi's Dead: Final Nightmare, the sixth sequel to the Nightmare on Elm Street series and another bad sequel. I think this is related to the last addition of a child of dreams. I was lucky enough to get a DVD box for the nightmare in the Elm Street series for my birthday, so I had to see all the sequels. Can I say that I am more and more disappointed, although with these sequels, at least in the last two, Freddy seems to have lost the advantage. It's almost as if the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they just destroyed it instead of re-inventing the story. This was a continuation that was not needed, I'm sorry, Robert Englund, but this was a lot below what Freddy Krueger represents. Freddy is back, but he has something we do not know about, daughter. Maggie, unaware that he is her father, but soon finds out what his dark secrets are and wants her help. She must make an effort to resist her power, but it is difficult with all the good memories she has on her beloved father. Ironically, is not it? But Freddy does not give up without manipulating her way. Freddi's Dead: Final Nightmare is also featured in the 3-D, radical, huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst extensions, it's related to the fifth episode of the Nightmare on Elm Street, I'd rather watch another nightmare on the Easter Street to be honest. This had a bad acting, stupid editing, and only a bad idea for the story. I did not like the concept and he just ruined the idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger really is, the master of the nightmare, and not the Father best knows. 2/10
