I was so disappointed with this show. After I heard and read everything about it, how it was "a show on earth" and all kinds of wild promises, if I was quality, I tried to watch it. What a disappointment !! The act was forced and exaggerated. The story made little sense. As for any indication of the praised "look at teenage lives," I could see only a poor attempt that had as much realism as the real shov. Some wonder why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it's really not all good and beating the drum over the quality in this show is only to draw attention to how badly it is made.
