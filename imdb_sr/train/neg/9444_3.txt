There's only one thing I'll say about a cat in a hat ... as a children's movie and a good comedy movie that's bullshit ... I lost track of how terrible jokes in the movie not only sucked, but it was. That's the exact child. Oh, by the way, the way the cat in the hat spoke was embarrassing ... as far as the plot that I completely forgot about. Who cares, it is already sucked. I'm not sure why Mike Miers joined, but I think the writers were trying to sound like he did in Austin's powerless swingers and that it was doing too much - but how it was bored. I do not see it - it falls into the bottom 100 .............................. jokes are so inexcusable that it's ridiculous
