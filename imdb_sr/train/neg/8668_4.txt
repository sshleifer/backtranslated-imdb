I never read Bradbury's novel on which this film is based, but from what I've collected, it will be interesting (when I finally read it and I want it). My comments will be based exclusively on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew that I had to see it and I was so excited, but when I finally succeeded, I was so disappointed that it hurt me. This is because the film itself felt so amateurish. Actors did not play well (although Robards and Price are good actors - just not here). It seemed that children's actors were only asked to appear, enter the clothing of characters, say the lines and facial devices. The set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised by the dreadfulness that I had to go to the Internet and check who sent it, just to see what the job was doing. The assembly was cut out and glued, and the action (script) was precisely this (although the author himself was involved, irony?). Building tension, fear and uncertainty was so mild that it was ineffective when the peak finally came. I read some comments on this movie and I find it hard to believe that people actually like it. What hurts most is that the content is interesting, fun and intriguing. He had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad that it took away the glow from the story.
