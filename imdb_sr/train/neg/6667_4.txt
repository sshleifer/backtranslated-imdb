I enjoyed this film all the way to Ed Norton's facial hair. Without revealing any details of the land - one afternoon he had a light beard, but the same night the chin disappeared and there was a very big mustache on it. There were a lot more than the mustaches that went with the beard. Later, during a dark night outdoors, the mustache disappeared and seemed to clean the hideout. This was an opportunity in which a shave stop would be no option. These continuity differences completely discouraged me from the rest of the film and destroyed every credibility it had previously. Also, I discovered that the long cowboy scene alone in his bedroom was too much like De Niro's taxi driver. Even if she was supposed to be a homage, she was too fat for this viewer.
