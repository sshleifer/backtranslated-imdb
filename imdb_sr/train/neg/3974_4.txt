I agree with what Calamine said! And I do not always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true, it's time for girls to move to better roles. I would love to see them succeed, because they were a very inspiring couple who grew up, and I would like to see them grow as men, actors and career, as well as in their private life. So, the producers, please, let the girls have a chance to develop something that will separate a little from the tangent, move them to a new direction that recognizes them individually and their talents in many aspects. This film that is commenting is not bad, but as I have seen in their films, their films remain the same for the typical action and typography. When in Rome it is good for the audience of the younger generation, but adults who were children when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so I think that adults would like us to see them making films of different types, maybe some are like sixth sense, clock, chocolate, such a movie - not saying they only have serious films for them, but humor, but to see them in different roles than what they played in their newer movies like this one and the New York Minute.
