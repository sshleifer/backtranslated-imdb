I am surprised that everyone involved in the production of this series will truly recognize the responsibility. The script is so inconvenient that it was written by someone who failed on the admission exam for the Canadian Union of comedians (and that is something that is said!). Take out the binoculars if you like, but there is no similar scarf in sight. Ronnie Corbett must have been broken to take up this rubbish. The rest of the actors are so lacking in any acting or comedic ability I'm amazed that it passed the first episode - correction, passed the audition. All I can say to those who are having fun is that they have to have fun very easily. And it is obvious that the production costs had to be 100 e per episode. And just in case someone thinks that I comment as a foreigner who is not familiar with English humor, I must add that I am really English.
