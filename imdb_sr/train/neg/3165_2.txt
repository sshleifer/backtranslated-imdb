this film was terrible. I thought with all the actors who were decent, it would be better. do not waste your time. Eva Longoria Parker was terrible. should be kept by desperate housewives. Paul Rudd becomes actor B. the mess he made in the movie, I could never be your wife, it was what I'm saying. and the lake bell she was cute, but she definitely needed a few more lessons. Look like a paradise with Reese Vitherspoon ... it was a little better. or any other ghost film. you will be grateful that you have not lost your precious time. PS I love you, it's also good from outside the hard romance! It's time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listening to people who have already seen it.
