Of course, if you ask any mom who is the most beautiful baby in the world, she would tell you that her son is the most wonderful child in the whole world. She is right, at least in her own world. The film's producers were Biggie's mother and his good friend Puffy. Oh, well, do I have to say more? I will ruin them for those who do not want to make a simple conclusion. The whole film was fake. You can just put a few MTV videos together and call it a movie. Beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggy's mother. He looks like a dog in his life. I'm just wondering why he called himself big ones. Big body Little dick? Big mouth Small sound? Big fat Small eyes? Disclaimer: I am a person of color. So keep your racist remark to yourself.
