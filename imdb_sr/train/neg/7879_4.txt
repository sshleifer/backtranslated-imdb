First, I must say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it to my 9th grade, and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie is useful. The film was so disappointing. The film cuts some characters and misses many of the main points of the book. She skips a lot and does not explain anything in detail. If someone watched this movie without having read the book for the first time, they would be confused. What disappointed me most in this movie was the end. The end of the book was the most powerful, and in the movie they changed it! It was supposed to be about pigs and people in the alliance and to "melt" together, but instead, the movie looked like animals would rebel against pigs. In short, I do not think this film captured the true meaning Orwell displayed in his book.
