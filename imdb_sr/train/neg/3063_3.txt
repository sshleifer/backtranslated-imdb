Images that usually glorify the hero have meaning. For example, Bonnie and Clide were celebrated by dynamic bank robbers and you really felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds. Why? These were two people who found themselves in depression when people desperately wanted to survive. The character of Viggo Mortensen soon appears as a national hero. Why? He drives the Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his affected woman was taking. Nobody tries to understand why he is trying to escape from everyone. Worse still, when it becomes clear that he is not a red-necked terrorist, nobody in the government wants to help him while trying to save his back. a radio emcee that relies on a story in favor of our hero. The end is absolutely incredible.
