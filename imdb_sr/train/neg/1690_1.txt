this film was terrible. I could hardly stay awake through it. I would never see this movie again if I was paid. The so-called horror scene in it is gradually predictable and too loud. There really was nothing in this movie that made it original or worth $ 7.50 that I paid to see it. Do not look at it, do not rent it, do not read about it on the internet because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave an unpleasant performance and should really be ashamed of having banned her good name with her film. I shame you, Sarah, that you joined this terrible, horrible movie. A terrific film, you do not need to ever see it.
