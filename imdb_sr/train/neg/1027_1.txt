Normally, I have much better things to do with my time than writing reviews, but I was so disappointed with this film that I spent an hour logging in with IMDb just to take it off my chest. A movie with names such as Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacei would be a bet on a bet ... well, this movie was horrible. The closeness of the impossibility is to "stop disbelief"; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy, but Justin Timberlake did not let me. Timberlake needs to keep music, what a horrible performance - NOT presence as an actor, no character. I can not blame everything on Justin: The movie boasts a terrible montage; definitely "F". After I've seen it, I have to wonder what really motivates the actors. I mean, Morgan actually read the script before taking over the role. Did not he see how bad it was? Then what could motivate him to take on the role? Money? Of course, acting is sometimes more about who you are with, but about the actual development of quality work. LL Cool J is an excellent actor; he gets a lot more screens than Freeman or Spacei in this movie and he is really struggling to reconcile himself with the poor scenario. Meanwhile, the audience goes: "What the hell is going on here? You expect to believe in this shit?" done - very disappointing.
