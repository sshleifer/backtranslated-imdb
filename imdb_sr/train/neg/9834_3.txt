One of the more "literate" Lone Stars, with time on character development and interaction, dialogue and business. The introductory scene sets the stage (literally) for the personality of the gambler, Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler), and his friend, John Vaine, rodea (say, Roh-Dai-oh) stars, both of whom are a little rand. The film follows their adventures as they try to work best in search of Mexican Juanita, and later in search of vibrant Marie Kornman, who has an inevitable brother's brotherhood (although he was reprimanded by a real criminal and wants to repent). And oh, of course, they are wrongly charged with two crimes and have to serve a prison sentence before they escape and be released in the end. The peak is Scott continuously and intentionally framing Mari's ass to her store, and throwing away the ladder on which it stands, can catch it and grab it as it falls. Everything looks a bit modern for the western 30s, but it sounds better than it actually is. Unfortunately, the exciting action elements found in many other Lone Stars here were very short. Not Iakima Canutt. Cheap and bad use of shots of riders falling from the horse. Not George Haies. Tedious Stooge-bi-plai between Scott and Charlie, with Charlie swinging on Scott, Scott stomping on his leg, and then hitting him (repeated two more times!). Experienced Paul Fik is underutilized. Eddie Chandler himself, here in his big turn of the stars, is not quite convincing as an early blow. Zlikovac looks too old and thick. Like Chandler, who spent his later career in 300 more films as an unpublished meat loaf. Mary Kornman, 20 years old, "Our Gang" (see 'Mary, the Queen of Little Girls' 1925) is cute in her scenes with John Wayne, but this is for this. Here are the buried seeds of a better western lie. P.S. An ultra-short, colorful version, which looks good, moves so fast, it's almost blinking multiple times. Luckily, the shameful scenes with Eddie Chandler were cut.
