An absolutely horrible movie. Totally wasting time. Background music is so loud that you can not understand the speech. So if you really listen carefully, whatever they say is actually incomprehensible. The camera's operation is poor, the editing is not present, the background result gives the headache, the action is bad, the dialogs are incomprehensible, the acting is vague. Kareena looked like a wrestler, now she looks like a starving wrestler. Damn you can lose weight, but you can not get the grace. After I spent three hours watching the movie, I want to like him, but this film would not even allow me to enjoy it. Please, if you want to torture yourself, just watch this.
