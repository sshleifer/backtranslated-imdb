This was not well done west. You have this craze driving around in the blazing sun in a hut with a sun umbrella over it, killing people for their own reasons. You have this same person sitting in the snow cave during the blizzard, cutting off parts of his anatomy that were frozen. Then you have a woman in the house in the middle of the place where the wolves shoot outside. What's the meaning of this movie? Did Bruce Dern not find something better? This was the loss of the film.
