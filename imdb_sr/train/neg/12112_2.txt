I can not believe I've lost time with this movie. I could not even call a movie. It was so terrible that I did not recommend anything. I love movies with low budget and strange movies, but this has bored me to death. Poorly done and bad behavior ruined it from curiosity. You have to wonder what these people thought when they spent money on the production of this movie. I wonder what I meant by looking at him to the end. I recommend this film to anyone. How did they publish it? Was there an audience that likes this kind of movie? It must be because you can find it in almost every video store. But why? It deserves to be forgotten. If you love bad movies then this is for you.
