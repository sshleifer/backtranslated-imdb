I love low-budget independent films and I've been hoping for this. But this film is static. It does not matter the production value, which is very noble for its budget, but pacing is deadly. However, these people achieve a lot with little, but the film fails at the most basic level. Boring. Installation is glacial and pacing booths. It should have been 65 minutes. The best thing with Dr. Jekilla is Mr. Hide who can not be seen enough. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we have to suffer from the harassment of Baltimore-Britons through endless and weary exposure. I feel like a play in the background that is dedicated to the video. The noble efforts of all in production, but the story this murder demanded hitting pants and funky new low-budget technology had to give a new voice. Instead, it's just a poor recovery.
