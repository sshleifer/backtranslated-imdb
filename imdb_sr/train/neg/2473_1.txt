if my grandmother was making films, she would probably have done a much better figure than this ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (mom, dad and son) are OK. Especially mother, she is a beautiful actress, and the child has also proved to be beautiful, especially on scenes where she should be scary. But does the director know the meaning of the word Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. the script has no evolutionary atmosphere that could become uncertain. If you love being chased by trees, you will probably enjoy it, otherwise you will stay at home and sleep. Oh ... it was actually funny: a 2001 movie, but we could not figure it out because the picture is so bad (like mini-dvu) and cars are so old (like the 70's and 80's).
