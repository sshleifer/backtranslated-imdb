In this story there was no original idea. Topics are drawn from different sources; few are the Ninth Gate, In the mouth of Madness (another Carpenter film) and the Ring. He even went to the same cursed, brilliant Circle from the Ring and used it as the name of the film. The soundtrack of Cody Carpenter is almost pulled out of Suspiria. I hope that nobody will oppose this comment by ejecting the word HOMAGE. Yes, I saw the theater playing Argento's Deep Red. The hump claim would be a shit. This was at the bottom. Throwing up and "disturbing" images into the pot do not make a good horror movie. Carpenter knew that. He should fade in the dark or get a time machine.
