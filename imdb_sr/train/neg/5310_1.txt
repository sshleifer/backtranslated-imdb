I'm not talking about what the other story was about. This is definitely not a bimbo movie, in fact, I do not think there was one decent girl in it. No, it's just a stupid, poorly-made, Ed Vood-style science fiction. And that's bad. I can not even tell you how bad it is. I saw him late at night on the cable and I was in shock. The fact that this movie has ever been published is an insult to all of us. The actors were producer's friends or mentally retarded, special effects are a joke, and the rhythm is crazy slowly. Music is the highest for me. The monkey could write a better theme with xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on a cable, watch it. You'll be amazed how bad a movie can be.
