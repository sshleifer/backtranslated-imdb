Waiting for me to enter the circuit with tickets in my hand, I expected an interesting sci-fi fantastic film that would finally feed my appetite of robotic technology films, instead I disappointed every aspect of it, once again proving that the amazing effects can not help boring a complication, which in my opinion was worse this year. And in this film I was dissatisfied, Vill Smith did not show anything new in this film, but I never saw his acting change from "Men In Black," which in my opinion was his only success. Since then, he had to withdraw, not spoil his name with titles such as "I, Robot" and "Men in Black 2". 4/10
