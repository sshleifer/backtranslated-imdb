Terrible acting, terrible acting and cheap props. It would have been much better if it was set up as a parody action movie. What a waste. Starting from the name of the film. "Enemy" By naming "Action Film" it would be better. (contributes to the effect of parody). A policeman who looks like a 60 year old, a blonde girl who always has the same empty, dull expression on his face. At the end of the film, he and she work together to shoot bad guys and every time they exchange words, they feel like cheap lines in front of a sex scene in a porn movie. Terrible. Do not waste your time.
