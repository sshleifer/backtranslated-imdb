Regardless of the Internet, this film was horrible. I expected the movie to be more farce than anything. Instead, the filmmakers tried to make a serious thriller / horror movie, and they completely missed it. There were only a few good parts, and a couple of good lines of Samuel Jackson. In addition, it was a bunch of ups and some bad animated snakes. All the Internet joke was a bit better than a real movie. Now that the film really came out, I hope this joke will die. Do not waste your time and money on this piece of over-ridden garbage. If you are looking for something fun and fun, then go to Snakes on the blog.
