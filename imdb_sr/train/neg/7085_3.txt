I really tried to love this movie. It deals with an important problem in any society: dependence on sex. In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex. In this case, our main hero and hero, because you have uninterrupted sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic) endangers your marriage, work, and even your life. Production values ​​are terrible; mostly acting. Oh, you will not enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are made in very bad taste and you may think that you are watching a movie made by a homemaker. Second, the plot is just not a sense. How could such a smart and beautiful woman handle all the nasty things of her husband? How could she trust him ?! The situation in the three is invaluable and will make you smile a little. Also, the scene with the black theater stage is meaningless and will leave you in mind "vtf?" Scenes like those you will find plenty of. Avoid this film. Please, avoid this; it's not a soft core, it's not a documentary, it's not a dramatic feature. This is a pretentious attempt by the so-called. Documentary director or anything else. Only the feet of Mrs. Kinski at the exhibition worth the clock. I got it on HBO and I'm glad I did not spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life will not come back.
