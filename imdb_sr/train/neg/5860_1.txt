It's hard to say precisely the horror of this movie. A completely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything that could be called "humor" or even "fun" in the Rabbit test. So, as a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest this word: "Hubiriffic" (adj.) The combination of "hubristic" and "awesome"; It is used to describe pre-ambiguous debates such as the "Rabbit Test" movie. Joan Rivers and producer "Hollivood Skuares" Jai Redack have seriously outdone their modest abilities to have fun at this 82-minute festival of misery. . I'm trying to make a plane! comedian in style with a moldy collection of hedges, (note Joan: German doctors were not laughing at Vaudeville) drawn from their graves in Catskills - that's bad enough. However, this cinematic crime is the words of the director's style, which can best be described as "ugly", and the acting game of the former and the future - is so eager to please them, even the weakest of them. In this Sargasso sea, Juice is unhappy Billi Cristal in his film debut as an unlucky protagonist of the movie Lionel. Watching the Crystal in this picture is similar to seeing a blind person walking in a minefield; after all, the reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition like a cheap joke after a cheap joke explodes on his face. I can only speculate about the kind of audience that you might actually like Rabbit Test. Cabbage, molluscs and slightly retarded lizards are all possible candidates. But for self-conscious people who are thinking - with enthusiasm I would recommend that you bleach into your eyes before I recommend the "Rabbit Test".
