I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, which I did not even see in a movie from Rocka IV. Unfortunately, this film was a great disappointment. The performance of all parties was bad, except Mr. Lundgren, who was fine. Kata Dobo was something nice to see in spite of her funny clothes and makeup. The cheaters were completely stereotyped, and Lundgren's character had no depth in it. I did not really expect a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately it is not a decent action. Every turn of the plot is extremely predictable and the incredible amount of unrealism and comedians such as the characters began to make me very annoying. comic action, but only if nothing else is available. 1/10. (I assume that the current average voice of 7.0 with 6 votes had to be influenced by someone who took part in the making of this film)
