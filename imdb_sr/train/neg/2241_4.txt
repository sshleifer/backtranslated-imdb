I remember I enjoyed this a few years ago, but I came back to it, I wonder why. I guess it always looks good, and girls do it pretty well, but men prefer to lower their side. Why, why in so many English movies about sex we must have such incompetent people in addition to beautiful girls? What is sufficient enough, it begins as predictably enough as a sex farce similar to the Confessions, but about a third of the times (as we begin to enjoy the presence of the beautiful Me Me Lai), the film asks to start seriously. Not only that, but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stiff. In short, it is neither innocent stupid nor intelligently serious, as it seems. Maybe Richard O'Sullivan, as such a central figure, could help, but I think that this is one of his worst performances. Just worth the ladies.
