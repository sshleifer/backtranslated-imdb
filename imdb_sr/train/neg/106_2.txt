First seen on 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sikes): Mindless 3-D film about eating zombies in 3 stories inside movie chronicles. And yes, we see zombies that eat parts of human flesh in 3D !! Wow, no! This has been done over and over again in the 2D in a zombie movie, but what usually makes a zombie film is a better story than a real diet of meat. That's what the original zombie classics did good. Eating meat was just inserted as a supplement. In fact, in most of these 3-part chronicles we are bored by the fracture (gloomy zone) easily understandable and slow-detected finals. The last story is actually the story with which the film began (when a journalist explored the so-called Ghost City) and of course we see the flesh eating zombies in it. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D gadget.
