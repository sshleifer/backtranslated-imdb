The sects that capitalize this film are well known for their claim to take the 'message' of the Bible without any changes or unnecessary influence. The existence of this film is only due to the fact that there is no such thing. If you want to know what was born again Christian branch about the seventies, just look at the word 'excitement' in the vocabulary of cults and sects. It's faster than sitting through this celluloid loss. Poor acting, uneven sound quality, and scenario that could also easily be written by Jack T Chick (a paranoid Christian conspiracy theorist for those who are not familiar with the Evangelical scene). You really could not put this in the category 'it's so bad', so it's the only audience or the one with a collection of pamphlets that wants to be separated or extremely paranoid.
