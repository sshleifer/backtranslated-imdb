This is probably the most boring, worst and useless film I've seen last year. The action that needed to have some philosophical aspects appeared to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix, with a lot of cliches: a lonely wolf cop, a nice look, psychologically upset, sleeping with a gun ... and shy, but she looks very well - you're adding a scientist A parcel of 2 cents and you have me, Robot! I was terribly upset by the obvious advertising of brands such as FedEk, Audi, Converse etc. This movie stinks to commercialization and tends to be a more bad ad that unfortunately will not stop after 30 seconds. I would not recommend this to my bad enemy, if you have free time, watch a good TV program or read a nice book better.
