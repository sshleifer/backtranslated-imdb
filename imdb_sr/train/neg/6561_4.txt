The order of the opening should show that Legija arrived in Paris on November 13, 1918. The troops are piled on the train - wearing a uniform in which the French army, including Legija, went to war in 1914! This is a sure sign that the war blow you will see will be a turkey. (French army realized until 1915 that the war in red trousers and dark blue coats did not work. Metropolitan French troops were placed in the "blue of the horizon" and the colonial troops were placed in a pot). Claude Van Damme (sp?) Remake at least uniforms more or less right. It's really bad when directors make such mistakes when they go to all the effort to get other things.
