Not? I did not mean that! Well, in that case, all you have to do is stay away, away from "Do you want to know the secret", because it's just a meaningless, meaningless "Scream" bookkeeper without any redeeming value. The action is extremely funny; The characters are unbearably stupid, the up-factor is negligible and the whole thing is simply boring! As you can already get out of the title, this movie is mostly inspired by "I still know what you did last summer" because events take place in a similar environment, and the killer's motivations are just as stupid. Why would anyone want to steal ideas from a junk like "IKVIDLS" is completely a mystery to me. At least that film could depend on the precious stand Jennifer Love Hevitt, while the girls in this garbage, besides stupid, are also terribly unattractive. A year after the still unsolved murder of her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, her new adulterous lover and four other intelligent students, leave for Florida to spend a holiday on spring holidays in a lovely house on the beach. The killer did not make a move all year, but now he follows the path for Florida and begins to pit them, leaving behind a title message as a kind of business card. You really do not have to be a horror expert to quickly figure out which face is hiding behind an indescribably funny mask, and the writer's attempts to mislead you are really embarrassing. Since the action is so thin, most of the film is completely irrelevant, including backgrounds for the incompetent Floridian police and the 'mysterious' FBI inspector who seems to have a personal outcome. Murder is unexplainable from the screen (do not you hate when this happens?), Even there is no free T & A for enjoyment, and I better not start with the quality of the dialogue. Walking through this kind of shit only makes you realize that the splendid spirit of the 80's slashers is gone forever.
