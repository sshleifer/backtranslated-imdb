Remek Alexander Aja "The Hills Have Eies" was one of the great points in 2006. Not only was it a remake of a classic horror film, it was already pretty damn good. So, almost a year later, we were treated as a continuation of this remake. While the original scribe Ves Craven has returned as a producer and screenwriter, this film simply fails to reach the level set by the original and remake. A group of military trainees are stopping in the desert to check some scientists and found themselves in conflict with the family of mutants from the first movie (at least those who stayed and new ones). There's a lot worse here. What is annoying about this film is the ultimate lack of characterization. The spectator does not care about what is happening to any of these people because we have not entered them. Even the mutants had some kind of characterization last time and this time nothing. Up there is no sense in the upside. There must be reason to make this happen to be interesting. Nothing that's happening here is not interesting. And what's this lately about the scenes of rape in movies? There's one here without the real reason. I hope this is a set of hills that will not be visited again.
