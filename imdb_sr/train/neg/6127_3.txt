While I am from Hungary, I have heard many people who have so far spoken better and better things about Uvegtigris, but I do not really understand the reason why it was all. I loved many movie spots, some of the quotes really made me happy, but stereotyped characters are re-present, as in every Hungarian movie, and the story is also quite boring. The first half I liked, but then I started to get bored, and then I found the whole movie only BORING. Rudolf Petar is as good as ever, Reviczki is also brilliant, but the rest are just there ... do not do anything. How many years do you still have to go for a good Hungarian film?
