I hated this show when I was a kid. It was on the day when the children showed that the characters actually have accents, not only the mild, generic, to which we are accustomed. Jack Wilde had a British accent, and Pufnstuf was south. As one of the others mentioned, I never fully understood what was agreed with a witch who wanted a flute. It always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute just upset me and I would not try to take her away! Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf with McDonalds commercials in the early 70's. Others mentioned: Pufnstuf broke McDonald's. At the height of McDonald's popularity, a television show (or rather, their creators) tried to license McDonald's signs for their shoving, but when McDonalds refused TV show, he slightly changed the characters and forwarded them as their own. They even hired former employees at McDonald's ad and loud actors to make TV shows. McDonalds sued and won. Look for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you will find many articles about it.
