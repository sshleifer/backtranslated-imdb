I picked up this movie hoping to be similar to the hilarious "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is very recommended, by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The film was shot in this fake documentary style that was celebrated by the office, but it does not work. The reason for this is partly stubbornness, but mainly writing and directing. True, it can be funny to use each individual cliche in the role play role, but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of each scene, you know what a "joke" will be. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is shown at the top. There is no subtlety in this film, if the inscriptions "LAUGH NOV" or the cheap trace of false laughter from the 80s appear, that would not mean much. With some scenes, you can not think, "Yes, I understand why they thought it would be ridiculous," but the way it is executed takes all the moments from a possible joke.
