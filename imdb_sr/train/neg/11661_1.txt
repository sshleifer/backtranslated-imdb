Basically, this is a long-lasting, unbridled, action / comedy. First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed the movie Scari Movie (1), and the continuation had its moments. Unfortunately, white chickens do not deliver even half a laugh. Humor in it is absolutely cheese. If you like burping, farting, stupid phrases, you should probably look at this. When it's not rough it's idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the film gave me everything, totally free, just idiotic. However, I watched the whole thing since I was with a friend (otherwise I would not bother). The story is undoubtedly skinny, it was in a terrifying film, but at least they laughed fast and constant. I think this is one of the main problems with this film, the laughter does not come fast enough. Some jokes are getting too long when they are at first sight more repulsive than funny. If you prefer your comedy with several brain cells then just avoid this. If you want a stupid comedy with more laughter, then watch horrible movies, plane, hotshots 1 + 2. 1/10 A completely uneducated, thin story, a movie that seems to be based on one idea (what if we are dressed like white chickens for a movie?), but simply did not have enough material.
