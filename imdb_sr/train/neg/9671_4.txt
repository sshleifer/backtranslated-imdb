Perhaps I would give 6 or 7 for this propaganda film as it shows when and how the propaganda film becomes successful. If there are people who watch this piece and think that "well then the Jews had to do something to be treated in the way they were treated in World War II," then the film was very cleverly made to conceal why and how and how to mix correctly and false observations on how people live. What more can a propaganda movie have? The part of the American film about the Rothschild family is, for example, very cunningly used. There is no question why the Jews keep their wealth from the officers. No one in the social layer mentions the taxation system. In addition, the level of excitement (or level of disgust) in the movie is slowly increasing, and the end of film suits are the solution. goal and obligation for propaganda. The audience will leave the time to come for joy and gratitude ... well done. In the film there is some sort of simplicity that deals with the most basic emotional perception of the audience. Film is a kind of history today, so there is no need to worry much about it. However, in this simplicity of the word of ethnic degradation, a careful observer can find relevance for today's cultural hatred, violence, decivilization, and integration problems. All in all, fine garbage.
