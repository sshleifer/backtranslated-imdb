I wish I knew more about this movie when I rented it. I would put him in his turn based on Heather Graham and her strong credits as actresses (IMHO). While the parts of the film were charming, most of the film felt unnatural, undeveloped, or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention that the ICK is the factor of so many people who think that the sisters are a couple ... I do not care how much of the story is, still felt a bit, mind, roughly. And Charlie, for the zoologist, she certainly does not look very well adapted to the signals of other Homo sapiens. What is in it (besides its heat and some common interests) made Gray fall for her? The story could be much more interesting with a little more depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the reviewer who occasionally upset her), a taxi driver in pull-outs and dance sequences (if Sam & Grai were so big dancers, I'd love to see that more because the parts that were shown to us were really better than most of the rest of the movie). It could have been better.
