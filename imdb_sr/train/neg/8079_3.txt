Another movie with interesting premises and some amazing special effects that fall into the garbage can. Boring direction and performance (with the exception of the lovely Annabel Schofield who has a lot of brunch as a brunette and probably deserves better material, and a sincere Charlton Heston) deserves the evaluation of a real stink. It's incredible to watch Heston perform his usual pair and show how badly this movie is. She even plays in a sub-store that only interested me to see how it relates to the main line of the film. The way they ended the solution was that they were not. It simply falls from the end. Really. Do not waste your time on this.
