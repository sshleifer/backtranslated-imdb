I can not figure out how someone can get the budget for the film so badly. It's like the TV station is desperate for anything, anything. They are buried under a bunch of snow, the stream constantly flickers and extinguishes, but magically there is a backlight that remains constant. Where do all these (false) lights come from? That and all that stupid quarrel between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive. It tries to create a sense of urgency and help people. But because it's so bad acting and acting, you will not fix your Florence Nightingale with this movie, I'm sorry. I join negative feedback and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever.
