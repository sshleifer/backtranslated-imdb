This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted to get up and go to strip 4, but I dropped it out. Now I consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide Sanskrit posters? I thought that the main actor (George Calil) was particularly incompetent. Apart from bad acting and passionate shake of the camera, I thought that the September 11 events as the reason for "Larson Lunatic Implodes, full screen near you" were shameful and dishonorable on September 11th. Using a phone call from Larson's wife, Sarah, allegedly from one of the terrorist planes on that day, was terrible. The camera shake did not bother me because of the cold heart.
