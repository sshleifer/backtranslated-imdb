DO NOT READ THIS FILM CONTENT. I spent time and money on it and I drove quite a bit about it. The acting is comparable to high school performances. The scenario is shocking. There is no complication. Twenty minutes from the end (for which I believe I should be rewarded for reaching) I had a headache of all screaming, crying and twisting the five girls. Most of the violence is (rarely for the film that is proposed today, not graphically, but I found the characters so damn irritating that I wanted to see them, and certainly every person involved in making this part with ** t, die in the scariest possible ways. I spent ten more minutes of my life in order to save you from a very poor 100 minutes. Do not do this.
