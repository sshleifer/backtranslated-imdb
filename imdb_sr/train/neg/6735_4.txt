The best thing I can say about this movie is that it's well-timed. She did not fall. The next best things are the accompanying performances of an actor who plays foppish horseback riding Edward, always a wonderful Holland Tailor, and an actor who plays Tailor's husband. An actor who helps to criticize Messing's potential clothing in the early stage brings a wonderful absurd success in the process. All right, that's on the positive side. Dermot Mulronei, whom I adore, is much more convincingly expressing contempt for Messing than in any other scene in which he is trying to be either business or supportive. As others have noticed, there seems to be no emotional investment in this venture, except as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to take the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulronei. She does it adequately, but she just is not a strong enough actress to pull all this without help. Give her "E" for effort and "C +" for achievement. Given Mulronei's indifference, the only thing that could help Messing would be a brilliant cavalier performance of iron from an actor who plays her former bridegroom, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak, hectic, and impersonal. If I tried to further analyze this, I would obviously have paid more attention than most people involved. It's safe to pass the time if you have nothing else to do, and less disgusting (and less creative) than The Vedding Singer, but it's far better for you to look again at the "My best Friend's wedding".
