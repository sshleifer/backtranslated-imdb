At the time this film was released, I watched Chorus Line four times on the scene and quickly predicted the production of a story film. My wife and I were on the line for hours before the cashier opened on the day the film was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a blow to the stomach. First, the story is "moved out", so to speak, by including scenes that were not within the boundaries of the theater. These limitations are a major part of the meaning and influence of the story. Second and Third Together (Assign Your Order): One of the original songs was removed, with a very dynamic dance number; a song that was not in the production stage was added. What do you say ?? I am confused! The only reason I gave this movie to 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performer. Now I've been watching the Chorus Line on the scene 6 times, and I would not mind to see it six more times before I die. It is superbly written, with beautiful music and sincerely true stories. If you want to see a musical that includes a great audition for "call for livestock", I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line, take a look at the scene.
