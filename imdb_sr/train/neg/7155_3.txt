I'm sorry, but this doctor did not like me. I can imagine a million ways that could have been better. The people who made it obviously do not have much imagination. Interviews are not interesting and there is no real insight. And the video was not compiled in a very informative way. It's a pity that this is a movie that really deserves special features. One thing I will say is that Isabella Rossellini becomes prettier than the older. All taken into account, this gets only "4."
