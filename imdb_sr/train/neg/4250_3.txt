It's like what other Dracula films are always doing, Dracula's servants are always on the side of Dracula, which disappointed me at the end. Regardless of the fact that a person wants to remain a vampire or not, I would like to see something like in the first movie that the minion fights against its master. It's very interesting (since you can almost predict how the story goes) than either a priest or a D. Won in the game (we need some surprising pitches!).
