Americans have a range of fruit flies, and if something does not happen within the range of typical advertising, we often lose interest. I discovered the exciting fact of this film: someone has to obey the pillars for high tension and it works according to schedule! And guess what, you really would like to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). The characters are interesting and very interesting. I usually do not watch such a late TV program, so I can not recommend this movie, unless watching a dry color is not your idea of ​​two hours of your life.
