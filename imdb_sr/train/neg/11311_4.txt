I vaguely remember Ben from my sci-tech days of the sixties, I worked on several interviews and biographies of obscure actors, especially Ben, actress Fai Spain and Jodi Fair, who played Angel In 1961 The Ioung Savages. Ben was one of the people at the low-key Sci-Fi zone in Chicago, around 1970, when I had a nice conversation with him and his "career" and life. All this has been published in a long forgotten fan of the day. I wish I still had copies of those interviews, but the time is up, and any of these people would certainly not remember me so many years later. Ben was a really good man who lived (the counter of those days did not even pay them to his guest unless, of course, there were big stars, and even then he was paying a few hundred dollars, most! It's good to know that Ben still alive and hit him! How can I do the remake of the Creature, but 50 years older!
