This movie is basically about some girls in a Catholic school ending in trouble because they put red in one of the shampoos of their schoolmates and after being punished for this, they decided to go to Florida for a vacation. On their way there they meet with some types in a local restaurant and decide to meet later in another location. The girls end up on the road next to the forest and stop for some time, and while one of the girls decides to walk a little around, she sees a murder in which the local sheriff himself is. She gets scared and runs to tell others what happened. Other girls decide to look at her, and two of them kill the killer. Then the murderer kills the two remaining girls and is placed in a local prison cell. In the meantime, the deputy sheriff keeps girls and despite their insisting that the killer is a sheriff, he both ignores them and behaves like an ignoramus and everyone else in this movie who simply can not put two or two together, and especially some bad detective work. on that. The best part was the scene of rape between a murderer and one of the girls where he decided to rape her in jail and it seems that the girl actually wants to rape this man, and a naked sight on her chest for which I admit she is good, but before their lips meet with other things in mind. This film reminds me of the low-budget thriller "The Blood Song" in which Frankie Avalon looks at him, the same motif is just a different character. It's not a movie worth paying for even a movie from the '80s, and the end was the worst finish I've ever seen in the film and left me the money back!
