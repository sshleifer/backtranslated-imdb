The writers probably did not have experience in the military, and probably never looked into the book of history, but I still continue to credit this cheaply-produced war film for a long-term view of the role of black soldiers in World War II. br /> Action is confused and incredible - any episode of Combat! it has better production value, or it's interesting. Seeing that New York Giant Rosie Greer is worth the money I paid for this. The Art Direction is the fifth course - men wear uniforms in the Korean War, and there was a pretty bad time when the US Army arrived in Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I do not think the terrain looked like Northern California. The scenario never explains why black support troops are used as combat troops. There is a nice touch that shows that some of the men wearing Springfield's rifles instead of the M-1, with which they would probably be issued second-rate soldiers. This basic story idea (a racist southern officer who commanded black troops) was supposed to expand into a large budget production then, and now it's not too late to try it out. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film who have made an effort. I recall seeing it some time ago and thinking about it being set up in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops there in 1944.
