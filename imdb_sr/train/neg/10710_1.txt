Dolph Lundgren plays the templar who comes to New York when an archaeologist discovers a key that unlocks Christ, of course, the demon is only a few miles behind Dolf and does not kill as easily as it passes from the body to the body. (Like Fallen without uncertainty) Of course, Lundgren is out of his element and the film is completely invisible. I admit I'm a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, trying to watch his movies whenever they are on TV. I caught Minion and the boy I ever disappointed. This film is terrible. With action sequences so poorly placed and poorly arranged, you can hardly think of a sense in the arena of fighting. The worst of all is that Lundgren's utterly unpardonable perf is a stubborn priest (!) All this worsened that the film was such as to get rid of Fallen (who was good) and End Of Dais (which was bad but better than this ). this movie is the worst movie I've seen from Dolph Lundgren. That literally has nothing to recommend. It's terrible and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, Last Varryor and Masters of the Universe. 1/2 * Out of 4- (Terrible)
