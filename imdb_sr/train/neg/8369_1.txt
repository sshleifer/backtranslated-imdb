Since this image is classified as "pure entertainment" and since there are already many comments about it, I would like to refer to something relevant for the abuse of humor. We see that Marlon Vajans plays the role of the joker in this film. Of course, as long as he was involved in the work of casting, he always acted like a little man - the actor can change his usual dress, but can hardly change his physical appearance - the other can be an advantage when needed. As far as I am far from what I expected, I saw an image that is being disguised, pretending to exhibit various aspects of a baby's life by the mistake of a forty-year-old criminal. And with a funny happy ending. What's the matter then? Many elements are mixed, some of them are basic violence, sex and criminal activities, among which the story is poorly composed and somewhat lacking in common sense: where is Vanessa when she broke the peace of her house and the life of her husband? In addition, the diamond is even higher than the first in the world Cullinan! But the most interesting aspect is an unceasing attempt to make the little man a superman, showing his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. Diamond is precious, hard and brittle; can not be cut off by any other material, but can only be won by the hot blood of the goat. That's why it's no longer a diamond but a piece of the remains.
