I did not expect it to be a great movie, but I did not expect it to be so terrible. I hated my mother so much that I had to turn the channel. I turned it around, hoping it was just one part of the film, but not. And in order for his daughter to sit there, it would be unpleasant for him, or almost ceased to engage in work, or to be taken into madness in his home? Are you kidding on my account? I raised my mother's respect (and even fear), but I would quickly put her in the closest hotel if I proved that it was embarrassing in my house. I was expected to follow a series of rules in my mother's house, after all. Nothing from that I bought. I tried to give him several opportunities, I really am. Sorry.
