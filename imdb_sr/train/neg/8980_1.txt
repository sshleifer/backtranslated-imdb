I'll never forget the night I saw this movie. We were on a submarine in the North Atlantic Patrol and this was a planned evening movie. We all gave up after the second round. They did not even try to show it in the middle of the night. Instead, I decide to repeat ... This is all I have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment must contain ten lines. I should not make a comment by random words, so I'm just going to continue until I get my ten BS lines. I could not find George Goble on the list, but I remember him in the movie. The son was terrible, and the songs were worse.
