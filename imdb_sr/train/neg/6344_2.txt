Well, I'm freaked out, Voody Allen's movie I left after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a movie I've seen less than half, but I hope you understand why). In essence, it has become apparent very early that we will be under the patronage of the screen with: a script that sets its appearance as if it were with points; actors who all tried to be characters from Hanne and her sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigni), and were badly referred to; and the camera that was standing around, just that there would be nothing to shoot, but to chat and the actor is delivering it. Drama? No one; This is partly pre-narrated, but action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. Perhaps I went too early in this case, but by then I decided against another hour and a half -Liner-Allen clones. The script has its funny moments? I went almost completely on the back of Vill Ferrell's passages in the trailer (hooked again to the trailer, doh!) ?? but it has little tempo to let them fly away nonchalantly, as it is best. Above this there is no fluidity. Speaking about the wood of this film, the forest looks like they want: the opening discussion about coffee is the worst case. The only thing you should do with numbers is the potted revievement? 2/10.
