If you liked Grinch's movie ... look at it again, because this was not even close to such a good translation of Seuss' movie. Cat Mother Miers is probably the most disadvantageous figure in the grace screen lately. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs with his own jokes with a terrible sound, which is the only laugh I've heard in the theater. Even children did not like this, and children are laughing now. Save your money and go to Loonei Tunes: Back in action if you are really looking for a fun family movie holiday.
