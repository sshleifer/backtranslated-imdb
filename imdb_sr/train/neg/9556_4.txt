This film is mainly hunting scenes and special effects. The plot is very weak. Most conversations on the computer were just a mumbo-jumbo. I watched this because I was a big fan of the original movie about war games that was based mainly on computer facts and real computer terminology. This film did not have any of that. Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and very unrealistic real computers and networks, but they were just poor. It's like it was written by someone who has no understanding of real computers. The Ripli game was lame and was actually just an arcade game. There is no real hacking, so what is the point? The film was boring. Lame Sequel.
