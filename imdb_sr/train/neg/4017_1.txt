Yes, this movie gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult movie. Still, I did not like this at all. When it comes to a woman who suicides on a scene more suited to the horror film, she is given the opportunity to return briefly to Earth in order to live the life of a lust that she has never had in her daily life. Crappi sex scene to follow. Why they are crazy, because they are so hard to try to be artistic, which deprives them of a real sexual act. I think we're looking at pornography for sex, is not it? Young girlfriends Blue also do things in an artistic way, but it's still very erotic and nice to watch. Of course the girls are very sweet in it. We have a pretty unattractive main actress here and it does not help things. If you believe that the lead in your adult film is inconceivable, there is no artistic vision that would make me enjoy the film. The scene scene moves from god to bizarre ... I mean, one of them is a snake. So for me this movie just fails because it does not excite me at all, it turns me off.
