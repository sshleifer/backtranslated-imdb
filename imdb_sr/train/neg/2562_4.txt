I'll start by saying that this movie has a funny point in the beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? George: I'm New George. The studio is too cheap to pay for Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the role? George: New George is lucky, I suppose. Unfortunately, it's the only fun part in the whole movie. It was still fun ... But again, I was just having fun ... I would not say this is the worst movie I've ever seen (this title goes in a terribly non-funny movie about disasters ...), this film falls to 7th place on my list ... If your child is easy to entertain, you will enjoy this movie. If you are a movie viewer who wants a good, funny movie, you'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one.
