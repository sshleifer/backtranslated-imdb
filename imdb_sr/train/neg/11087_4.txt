Guy Madison, the American leading man of the second order, plays a character whose glory was preceded by this Spaghetti Western? which, having very modest credentials, is essentially routine (although it has a pretty good result). The action has a mild interest: the title, incidentally, refers to a wounded man who was involved in a killer assault by a gun at a ranch? possession of the family of the persecutor, cavalry agent Madison. The younger brothers and sisters are decisive that the injured party, which is now in charge, leads them to the responsible gang leader; after all, the identity of any mysterious man proves to be a surprise? and both, ironic, intertwine with one of the nurses (the other is raped during the raid). Euro-cult star Rosalba Neri seems inconspicuous as a tavern in the lounge and Madison's ex-flame.
