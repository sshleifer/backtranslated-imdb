Oh, come on, people give this movie a break. One thing I liked was ......... I'm sorry, I'm still thinking. Oh yes!!!! When John Vaine came and shot the bad guys. Oh, I apologize, the wrong movie, I was thinking about a better movie. To see, I'm still trying to defend him. Oh yes, the fish that was from Clueless was in it. Do not put Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you made a dooooosie. Hey, one thing that has never been done in the Western, even female actress, actually hangs a woman with a hangman. It may be the first in the west. Although her neck should have been broken and she has survived the temptation, however, you have to give the director some effort to first try the Western one. Also, I have never seen a lynching woman in any Western, although it did not happen in this movie, I just thought I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be made right after that . Ed Vood's Bride Of The Monster # 2. Maybe it's what the creators of this movie went. Orginality, especially with all African actors and oriental cowboy. Heeei, if the manufacturers of Gang Of Roses want to continue this mess, you could have such a slang like: "Hey, do not worry about my house friends" and "talk to your hand, honey, talk to your hand "You could have a deputy sheriff who said:" That gun was totally a man, totally. " You know such things.
