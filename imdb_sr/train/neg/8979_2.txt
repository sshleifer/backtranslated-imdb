Jon Pertvee said: "It's very difficult to be funny, but very easy to be stupid." Well, if that's the case, PASTI FACES is "Very Easy". David Baker (as a director / screenwriter) and his actor seem to be under the impression that the comedy involves the theft of scenes and styles from top-level Britcoms like LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely undeveloped script and jumping up and down a very quick voice very loud. Alan McCaffrey is particularly suffering from this type of OTT performance, but not enough to destroy the film, as there is not enough film to break down. PAST FACES is awesome on all fronts, especially in scenarios. I could not understand why this ended in the way it was, it just seemed to stop in a very quick and foolish way. Oh, and other obvious mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the United States and a green card to work there - this movie would be that you could get out of the plane and start a new life in America without any permission - that you are still paying donating blood in America - People I know in America and who donate blood tell me that payment for donations has stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any kind of weapon from a weapons store. As far as I know, weapons laws in America vary from country to state, but no weapons stores are sold against a tank gun. So we got a very wrong view of America from a very unreal and so insensitive movie. Perhaps this is a revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of Scotland? Perhaps, but this does not prevent PASTI FACES from being a comedy comedy
