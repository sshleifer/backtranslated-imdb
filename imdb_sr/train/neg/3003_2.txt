We all know that countless guys have adorned a slasher genre from the 80s and often deserve nothing but our deepest depravation. Maybe it's a bit hurry, but damn if the "Slaughter High" was not terribly unoriginal, even for a slasher movie. To a large extent, the plot involves a child in high school who has been humiliated in a cabin like Carrie and returns to the oronule building to illuminate a group of former abusers who all appeared in memory. As you would expect, a massacre lunatic was killed on April 1 through electric shock, ignition, hanging and chemically modified beer. I have a lot of problems with details about the setup and settings of this movie, but considering the end, I feel the need to reject my complaints and just say that it is a total waste of time. Ignore every thought to see this movie ...
