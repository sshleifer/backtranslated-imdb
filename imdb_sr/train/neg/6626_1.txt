I saw a movie and got drunk, because the movie was dumb and boring. I thought that the frame of the gopal varma would justify my work, but unfortunately it failed and the whole movie broke down and they broke the "sholai". actors and team were bad. the entire theater was asleep while watching the film, some fled in the middle. The act of amithab bachan is bad, I thought this film would be the greatest hit of the year, but this film will be the biggest flop of the year, of course. No one respected their work, including the Ajai Devagana. this film deserves no audience. I bet this film will collapse. "THE FAVORITE THIS FILM SUCKS"
