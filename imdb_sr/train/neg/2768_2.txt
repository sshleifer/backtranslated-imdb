This film was terrible. They did not develop any character at all, and the story was terrible. It definitely slept. You expect the action scenes in this movie to be its strong points, but D-Vars will surprise you even with lowering in that department. Also, the acting was just a step above the level of low-budget porn movie. And I mean it seriously. In fact, I was happy to see the end of the loan on this, because it was so bad !!! Please, whatever the people do, do not waste time and money on a shitty movie like D-Vars.
