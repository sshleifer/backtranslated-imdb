I read the book Celestine Prophets and looked forward to watching the movie. Keep in mind that the film is loosely based on the book. Many of the most interesting points in the book do not even appear in the movie. This is at best the movie "B". Many events, characters, the way the character communicates and encounters in the book are simply changing or not appearing. The flow of events that are in the book are very smooth, agitated, and watched as if you were a child. Character development is very bad. Characteristics of characters differ from those in the book. The direction is similar to "B" horror. I realized that the movie would take six hours to present everything in the book, but they showed the base for the game missed a lot of points. Casting was very good.
