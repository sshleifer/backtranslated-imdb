OK now, let's see. What was funny about the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people falling in the water, stupid ships and funny comments between the two teams. In this film they have turned the accent to the maximum, it's not good. A lot of people fall into the water for uncertain reasons, there is no good. Boatcrash, check it out. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried but failed. Also, there are too many people who follow in this movie. This film should be about what is happening on the water, not on the land. I'm sorry I have to say that it's too far between fun parts and that film sponsors are maximally exploited. Not good. All in all, I give him four out of ten because he has some funny things.
