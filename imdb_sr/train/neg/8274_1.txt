Ah, this movie had so much potential! A good actor of quality B actors, thighs Jessica Simpson and ... that's it! I think that some guy in an unnamed marketing department had an idea. Basically, let's make some kind of a legally blue film, but you do it in New York. This great, bright city of chance, power and money, and where everyone is insensitive, powerful / hungry man. Add Jessica Simpson, a little town bimbo, Owen Wilson's brother, and for some reason without cause, Andy Dick (you must ignore this film only). The main story: /> The boy leaves the girl for New York, the girl follows, the boy screams, the girl stays in New York with a cousin, gets a job under false pretenses, mucks himself, the other boy sucks (brother Wilson) and together save the day a kiss. Several words come to my mind when I think about this movie, i.e. sharp, horrible, unbearable, unbearable and xenophobic. Just do not watch this movie, be happier. One reviewer called on Guantanamo and I definitely agree with him. This film is shocking. And I know what you think ... at least at some point I'll see the Simpson naked or close. It will not happen, spare time and IouTube. You'll have a better sexy time! Editing movies is poor, acting is unbearable and why use blue screens? In conclusion; this is a film release to be punished to the maximum. Another question is why Villie Nelson always plays some kind of paternal figure in almost every movie about Jessica Simpson and why she does not have a black, Latin, Asian or European film. People in this movie?
