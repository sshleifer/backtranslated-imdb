Dark Rising is your typical bad, obviously quickly produced horror / sci-fi / fantasy movie. It has a weird, inexplicable plot with holes so large that elephants can fit through them. Most of the time I did not know what was going on, but it did not matter, it was a simple demon hunter who is returning from hellish dimensions to preserve the story of a camper with confusing things added to witches and a book of evil to draw elements and characters that do not make sense or completely disappear for no reason. The acting is bad, but honestly not much to do with this scenario I guess. There are several scenes in Toples, which is probably the only reason this bad movie was filmed (like many other bad films). Give this pass unless there is nothing else on T.V.
