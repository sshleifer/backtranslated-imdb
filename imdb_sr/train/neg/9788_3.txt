It's not that I do not like children's movies, but this was a searcher with a little redeemable quality. M.J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart, and the rest of the talent was futile. Hugh Lori can be astoundingly funny, but he is not given a chance in this movie. It's sugar-coated sugar and I would hardly like anyone over 7 years. See Story Toi, Monsters Inc. or Shrek. 3/10
