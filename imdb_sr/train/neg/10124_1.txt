There is no tension in this series! When an episode ends the act, it's so bad, the effects are so bad and the script is so terrible that the last thing to remember is that Batman and Robin will save the day. No, in fact, the last thing on your mind is to watch the next episode! This show is so boring that I can not see how it was made, let alone released on DVD! It's obvious that the effects are not in line with modern Batman's films, but even the script is horrible. Unclear confusion about the badge of a professor and a pistol or something like that, I'm not quite sure, because it's too terrible to follow. Watch the version of the 60's, or the version of the 90's, or even Batman Begins, just anything over this version!
