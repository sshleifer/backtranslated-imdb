This is one of those cheap TV films where the characters have lost meaning. The premise of the story, the kidnapping of a son by the boy's father is very good. But it seems that the story only begs faith. Whenever her mother advises not to do anything good, she will do it. It's a bit embarrassing and not worth watching.
