The film itself is not so bad; many comments point to obvious shortcomings of the scenario, but it is visible. What really gives me fears is that people like Justin Timberlake even get actors for films, and above all for movies like this. I have to admit that I never heard the name of a man before I was watching this, but at the time he appeared, I was just nervous. The voice is bullshit, the face of a bad passage of Legolas, holding is terrible and can not even properly coordinate all three. I said to say, I was thrilled when he jumped after leaving the discotheque, because I hoped Morgan Freeman and Kevin Space would only be from then on. It's a shame I made a mistake. These two and also LL Cool J give very decent performance, and they are the main reason why I gave this game 4. I see many upcoming films with a small Timberlake cast ....
