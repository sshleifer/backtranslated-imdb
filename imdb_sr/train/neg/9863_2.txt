Kristofer The guest should not worry, his top-level posture in the Mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble to be upstaged at the very least, especially with this extremely ungrateful hit in the RPG players. Jokes are out of the joke. There was not enough substance to last a typical length (especially rougher) SNL skit, and even less than 87 minutes of minutes that I broke down watching this mess. The great Villiam Katt (the greatest American hero, the house) deserves much more. One thing and one thing just make up the fact that I've seen this in my head and that it's publishing about it here, so I hope to save someone such a bad experience. My Rating: D- DVD Ektras: 2 Audio Comments; 7 interviews with different members; 4 deleted scenes; & Theatrical trailer DVD-Rom Accessories: 2 Vallpapers Easter Egg: Lighten the eye on the picture in the main menu for the short scene
