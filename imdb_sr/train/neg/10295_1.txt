There are many pretentious people there who will pretend this is endowed with some beautiful meaning, and that unscrupulous fools like me do not "get it." Obviously, this means we have to stick to Hollywood slag. In the book is every, a-hem, artistic clich√© - I suppose it is good that the director is one of the chosen ones. Almost the parody that is drowning in its own presentation. The director (almost equally uncomfortable) of the film "Ratcatcher" returns with another piece dealing with artistic nonsense; it's hard to understand and it's obviously a study of alienation. The best way to describe this movie is alienation for viewers.
