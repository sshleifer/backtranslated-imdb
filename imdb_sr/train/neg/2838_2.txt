Skip Mission: Galactica and watch original Live Legend episodes instead. The network took Parts 1 and 2 from Living Legend and put them in one action with a horrible episode of Fire In Space. Although Galactica suffered from online writing and a lack of time to prepare for proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in the universe is in itself one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the Trek revival series, and you will see the difference in quality between network sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.
