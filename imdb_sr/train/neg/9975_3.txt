I remember that I watched this movie several times as a very young child, and there were also parts of it (many in fact) that I did not understand. I think I saw him once as an adult and then I understood those parts. The only problem with looking at an adult was that it was not at all fun for me. What's this movie? Is it a "movie for kids"? It is not difficult. It contains a language and an object that is not suitable for children. Is it a hyperbole of what each parent feels like to go with his children? Perhaps, but why does it no longer focus on the image of John Ritter instead of Junior? When a movie has a seven-year-old film as its main character, in order to be good with its audience, it should be a movie for seven and under the crowd, otherwise people older than that will have no way to connect (even 8). Years would not want to see a movie about a child who's been younger than them all year. I am pretty sure that this film did not go well in the box office, and the reason is that he could not find a niche in the market.
