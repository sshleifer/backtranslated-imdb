There were very few films through which I could not sit. There was no problem with the Battle of Earth. But this, this is one of the worst movies ever made. I understand that Vhoopi Goldberg tried to act in him. I do not blame her. I'd be ashamed of having this in the summary. I believe this is a rare opportunity when almost every dog ​​in the movie is dropping on his face. That's what's happening here. Not to mention SFKS, look for a dune with control cables that are more from the back end !!!!!! Halfway through the movie, I was still looking for a plot. I never found it. Save trouble in renting and save 90 minutes of your life.
