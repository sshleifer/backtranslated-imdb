First viewed 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sidnei Pollack): - A DVD version that I watched under the title "3 Days of Condor" - so that the CIA drama full of relaxed performances makes it a very relaxed movie. The premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of the CIA research group who was killed by the image of Robert Redford, codenamed = Condor, who remained. Who killed them and why? This Redford attempts to discover while trying to avoid being the 8th victim at the same time. By the way, he is included in the figure of Faie Dunavai, initially because he needs a place to hide, and then he eventually helps him after a short while. This is one of a few innocent guys in the story of running, but this is not a lot of uncertainty. Uniform performances do not help, and ending is not enough for the audience. Although he has a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classical performers, stories and performances are not what they should be and therefore the film is not what it should be.
