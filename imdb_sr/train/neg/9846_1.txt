You may be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears in it. That would be a mistake. This is one of the nonsense films ever made. I waited for something funny, but nothing funny does not appear in this movie. Even the film industry recognized that it was a very bad movie and did not even try to promote it. It's a wonder that he's ever put on a video. I wonder how the deal made sellers to be in this movie. I wonder why people who are responsible for this film are allowed to do other bad films. It is certain that this film is a waste of money that is used to create it, and a waste of time to watch. Certainly there are high school students who could write / produce a movie that as a complication.
