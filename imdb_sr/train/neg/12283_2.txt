Student Alec Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is hit by a nightmare in a basement that lives in Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting off his hand, spitting worms, the soul that opens his chest and bakes in an open fire. After seeing his friends seeing him levitate "6 feet" over his bed, a helpful, occultally obsessed teacher (Donna Denton) suggests they sneak into Alcatraz to cope with their fears. Of course they go in the middle of the night when no one can help when things get out of control! The group becomes stuck, Alec Brother Richard (Tom Reilly) becomes obsessed and begins to kill everything. Toni Bazil of "Mickey" fame appears as a useful spirit by Sammy Mitchell, a singer of the Bodibag group. She teaches Alek how to levitate from his body and makes a dance intercalculation of rock music with a replay of the nightmare to extract the running time. All victims appear as witty ghosts in the image of Griffin Dunne in AMERICAN VEREVOLF IN LONDON. The scenario is full of holes for works, sirens dialogue and courageous comedy attempts. Good FKS work and cool opening (and Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that get any kind of credit. Basil and Devo ("Vhip It") are doing some songs on the soundtrack. Result: 2 out of 10
