From the very beginning you will notice how much they tried to mimic very clever and powerful 'cruel intentions', and how straight it was. You will also notice the awesome choice they made by Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then in the second scene, you'll meet two of the best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers like Kathrin and her mother. That is, if you can go through the fact that Kathryn was not blond in the first movie ... Then the movie continues, you see a cheap romantic story about a mile, and notice that Sebastian has already met Anette in the past, here's called Danielle, and Cecile , here's Cherie ... How original it is to bake. Then it turns into a low budget movie 'Vild Things' with lots and lots of 'turns'. As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he's a bad actor, he's good. He just does not have Charisma Rian. Amy Adams, who, in my opinion, is one of the most talented young actors of our time, once again brings. But with all the talents in the world, there is no way to save this garbage. On the whole, this "movie" feels like the episode "Beverly Hills, 90210". The result was stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Javbreaker' ... Yes, they used the score of JAVBREAKER ... Did they not at least be able to leave that person?! You want to pass this one. If you want more Cruel Intentions, see Steven Frears Dangerous Connections.
