I did not agree with any theology in the Left Behind, but I still found the books that attracted me and I read them 8 out of 12. An undeniable good writing and an interesting story. However, I did not have great expectations from the film. There was no way the Hollywood mainstream would take over the Christian series and produce a big budget movie. So it was done independently ... and it just looked like I was watching a very long TV show. He simply did not feel like a movie; he did not have a "film experience" for him, if someone knows what I'm talking about. So, the film was suffering because of that, and the low-budget, bad special effects for me were another problem. In addition, I feel that Gordon Currie was sad as Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of the NC is that he should have been this charming, brilliant, incredibly handsome guy who spoke English with almost zero trace of accent. I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found a pencil with Clai Aiken pencil, which looks like an employee in the month of Best Bui, and gave him a very bad false accent. So I lost a couple of stars for me. The film is simply not convincing when the main bad guy does not look or sound the way he should. The act was fine, but nothing about what was being said. Some of the scenes - like on one of the scenes for conversion (which I can not remember) - were the right seats for me. And some of the Christian rock music or whatever it was, it was really inappropriate for some scenes, like that with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom. In short, there was no bad movie, but it just did not do for me. Keep the books, people, it's much better.
