There really were not many stories in this movie. It freely based on events in the first film of Lyon King. It was assumed that Timon and Pumbaa met through their solitude. But there is not much more than that. It mixes some scenes from the original, and then ignores them how this movie has changed them slightly. But still, is it? I was hoping for something more. Instead, everything I have to show is an empty parcel with little explanation. I assume that if you wanted to see other mercatas in the universe of Lion King, then that's it. But, in addition, he helps a bit for lawyers for animators. Disneys really need to stop these direct video productions. He was really quite boring and could have used Jason Statham. "D-"
