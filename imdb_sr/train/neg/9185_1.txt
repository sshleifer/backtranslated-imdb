VOV! I did not know anyone would shoot this movie! this is terrible! I have written 5 things that I can say why you do not want to watch this movie. No. 1: "His greatest rave ever" where is that rave? I could see only a few people dancing around. 2. When they are in rave, I can see blood everywhere, there are no people, two demolished tents and one phase .. and what are they doing? drink! 3.Najgori actors I've ever seen! Captain and his team ... terrible! 4. When one of the people shoots out of the ordinary rifle, it shoots almost 30 times without the transshipment! 5. I did not know that every person in the world can fight as a professional! it must be a new thing .. I wonder what the manufacturer was thinking! "this will be a big hit, it will be a classic" .. surely stupid with ** t anyway I do not see this movie, its waist of time. MY EYES ARE READY!
