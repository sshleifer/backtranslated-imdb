This is absurd - apart from the Australian who reviewed this movie, I can not help but think that all the others who have submitted the review so far were involved in the production of Elektra, considering how generous they are with their praise. Perhaps, I did not really like conversion to strip-to-film, so I did not have much expectation, but I still found that Elektra was incredibly immodest. What disturbed me most was the fact that in this movie it was so much that it was inexplicable, which led you to think "ha, what is the relevance to the plot?" or "so how did this aspect of the character appear?" I can only hope that these are things that may have been somewhat explained in Daredevil, which I have no intention of seeing. In addition, the behavior of the characters in this movie seems to be the face of random moments that fit into the story, and you do not even start me about a senseless romantic underworld. I also (still) scratched my head over the fate of character Cari-Hiroiuki Tagava, which seems to have gone inexplicable. If I can give honor to this movie for anything I should be a fantastic location in which it was shot, but I otherwise got some enjoyment from Elektra. I know we need to suspend disbelief for fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this movie was so incredible or confusing (even by action film standards) that it simply frustrated me. Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks damn good.
