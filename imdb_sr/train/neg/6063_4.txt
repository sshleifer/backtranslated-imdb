"Masters of Horror" proved to be a bad arena for "episodes of messages," and while the definitive case can be made for "Screvfli Solution" (one of the best episode of the series, period), most of the effort to do so came as an anvil - Tactical and non-impressive (no more hinders horror than soap). And 'Pro-Life' simply combines reactionary attitudes with ultra-violence; Young Angelikue (Caitlin Vachs), seen as running through the woods, is almost affected by two doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who just accidentally drive to work in a local (and isolated) clinic for abortion. Angelikue's father, Dvaine (Ron Perlman), is a stone-cold, far-right sacred roller who will do everything to prevent his daughter from getting abortion. If for no other reason, Pro-Life has collected some rumors about its controversial issue, but John Carpenter treats this venture with astonishing indifference - it seems even less interested in filming the film from the script itself (which, incidentally, is bad); the slow pace does not create tension and simply brings the already entangled plot into a creep. Even when Dwayne and his sons hit the clinic, the pistols are burning, it's a startling event; Later, when the doctor is struggling with "male abortion", the scene is released as unnecessary and unnecessary - an effort to remove the insured film. Poor performances (Perlman's unfortunately lost here) are becoming an outgrowth of the script, and Carpenter's direction is exhausted, as if 'Pro-Life' is the source of his next hot meal. Until the moment when the creation of human-made spiders and a guy in a suit of latex monsters wandered in the corridors, you just need to ask what they thought behind this mess ...
