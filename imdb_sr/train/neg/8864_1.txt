After watching this, I lost little respect for Christopher Lee (this was over with time). This film was totally trash. First, they tried to reconstruct the completion of the first "Hovling", with incredibly bad makeup. Then they try to turn him into a sad excuse for the porn movie of the insect! The action is bullshit and the whole movie is just nasty !!!! The brother of the first-movie waswolf victim (It appears to be Dee Vallace Stone) is teaming up with Lee and another woman to destroy the group of invertebrates led by Sibil Danning, who looks like naked all the time. This is not worth renting (unless you want to waste time and money by watching nudity.) Try catching it on the cable. It would be so cut, it might make sense.
