I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but not as bad as this one. It's a movie that mocks fat people, there's no real story, there are bad actors, it's not funny and much more. Is this the movie you want to see? I guess not! I assume that the filmmakers tried to be original and creative, but it seems to have been made of a 12-year-old child without any film skills. The so-called funny parts are as funny as passing pies on people's faces, or breaking the wind. If you are a fan of humor, this is a movie for you! Do not spend money on this movie!
