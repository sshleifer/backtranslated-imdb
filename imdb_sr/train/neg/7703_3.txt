The famous master of the show enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly, she kills him and escapes while the old lady gets a heart attack. The name of the female killer is Sava. She continues to go to school and works for the evil of a criminal, Akai, who sleeps with her. One day, Sava finds out that he killed her parents. Even the biggest fans of anime will have to admit that this nasty action thriller is disappointing up the fest. "Kite" has a style, but it's still garbage. A strange story about a teenager who kills people as a killer has tried to be terrifying and touching at the same time, just causing the story to fall on his face. One of the most important actions is the sequence of action in which the good / bad Sava hero falls along with the bodyguard from the building, but the dramatic structure is not nearly as well orchestrated and the strange and grotesque animation of the character characters of the director Iasoumi Umetsu is terrible. Not only that, interaction sequences are simply creepy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
