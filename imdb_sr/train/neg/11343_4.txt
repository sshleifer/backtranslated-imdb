First viewed 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Drab and non-spectacular sequel to the original animated film '101 Dalmatians.' Yes, the film continues where it ended in the first, but the problem is that it is played as an original. One of the great things in the original was the pace of the story, which this one does not have. The animation is also very non-spectacular for Disney and everything we get is the same characters that go through the same story again. When Disnei will stop bothering us with extensions and re-work, etc. Etc. Probably when we stop renting or buying this central spring that they have shut down.
