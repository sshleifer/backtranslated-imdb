This film is a shit. He reminded me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which was also very boring. And "Semana Santa" is in every way even a poorer film. Just one good thing in a movie that does something for this movie Alida Vali. Alida is one of the big old ladies in European film history. I loved her maniac appearance in "Suspirai" and "Inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not have more time to deal with this movie. I'll tell you another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep fast ...
