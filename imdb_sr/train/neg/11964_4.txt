Billi Cristal is a co-writer, co-producer and star in this extremely safe and comfortable comedy drama about father and sons, adult irresponsibility and aging. Billi is a cardiac surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha), which prompts him to look for his alienated father (Alan King), a movie extra that loves the big star. The scenario is a sub-Neil Simon nonsense with one line in the abundant, flat, non-expressive direction of Henry Vinkler (stuck in sitcom mode), and the family conflict is ready. The crystal and the king try the best they can, but the king is overly eager, and often at the top. JoBeth Villiams has one of her ungrateful roles, but she manages to bring her innate, upcoming class into the character of a promising girlfriend. It's a comedy, I suppose, but the one that flashes tears ... shamefully. ** from the ****
