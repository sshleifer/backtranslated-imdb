I'm sorry to say that I saw this movie a few times. When bombed at the box office, she repeated overnight for about a month on HBO. I watched him over and over, because television was so bad at all - or was it at that time. I no longer look, so now it can be wonderful - as Samuel L Jackson says about pigs, "It could be a taste like a sweet potato pie, but I will never know because I would not eat the dirty mfer." Let's see. Dudley's play Arthur wander the desert, always a few steps behind Moses. He came out right after Life of Brian, so you can guess where the inspiration came from. A few mildly funny things take too long until you close your eyes and do not squeeze your teeth. There is one scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, they both pulled out and dried, dying of thirst. Then they meet as old acquaintances who do not know very well, promise lunch. It could be funny. But the scene that I remember most clearly is a meeting with a pharaoh in which Pharaoh is a black kid on the street that is made in full royal regatta. He must have read the lines because at some point before his release, his scene was overtaken by the Hollywood equivalent of the black street pronounced by Jimmi Valker vannabe (Kid Dino-vannabe). Or maybe Jimmy Valker - who knows? Who cares. They have turned essentially boring scenes into a very racist, very inconvenient, very long piece of excrement, one of those legendary things that just do not have to be exhausted, no matter how many times you try, and leave it there to someone else to deal with. So this is my review. If you rent this movie (DO NOT BUY, WHAT YOU DO!) Prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and six Corona packages. Now that they've rearranged the Poseiden Adventure, this one is probably high on the processing list. Maybe he will hire a comedy writer this time.
