This cowardly and offensive film has intrigued me. Characters are known young men who are often confiscated and often seen in a city at sea. Robert is an outsider, but he has his own music that could have been his soul. Instead, Clai makes Roberta a freak who moves on the road to cannabis and ecstasy and enters the wrong crowd. Clai seems to believe in "reefer madness" and Robert ends the film as a rapist of murder. You wonder how much the experience of this young director has a real life. Nobody can save the poor Robert. Clay leaves us a message that young Britons are out of control. There is a very unrelenting link with Iraqi insurgents; during unnecessary graphic rape, we are exposed to explosions and images of war. The film shows the extremism of male peers within its boundaries. Young bombers in London are pulling a parallel with Cley's hatred of a modern man. Clay implies that men simply can not help themselves to inflict horrible acts of violence. It is a miracle that the British film industry allows money to be invested in films that advocate such a propaganda division, when in London we are still withdrawing from recent attacks. This is Clai's first film, I would be thrilled to be his last.
