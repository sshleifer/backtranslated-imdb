I just watched him. A little laugh, but nothing to write home. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. (Long) DVD reel is almost exclusively composed of an attack of uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to hit an hour, but again, her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so "well done," I guess? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip, and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Father Julie Stiles (hilarious), in 10 things I hate about you is also funny here. He is great, but the best aspect of this film was the casting of Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours watching the folding underwear, and I feel like I did it.
