After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and I was not able to go to bed, I decided to have a good time while I was deprived of sleep. This film was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! Here is a plot (potential spoilers, if you care): a neurotic man with candy addiction (Josh Kornbluth) works as a temp for a funny company. Suddenly, he is offered the opportunity to "calm down", which seems to be the favorite phrase of this film. But with a secure job and secure income in his hands, Josh decides for any stupid reason he does not want to do it. He hopelessly throws out some minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fills me with contempt. His inability to send some "very important" letters over a certain period of time should be hilarious, but it's just stupid. Josh gets to know and deceives a lawyer and ends up in bed (obviously the fantasy of Josh in real life, because such a thing would never have happened). A bunch of other things is happening, but it's too rude and rude to enter now. In spite of the fact that this movie is charged as a comedy, I just laughed twice during it; for the first time was the first shot of Josh Kornbluth (my first reaction was to conceal fear), and the other was when he was in bed with an attractive woman (yes, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most horrifying person I've ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, fervent Jew, for whom I have to believe that he has sex with beautiful women. I do not sympathize with Josh's character at all. He is lazy and non-motivated and I simply do not appreciate unsuccessful attempts at humor. Skip it, even if your life depends on it.
