The standard "color-by-numbers" monster, filled with a bunch of routine devices for filming great creatures. It was as if someone had a deck of cards with complications from other films written on them, which were moved and shared. Whatever the lines and characters come to an agreement, they are thrown into the script. The characters are so clichely that you can play the game "Guess Who Comes Like a Monster" after less than ten minutes in the movie, and they will probably get every right - including an order to devour them. Many characters are so disgusting, that you take root for the creature to close them. Some of the main characters are: Billi Idol clone surfing with sharks, a loud brother fluttering with bankers, Captain Ahab with revenge, and Ahab's girlfriend who plays dancing at the bar. Oh, and a big, big beast that needs anger therapy. By the way, people are much quarrelsome, pretty girls run around with wet t-shirts, couples on exotic beaches, explosions appear in the ruins of the sanctuary, and pirates of greasy faces fall. Funny, in most cases, but one thing struck me: the recklessness of the characters when other people were killed. After a violent death, they make jokes with one line. I almost could hear the triggers. All in all, okay, if you have 90 minutes for losing and you want to laugh as bad a movie. Otherwise, you may want to skip this.
