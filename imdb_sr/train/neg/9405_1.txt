I just finished watching TV and what can I say, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm ashamed to be from Melbourne, where the film was filmed. Diabolic acting, amateur effects of makeup and really bad soundtrack. As for the plot, well, it's even more stupid! Some of the scenes left me stunned as it was bad. There is a reason why these films are put on television late at night - because they are total stupidity! Avoid at all costs.
