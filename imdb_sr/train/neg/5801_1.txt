Ivan (Valeri Nikolaiev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who explores unexplained. He travels to this small town where it is said that the witch (Ita ever) terrorizes the community. His car stops and he hides in a small building and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly he turns into a demon and he is killed, and the city is wondering who killed this woman ... which I presume was a witch, but I'm not completely sure. John is now persecuted by his spirit, or something else, and must have faith, or something, to win it. I really hate Christian movies. They are usually filled with lame actors, dumb stories and minimal effects. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian movie ... but a foreign film. Ivan's acting actor made the film more comical than terrorizing, because it is so tall and fierce. You will not miss out much if you miss this movie.
