I loved the first season. Quality declined slightly in the second season, but it had a great environment (Pegasus!). The third season was quite new and original and it was fine. The fourth season began to descend rapidly, because they never started to give us any explanation when we really started to need them so far. What the hell was the Cylinder Plan? Why were there two Cilone fractions? What was the purpose of Angel-Kare to lead the fleet to the devastated Earth-1? What did the last five Cylons have in the past and how they survived, or reincarnated? Questions do not suit everywhere. And then comes the end. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. All right then. But destroying the fleet ?! Dropping from technology and giving up any kind of urban life, and spreading thousands of people on paper all over the planet ?! It's not just anti-science, it's anti-sense and anti-life. And the philosophy of the play then seems that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle that goes from natural romanticism to a decadent capitalist society that invents destructively A.I. it destroys everything. It is without a vision, without hope for the greater future of mankind, and it is contrary to the correct scientific fantasy. And do not even ask me about the angels! Religious bench of the worst kind! Ultimate disappointment! The whole "all this has already happened and will happen again" was meant to refer to the previous incarnation of the series, not just the Earth we know. Creating a new performance somehow in line with the old one would be a definite move of genius. Frakkin shame. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10.
