I do not even want to call it a movie - it's a movie that should not have won any prize. The acting was terrible as stupid scenarios. This is exactly the kind of film that many people think to listen to the NRP audience, but it's actually disgusted abroad because of its clumsiness and a huge sense of "trying" through the movie. It's weird that so many actors who are familiar with English language, are so hard to work so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all those symbolic English phrases that have been inserted into the film, in Hindi and in regional cinema for the cold spots. There are several Indian films in which English appears to be completely authentic. Although not a great movie, it was a good movie and the language did not look "dressed". I'm ashamed that P3 got the NFA award in 2005. The only half-pleasure in this garbage was Konkan and a somewhat attractive background score. In addition, do not waste time with this movie.
