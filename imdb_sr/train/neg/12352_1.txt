How this movie ever got an average of six stars is beyond me. The scenario is so banal and sincere is the insult for which life is based. Cinema comes directly from the smooth world of advertising, and talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore, however, does not show any surprise by participating in this movie, if you look at her list of songs. All in all, a film in the style of "high concept" that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of.
