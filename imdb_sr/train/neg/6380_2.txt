Well, what can I say about this movie? I am speechless. I could talk about how this movie is always stupid, although one of the things I really did sing was music. And at the top of everything, someone commented how much they loved him. For them, all I have to say is that he is drawn from one of the best martial arts films of all time by Fistsof Furi with Bruce Lee. If he was still alive and encountered this movie, he would be horrified. the rest of the film is absolutely funny and losing the tape. I'm telling the tape, because the film seemed to have been unable to be filmed. Now I feel dumb that I spend 30 minutes of my life watching him. The only reason I even saw it was because my roommate took over from morbid curiosity. What is this world coming to?
