You know, I went to see "The Hills Have Eyes 2", wanting to like it. I really enjoyed the original, and the remake was pretty fun. Apparently they had more money to throw than Ves Craven did for special effects the other time. Although I still prefer the original movie, the remake was done well and for me it was some kind of pleasure. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a big popcorn movie for every fan of horror. Bring us to the "Hill Have Eyes 2". Man, where do I start? The action, or the lack of one, is thin paper. We do not break the exact new ground here. The army decided to follow the area and all these people were gone. So what do we do now? Let's send the National Guild to investigate. In the real Hollywood fashion, we have to make them the dumbest, and the worst soldiers ever seen. I've never seen this premise. To shorten the story, mutants kill military morons one by one in a graphic way. Once again, the special effects of Nicotero are great, but killing, no matter how graphically they become boring and predictable. I honestly thought that this film was done only to earn money quickly. It was bloody and graphic, but I considered it predictable, boring and not at all terrible. For me, it would be nice for this film to have one original thought. All Craven and his son shared the duty of writing, and he was involved in many of my favorite horror films, but unfortunately this is not one of them.
