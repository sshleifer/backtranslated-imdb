This is actually an insult to the victims and their families who kill the BTK. The events in this film are not near the truth. Why they could not make a movie about real events does not make sense because real events are more interesting than farms. Do not even waste your time watching this for free. A low budget and a shameful display of events that should not be a joke, which is actually what this film did. If you let me give a movie of -10 to this movie, I would. The play was exhausted and it seems to have been shot on an old VHS video camera from the '80s. Save time and money without watching this movie.
