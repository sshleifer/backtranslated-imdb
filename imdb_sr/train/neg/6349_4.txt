Voody Allen made some of the greatest comedies ever and I would seriously consider that Annie Hall is the best film ever, but if I really think about it, I'll probably think of one or two better, but it would be difficult. Of course, he had some films that were not very good, but not as bad as Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sveet and Lovdovn, but he had never before had such a bad movie as Melinda and Melinda. Not so tired and so immature, his films are usually funny and hilarious, but how did that happen, is it still our old good Voodoo? The action takes place around four friends who have dinner together. The two are game writers, and one of them mentions a funny story that happened to her friend. It's about a young woman who suddenly bursts unexpectedly in the evening. We never hear the rest because these two pieces begin to discuss whether it would be a better comedy or a tragedy. Then we begin to see two points of view. Both are focused on a woman named Melinda who has problems with drugs and her ex-husband. In the tragedy, she is an old family friend who, after attempting suicide, decided to appear before the door of her old best friend for no apparent reason. The comedy is about Melida which is found on the evening after having drunk 28 sleeping pills. They both go on a wild whirlwind of events that never make sense or fit together, or they make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some beautiful performances by Radhe Mitchell and Vill Ferrell, but they can not fit together. They can not stop him from sinking away from most other films this year.
