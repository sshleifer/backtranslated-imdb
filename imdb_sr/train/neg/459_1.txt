I was looking for a cute, simple comedy that would go through time, but the choice of this movie proved to be a huge mistake. I can not write any good thing about it. First, the script is stupid and not ridiculous at all, relying on tired, recycled jokes and a festive turtle for laughter. In my book, it's not funny, it's pathetic. Low budget effects (if you can even call them effects) with terrible cinema. In many places she feels almost like an indie movie without any money. Acting ... I'm sorry, actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperate for some money that they agreed to participate in this? (seeing their recent filmography seems to be the case.) Despite the clothes, Pamela shows her age and as a whole, they do not even meet as sexy, let alone funny. This film is not even in such a bad category. It's just bad, as if everyone involved was sick of it. Avoid.
