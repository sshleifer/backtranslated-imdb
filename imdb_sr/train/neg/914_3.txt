(Revision in English since Swedish is not allowed) I saw this film with extremely low expectations and I can pity you that the movie has barely survived. As much as I liked to see Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen, the writers should have understood early in the writing process of the script that seven people were falling into the water, not original or funny. The story is very thin and jokes are used and predictable, those that are not, it's just boring. During the entire film, I smiled three times. Setting up Swedish Findus products is (inadvertently) ridiculous, why not only the big sign that speaks; "Findus did it!". Gota Channel 2 should not be seen in cinema or on DVD, just wait for it to be broadcast on TV, it does not take too long.
