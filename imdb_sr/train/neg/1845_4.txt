Losing control is another offer in the genre of the erotic thriller that can be considered a fiction of the film of the world. Usually this is a roundabout route to a killer intent, squeezed out by abundant turning. This is not an objection, especially when it comes to incredibly beautiful women who live permanently in this fictional world. Kim Ward (Kira Rid) suffers from the attack of the writer. Accidentally (or is that?) She meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who deals with her at more risky sexual encounters. A man refuses to disclose any information about himself, but Kim stubbornly refuses to stop the affair. Her agent, Anneliza Scott, thinks it will do wonders for her book sales. As with most films of this type, the outcome is approaching, but some things do not add up. I've seen enough of this kind of film to think, there's no change there - then I like it. They are so undeniable. The performances of the actors vary. Doug Jeffery carries a movie as a psycho / sociopath who you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good, but she does not manage to convince her as a woman in danger. Clai Greenbush as PI did not convince any one. Finally, a warning about the DVD being considered. The cover and disc have R-rating and operating time of 93 minutes, but the operating time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why scenes of sex appear shortened and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance was interrupted just when it started. 4 stars.
