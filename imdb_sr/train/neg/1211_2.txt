The only redeeming quality of this film is pretty original death scenes. In addition, this film is a great DUD. We have Kim Basinger, an enclosed housewife who slowly intervenes through the local center for the first 30 minutes. film, which did not add anything. Then the film raises a little bit as it faces four punkers who took 2 parking spots on this busy evening. They start chasing after her after leaving the local guard who tried to help her. From there, this movie is getting worse. I know only her film and you have to go with the flow, but it has about 5 minutes. she can not hide or find someone to help her. Instead, he drives up to half the built divide next to the forest. In a typical way, she does everything in her power to allow her followers to follow it easily. But now it is turning into a heavyweight. You understood the point. Under no circumstances do you buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type. It's so illogical that you will examine every scene. It's uncomfortable for Basinger and Craig Sheffer, as well as for other actors, as well as for consumers.
