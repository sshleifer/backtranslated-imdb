This film was so disappointing. From the blurb that made me decide to see Phantom love (why is it called?) I expected something artistic and imaginative with beautiful pictures. He had some interesting pictures, but that often seemed random and did not make sense. In fact, they seemed to be inserted to fill the time. In the end, the effect was volatile. I think the film should have been atmospheric, but it's simply not. The lack of a coherent plot did not help with the issues. It could be said that it was mysterious, but I think it was only incoherent, without an atmosphere. The main character was upset, but the plot did not attract me enough to take care of her situation. Without looking at the list of actors, I would not know that you see the main character as a child. The film has very little context for time, place or character. I did not prude, but the scene of sex (there were several) seemed meaningless and confused me, I recognized Lulu, but I was not sure if it was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband or a prostitute. Only when I saw the merits I discovered; the hairy back should belong to her lover. This film managed to do what was supposed to be shocking (dream sequences involving Lula's mother) look a bit boring. I will not blame the actors because I have nothing to do with them. I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film due to incompetence or because it was pretentious but the end result was boring. I can no longer bother to talk about it.
