I love bad movies. I like to rent bad films with my friends and I rip them for their duration. Then there are some disgusting movies like this one. Redline is not just a bad movie, but also a clear sign that the US film industry should, for the benefit of viewers, at least to read the script before the financing of the film. If the stereotype took Shit, this movie will get out of it. The story is unbearable, and the acting is ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have, perhaps, the worst chemistry screen I've ever seen in good weather, and even individual should be isolated from humanity and beaten bag of oranges until they change their profession in street traders (the only one that can legitimately qualify ). Moreover, as Angus Macfadien convinced himself to do this film, it's so far from me that I can not even think of an analogy. I am his loyal fan, but it made me examine him. Yes, I summarize. Few people want revenge for various reasons (if you care enough to know what they are, you are a bigger person than I am), so it turned to violence (I assume). The film is like Ouroboros, the snake swallowing its own tail, the fact that this endless cycle of confusion and dialogue that does not correspond to human ears. This film is essentially one big commercial for the first half of the year, and an invisible action movie for the rest, it should be avoided at all costs. <Br /> <br /> I wish I could find one positive aspect of the film, and I think this is the fact that in the end credits rotate. <Br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if this is your sing these two songs in the film, then you hack, and I hope that this age destroys. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you rent this movie in search of ridiculous experience, listen to the lyrics for the great songs Nadia Bjorlin.
