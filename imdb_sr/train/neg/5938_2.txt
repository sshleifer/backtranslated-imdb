if you did not live in the 90s or did not listen to the rapper EVER !! this movie could be fine for you, but any one for any fan or any person who ever listened to rap this film was boring and there was no purpose in the movie where I said it was interesting or I did not know that. another thing that bothered me was that it seemed to look like something in his life, and that was very easy, there was no pain that made the prison look easy, selling drugs, and even the tail was not realistic. I think if a movie where it was published in about 15 years from now it can have more of an impact perhaps! good rap films are pushing and stumbling, enriching or dying trying not to notorious
