"Truth" tells the story of three girls who go into the wild of Connecticut and eventually they are hunted by a maniac in the forest. This is a movie that would be played in America thirty years ago to mixed prizes. The film does not work much about what works with a low budget to mixed results. The movie can be watched, but it's not scary at all (blame some of the attacking scenes for it). It's a movie that you'll probably forget when you're done. It seems that you will never think to see this, unless somebody handed it over to you and said, "Look here," and that's what happened to me. If you are given a copy, the film is not worth the effort to see it even if it is possible to watch.
