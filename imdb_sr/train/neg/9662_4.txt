I usually read reviews before I look at the movie. Guess what, I did not do it before watching the TLB, and I must say that I was very surprised to see the above-average IMDb rating. I discovered that there is a complete lack of a story. Just throw it in (and, unfortunately, not the way Saving Private Rian put us in the movie), and there is a sudden end, which was very unsatisfactory for me. I have the honor, the wounded soldiers seemed pretty real to me, especially given the low budget. But get ready to smile ... Some guys are throwing themselves in the air after the explosion as if they were Olympic gymnasts. The middle airplane or salto during the First World War is too much for me, especially when it's done countless times during the movie ... But the parts that really made me laugh while I was almost crying were scenes that contained a close fight. Screaming and shouting German voices ... incredibly funny. It seems as if one actor / vocalist is speaking them, as they all sound the same, and sounds like a "typical" German voice. Absolutely I would not recommend this film to everyone, except for people who just want to smile because of the sad and banal quality of it.
