This is a fascinating horror movie. It makes such a little sense to start making some strange internal logic. Well, it would be if it did not disappear on the side streets, until eventually it fell under the weight of its indecisiveness. The film can not decide whether it is "an advanced man who turns into a monster" (like all those of the 1950s), or a film about conspiracy theory, or mystical. a contact story after life or ... or what? Choose. It's just a mess. Grotesquely overhead and firing in all directions, leaving free ends as they fly all over the place. It's like Tobe Hooper took the pills of David Linch. Unfortunately, he did not take enough.
