and does not help Rohmer's case that a few years later Siberberg came and made a huge deal on the same topic (with little help from Wagner). Maybe this movie has failed. It seemed so insignificant when it came out, without comparing it with a Siberberg movie, which was probably shot in an even smaller sound scene with fewer resources. In fact, at this point, I can not remember whether there are horses in the Siberberg film. All I know is that the German version is pure magic, while this looks like a college production documented on a film for archival purposes. Music ... la musikue ... it's not even credited here to the IMDb ... but someone based on "broadcasts from the 12th-14th century" or something ... so that It's not very helpful to the movie, it appears as inauthentic and cheesy, comme le frommage mon cher !!! Rohmer is one of those French authors who love his leading men, mostly pretty unattractive, and that does not help things. sold a special bicycle he invented .. I'm tired to think how to watch Siberberg on the video. I remember the last time I saw a movie at the theater. so bad that this experience was an incredible five hours of tragedy, but even then it would have to outdo what this version has to offer, I'm afraid. Points for seriousness, for chutzpah, but ... this movie was simply needed for more money. does not look like a medieval manuscript that looks like CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! Oh, yes, it just ends extremely arbitrarily with Parsifal who goes to church, and this sweet game of passion is inserted ... blah!
