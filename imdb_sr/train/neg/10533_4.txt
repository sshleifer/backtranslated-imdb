This version has moved a bit slow for my taste and I guess I have a problem with this game to get started. But the first film, it's a typical TV movie version of the show, which means that there is no original movie version with Villiamen Holden. What could not they afford to employ more than twelve people as a statistician? Why move the movie until 1966? So, can you give a little sister a line on the Vietnam War Protests? Why not 1963 and give her a line on the civil rights movement? Jai O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character, especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin, on the other hand, misses a lot of notes. He is believed to be a former BMOC athlete, but he has no raw sensuality to Villyama Holden. I always thought that Brolin looked kind of gorilla that all the women in the city would imitate him (forgive the boredom). Gretchen Moll was beautiful, but she looked a bit wise for the character she was playing. She did not project innocence or ignorance that is needed for a character. Perhaps this is because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters. But Holden was ten years old again. Bonnie Bedelia was pretty forgetful as her mother and Marie Steenburgen could not decide whether she played Blanche duBois or Katharine from "The Taming of the Shrev". As for Mr. Inge I always felt that stories like this young woman who chooses passion for practicality always require epilogue. "Twilight Zone" I believe will probably offer a epilogue with the episode "Spur of the Moment" in which young Diana Hiland was chasing bitter Diana Hiland, as younger Diana Hiland decided to escape with a type similar to Hal Carter.
