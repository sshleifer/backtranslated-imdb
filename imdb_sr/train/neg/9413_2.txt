I honestly disagree with the other viewers of this poor film. The only reason I did not think that 1 was terrible was the great talent of Carmen Miranda. Beginning and ending are the best parents because of her gifted singing and dancing. The problem with the rest of the picture. Alice Faie turns out pretty hollow. Don Ameche has a great singing voice, but with poor writing material, he comes so terribly loose. She is not happily married to Faie. It seems that Ameche's marriage by playing a song and dance, gets a second change to the reigns. Some stupid nonsense that the baron must clear the job and be absent, allows him to play both parts. <br /> <br /> S.Z. He is almost given the job to work here, so comic gifts do not have the chance to shine. Ditto for J. Carrol Naish, who seems uncomfortable in his role. This is a movie-related bomb.
