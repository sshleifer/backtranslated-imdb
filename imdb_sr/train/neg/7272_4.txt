The movie is a bit tiring. It's mostly a silent film, with most of the stories being delivered through a series of voices. Although such a dumb movie is not such a bad idea, this is one of those films in which the lack of dialogue and repetitive early scenes make it boring. You do not understand the reason for boredom until you get to the picture, and by then it's too late. The first 40 minutes of the movie is something like a slow piece of Mexican soft pornography. Later in the film begins the meaning of the first 40 minutes, but it's too late, because until then the audience is lost. At the National Autonomous University of Mexico there is some nice recording. I often wondered why there are no more movies being recorded there. The campus is built on the edge of the lava field which give the campus a very alien sense. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer made the movie in the way he wanted to see him, regardless of how it would be watched by a viewer who did not know the story. You can not ignore the audience when you talk a story.
