I understand what this film was trying to show. As the old people are often ignored and treated as an obstacle, which means that they ultimately feel unmanageable and as if their lives are empty. I have no problem with this message, but only I feel it could have been shifted in a way that is not so painful to watch. I enjoy a good artistic film, but when the film becomes too self-conscious art (as in this case) the result is often frustrating. Including photos of a person who slowly connects a 5-minute coffin, try to make a point, but in the end you're bothering the audience. pull it together. This is a movie that you feel you should enjoy or rate high and certainly has its merits, but I was too frustrated looking at him to recommend it to somebody else. Perhaps he has a deeper message than Roger Michel's other films (for example: 'Notting Hill'), but at least it was a movie that you can enjoy watching.
