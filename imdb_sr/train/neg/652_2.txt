I think it was overrated by the shit of PG-13! At least BRITTANI SNOV performance was good, and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good, but some other teenagers at a prom dinner like a friend were not so convincing. The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid. Death was stupid, boring and totally unoriginal. The film was very boring and highly overrated. It was not at all tense, I almost fell asleep. Another bad remake for PG-13, his awesome IMO movie. The ending was so dumb and the climax was very hot and boring. The film is also quite slow. All in all, the only good thing about this shit is maybe BRITAIN SNOW, I think it gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA, but besides that it was a horrible movie and horrible remake. Well, that's just my opinion. I gave her 2/10.
