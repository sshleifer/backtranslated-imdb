Kirsten Dunst is terribly overstated as an actress. You can always say that she's just "acting". I like Izzard. The plot is very boring. The viewer has no real connection with the characters, never knowing who he really needs to like, or even worrying about him. Slow, boring movie, with some laughter, but a little and not very funny. The plot is not at all attractive or tense. You can see that each plot rotates a distant kilometer. What should this film be? Comedy? Drama? Who cares? You will not get to the end of this movie.
