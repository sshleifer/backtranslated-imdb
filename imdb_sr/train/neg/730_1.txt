I did not see the first movie, and if something like that does not have great desire. Just because I watched it a few hours ago, I'm struggling to remember something about it. From what I remember, it seems that the main plot of the group is very boring people who stay in the house with that dark old woman on Friday 13th and are haunted by a board of wood. Some people are dying, the film is over, I file a lawsuit against the person who sold me this movie because I want to pay for the time I miss in my life. I will pay in Â£ 1 to take this film with my hand ...... oh wait, I already handed it to a "friend".
