I've never been to Paris, but after I've seen "Paris, Je t'aime" I'm crazy to visit this city! I was in New York several times and I love the city and its cities. I expected this film to touch me, feel like I jump on the plane and fly there, but, look, I'm sorry about the time and money I spent with him. There are no love stories between people or people and the city. There are many dysfunctional meetings and relationships or people who know each other and simply do not function well. Perhaps this reflects the characteristics of the city, where it is said to have thousands of people living alone. Can not you find love in New York?
