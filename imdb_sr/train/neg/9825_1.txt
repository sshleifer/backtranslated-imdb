This film seems to be sending the wrong message. It may be necessary without the use of Christ. I believe that other religions can enter paradise. I am a Catholic who goes to church every week, but I disagree with such Christian arrogance. This is the worst movie about the journey I've ever seen and I saw Timeline.
