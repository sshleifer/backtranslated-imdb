The Mummi's Grob begins with an overview of the event in the hand of Mummy, and then moves the story a few years before and across the ocean to the United States, where the current high priest and Kharis mum went into devastation and vengeance Those who in the past broke the tomb. While I absolutely loved the "Mummy" with Boris Karloff as the Imhotep mummy, and I really liked the "Mummy's Hand" with Tom Tyler as Khari (which he directly bumped into this movie), I was not photographed with "The Mummi's Tomb". It was made in a similar style as the previous film and has something similar, although in a new environment. Lon Chanei Jr is fine as Kharis, but does not stand out. And I suppose this is my main criticism of this film - nothing stands out. There is nothing terrible here, but nothing really exceptional, so the viewer stays with a fairly mute mummy story.
