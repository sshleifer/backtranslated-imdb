I saw it by chance, pointing to the cable, that I liked it, because I thought Sandra was pretty funny than I remembered. The only movement I had in the entire film was the fall of the jaw due to the terrible film I just suffered. The person who said this is one of the most entertaining films of all time, highlight one line, one scene, which is even worth laughing. She is a much better singer than I remember she is, but I did not want to watch the party. <br /> <I think this is a film that is working hard, because they think that it should not be viewed objectively.
