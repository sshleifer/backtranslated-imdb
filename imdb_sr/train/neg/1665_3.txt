It was a decent movie, I actually enjoyed it. But the end is so surprising! There is absolutely no closure and leaves tons of free ends. What happens after the concert? What's happening to her boyfriend? Did she connect with Grant? Did she come in the next semester? And what about Angelo? It is obvious that Holly's performance would tear down several angles to Angel, but she did not show anything to show how she reacted. So much is left in the air and very unsatisfactory. I do not know if it's trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it's a terrible end and I think it really makes a movie a scarf. I was very disappointed.
