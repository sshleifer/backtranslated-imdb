Oh, dear God. This was terrible. It's bad, then it was. This movie makes no sense. It runs all over the map and it's not clear what it's all about. Music seemed to be trying to be like Batman. The fact that 'Edison' is not the real city, it takes away. Since I live in Vancouver, watching this film and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. Why did not they make the right city? The only thing that was decent was the 'Tilman' in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role realistically, not over the top and camp. It was a pity that John Heard was playing such a bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the film was rinsing. A pity. I hope that some of the important people will see him, and at least give credit to John Heard where a credit is credited, and recruit him again as a bad guy, which should be there. on list A.
