I did not read any IMDb commentary on this film that mentions that the Jewish character in this movie jumped up and down as a little baby, because the gun was pointed in his face by racist skinhead while the film's lead black face looked stern. I do not know how it would be could be understood as a balanced view of university life. I agree that universities are not bastion tolerances as they should be and that the title would be appropriate for Singleton not to make his characters so wide-ranging. On the surface, he tries to show the image of Ice Cube. as a bad guy, causing Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who ends up in the movie epilogue? Singleton seems to point to white as if he is not able to sympathize (I did not say sympathy!) With his fellow black student, he can only go through racist skinhead. Many people who are abused by another race do not turn to extreme intolerance. Even the women who are raped do not immediately turn to lesbianism, which is more shown as a cult, not as a way of life. Sincerely, what is the point?
