I'm just wondering what is the purpose of shooting such films? profit? and to whom do they tell which intelligence your brain needs to watch something like this shit? This movie can be watched by children under 3 years old, if you are an adult, do not try to watch it. That's why I think Hollivood began to use cartoons in movie actors like this one. this laptop can be easily used in the restaurant, but certainly not in the theater, my dog ​​is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building. It is certain that this film refers to people without the only thing that this movie can use is to watch it when making a shopping list at a supermarket. I'm giving 2 stars to support Indian film efforts, but for nothing less or less.
