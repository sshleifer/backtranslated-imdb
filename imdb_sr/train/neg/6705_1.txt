This film is just a shame. It seems that Orlando, Florida, has become a more recognizable film space (like Vancouver's rise). Brothers were filmed in Central Florida, and this short film lagged behind the area (which made great strides with the Indie movie Valking Across Africa and the big HBO miniseries From Earth To The Moon). <br /> <br> I'll try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to shoot the brothers. He had the potential to make a new spin on the 'Boi Band' craziness. After all, both N'Sinc and Backstreet Bois come from this area. But, The Brothers probably collapse because of a bad letter. Both main characters are straight and almost do not have development (part of it could be amatuer actors, but some of them are definitely the way the script is written). Also the problem is choosing a joke. Many jokes are too repetitive (for the first time they are funny, but they get a little boring). Some of the 'concert' scenes are poorly placed (and many of these scenes, it seems, does not move the story in any way). I had great hopes in this, but unfortunately, a disappointing effort. I also hope that it will be best for an upcoming function based on this short one. But I think the best thing for director John Figge is to move to different genres (fast). Comedy is not its strong suit. But, undoubtedly, he is definitely one of the most prominent filmmakers in the Orlando area (it's just a shame that he is now unscrupulous and not known). <br /> <br />
