No laughter. Yes, I watched the whole wreck of the train, but only to not ask myself later whether Cleese came to his senses in the second part. (No, it's not.) This may be interesting to young people for you, to see that British "humor" includes black "jokes" like these, thirty years ago. What amazes me even more is to read the comments of other reviewers, who admit that this is not very good, then turn around and give him a large number of votes. If the vast majority of comedies you've seen even a lot worse than this, then I certainly pity your torturous existence. The humorous level of this show seems to be aimed at young children, but the theme is not. So, for whom is this? People who enjoy repeated and exhausted double moves, bumps, humorous drugs (interesting only as a short journey back to '77.) And other "low" humor. The three Stooges are still funny, and they were like me as a kid. They made some effort to make jokes. This, however, has been deleted. I am afraid that this is the end of civilization, if this is really accepted as worthwhile. Then you'll tell me that the tabloid TV is popular. :(
