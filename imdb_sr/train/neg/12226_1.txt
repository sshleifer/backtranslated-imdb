I know, I know, Plan 9 from the Universe is the worst movie, or maybe Manos, the hands of destiny. But I can not work on monkey monkey films. * Of course * they are bad. How can I be good? But if you are talking about movies with respectable production values ​​and talented banks, T. The words of all turkeys must be "Ientl". All the treasured foniness, all self-absorbing affinity, which stains everything Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaches its peak in this film. From his lonely top horror, "Ientl" looks back at "The Star was born" and passed the "Mirror Has Tvo Faces". There is nothing similar to that. What kind of emotional venture has Streisand drawn to make this movie, I would rather not speculate, and what kind of audience it was playing I can not even imagine, although I bet there are nine out of ten chances that you are not a member. The winner of the Nobel Prize and the Holy Guardian of Yiddish Literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so upset over what Streisand did to his story that he had publicly damaged her. It is a recognition of Streisand's impenetrable vulgarity that she not only did not commit suicide, but she continued to make even more horrible films.
