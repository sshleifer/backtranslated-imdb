Three writers tried to adapt the novel Jane Stanton Hitchcock to the tube, but this television movie eventually injected too much melodrama and simply did not know when to give up. Meg Tilly, an artist who fights, suddenly found herself employed in the rich, mysterious Ellen Burstin, who wants a wall painting on the walls of her unused hall. After finding out about the last gathering she had there - Ellen's daughter at the exit - Tilly decides on her artistic theme, never dreaming that her daughter died mysteriously before the function had even begun, nor that she and the deceased had a similar similarity . ! Two beautiful actresses provide their services with an incredible passage that does not follow carefully, which does not suit any lady in emotional intensity. Burstin's role is in the camp, while Tilly stuck in the routine of the dreamer. Only a series of late films (morning after the mural is over) is charged with a sincere feeling, anger and betrayal. The rest is a buff.
