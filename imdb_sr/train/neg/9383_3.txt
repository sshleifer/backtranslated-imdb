VERY BADAN FILM ........ and I Think WANT BAD ... The action is predictable, and that's EALLI cheeses, the creativity of the battle and the dance scene for the time being the only reason why I did not give the movie one, besides ... this is a def film that can afford not to look ..... I feel like watching a movie, the idea behind the movie was interesting one type of clich√©. .. I'm coming to the city blah blah blah, but I feel it may be a bit better if it's just not so cheesy, very badly depicted from idea to screen, I think. The plot is sometimes predictable, and the dance I can say in time is pretty good, the dance battle was good ... If you just appear in the movie and watch the dance scenes and make your own dialogue maybe it's 5 ... lol
