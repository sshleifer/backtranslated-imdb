This is a typical budget mess of the 1970s. It should be a docurama of crew in Bigfoot through Pacific Northvest. Each character is a stereotype, from the Indians to the cynical cowboy. The acting and narration are a complete joke. If you hope to see a lot of footage with big feet - keep hoping. There will not be much, and what can you do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder; it would look better than this movie. It is not that I do not like the low price of the 1970s; I work. It's about being a mess of bad acting, bad characters, bad story and no excitement that you just can not enjoy it. It does not fit into the category "it's so bad", nor can you laugh at how bad it is without the help of illegal substances. Mostly boring videos of people who camp, hike, horse rides and watch wildlife. There is an attack at a great rate that is completely stupid; I assume that our friend Saskuatch throws stones on the campers from above as they return their guns to him. Until that moment, you are strongly entrenched for the bigfoot to drop some stones on the director's heads and stop the whole thing.
