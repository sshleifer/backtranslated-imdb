Ben Stiller does not react as much as a reaction. And it works well. It is highly dependent on the comedy that takes place around it. In the movie There is something about Mary, the standing hair scene works just because Stiller is trying to keep her face right. When he confronts Merino with two other prosecutors, he is the sunniest guy in the room, but the scene is hilarious. In Along Cole Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to grasp. Stiller is surrounded by a series of comics. Hank Azaria and Philip Seimour Hoffman get the best lines, which he has too little. Saying that, Hofman relies a bit on body humor - you know we're in trouble when they go to freak jokes to laugh. A basketball scene in which Hoffman ham is completely outdated (although it raises an obstacle in the form of an opponent without a shirt that raises a smile - visible through Stiller's reaction). However, it seems that everyone works in a balloon, and the reaction is very small. Hoffman's and Stilller's characters could play a lot, much more. Aniston repeats his role again Rachael, but Stiller is not Ross. It's more "Joei with a crush on the Rachael" scenario. Poli is rom-com by numbers and that's his failure - he misses his heart. Do not get involved in the signs. With a little more work we could have a deeper story, but in the end, the film's failure is reduced to bad writing. It's worth watching if it appears on TV in a slower night, but you'll regret paying for the money to see it.
