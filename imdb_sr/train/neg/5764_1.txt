Scari Movie 3 is such a stinkfest that it's hard to say words. Movies like Malibu's most wanted film look like Oscar material, just say that. The original Scari Movie was a great party, one of the best 90s movies coming from a great team that had previously thrilled the world with Dont Be A Menace on the south central side while drinking your juice in the hood. But what the hell happened ?! After the tragedy that was Scari Movie 2, I thought the actors and the team would change things, but it's even worse. Within 20 minutes, I smiled twice. No laughter, jokes were recycled, and originality was obviously not a factor. The fact that it is in writing at the moment, the majority of people on this site voted 10/10, I made me feel physically ill. When there are great movements such as the School of Rock Out, which actually have jokes that are funny, everyone who uses their money on this bag needs to look at their head. No star / ****
