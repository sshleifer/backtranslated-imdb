Director Sidney J. Furie created a postmodern absurd masterpiece in Hallow Point that causes and constantly surprises the audience. Sidni J. Furie dares to ask what happens with tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of "plotting" and "characterization" when you remove the 'motivation' and 'reason' lines. The result leads me to say that my opinion about him can in no way be greater. One and a half stars. P.S. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, police officers are unsuitable, and organized criminals are full of folly.
