This movie is worth watching if you enjoy amazing effects. There are some interesting pictures. In addition, the typical Hollywood Ninety / Indecent Tariffs without glare. True to the title. It is not worth dividing the story. It's like brain surgery on a dinosaur. There is not much to start. It's nothing original and not special. So do not enter the story at all. Just look at the effects. As already mentioned, in the end it became a little tense, diluting the purity of a large FKS treatment of the invisible (and sometimes invisible) man. However, if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics, this is a view to look at (or not to watch).
