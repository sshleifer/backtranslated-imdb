the only thing that often appears in my head while I write this review is, I will never get an hour and a half ago !!! to show that I have not just blowed the air, I'll compare the movie with other films of the trilogy of cubes (cubes and hypercube)! as a sequel lost the advantage of originality but it came out pretty sharp and I even liked better than the cube (the story was better)! but the cube of zero in comparison with its predecessors is really not worth sh * t! a complete lack of good fk, very f * ck * d scripts and just a plain old bad actor do not combine well! for example: all the time during the film I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... it should happen and then it would happen, so it's not original! my advice: do not lose an hour and a lost !!!!!!!! Oh, and I hope this film crumbles and burns !!!!!!!
