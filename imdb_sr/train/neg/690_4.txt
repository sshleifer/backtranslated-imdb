If you've ever seen a slasher of the '80s, there are not many reasons to see this. Originality is often not one of the strong sides of film cinema, and this is something that this film is seriously missing. The film was one of 74 films that were on the DPP Video Nasti list, and that was my only reason to look at it. The shop follows a crowd of children who stay in the dormitory during Christmas. As they are in the slasher, someone decides to pick them up and this leads to one of the most beautiful mysteries ever seen in the slasher movie. The fact that this movie was on the list of Video Nasti is bizarre, because, despite several bloody scenes, this movie is hard to corrupt or repel anyone, and the gorier slashers than this (Friday, 13th, for example) has not ended. banned. But again, there are banned films that are much less than this (The Witch who came from the sea, for example). In any case, the conclusion of the film is the best thing about it, because even though the audience really did not care who the attacker was to this point; It's pretty well done. All in all, this is a gloomy and harsh treat that slasher fans will miss out too well.
