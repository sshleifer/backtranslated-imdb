This adaptation positively kills the classic that is favored by its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no idea of ​​the different Rochester character's nuances. I have the feeling that he never read the book, just walked on a set in his slippery panties and gave a summary of the character that read: "Grumpy, brood, murky trap." He plays Rochester not as a character, or as a real person, but as a wobbly grouch who never breaks a smile until he engages in that moment, he miraculously turns into a maid. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation was excited in me was unbelief, but also a sympathy for Charlotte Bronte, which is definitely turning around in her grave. Go and browse the book. ROCHESTER IS A LIQUIDITY. AND ON THE WAY: "PASSIONATE" LOVE SCENE DOES NOT KNOW THAT IT IS ITS FACE.
