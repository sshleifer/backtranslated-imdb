I did not think it was possible, but I found a movie worse than 'Be Melt'. This movie is really bad! And what makes her worse is that her second Australian film ... Shotted on what looks like VHS, and with a terrible sound backing for the 80's, she just gets worse and Up, which is hard to believe by looking at how the start is bad (a man hanging up and down in a white tomato sauce, anybody?). And why are their accents changing? From the bad New York dravl, to the English press, then clean Aussie! And this is happening to the whole team! This film also claims to have won a film festival on the cover page (I think it was a film festival in Utah). This must be a lie, because no one in the smart sense would nominate this for anything (maybe the Golden Rasberries, but I think it's bad for that). Come on, guys! This film must be number 1 at the bottom 100 !!! It has to be ten times worse than those films that are already there. Well done by the "filmmakers" of this garbage, because it proves that there is a reason not to see movies ..... 0/10
