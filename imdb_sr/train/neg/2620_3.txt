After looking at the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil take the punishment for torturing animals just because of their skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and in my opinion, better than animated. But there was no need for another. First of all, if Cruel returns, do not cure her and make her crazy again. Just make her go out of jail and it's a tail. I thought it was not so funny. Only one original puppy should be returned. I expected that it would be Lucki, since he was the most attractive, and besides, Roger and Anita. However, they decided to have complete processing and add not just a hundred, even a hundred, but only three puppies, and a parrot who thinks he is a dog (smart). Part of Gerard Depardieu was pointless. In the end, Cruella suffers too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She bakes in a giant cake. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first. It just did not work. It was too much over the top, and not too funny. I was really sorry about Cruella.
