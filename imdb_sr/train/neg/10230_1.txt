It happened on a copy of this. Not mine and I spent my money on this, I would ask the responsible ones and look back! All I can say is that it would be a horrible student film. Any understanding of the film's media is absent. The acting is terrible, the story would be discarded from the original Tvilight Zone series as non-original and chromatic, and the change in the tone of the main character's reaction to the 'ghost' is ridiculous. I just agree that 'great' reviews of this film are from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not fun or bad. Amateur in Extreme Situations! Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
