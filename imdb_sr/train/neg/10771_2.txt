For a few more years I did not watch children's movies, so I missed "Here Come the Tigers" when it first came out. (He has never seen "Bad Nevs Bears" although I've been working for the guys who funded this film, "Varriors", "Man Who's King" and "Rocka's Horror Picture Shov.") Now I like to check old or small films and find people who went to great careers, despite being early in a movie that is not very good. Just a few minutes in this movie I could not take it anymore and I jump to the end to see if in this movie is a young actor who went to bigger and better things - at least looking at his / her appearance will create an interest because the plot and the acting did not work . Look, look, in chess, I saw the name Craven's name as an electric pistol. He has already made two or three early sharks, but has not yet created Freddie Krueger or made "Scream" movies. Maybe he owed a favor and helped in this picture. It is surprising that Fred J. Lincoln in the hits as "Ezop", a strange character in the film. F.J. Lincoln, from the 1970s to just a few years ago, appeared and produced adult films. He was associated with bribing adult "The Ozporns", and this title is smarter than all the "Tigers" attempts of humor in combination. The fact that an adult actor was housed in a children's movie indicates that the people who made this film must have slept behind the wheel.
