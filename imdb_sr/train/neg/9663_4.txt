How cynics are writers to show. I may be an American citizen, but I do not have to see other Americans hitting their backs for hours to enjoy the movie. I am astounded that so few of them commented on the extent to which the dialogue in this film is completely humorous, sentimental and banal. The historical inaccuracies of the film are not so crude and offensive as in the "U-571" (which are changing British submarines to American ones), but you still feel a little slim. Indeed, the Germans in this film do nothing but admire the Americans between the battles! How sad, unnecessary! I just want to tell the writers: for many of us, it's obvious that you can not catch real people, with real problems, under real pressure, and that you've taken some very well-tested shortcuts. Happiness for you will always be a nationalist mature joy that will appreciate your sherpa.
