I am a great music player for Neil Iounga, and thus great praise that the film received in many alt-indie media circles, hit the first glimpse of Greendale that I could find. My excitement was short-lived, because this sharp story and the weak lyrical moment left most viewers either asleep or disappointed. Neil says the film started as a soundtrack, and the characters have been revived so much that they just recorded a soundtrack. Not the best way to make a story. No character really has an arch, and when "significant" events occur, the viewer does not care because the level of disturbance of the film technique is so high up to that point. The film is all the poems, and in this end, characters end up singing the lyrics while singing ... the technique works for the first stroke that is made, and after that it cracks on the nerves. It does not feel real or false, it just feels uncomfortable. Terrible acting, with characters who find one mood and play it all. Poor lighting on time. The only honor I can give to the film is related to several scenes recorded as news, but the technique is so much used today in cinema that this film did not contribute much to it. It's okay, but nothing I bought quickly. Bad movie.
