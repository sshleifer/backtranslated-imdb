This movie could have been much better with the script. I do not expect much confidence in the movies, but you think even homeless and urban Jack Mason would ask why a group of experienced hunters would want to employ him as a hunting guide. And when it reaches the hunting ground, the poor Ice-T plays its role as if it were actually going to lead those people through a forest that it had never seen before. How does Mason Mason find Thompson Burns in Seattle? I suppose this film is based on Richard Conwell's short story "The Most Dangerous Game". A few years ago I showed this film a class of 9th grade students after reading the story. I rearranged the film, cutting out all the senseless scenes and all the cursing. It ended 43 minutes.
