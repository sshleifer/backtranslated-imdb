Jewish journalist Justin Timberlake (as Joshua "Pollack") is confused when the accused in the courtroom whispers "Thank you" to LL Cool J Testimony Officer (like Rafe Deed) while leaving the stand of the witness. In the introductory sequences of this movie you get an explanation. You will see that the hot detective partner of Mr. Cool J Dilan McDermott (as Frances Laz Lazer) decides not to kill Damien Dante Vaians (as Isaiah Charles). Police officers in the city of Edison are so corrupted that they shoot at their suspects, steal their money and snatch their drugs. Regardless of whether she impressed her girlfriend (referred to herein as "Pussi") or conquered Pulitzer, corruption in the city does NOT well sit with the noble gentleman Timberlake. Timberlake decides to investigate corruption, reaches an unexpected volume and danger of life. Writer / director David J. Burke holds the film above the water, but barely. LL Cool J defeats Timberlake in the prize "Pop stars to the movie star" (known as "rapper to actor"). G. McDermott is having fun with his role. By mediating gravity in the process, actors are strongly supported by actors Morgan Freeman (like Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacei (as Levon Vallace). F.R.A.T. means First Response Assault and Tactical, but it is more important to know that "Edison (Force)" is played by Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacei (which appears to be lost). ** ** Edison (9/17/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dilan McDermott
