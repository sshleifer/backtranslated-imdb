I rented this film from a library (it's hard to find it for good reason) purely from curiosity. I am a great fan of Platha and this film was a complete disappointment. Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst films I've ever seen. The scenario is terrible, not because it leaves the original novel, but because it turns out without focus or intent. The scenes are badly designed and the viewer does not lead anywhere. What about a hockey voice about Plath's poetry? Lazy Lazarus has little to do with Greenwood's situation; Plath's poetry is completely misused. Marilyn Hassett is absolutely incredible as Esther Greenwood (or any 20-year-old for it) partly because of casting (she was 32 years old when she was shooting, Platha's age when she died) and partly due to the fact she can not work. Hassett is all emotions, no arts, no skills. The direction is central; the director simply covers what is there, which is not much. The only reason I gave the film and 1 is that 0 is not an option. I'm sorry, Silvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to adjust your fine work to something more appropriate.
