It's getting worse, the series is in serious decline. The first two sequels were acceptable, and since then we've seen buch really, really terrible movies. Robert Englund gives another great performance like Freddie, but the rest of the actors can not act. The story is that Alice, after spending the previous series of Nightmare, found deadly dreams about Freddie Krueger, who begins again. This time, the murder of the killer is striking through the sleepy mind of Alisa's unborn child. His intention is to "be born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice relieve her ghost in time to save her son? Check out the first three, miss the next three, and then look at the last one.
