When I saw IMDb users evaluate this movie on 250 movies, I thought it was too sharp, but I do not know very well that the low grade is absolutely correct. I am a great fan of Vaians brothers. I loved their Scari Movie 2 and even enjoyed the Wit Chicks. The little man, however, had very little laughter and jokes were stagnant. It is obvious that the joke will revolve around Marlon Vajance, who plays an adult dwarf recently released from jail. He and his partner, Traci Morgan, steal a gangster diamond. Things go wrong and the dwarf must put a diamond with unexpected steam played by Shavn Vaians and Kerry Washington. In order to return the diamond, the dwarf pretends to have been abandoned a baby who remained at the threshold of harmless couples. Of course, he is caught and the drama begins in search of a diamond. The film has some actors and actresses from Saturdai Night Live such as Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as from In Living Color. All these talents, however, can not help poor scenarios and jokes that were simply not funny. Special effects for Marlon Vayans to look like a dwarf were okay. I mean, it was not 100% convincing, but it was OK ... nothing great. I just want the Vaians brothers to make more efforts to develop scenarios with good jokes, not to try to support their poor scenarios with Comeos by their famous actors and comedy actresses. or television. It really does not cost any money.
