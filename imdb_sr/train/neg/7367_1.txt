I really start to believe that Seagal's mission is to see how his films can become shitty. This film was the complete and final loss of time to see it. My first complaint was the cover of the DVD on which they shot his picture and made him look thinner and younger when he appeared in the movie as a shit. He has a big belly and a double chin for him, and the worst and boring look on his face. The whole plot was funny to start and too long. The entire film led to the final where Seagal and his team had to take over a pile of people under the influence of the top secret of a military chemical adrenaline amplifier. a lot of useless dialogue, not to mention the ridiculous and constant sound of Seagal's voice even in the middle of the statement. The sound of the voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and he was pretty funny. The scene of the fight in the film was terrible. Half the time Seagal foug. You could not even see what's happening. There would be close-ups of how they bang their hands in the camera, and then the person who flew through the wall or something. That reminded me of the old Kung Fu series on television. too slow for battle scenes. I think this is the worst movie of Seagals so far and I am glad that I did not buy this movie or I would be very upset because I'm a big fan The action star quickly disappears and seems to be worse with every performance.
