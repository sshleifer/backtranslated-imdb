One of the funniest films of the forties, an unbearable comedy with a house with music played by Kai Kiser. Kier, the orchestra leader and radio star (and eternal fraternity in college), was some kind of predecessor Spike Jones, who entertained him for his guests and was supported by his cheerful family of musicians. He is engaged in playing a birthday party in a gloomy villa, in which poisoned arrows imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. Shindig is obsessed with a terrible judge, a scary professor, an ominous swami, many giggles of females, and enough bad jokes to fill three Bob Hope pictures. Songs (Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are nothing to boast about, and neither is the overly confident Kisser, who pulls it out with the elbow-in-ribbon material that turns around in ten years. * from the ****
