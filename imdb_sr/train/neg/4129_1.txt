After I looked about half of this, I was ready to quit and shut it down, but I endured to the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and does not work. The acting is bad - much worse than acting in T & A films from the '80s. There are several attempts of humor that decay and the movie is 100% predictable. Perhaps, if you are a teenager, this movie is appealing, but for those who watched a lot of movies, you will know how the film will appear after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in agony waiting for the credits to end. Do not waste your time watching this.
