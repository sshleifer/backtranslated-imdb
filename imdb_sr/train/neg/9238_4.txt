Comedy with a single note that probably sets teeth of modern feminists on the edge. Betsi Drake's department store is in love with the idea of ​​babies and marriage, and hopes for women's magazines as long as he does not spy on a super-bait in the form of elegant binge Cari Grant. The rest of the film is moving from one to the other, while the merciless Drake follows his quarry. I suppose the word "rude" only about the suspicion of Drake's approach to that role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of dentures remembering, I began to prefigure myself. Grant's role is basically secondary and minus his usual meaning. However, there is one scene that almost saves this slim exercise. Drake asks the unhappy Grant after his lecture to the vast eminent ladies. Here her livelyness has a grateful freshness that is truly remarkable, and the production did not rub our noses in this optimistic smile for 90 minutes, the movie could be more than a daylight for girls, around 1948.
