When I was a kid, I remember seeing this when I visited a friend of our Uncle Phil. We are back! The story of the dinosaur is a funny cartoon about a dinosaur called Rek (which was expressed by the wonderful John Goodman). Tells the little boy dinosaur story of how the dinosaurs have returned to Earth to live. He explains that he was part of what returned them, along with some friends. I think that the doctor / professor bad guy in this film was responsible for their return, but I do not care about him. Children will like this, but personally it is too redundant. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Bad!
