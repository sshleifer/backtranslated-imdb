Horror fans (I'm talking to people over 12 years old, although if you are under the age of 12, I apologize for what you consider insulting): In short, if we appreciate that your imagination is disturbed by well-written, original narration, accentuated unforeseen well-planted fears, and delivered through convincing designs, then I can sincerely recommend - MAKING THESE PAMARKS - made by directors who have apparently long gone their sale by date. It's no coincidence that almost every episode feels like it was made in the 1980s. Not to blame on the shoulders of some of these old boys (or even 80s), because if we were without certain films like Argenta, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (actually Clive, VTF, I'm in Drago Romero had a good sense to miss him because I'm sure they asked him to take part ...). Maybe it should show more finger to creator Mike Garris, whose credentials include the logic that defies and depressively ill advises the TV remake of the masterpiece by Stanley Kubrick "Great." Perhaps this is an indicator of the situation. television today. Are we so hungry for a good TV horror to applaud any old rackets that the nets are running on our sets? Unfortunately, maybe so. Usually I would not understand the purpose of adding comments that does not discuss the errors and merits of production, but I would only rate it. However, as this series lacks in any kind of merit (with perhaps the exclusive exclusion of thematic melodies), I write this as more warnings than a review: DO NOT REMOVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. If you do not agree with me then it's probably that you have not seen enough decent horror. Perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would have been a much better place to start, but if these 'Masters' Horror' were to be evaluated only on those works, they would never have the right to graduate with even their degree. Unless, of course, they studied at the University S ** t.
