I absolutely hate this program, what people sit and watch this trash? OK, my dad and mom love him, but I'm sure that I got out of the room well before he comes. It's depressing and sad, but the worst thing is that I can not handle all detective programs like this, because detectives are so wooden and soulless. What happened to detective programs with the right mystery ??? I mean, who wants to know what happened to fictitious characters that we do not know anything about what died 20 years ago ??? I would like the BBC to put more comedy on bbc1 because now a dhikrish shaker has got more room for shit like this one.
