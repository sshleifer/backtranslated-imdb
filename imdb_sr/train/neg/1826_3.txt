I saw this movie last night and even after a few beers, the only movie I got out of the movie was when I realized I was actually watching it. In a word, it's immortal. UNFunni. I totally believe that trivia is maltreating about the black apple who apologizes for making this garbage. I can not believe that Barry Levinson not only threw the script when he read the first page. Moreover, I can not believe I've been watching for more than ten minutes. I gave him 3 out of 10 * because I like to see that Christopher walks really horrible movies for pay. Also, the "floating" horse, just what exists as a character in this movie, is actually quite funny.
