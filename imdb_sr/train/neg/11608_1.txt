If this guy can make a movie, then I can make it. In fact, if you employ me to make a movie for you, I promise I will do the following: 1) I will add more naked women. He did not have this film. I consider that poor-quality horror films of the B-class are rented only because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I would not want to let my viewers. 2) I will refrain from making too many scenes where a hero wakes up to find out that it is just a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. Given that the film lasted only an hour, the ratio of the length of the dream to the film was quite high. And, if I decide on one sequence of dreams, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants? 3) I will not break any movies like Star Vars or Matrix because I will know that my budget is small and I do not want to mask my disdain for Hollywood big budget movies by adding satirical references to them in my . 4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, palm pilots can be so scary ... at least they've turned it into an evil rolly-polly monster before the screen exploded or something like that. So, if you are looking above quality in your next horror production, count on me: an extraordinary director of vanna-b-movie.
