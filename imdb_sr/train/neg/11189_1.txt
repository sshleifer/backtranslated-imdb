Always enjoy great movies dealing with the super-natural and deep thoughts of the spiritual world. However, this film only rejected me as far as his production and direction were concerned. There is nothing that could enter into a deep discussion of what this story has to say; All I can say is that it was a great waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. The actors, including Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave an extraordinary performance in native England, and we saw him in the "Still Standing" TV series. Heath Ledger, he played real evil dude and we recently watched him in Brokeback Mountain, '05, gave a lot of support. Shannin Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair), has done a good job of seducing priests from a church who are not recognized by any faith. Do not waste your time, you will be sorry!
