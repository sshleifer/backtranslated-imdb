... then they will have the right place to handle this shit. I'm sorry, it's not a "mystery" as it claims, it's a religious mumbo-jumbo. I was waiting for the "unthinkable evil" that I was promised, but the "evil" in this movie would be unthinkable only to a five-year-old with learning disabilities. I can not believe that they actually managed to find some larger actors who were willing to engage in this shame. Unfortunately, it has always changed my mind about them, and I will probably avoid everything they do in the future. I am a little bit apprehensive that now I have the name of the writer and the name of the director I will remember, because I will now avoid everything they like as a plague. It's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics who publish here say that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. This could lead to more people being deceived, like myself, that I believe this film is something other than religious preaching. Well, it's in the video store to give me money for fake advertising. It's a shame that I can not get back in 105 minutes that I lost by looking at this thinking that this is actually a Hollywood horor / supernatural movie.
