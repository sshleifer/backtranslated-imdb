A Cinderella story made for adults living in the dream world. Romantic is very unreal, fluttering, lovely, perfect, etc. Cinderella plot to the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a romantic dream with a craft, this is definitely a movie, but for other people from the real world, I recommend you save your time of three hours. Wake up people! Four out of five people who watched the movie with me would not recommend a movie. We had a great time to hit most of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I miss something .. I just can not believe that such a movie can beat the classic like HDDCS !!
