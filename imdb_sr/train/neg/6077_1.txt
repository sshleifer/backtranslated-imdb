Would anyone really watch this RIBU if you do not have little kids running around naked? From a film point of view, this is probably one of the worst films I have ever encountered with horrible horror. Some of the others woke up one day and thought that I would make a movie with little girls and call it art, place them in the village and there is no need for a story or explanation of how they arrived there or why they do not appear to live anywhere or have parents because p * rn movies do not need anything like that. I would comment on the rest of the film, but I did not tag the spoilers, so I'll just say that I'm avoiding, avoiding avoiding and finding myself a real movie to watch
