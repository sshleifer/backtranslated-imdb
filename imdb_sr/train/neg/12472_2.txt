Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon. Include a pair of sweet animals, some terrible toys and a pair of skates, and you come across with an almost exact replica of this movie. I made my mother to rent it from the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not bad, except that all viewers of Marxists must have something to complain about. If you do not like America, you will not like this movie.
