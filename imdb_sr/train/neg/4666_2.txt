This film speaks of a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on the skin. The action is absolutely bizarre. I do not see any "sensual" or "erotic" tone. The work transforms the ancient form of art into fetishist pornography. In addition, scenes recorded in Hong Kong certainly portray bad portions of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the city center, poor living conditions and noise. Throughout the film, I keep thinking that the "Book of Cushions" is offensive to Japan's culture and environment in Hong Kong. He seriously clings to it.
