If you want to watch a film that is unusually recorded, unusually illuminated, strange stories about these men (and one woman) who enjoy the shuffling of each other, if you want to enjoy the story that does not go any of these two, one boxer, and another gay man , then you should watch this movie. After I watched this movie, I almost felt so bad and cut out, as well as the director himself (film). It's a movie in which you do not have to look for a plot or a great acting, this is a movie that stares in horror and wonder. It's like watching a plane crash or a wreck of a train. If you want to watch an excellent movie, a good movie, a movie "B" or even a central movie, this film is not. Warning to everyone watching this movie, please do not eat beforehand. You may want to vomit to the end of the movie.
