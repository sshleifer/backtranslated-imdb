What a mess. For a while I saw it with a friend and we both consider ourselves open to many wonders of the cinema, but it certainly is not one of them. ideas / concepts and there are certainly some good performances (under these circumstances), everything is buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony crosses too much from the same genetic fund as Natural Born Killers, U Turn and similar editing films, or maybe he watched himself in Nikon for inspiration. Tell me what you want about David Linch, but at least more often than it does not have a method of insanity. His claim that he made a movie like a joke tells everything. It's not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
