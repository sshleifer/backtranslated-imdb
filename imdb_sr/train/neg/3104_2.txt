I made a lot of reviews on the IMDb and this film is unique in that I never saw the whole movie. It was so terribly stupid and uncomfortable that I just could not sit through it - even though I tried. In other words, because his film is better, you see less in the movie. Think about it - The producers and young Frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them. But, movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are full of Mel and are pretty stupid movies (yes, DO NOT SPIKE BALLS - but this is not the right place to talk about it). Second, besides cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can not think of the less funny topics of homelessness. This is just a comedy. Think about it, folks. FUNNIEST (?) The scene in the movie is Mel making a vhoopee with Leslie Ann Varren in a container !! And this is ridiculous in what way?
