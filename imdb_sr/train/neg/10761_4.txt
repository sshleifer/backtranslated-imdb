This film was a mess. He had absolutely the worst editing I've ever seen. Almost at the end of the scene, the writer wanted to go into the commercial, and the director added a second black screen to fill the dream of the writers. Under untidy direction and assembly, there was a gimmick of something good. A good idea, an extraordinary spark. But somewhere it went wrong. The story is about a quasi-psychic priest who is trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing that's hard to bite is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well, the part does not require him to be a good priest, and he works pretty well. Another problem is Dennis Hopper as a crazy bad guy. He always plays a crazy bad guy. Very good. Oh, I thought maybe all of that terrible, horrible montage and unrelated action tried to add the sense of confusion that the character (Grieco) is experiencing. And just to prove that it was fictitious, they fixed the credibility. It's not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
