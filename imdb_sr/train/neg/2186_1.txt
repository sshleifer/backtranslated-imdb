... but you will wonder if we had anything at all! This film is as bad as the present horror. A man visits half-dressed ladies, trying to decide who he will kill in order to give his girlfriend a new body. One scene involves a man who stirs and spreads over the entire set for three full minutes, embracing everything that must be over ten gallons of "blood". The film also tries to create the feeling that what a man does to his girlfriend is not right and against nature, but the film is so badly made that the audience can not dive into any sense of shock or indignation. Infinitely dark and inconceivable, this movie can not even get its title - initial credits say "A brain that would not die," but eventually it is said that "A head that would not die".
