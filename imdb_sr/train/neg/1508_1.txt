Last night I saw this film (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what kept me on the seat. I guess I just expected the film with Ger to have some value in it, but none of the values ​​came to the screen. The story is a silly excuse for accumulating cadres after firing and torture. There is no character in a movie that does something like real life. Cutting "style" relies on jump cuts, mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setting gnard sadista obviously running for free for years and the SURPRISE leader is the "victim" of the executed killer. I can not see how Gere, a Buddhist, got into this violent, sexist garbage.
