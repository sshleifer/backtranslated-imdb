Executive power, very successful in her professional life, but very incompetent in her famous life, meets the boy with a fall syndrome, who fled from his place of residence. Both characters feel very lonely, and seemingly less intelligent will show the executive the beauty of small things in life ... With this argument, somehow Amelie's atmosphere and sentimental music, I did not expect, but a moralistic disgusting movie. In any case, since there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite violent), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pascal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to continue watching the movie. French cinema, in general, has the ability to show something that seems pretty lively, unlike a stereotypical American cinema. But, for that reason, it is much disappointing to see after the absurd ending, the boy's death impossible, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive powerhouse, the cheap morale, the unbearable laughter of a daughter, the guy waving from the sky like Michael Landon ... It's really nasty, in my humble opinion.
