I picked up this video after I read the text on the box, the story looked good, and Keanu Reeves had it! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed that his acting was horrible, he was walking and talking so stupid all the time, it is false and not convincing. It does not end, almost all characters behave so badly that it's ridiculous, it's only acceptable to play Alan Boice (David), but the guy begins suicide early and you do not see him again, you never know why he did it! Everything about this movie screams of low quality, I can not believe how such a thing is released! Many times I was tempted to stop watching, in fact, I was, halfway I decided to stop watching and turning off the thing, came to IMDB to check what others think about it, I found zero reviews (not surprised), so I I decided to force myself to deal with the pain and return to finish, so I come here to comment. The only good thing that went (for me) was the theme of the high school band, the occasional guitar and the singing of parts, but that's not worth it. Very bad acting and directing ... Horrible movie.
