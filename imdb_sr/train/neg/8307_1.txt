This performance is incredible. . . what it represents and what it focuses on. . . words can not describe how mad ET. Everything will report. If the celebrity is even indirectly related to the story, ET will report about it. If a dog appears in Tom Cruise yard, they will report it. If a celebrity dies. . . they will talk about it for weeks until the public envies that famous personality. If the celebrity is at trial. . . ET will report it to MONTHS at the end. There is no end to what this broadcast will report and there is no time frame that dictates how long it will focus on the story. Is it even considered legitimate reporting? Reports are so drugged and cruel, with sharper voices and ending with unnecessary pauses to convey a sense of importance. I can not watch this show without re-examining the existence of humanity. ET is one of the big reasons why no pre-evening shows are shown at all. I'm sorry that IMDb can only allow at least one star, not zero or even negative. For this show deserve -10 stars.
