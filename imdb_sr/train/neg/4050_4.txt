It is a completely outdated movie aimed at showing the desire of young people for freedom in a dehumanizing British school. Oh, yes, it's like in the army, learn to listen and do what you're looking for. Yes, a young dream about something else, but breaks their dreams and removes their optimism at the threshold of life. Great. In essence, so you can summarize good intentions in If ... Nice intentions that do not cause cinematographic challenges: the result is a declamation movie. Do you see how boring I am? At least this Oldie helped Kubrick to insert McDowell into A Clockvork Orange, a movie with truly powerful social satires and without self-inflicted sentimentalism.
