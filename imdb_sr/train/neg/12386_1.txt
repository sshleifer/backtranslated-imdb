It's hard to make an impartial judgment about such a film that had such an impact on me at such a young age. This is no doubt the worst kind of exploitation film. I was unhappy to see this film for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made. Then I saw her again earlier this year and again I was horrified. I am not a fanatic or a person to say what others would need and should not see, but I was very offended in the way that, as in this film, rape was dealt with. I love a movie, but this is just nasty. Instead, rent Rus Rus.
