I have read several books about Bonnie and Clide, and this is definitely more accurate than the Beatti / Danube version, in that his costumes and shops respond to real photos captured by the gang. Particularly well done was the death of Boro Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks just like photographs taken that day when Blanche complained to her dying husband. However, this film is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes remain pretty much the end, even after they shot at the holes (in her life, Bonnie was hardly burned in a car accident a year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a cheeky cheerleader at the time of her death). The scenario is boring, and the performance is bad, especially traces. Frustrating. Beattie and Dunavia are held. Their maybe not a "true story," but it's a great movie.
