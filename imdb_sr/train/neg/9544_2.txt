I did not enjoy this movie. I thought the acting was not very good and the story was boring. A computer that's 20 years old saves the day? I thought this was just a bit far away, even for a movie. I could not understand why I can not simply turn it off, why not take the mall. what was actually delivered. This film could have been a version of the old 21st century film, not. If that's what you want to watch, do not watch this movie! Even if the old computer did not appear to save the day, it would, in my opinion, be very shy.
