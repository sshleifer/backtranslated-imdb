After low expectations, the opening of a new recording (lasting over five minutes) 'Husbands' was a pleasant surprise. I will not say that the new material is A grade material, but it provided a solid basis for what "could have been" a good original movie. Unfortunately, this was compiled in 1955, during one day of shooting schedule. After a new recording, Jules Vhite decided to put in Brideless Groom a short story, in this short text, making this not so smooth story, which Jules and Felic Adler try to eliminate with a quick new clip to the end, giving us an old, worn out ending of the guys (Moe & Larry in this case) shot in the ass. 3/10
