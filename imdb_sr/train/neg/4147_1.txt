I am a passionate fan of terrible movies, everything that is shit and down is ridiculous is my game. Imagine my spirit I went to the local Rent Shop, and found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is too fun, you know that no one in the world can pull something like that, it just has to be bad. After watching this horror movie, I was speechless, literally. I and my friend sat for a few minutes, not looking at each other, both of us are thinking about the future of our lives after watching this movie. I interrupted the depressing silence with the words: "... man ... What?" Yes, I am an enchanting individual. Here's a quick 'Street View' The Plot; No, in general, ever, constantly in the "VTF" mode. Characters; No development, it's forgotten. Music; Worse than pornography. The Vampires; Their vampires? The Zombies; Their zombies? At the end; Everyone should watch this movie, honestly, so bad that I'm looking forward to seeing it again. So do yourself a favor, watch and get Depressed.
