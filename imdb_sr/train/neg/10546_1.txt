Recently I looked at this crime in my film program, and I thought it was terrible, as I said in my slogan, that he was pretentious, rude, petty and phenomenally self-confident. I consider myself a fan of the film and all the things that a movie can offer. If I want to see a documentary at a festival in Cannes, I'll watch A & E ... and they will probably be much more objective about it. I do not recommend it, period. <br /> <br />
