The enormous pace of this film interferes with any shocks it can provide. There was no real uncertainty. Most of the characters were unsuccessful. The dirty Irish priest was as lame as a love interest. Interest is wrong. The girl they chose to provide the sensuality of the film can be better. The central conflict of the main character was not included. This film is completely deprived of positive. It's like a strenuous exercise by someone who did not want to go to the gym that day, but he did it anyway.
