As someone who lived, and still remember that colorful decade, that the real '70s were half of this ridiculous and (half) normal, it would be much more pleasant. \ Young people in the country were still under the influence of hippies and the culture of drugs all these revolts of the 60s that have emerged, especially in the behavioral department, slander, self-indulgence, suicide - legitimacy, childishness, unreasonableness of them - none of the characters shows none of these. Someone compared to "Happy Days", and I see why: Both were comedies that took place 20 years before broadcasting, and both offer only superficial, cliché impressions of real epochs, even close to full volume, just showing obvious things - fashion, toys, music, contraptions, etc., and that's it. For those who are too young to remember, or were not born then, believe me, 70 were not like that, nothing more than "Happi Dais" were as real 50s, because "M * A * S * H ​​* "did not accurately depict life in the US military's medical base during the Korean War, etc.
