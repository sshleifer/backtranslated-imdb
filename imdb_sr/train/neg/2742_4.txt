I just happened to have surfaced on this movie channel. my first reaction was: "Oh God, not again!". These days it's so silly that the game is retarded, it has become pretentious and frankly despised. For some reason, however, I remained and watched him to the end. Maybe it was my faith in the actors, hoping to give me something to cheer. Also, the film is progressing to something better to the end and actually a real point. Helena bonham carter also surprised me with her character. Jane has a middle ground that she uses to keep her distance and refuse pity. then again it has a soft side that only requires love. the only thing that surprised me even more was Branagh's character ... this was a triumph of the acting, the film itself is nothing unique. In pursuit of pure fun, you can skip this. This is Sean Penn seriously! Oh, that was a bit rough, but there are a few jokes ... but not for the escapist.
