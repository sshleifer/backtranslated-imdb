This film is described as action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi suggest that this is a witty gangster movie. However, the introduction of a funny feminine leadership begins with a number of pointless complications that make a little bit to hide the fictitious ending. The film moves between comedy (a description used loosely) and surrealistic drama, with some out of the context of adult scenes that have been thrown. The main female (The Title Angel) is poorly performed, and the actress does not help a script that requires some incredible, extreme characters to show. James Belushi is the only one who manages his role well, but he is also bad. One to be avoided.
