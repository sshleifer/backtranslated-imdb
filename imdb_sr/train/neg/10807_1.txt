This film has successfully proven what we all know, that professional basketball players play everything except basketball. Especially fun and acting. I can not even begin to describe how bad this film really is. First of all, is it just me, or is it the hardest kid you've ever seen? I mean, his teeth can be used as a can opener. Secondly, why would a genius want to engage in a career in the music industry when, although it has magical powers, it is horrible to enjoy the making of music? Thirdly, I read the Bible. In no way did the form or shape say that Jesus had created a genius. Fourth, what was the deal with all the shabby special effects? I assure you that any nervous teenager with a computer can have better effects than that. Fifth, why did he end up so bad? And what the hell is Dad? And finally, whoever created a nightmare known as Kazaam should be thrown from the plane and to the Eiffel tower, because this film takes the word "suck" to a whole new level.
