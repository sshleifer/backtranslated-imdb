Lame, lame, lame !!! A 90-minute game that lasts 89 minutes too long. Setting up in the atmosphere and possibilities (an abandoned monastery) has collapsed from a stinking scenario filled with an awkward, ruthless dialogue that bends oh-so-hard to be hip. It's mostly unpleasant, and the horrors of horror are dropping to the surface (the pattern of this film's dialogue: after she demonstrated her artillery, a quick doll fired near Barbeau's vicious character: she: "Any questions?" Huck Huck Huck). Bad acting, idiotic, homophobic jokes and judging by the effects of the creature, the director seems to have looked 'evil-dead' too many times. I owe my friends a lot of time to rent this party and I'll take them in ninety minutes of lost minutes that they will never get. What a shit.
