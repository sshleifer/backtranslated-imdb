This mini-series is actually more fun than some others with much larger budgets and greater aspirations. SOTD is located between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" in the entertainment spectrum. If it had not been such a long time (almost 3 hours) I think that there would be enough children. It has an adventure, action, a "walking scene", not too romantic or other "miserable" things. When you are young, you are not too critical to bend rubber swords, action moves and recurring scenes. (At least two scenes repeat themselves identically in the film, as did the old series in order to bring the audience to speed.) Finally, children usually more accept the dialogue of the American English language that comes out of the Asian actors mouth. (Not to mention the fact that several main roles are played by non-Asian actors.) I wanted to give this movie a three-star, but I felt like a director, the producer and the actor earned the additional merit for the least implementation of the project . This film is not art, but, like your house painting, it takes a bit of time, effort and discipline to make it. All in all, it is not recommended to use for your time, but it can hold. children were having fun while traveling in a mini-van. Oh, yes ... hey, IMDb! "Dialogue" is a preferred and traditional spelling. Your spelling check seems to think that "dialogue" is a real spelling. While the "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and OED consider it an alternative form.
