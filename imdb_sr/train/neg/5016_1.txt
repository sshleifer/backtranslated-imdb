The name Nick Stahl, the young actors and the attractive VHS clip made me buy and watch this movie, expecting to see a good teen movie. What a shit! A lot of clich√©s scenarios, dialogues and performances are terrible, terrible, very bad, horrible, terrible? summing up, total waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, only an absolutely boring story, with shameful dots. The film begins with six characters, really three pairs, together as a group of friends, but really very nasty people who look like enemies, playing a ridiculous, meaningless game called "Taboo", and each of them writes that or not some taboo topics. This is it: without the previous development of characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and relationships. Then, there is an ellipse up to a year later, and the same group gathers at New Year's party, insulting each other in a very dirty way. But the plot and contours are so funny, predictable, central and incredible that they do not deserve any additional line in my review. Just one tip: do not waste time and money on this garbage, you will surely regret it. My voice is one (horrible). Title (Brazil): "Tabu? Jogando Com o Assassino" ("Taboo? Playing with the killer")
