Now I've watched all four Bo Derek vehicles driven by her husband John; All of course, of course, are pretty scary, but this is a safe pit. Along with the usual bad plots, bad scripts? by the director, of course ?? And acting, not to mention a free nakedness from a star, she deals with her loss of much older husband Anthony Quinn (she accepts his suicide from a rifle by saying that he always admired Hemingway !!), but who continues to appear and talk to her . In fact, he wants to return to another, younger body, but that actually works only in the last scene! Derek is as beautiful as ever, and still plays naive (!) ?? especially during a muddy middle part that a hired killer in a spa is haunted by. Kuynn, too, is typically higher than life (read: hammi) here, but it easily represents his overture; Moreover, for most of its duration, it works behind a piece of glossy plastic (probably suggesting it is in some kind of limb)! His 'replacement' is obviously a handsome kid who has no licking of talent or even personality. The acting team is also the Hollywood veteran Don Murray (as Quinn's best friend and Bo's business consultant) and Julie Nevmar (as Quinn's guardian angel in the afterlife)? and the surprising appearance of the beacon by billionaire Donald Trump (who probably should have this in his resume)! It should not be forgotten that John Derek was his own filmmaker, that the final credits were filled with useless (and banal) expressions of gratitude to many people who provided help and that GHOSTS CAN NOT CLOSE the board at the Razzie 1990 Awards!
