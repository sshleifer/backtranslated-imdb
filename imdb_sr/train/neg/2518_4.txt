Imagine a darker version of one of those children's shows such as "Power Rangers" and you have this 1990 movie, Robot Jok. A movie in which you fight with huge robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country is winning. Robots are huge and look like something better than those from the mentioned shows, mostly because they are less colorful and even if this movie is not good, it's not very bad to watch. As I recall, two robots fought in this, one that is badly ending and a final calculation. A reversal has occurred in the turn, because a traitor is revealed, but in the end, the plot is nothing that will stay with you any time after the picture is over. Conflicts themselves look like gigantic toy towers, but it's still fun to watch. This film would also create several other films with similar devices, such as giant robots and a tournament. So it's worth checking once, but probably not more than that.
