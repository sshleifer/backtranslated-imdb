Foivonder's review of this cheap STV hit his nail straight on his head. Read it. In case you do not, a group of scientists goes to the deep forests of the Pacific Northwest to climb with a bunch of bones in the animal cemetery. The Big Foot family does not accept kindness towards this and continues to take away the team one by one, mostly outside the screens. The big leg itself has a distinctly monkey face, but it's less terrible than Harry from HARRY and HENDERSON. Most of the film has wooden, generic actors who pretend to be scientists who roam around in the woods and leave. This is a budget without a budget in which very little happens, at least on the screen. We can watch the sexiest women showering while one of her male followers is watching, but none of it comes.
