Most of the "My Bollivood Bride" I saw at the IAAC film festival in New York today and I had to leave the theater because of the feeling of nausea that appeared in me. I saw Bollywood films, and I saw satire Bollivood movies. This film could not decide which one it wanted to be, so it ended up like a joke on it. messy, lazy job. How can Bollivood ever be rejected by its determination to stick to overstated, well-acclaimed scripts? Is not there anyone who can display on the screen millions of true, fascinating tales that certainly exist and appear in billions of people? Too smart car driver, cows on the street, free scenes of foreign locations, meaningless scenes of Mumbai streets, they are all there. Every possible clich√© about India is faithfully involved. So painfully predictable. ugh !!! Acting performances are weak, except Neha Dubei, who is talented and beautiful. You wonder why you would choose this kind of project.
