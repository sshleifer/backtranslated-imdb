Wow! I remember so many horrible films that were loosely revolving around high school in the early eighties. Usually they had unusually tense actions and many 27-year-old actors who pretended to be students. As I watched this film, I felt a bit of nostalgia growing up in the 1980s. However, then I learned that this film was shot in 1989? What do you say! Well, the nostalgic factor ends right there, this is only bad. The city is preparing to close high school and threatens to translate all students into secondary high schools. What is strange, because the students in this school are both rich and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a villa. You wonder how they can not find the money to keep this school alive, never heard of property tax. Oh, but here's a kicker. The school board says it will keep the school alive if students can collect $ 200,000. So, seniors do it. Hmmm, you collect $ 200,000, but instead of saving it for college, put it to save your high school in which you are older? And why exactly would you close the overdue school before the end of the year? And ... ahh forget, this movie was stupid and made in 1989 !?
