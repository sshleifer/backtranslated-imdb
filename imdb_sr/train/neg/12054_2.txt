"What happens when a homeless person gets $ 100,000?" As if asking this question in some way morally liberates what will eventually happen. The creators of the "Turn of Fortune" are trying to get their voyeuristic giggles while concealing their antiquity as some kind of responsible social experiment. They take Ted, the homeless in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to see if he will turn his life. Then, with only the worst guidelines and counseling, they let him go in a cheerful way. What are they trying to say? "Money can not buy you luck?" "Homeless people are homeless because they deserve to be?" Or about it: "Raise a man - it is more fun to watch him fall from a higher height." They took away a man who had nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then he watched him throw everything into a drain. That should be fun? They dress this sower with some gloomy music and dramatic shots of the camera, but in the end it has all the moral backbones of video traffic accidents - just this time they built a car crash and asked, "What happens when you stop a vehicle?" sign?
