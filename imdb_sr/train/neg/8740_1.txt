My friends and I rented this movie last night and we had one of the biggest laughs. The film should not be ridiculous, but it is so funny and lacking any realism. First, Phillippe (I forgot how his name is called and I do not care) uses his regular employee ID to pass through all security terminals. Not only is it pathetic, it is even surpassing when its tremendous efforts culminate in finding such a scary Lego room in which super computers are located. This is just fun. The tense mood we should experience is completely spoiled by the childlike appearance. The ending, like everything else, is very poor, especially when a bad guy's lawyer appears 'on time'. Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need to mock something, be sure to look at it.
