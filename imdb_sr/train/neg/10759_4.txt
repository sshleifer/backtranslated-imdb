Despite the great design details in the future, the clever Asim's premise, and the trustworthy cool performance of Villa Smith, this film does not meet expectations. The clich√©s come thick and fast; (awakening from a recurring nightmare, a maverick cop has his badge recalled by the hardass lieutenant, the list will spoil it more - you can see the end of the mile off). This film is also stagebound - you never feel that you have traveled anywhere; What should be a global catastrophe is never left by the obvious CGI Chicago. The robots themselves are good at the close, but the 'crowd' scenes look more like a bad Disney - the CGI is constantly over-crowded. And if you can destroy robots by breaking them off, why should they inject 'nanote'? You know it's a stupid movie when these stupid problems start to disturb before the climax. It could have been great, but it's less than a collection of its parts, mainly due to the extremely predictable action that could have come from any action movie for the past forty years.
