I saw the director of "Woman on the Beach" and I could not understand the good from the excellent reviews. This film is similar to that of two people caught in connection with very little dynamics and even less interest for anyone else. Like his other films, you have to want to listen to an empty dialogue, go very little and become vicious with little, uninteresting characters. If you think this movie may appeal to you, do not let my review stop you. In movies, I like minimalism, but I think Tsai Ming-Lianga films are far superior. In his film he has a pretty great actor in Lee Kang-Sheng. There's nothing here. I wish I liked it, but no. Oh well.
