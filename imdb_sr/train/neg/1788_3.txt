By giving recognition to what is needed, only technician, costumes and sets deserve respect. This is undoubtedly the lowest point in the long career of BING CROSBI in Paramount. The scenario is just as clumsy as you could imagine, and neither the occasional Bing, nor Villiam Bendik nor Sir Cedric Hardvicke can do anything to fix it. Bendik looks extremely stupid in the wig with the pages. And poor Rhonda Fleming plays the role of a heroine in a costume that requires her to look beautifully on Bing and a little bit other than to cheat a couple of uninspired ballads in a voice that is probably named for that occasion. The inclination of Mark Twain is not visible in any scenario. Only hard-line fans of Crosby can value this mess of films that does not give inspiration. Even the accessories look like they do not know what they should do. In short: Dull as dishwater. It is not recommended, even for children.
