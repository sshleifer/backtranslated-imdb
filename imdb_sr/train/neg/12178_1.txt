Annie's wig does not look good. She's not cute and nice enough to play Annie. Annie shoots in the movie, while her clothes look like Halloween costumes. terrible acting and terrible complications. This film is such a change from the 1982 version. I think a younger and younger girl should play a major role. Ashlei Johnson shows very young Annie. It's not at all attractive. At least the casting director got it right with dad Varbucks. Ms. Hannigan also made a mistake. Camilla Belle played Molly in line. "Warning" this movie can offend your IK so you might want to show it to only small children. 8 and younger. Some plots are too fictitious and difficult to play in the real world.
