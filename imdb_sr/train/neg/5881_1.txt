Absolutely the most boring film I've ever spent my money on. It was the wrong choice for all these great stars to squander their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character is shown in a less inspirational way. No acting talent - just reading a piece. Alec can normally play realistic characters, Gwynt looked ugly for an ungrateful piece, Annette should advise how to choose the movies she chooses to play, and all those great stars who disappointed me about the way all of them allowed talents to be squeezed into a characteristic that leaves much to desire in the party. "Running Scissors" leads to the public predicting a great acting in a film that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotions. There was not a moment when the actors could display any interpretation of this on the screen. It may be a direct blunder - anyway.
