I chose this film after a cover that was a bad move. It was not funny at all, and the main characters were uncomfortable. The girl was pretty, but the story and the acting were horrible. He had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. A terrible movie with a surf "theme" that had nothing to do with surfing and making surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie is likely to see recovery just because she is now at the center of attention, married to Gordon Gekko and everyone, but if you have not seen him, you do not waste time. A bad movie with LARGE surfing, REAL surfers and AMAZING, NICE cinema was IN GOD'S HANDS.
