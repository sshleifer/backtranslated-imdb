I can not believe that some people really like this. Still they are still called Batman fans. Even to say it's better than BTAS. What is not. There should be plagiarism for them to use Batman's name for this shit. It's not Batman. The whole premise of the show is "if you can not defeat someone to get bigger weapons to help you". He uses his batarang and hook and Batmobile, that's it. There is no new genius technology coming up every time someone can not win. I do not know where the devil got the idea for Batbot. or anything else. They destroyed all the villains. Mr Freeze has moved from a curious scientist to a petty criminal who has fallen into something frozen. Catvoman is now 40 or 50 years old old dumb woman costume. The penguin is now a ninja with a high cap of 50 feet. Ventrilokuist is now called Scarface, making Dummi a complete center of character. They even have a stupid idea of ​​making him a giant! vtf? and two of the worst character changes are Joker and Riddler. They changed Riddler into a gothic / retro teenage freak. and Joker to acrobats with dreads. Looks like Bob Marley. completely and completely destroyed the batman even more than B & R did! I wish I could get to know the creators and / or writers and animators of this show so I could hit them with a metal baseball cap.
