Basically, there is a family in which the little boy (Jake) thinks he is in his wardrobe zombie and his parents are constantly fighting. This film is slower than soap opera ... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill zombies. Okay, first of all, when you make a movie, you have to decide whether it's a thriller or a drama! As a drama, the film is visible. Parents are separated and discussed as in real life. And then we have Jake with his wardrobe that totally destroys all the movie! I expected to see a similar BOOGEIMAN film, and instead I watched a drama with some pointless thriller videos. 3 out of 10 just for good playable parents and descent dialogs. As for Jake's shots: just ignore them.
