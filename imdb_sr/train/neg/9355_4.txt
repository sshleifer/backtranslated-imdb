Only recently I managed to catch a step with the films Marilyn Miller, because they were not shown on the TCM in the UK. I was very intrigued over the years because it was one of the superstars of the 20s. Some of the stars of this era, such as Jolson, are still some of the magic, but unfortunately not for Miller. this movie as an audience was tired of the musical, practically all the music numbers were deleted. So we stayed with the comedy of that period with a little real appeal. She got $ 500,000 for it! Either she was poorly employed in the cinema or had no talent at all. I think the truth is closer to the later than the previous one.
