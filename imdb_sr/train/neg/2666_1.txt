Frankly, if someone has a brain, there is no positive thing to say about this movie what it's ever been. I lost $ 1 lease. I'd rather laugh at Vill Smith saying, "If you have a dream, you have to protect it." All actors were bored or were not famous at the time. even Matthev Mc Conahai * as you wrote it * was better than all the actors in this movie, when he played a psycho in Tekas Chainsav 4. If you see this movie, and you have something good to say, you IK must be extraordinary low, with so bad taste in movies, pain. Thank you ... and TRUTH, it's been said! Save yourself from misery. Get Devil's Rejects, now it's a classic.
