John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domergue, who played as better players in better films, gathered for this horror movie Grade G about life by imitating art in a mysterious villa. For Carradine's been in these last two decades of his career, he appeared in whatever the theory was, it was better to continue to work no matter what you did and join them plate. The man did not even make the slightest difference in what he appeared. He played guardian of the old Gothic villa, rented by director John Irish for his latest low-budget film. There is even a graveyard, but with a missing citizen. Vera Domergue is an older star of Ireland, and Carole Vells is a young ingenue. In the last twenty minutes or more, most actors are dead and are not dead yet. The script is so inconsistent that I'm still trying to figure out the point. I will not lose more gray matter on it.
