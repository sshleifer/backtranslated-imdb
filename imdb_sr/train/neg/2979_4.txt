"Gone Vith The Vind" is one of the most appreciated films in history. It's a movie that loves mothers, grandmothers and prisoners who go to the cinema every five years. Like a zombie movie, blowing. There is no visible corpse in sight, and it's terribly easy in the department. "Zombie 3" is, on the other hand, big on fragile corpses and quite generous with shedding blood. It's also not overestimated. Most reviewers are not mistaken for that garbage. This, however, is not boring garbage. After the terrorist steals the virus, he is discharged as he is being chased by a helicopter, and chemicals leak into the ground. A terrorist, who was exposed to a nasty fabrication, is hiding in a hotel room where he slowly turns into eating zombies. One of his first victims is a cleaner. Once she was bitten, Lucio Fulci lost. As is usual for Fulci, acting is terrible, the story is pierced by cavities, and blood is plentiful. It turned out that the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, which explains his rather schizophrenic nature. And he's badly recorded, poorly decorated, and the sound design is flat. Still, it was saved by its cheerful respect for the worst murders and impatient rhythms. It's definitely worth picking up if you're totally undead. Or you do not like "Gone Vith The Vind", undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.
