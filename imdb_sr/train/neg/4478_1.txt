I did not expect much from this movie - a fun little diversion. Vuthering Heights can turn into an acceptable modern story - beautiful and soap, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film has decided to discard the talents of people involved in the simpering version, so it is dented by the original material that it is incredible that they had the courage to call it Vuthering Heights in general. She ignores the fact that this is a story about people who are essentially unsuitable, mostly non-emotional and often cruel to each other. She changes the very nature of certain characters - Isabelle, for example, in a novel, did not have a bumblebeat in her body - stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a humorous whore. Heathcliff is a terrible person who psychologically tortures most people on his way, but in this version Catherine eventually leaves his daughter in his care. The dialogue is erased and it is asked how the actors managed to deliver anything from that to the true faces. Instead of depth or real emotions, we know that they mean something when screaming at someone's face. I read a review of the early nineties version, "Vuthering Heights" Emily Bronte, which included Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying it was a very dark, gothic story in a soaked whip-riper. A little valid commentary, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver small bum bum cavorting to really bad music.
