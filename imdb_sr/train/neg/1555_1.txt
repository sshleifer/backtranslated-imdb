When I decided to watch Barbara, playing those double bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it could not be that bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has the reputation of creating sharp movies, but well-made rude movies. Well, THE BARBARIANS is an incredibly trashy action / adventure movie that wants to be another CONBAR BARBARIAN, and it collapses at all levels. The appearance of the movie is wrong. Some scenes are well recorded, but the tone and the schizophrenic "disco" look of clothes and the hair of people are decorated with simply makes no sense, even for a low budget flick like this one. <br /> <Richard Linch looks like an old woman with this funny hairstyle and costume. He should be threatening, but he finds himself crazy. And it's ridiculous to see Evu LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, who appears in her first film, walking in a scarce furry bikini. I'm sure she wants this shit to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called barbarian twins are fine as heroes-related muscles, but it's almost impossible to construct an appropriate critique of their acting because their roles, like everything else in this mess, are really ill-conceived. The only way a film tries to distinguish one twin from the other is that a twin wears a wrap that covers his ass, while the other twin's pantly barely covers the muscle bite. I'm not kidding! Do not ask me who it is. Deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film. And his despair is perfectly reflected in this stupid film. That's just bad.
