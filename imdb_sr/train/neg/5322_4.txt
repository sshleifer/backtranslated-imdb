There are two types of musicals from the 1950s. First you have great MGM productions with great names and great music. And then you have a smaller league with less known actors, less known musicians and other directors. 'Girl can not help' belongs to another category. Both Tom Evell and Edmond O'Brien did not become famous, and Jaine Mansfield was known for her ... well, it does not matter. It seems that every decade has its share of Bo Derex or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is slim like a razor and it can not be suspected that this is mainly an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or others from the rock-appearances of the 1950s that appear in the film. If you like this music, it's worth watching. If not, do not be tormented.
