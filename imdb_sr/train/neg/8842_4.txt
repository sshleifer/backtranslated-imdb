Something says most of the great reviews for the IMDb movie come from people who reviewed only one movie in their IMDb career and that you guessed that the movie was "Parasomnia." I often suspected the dubious good reviews about the IMDb for what turned out to be all but good films as insidious marketing, but it looks pretty transparent in this case. This does not mean that the parasomnia is terrible, but it ceases to be a good or excellent film that has had the potential to be. On the plus side, he has a great person in Patrick Kilpatrick who performs a brilliant job by projecting the threatening and evil, I could easily see him having what he needed to play a really memorable baddie on par with Hannibal Lecter -om. In dream sequences there are some nice pictures, in fact, if the film has decided to explore this terrain, it could be somewhat better. The real concept of malignant abuse of hypnosis is also great. Although I understand that the suspension of unbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it is a sign of a good story that allows you to do so. If you seem to be annoyed by what you find illogical or simply stupid, then your story loses, and that's what I've been constantly doing with this movie. Other reviewers have mentioned this here and I do not want to go into the territory of the spoiler, but I will say that the adjustment was particularly funny and disappointing, not to mention the very different mental age of the character that only needs to be A couple of years of life. All in all, there is the call of a great idea in devilishly abused hypnotism, but unfortunately this movie does not manage to realize it in something special.
