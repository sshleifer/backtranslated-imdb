I saw this movie last year in the Media class and I must say that I really hated it. I was at the age of 10 (and 15 years), so there may be something with it. But for English this year, the 11th year, we had to read the Animal Farm, also George Orwell. In addition to the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my view is that it is a terrible book, and I also hated it. ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the least developed people who have ever lived on this planet. I'm sorry for everyone who loved his work, but unfortunately I did not. The themes in the movie are well displayed, but the way the whole movie and the events that were taking place within it were not in accordance with my standards. It's just my opinion, and I'm sure many other people have fully enjoyed this movie.
