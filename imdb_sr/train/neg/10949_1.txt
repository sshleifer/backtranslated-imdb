I'm going to the cinema to have fun. There is absolutely nothing fun about this movie. From the beginning to the end, there is no break from the gray, brushed reality of this woman's life. It is one-sided, without a change of mood. I ended up only because I was convinced that things had to be better. They do not do it, and I do not think I was the only one, as evidenced by the many snoops of the bells around the cinema as the film approached. The honest presentation of social distortion is not a crime, but an annoying audience is no longer a way to gain public sympathy. Horror movie.
