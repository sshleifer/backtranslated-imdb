I remember the title so well. For me, it was Flora Robson's film with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles. And behind him was the voice of Vincent Massy. Well, Flora Robson was great. Her next signature, for me, would be "55 days in Beijing." Same role, but with different gorgeous dresses. And the same voice. As for the Armada, it was a subtext. I love black and white movies. Was everything in Elizabethan at night? It was difficult and difficult to understand, sometimes. I did not know what kind of love interest was. Was it Spaniard or Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe that Elizabeth would be a brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships send against the Armada. Apparently, this worked for Empire, but not for the script. It may have been more accurate, historically, but Bette Davis had more interesting scenarios. And I missed daylight!
