I went through this movie. First of all, the idiotic plot has little to do with Parson's story. Hollywood tried to create a kind of comedy car for a hike. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrik". Do not take anything about this movie to be accurate. The name Parsons in the title and the stealing of his body is only used as a springboard for a low-budget movie shot, an apparent attempt to take a couple of dollars from Parsons's legacy and his fan base. Gram's father was long dead in 1973, other global characters were invented, none of this has anything to do with Gram's life or death. If you are a Gram fan, I advise you not to watch this movie. I wish I did not. It's sad to see something special like such a shameful fodder. I swear I could hear how Gram turned into a grave while the film was playing. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and legacy, do not take anything in this movie as a representative of Gram. I can not say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram was alive and saw this movie, he would have killed himself. And again, you might be afraid to know that this film will result.
