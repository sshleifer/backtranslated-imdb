It's one of the funny things about being young and easy to fool around. I used to talk about a second film, in which the commercial for a movie (comedy) makes it more entertaining than it is. Looking at the ad for this in 1981, I thought it would be a wild funny movie. What I and my brother who left and saw with me did not know that the scene used in the TV advert was the last scene in the movie! Since this scene is the ultimate result of everything that preceded the movie, I can only assume that it was not so funny to use it! The last scene is, thanks to a drink for young people, dr. Fu Manchu turns from a long bearded old man to a brilliant young Asian / Elvis as a rock star! (With less spare singers!) For no reason, in the thirties of the last century, Peter Sellers did his best with the material, but he was not given any really good reason for his "comedy". moments. The other actors were simply boring, and my brother and I sat through this barely laughing. It is natural that we expected a comedy like "Pink Panther", Peter Sellers was so great at it. It's a sad embarrassment that it was his last film before he died. His performance at Muppet Shov was more fun than this poorly designed failure. Still, I do not blame him. I say that everyone else is involved in not trying to make a better movie about it. 2 stars is generous !!
