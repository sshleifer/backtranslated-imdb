I thought my favorite mars was very boring and extracted !! It was not funny at all. The audience just sat through the whole movie and did not laugh !!! Even kids do not laugh !! It's sad for Disney movie! I thought they could find someone better to play the Martians, not Christopher Lloyd !! He was really stupid! And he was not funny !! I thought the conversation suit was really stupid! In the original television series, the suit does not speak and moves !! In my opinion, they should not waste time on this movie !! I give him two thumbs down! Really wasting time and I would not recommend anyone to film !!! Thank you!!
