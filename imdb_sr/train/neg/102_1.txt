My girlfriend once made Zombie Chronicles look at us like a joke. We got a little understanding that it was a joke on her because she paid 1 pound for it. As I watched this movie, I began to find things I would rather rather than watch The Zombie Chronicles. These are: 1) Bleeding 2) Painting the sand in my eyes 3) Writing letters to Brad Sikesu and Garrett Clanciu 4) Re-making the American Civil War 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE 7) Sex with the old Lady. Garrett Clans, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy could not even fix the hole. The best thing he did was to knock down the door (the best part of the movie). This was the worst movie I ever saw, and I saw Vhite Noise: The Light. Never had the movie had so many mistakes in it. My girl left him here, so now I live with shame that I have this shit. News right in: Aries Wilson watched this movie and tried to kill himself. Fact. Do not look
