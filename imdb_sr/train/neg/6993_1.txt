What a horrible movie. I can not believe I lost 90 minutes of my life watching this. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and the Soft Puffer acted in this movie? Soft Pfizer is excellent in E.R, and Ving Rhames probably did not know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. The musical background I have to say is not compatible with ALLLLL in the story and it's amazing how you can find those directors who do not have absolutely no life in creating a well-balanced movie. I hope that in the future no director, such as this one, could destroy a big classical film. This film was not supposed to be made at all. Advice to everyone who saw him, please tell me that I am right because I can not be the only spectator who did not enjoy it. BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 of 10.
