To be clear. I've been using IMDb for years. But I just went through the trouble of registering on the site, just to give this film the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some of which are bad, a bit terrible. Never, however, have seen such a contrast of conversion and incompetence, high intent and failure. Mira Sorvino is terribly thrown like a princess, but totally incredible as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shav is always a funny figure, but the dialogue in the movie is much worse, even more than in the insidious French play that is the source (Marivauk has never arrived to Hollivood so far, and we need to keep him that way). To illustrate, for example, that Leontin is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she sprinkled the chemical from glass to glass, spelling out the names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the Princess is even duller. For this, the couple should receive a joint Clair Danes award, which in the fair world would be rewarded for free anachronistic and uninspired reinterpretation of interesting teenagers in literature as boys from the 1990s (see Miss Danes at Les Miserables). Apart from the terrible complications and dialogues, there are attempts to bring artists' art into the recording. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators faded out of the sight of the action, sitting on the chairs, watching the main characters. The director wants us to understand that she has adapted the show. I understand. But that does not happen at all until the end of the film. At that moment, watching a crowd of people sitting on a chair for a moment and then disappearing is creepy and confusing. They are like some kind of terrible zombie audience, which appears in the fog, filling us with fear. When you see the terrible play and song that ends this movie, you will want to wake up your own pile of zombies and kill them all because of the severe miscarriage of the mind in 112 minutes. -Mate McGuire
