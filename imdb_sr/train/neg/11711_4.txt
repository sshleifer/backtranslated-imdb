Okay, a movie, with a fine lead lady, but a terrible leading man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays a husband, is a really bad actor. Joice Hiser, on the other hand, is a film rescue grace. She is the best actor in the crowd. NOTE * The first comment, by a colleague who praised the film (and, according to his IMDB.com account, wrote only one review - guess for which film?) is obviously a plant. While the movie is beautifully captured, it is by no means a subtle or large or any other hypobolic description that the reviewer has used. It offers all kinds of sexual situations, but it never goes through them. Like watching Skin Flick on Cinemak, but with all the "naughty pieces" that have been changed. really big mess. Of course, there is screwing, because every film today considers it necessary to complete the bandage. A 4 of 10. <br /> <br />
