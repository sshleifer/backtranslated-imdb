In contemporary Eastern Europe, life is difficult, and for young women, prostitution is one of the only career opportunities that Melania takes unwillingly. She attracts the attention of the American Seimoura, who becomes obsessed with her, paying more and more money for the time she finally does not want to buy her. She has two pimps with various emotional connections to her, and she is usually transmitted as a piece of luggage without her own feelings. However, we are on the territory of a "modern art house," so that conventions like the narrative structure illuminate the subject so that it can be seen that the techniques of the cameras that add, instead of distracting attention from the action and the unclear consistent plot, can be abandoned. Most of the time I had no idea what should happen and very rarely I care. People started to leave the screening just before the last late people arrived, and I think I've never seen so many people coming out. Images are important to the director - characters appear slowly or disappear. in the dark screen, we get long-lasting images of nothing special and one scene of sex takes place in infrared. In fact, for such an unconventional film, scenes of sex were unusual; The missionary positions between the naked people in the bed were abundant and there were no drugs or related freaks. But perhaps these days are usually unconventional. Overall, almost completely without merit. <br /> <br />
