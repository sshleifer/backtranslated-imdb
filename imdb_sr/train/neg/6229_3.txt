First of all, let's take a look at a few things here: a) I am an anime fan - I've always been in fact (I watched Speed ​​Racer all the time in a pre-school). b) I work as several B-films because they are hilarious. c) I like Godzilla movies very much. We continue on, when the movie first comes up, it seems to be your usual B-movie, all the way to the fucking FKS, but all the sudden BOOM! anime is coming! This is the moment when the movie goes downhill. The animation is VERY bad and cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for the mistakes! In fact, it's so cheap, I remember one of the few scenes from the movie "Alive" when a group of children escaped from school ... and it's the same kids again and again! FKS are also terrible; dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, moving to live action on animation is unorganized, dialogue and voices (especially the English dub that I watched) is terrible and I asked my dad to take out the tape from the DVD / VHS player; The only thing that kept me alive was breaking the joke and comments like robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). Frankly, this is the only way we can barely enjoy this movie and spend it at the same time. Damn, I plan to show this to another guy who is my father's friend on Halloween for B-Movie night. Since it's stupid, it's pretty painful to watch and inadvertently hilarious, at the same time I give this movie 3/10, an improvement of 0.5 / 10 that I originally gave it. (According to my scoring scale: 3/10 means pretty boring and bad. How fun it is to count on three unless you find a way to laugh, then it will become fun as counting up to 15. )
