It should have been the last Freddie's film (and it's been over 10 years old) - you would think that you would try to make a good movie. But they turned out to give us the worst of the series (and that's a lot of talk). The plot did not make sense (seriously I can not remember), all the main characters were idiots (you really wanted them dead), and Freddie were worse than usual. The only thing that was good at this time was a short (and funny) comedy by Johnny Depp (his first movie "The Nightmare" was his first). (reaccounting Freddi's childhood) was in 3-D. Pa - 3-D was bad - faded colors and pictures that went in and out of focus. And the three flying skulls that were supposed to be scary (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. EVERYONE broke the laugh. Looks worse on TV 2-D. Misplaced and stupid - also very boring. Skip this and look again at "Freddy vs. Jason".
