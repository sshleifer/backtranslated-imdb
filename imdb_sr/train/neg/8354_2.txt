Any film in which Brooke Shields plays the Fund will be an anomaly and horror. The shields are actually bad only because the young, inexperienced and obviously not well managed by her co-star. Peter Fonda is bad, because, well, because he's bad. I liked Ulee's gold, years later, but Lord up, he's terrible here. Not that someone else is good. There is not any performance (outside Henry Fondine's beautiful chamber), which is even transient. I've never seen a movie with so many bad performances. In the case of Luke Ashev, the main criminal, it is clear that this is because of poor dialogue and direction, because in the past he did a good job. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is a shameless ham. Writing is just terrible, and actors can not be blamed for the terrible things they have to say. But they say so badly! Mounting and direction are worse than pedestrians. The recordings are held for too long, without any dramatic reason, or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized. This picture was much worse than I imagined and would have been completely forgotten (and probably never made) without the involvement of a few well-known names. One bright spot: cinema in the Grand Canyon is exceptional, capturing the beauty of the area in a way that even the imax production on the big screen is not completely done. And finally: is this a bad version of Paper Moon, with a nice pair of father and daughter types, or a bad version of Pretti Babi, with a much more romantic relationship between forty and thirteen years old. This suggests more than this other, and therefore quite disturbing.
