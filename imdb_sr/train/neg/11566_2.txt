Maybe I could not find the DVD menu for PLOT: ON OFF. It is clear that the default value is OFF. When the final credits began to circulate, I could not believe this was it. Like our poor, but beautiful protagonist, I felt used, dirty, inexpensive .... The characters were drawn with very wide moves, and the scorn of the writers towards the rich Thatcher was obvious. I consider myself to be "the Roosevelt Democrat," but I would appreciate a little more subtlety. Naturally, the problem could be with me. I see that many others find some meaning or message in this picture. Unfortunately, I am not. The only thing that prevented me from giving this "1" was a beautiful scene, human and herbal.
