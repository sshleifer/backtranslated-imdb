I thought I would never find such a horror film like "The Return of the Texas Motorcycle Massacre", but this film compete with it. I'm not a person who sleeps when I watch a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after Trance started. I woke up and started looking at him. Why did I deserve it? The whole movie was torture, I need to watch how it ends. I can not stand why he is one of my favorite actors of all time (MR. I must think that he did a favor to the director, or he really needed money, because the film after the film that works, is destroyed ; and so fast ... A movie is not a terrible, stupid story, the characters are terrible (but I really liked the one who played Jared Harris), the effects are very bad, the lack of death and blood, etc.; there are three things in three words: And I really mean it. I can not bear that the director can make such a film. Anyway, when I'm disappointed rao, I saw on the video that the film was presented by Stephen King. You think you could never present this shit? (I rent it in Argentina). I do not recommend it for a million years. I evaluate this film with 2 out of 10. (As I said in my review "The Return of the Texas Motorcycle Massacre", movies will always be on top, so it does not deserve 1 out of 10)
