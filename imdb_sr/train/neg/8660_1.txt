This is probably one of the worst gigantic animal films I've ever seen. This is followed by a typical premise of a laboratory experiment that was wrong and a huge crocodile with a rapid growth of the chemical in it escapes. The monster looks like a dinosaur, which has large Tiranosaurous hind legs, when it should look like a crocodile. Everything about this movie is non-genuine and it constantly secrets "clich√©s", minutes in a minute. Why are there always two drunken drunken hunters after the darkness that separates? In addition, there is always a guy and a girl who share a limp, an obvious interest in love while in life-threatening situations. Much has already been said and I feel like I'm wasting my time writing this ...
