In fact, I do not comment, but I wanted to warn people about this film. It's an incomplete student film with no buying options. At the technical level, it's completely amateur - constant unintentional editing of jumps inside scenes, wild imaging, etc. The action is completely clichÃ©, the structure is ridiculous, and the act is a disgrace. I do not want to be too harsh: I made my own part of student films, and everyone was terrible, but there is no reason for this film to be in a world in which innocent fans will have to see it. /> Safe assumption that - like the actors - positive comments are filmmakers, friends and family.
