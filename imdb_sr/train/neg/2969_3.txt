The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical side of the movie is pretty good ... even directing. The main problem with the castings, which turned this film into another local and regular cliche with a great lack of influence and an even greater lack of impression. Apart from the father's small role, Rafael (who was impressively playing Asi Daian), all other actors were unfortunately not at their best. The role of the older blind girl, played by Tali Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as a leading role. therefore, the figure she behaved has become mild and low. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal than a real movie. But, nevertheless, it's a good thing to start and make big improvements in the future.
