I'm rarely moved to make a comment on the internet about the movie. But I can not understand how this is done. Who made it? How could they have thought they were capable of playing a feature film? Have they done a weekend course at a film school, got a good check from Dad and kidnapped David Badelyle one family after he did not agree to be in it? Or was it by chance a longtime friend / friend from a family who did it from pure, wrong kindness? I do not care, I do not want to know. Even he looks completely embarrassing about what is in him, murmuring his lines and hiding his face from the camera. In the meantime, the DOP had to be from the neighbors, it seemed that there was absolutely no sound design, the scenario, the direction and the installation were sinless, and frankly, the apathy that is now overflowing me means that I can not try to spend more of my life thinking about this film.
