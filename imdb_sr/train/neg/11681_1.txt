Trailers for this movie were better than the movie. What a loss of talent and money. I wish I was waiting for this movie to come on DVD because at least I would not have $ 9. The film is completely missing. What could have been a great movie for all actors, at best, was a B-movie. The film was moving very slowly and just when I thought it was going somewhere, it almost worked, but then it did not. In this day and year, we need unpredictable complications and closing movies, and this film has not offered either. The whole thing about how all suspects are good is, however, not sure if it's the way it was directed, lighting, line delivery, writing or anything else, but none of it came. It's a lot of guts for nothing. I was very disappointed in this film and told everyone not to see it. Wide Saxophone music made the movie even worse. And the end had nothing to do with the rest of the film. What a disappointment.
