This processing of the classic drama Anthony Shaffer did not last long in cinemas. After I recently suffered a cable, I still congratulate myself on not wasting money on the map. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter and star / producer Jude Lav deceive themselves that their prestige could withstand this travesty through infinite 93 minutes, without having fun or a class of longer original ones. Michael Caine magnified his reputation by playing another lead in a wonderful 1972 film. Now he seems to want to destroy him by trying to lead, which in that version was played by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Oscar for the best actor, but they lost to Marlon Brand in DOBROBITI.) Kane looked swollen and exhausted, and smoothly passes through a fraction of the depth than he displays as Batman's butler. He has already gone down on a guest appearance in the terrible remake of GET CARTER. What is next - ALPHIEY II, or SIN MAN WHO WILL BE THE KING? But then, no one benefits from this indecent adaptation by Pinter, who thinks that frequent cursing and the addition of a sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shaffer's witty game. Branag's direction relies on a blond illumination and a soulless scenery that would not be kept in a second-class nightclub. Neither shadow nor solid, excessively closed big plans can not help the law to overcome its boring person on the screen. The result is a failure as a real drama and as a detective thriller, you almost forgot the purpose behind the title. Fans of original stage production (with Anthony Kuaile and Keith Bakter) and Olivier / Caine film would do well to make this company a bad dream. Покойни г. Shaffer, who wrote the script in 1972, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZI and several adaptations of Agate Christie, must turn to his grave, seeking to plan a real murder or two!
