I really did not like this movie because it did not lead to the messages and ideas L'Engle put in his novel. We read a novel in our class of English and I absolutely loved it, I'm afraid I can not say the same for the movie. There were some serious differences between the novel and the customized version, and it simply did not have any merit for the imaginative genius Madeleine L'Engle! That's why I gave her such a bad score. Do not watch this movie if you are a big fan of L'Engle's lyrics, because you will be very disappointed. However, if you are watching a movie for fun (or educational as it was my case) then that's fine movie!
