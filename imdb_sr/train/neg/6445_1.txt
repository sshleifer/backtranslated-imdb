In evaluating documentary films that focus on a relatively small group of ugly ultra-right and conservative groups like this in the United States, you have to consider the following. The United States, with 270 million inhabitants, and its complex history as a democracy that seeks both its hopes and the desire to uphold human rights, has its own shortcomings and weaknesses. Of course, extreme right-wing groups and ultra-conservative groups are expected to exist in large numbers, but they are very small and isolated compared to the size of the population. Based on per capita, Europe, Britain and even Australia have similar right-wing groups in fact on the basis of a drop, the real size of neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually higher than in the United States. For the reasons set out above, it is unjustifiable to humiliate and disparage the American people and their level of debate in the Educated American Society with a very fake and deceptive representation of this ultra-rightist group of psychopaths as representatives of the American Society. In this way, Greenstreet deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to build an image of America that is an unheard-of and deliberate sensationalist lie. This film is obviously designed to ignite and encourage the views of people who carry this subconscious and morbid hatred of the American people and the way of life under the guise of modern and clichy idealistic leftist ideologies. This film was created for profit, not for fostering the truth about American society and human condition. Greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra-right conspiracies, a military-industrial complex, but fail to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate, let alone alternative solutions to lapses of living democracy. Shov's movie is exposed as Anti-American thanks to the support for this garbage. SENSATIONALISM at its worst anti-USA garbage shameful.
