Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a horrible movie. This is just a superposition of the scene without a clear connection. It's also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El Allaili. But something is really amazing in this movie, talking about sexuality, emancipation of women, naked scenes are very rare in Arabic cinema, even in these days. Congratulations to the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons that led me to vote for this movie as horrible are not only the script and the acting, but also the lack of professionalism. This movie looks like an amateur. We can see a lot of errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabic movie Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not the one that is recommended. But if you want to encourage uncensored movies in all Arab countries, watch it and let your friends and your family do the same.
