Some might be mocking, but there's actually real art with making especially bad movies. This collapses on all fronts. Bunch of young people - women with raised breasts and continuous wet t-shirts, of course - go to the movie "surfing the blood" and eventually come across 31 Crocodiles on the feet. Not only is the crocodile obviously fake, but some of the props [especially notice that the ship hit the ridge] seems to have come out of the thunder! It's not good, from start to finish. You can not see!
