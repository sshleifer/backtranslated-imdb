Young scientist Harry Harrison continues his scientific research on the late father on the regeneration of extremities by flying colors. When he finds out, there is an accident in which Harry lost his hand. So, he tests the serum and what causes it is a genetically disturbed hand that has its own mind. Pretty thick shunky garbage is the appearance of film icons Elka Sommer and Oliver Reed. In fact, this is not a bad film of Fangori's films; Only those that are similar to the veins are better there. "Servered Ties" simply have no particular style. Strange nature and unpleasant spatter resembled the "Re-animator", and even the slapstick's touch fell out of "Evil Dead 2". The comic story is really exhausted with black humor, but it can be melodramatic and somewhat dry in a fun factor. Unexpected surprises, especially the final outcome of the film. What is well accepted, as I thought it might have been with something more accessible. For the low-budget production of FKS make-up can look stiff and very stupid, but there are some grotesque moments that will make you smile with the fact that it's actually crowded. Even a brush of sexual tension simplifies the story, thanks to the strictly juicy performance of Elka Sommer as a mother. Oliver Reed is pretty humorous in a bad sense and very well pulls him out. They were both redirected like a couple who you liked to hate. Billy Morrisette is awesome in an unusual performance like Harry. The director, Damon Santostefano, is making a brisk walk around the film and orchestrating some stylish scenes of rugged and bamboo horrors. Yes, it's a minor and, basically, a stupid nonsense, but you have to give it a non-complicated party.
