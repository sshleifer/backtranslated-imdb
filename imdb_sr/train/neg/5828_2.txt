I could not agree with another reviewer who mentioned Jodorovsky. Barney seems to be extremely dull and ungrounded "content". He can produce sweets (and I love sweets), but his pretentiousness and fundamental artistic void only diminish all joy. I'm afraid that many people do not distinguish between similar (but really only on the surface) works of Jodorovsky or even more linear filmmakers such as Tarkovsky or Kubrick (I love Odyssey in 2001 and I have never been bored because of end-scenes ...) Such art as M.Barnei did adds confusion and refuses viewers who would otherwise be able to appreciate the experimental film. Typical empty postmodern "conceptual" art. And check his interviews. I'm just not buying, I'm sorry. And so boring. It was never boring to watch Alehandro Jodorovsky's films, while the Draving Restraint 9 was utterly disappointing. Especially as long as she offered the opportunity to be something, she actually said something in a non-linear, non-heterodox manner (as a start and a great choreographed dance and preparations for the ship to sail ... Ships "meet" at sea ... Ideas of faeces as a matter of value bio feces.) Those "pearls" divers ... Everything could make an excellent surreal movie with some content, but it did not do. And those terrible pretentious dress scenes and false tea ceremonies ... How futile and false and philosophical pretentious or empty? I have some great pictures scene, but the whole movie has become so boring and pretentious and totally empty and fake that it made me physically ill. I do not have a good pace, I love movies at a slow pace, but it was just boring in some scenes - because it was pretentious and fake - so I was only forced to be a witness of an extended scene of artistic vanity ... Such films only kill art and spirit in my opinion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> I want more Jodorovsky !!!
