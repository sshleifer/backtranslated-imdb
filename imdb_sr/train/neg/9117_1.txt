... or maybe this is only bad. The action is a cheap rehash of the first, which is strange, because it should have been bumped, not a sequel. Almost the whole movie looks like a cheap remake of the first, with scenes that mimic the things that happened in the first, just much more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first one had a great role, it consists of actors from the B list and refuses. The acting is mostly bad. Half of the good lines in the movie were taken directly from the first, and almost every major character, including those who were not in the first movie. I understand that this is done by a pilot series of the TV series, but this is not an excuse. They did not have to turn (bad) footage into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and these are erotic sequences. However, since it's not nearly as good as in the first one, even this does not increase the score above 1. If you have the chance to see it for free, and you are the right guy, it can be worth checking if you want something erotic that is not pornography. If not, avoid at all costs. 1/10
