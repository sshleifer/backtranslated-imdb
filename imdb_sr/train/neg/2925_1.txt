After reading a few good reviews and hearing the nice things about this word of mouth I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say that I was pretty disappointed. It was difficult to follow the story because the film was set up as a series of flashbacks between the present and the recent past, which is very badly performed. The characters, despite the actors, are the best efforts indifferent and uninteresting. Sex and nudity are more explicit than they should be. I've never seen a movie in which they seemed so unnecessary to plot. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions on a story that is not well explained. In my opinion, wasting time.
