I rented this film, thinking it looks like a wonderful historical work. What I got was a piece of clean garbage. This film was confusing in most spots, thrilled in almost every place and horrible in all places. The display of Queen Mira Sorvino, who acted as a young male scientist, was deprived at best. Ben Kingsley should have been deprived of chivalry for considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shav should certainly play the role of Petunia Durslei; at least Harry Potter's films are more fun than this thing they call a show in the movie. Cinematography looks like some kid in college attended the classes of cinema 101 and collapsed. Almost every scene in the film is cut out due to some kind of effect; The end result is certainly the safest part of the editing I've ever seen. Jai Rodan was almost as good as Agis; Too bad he had such a bad script to work. Rachael Stirling is doing his best as a gentle lady in waiting. In the end, I really want Blockbuster Video to give money back. I'm so glad I did not spend $ 10 watching this fiasco in the theater. If they have been playing this Marivauk game since the 18th century, I wonder how many people in their age had the best naps during this work. If I were there, they would not hear the game over snoring. Thank God for the modern convenience of DVD players; You can skip boring or horrible scenes. I guess I was just looking at the beginning and the end!
