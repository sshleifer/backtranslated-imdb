As a long-time fan of all Star Trek series, I found this disappointing episode, and I wonder if the liberal use of "flashbacks" with Vill Riker ventures, positive (and mostly romantic) and negative (a lot of pain, and the death of a crew member, was a device for saving money, as well as many of their "side shows" (episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who at least twice appeared on the original series) earned a better final appearance than her character, dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the world of Zvjezdan to the track, is there any other kind?) They were also shortened. This was the last episode of the second season, so the season ended, "not with a bang," but with a "whimper".
