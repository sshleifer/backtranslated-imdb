... as far as the level of humor on which this comedy works is concerned. Hardly even reaching the length of character, "Can I do it ..." while I need glass "is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can not believe when you realize that it should be a punchline (example : Santa Claus Gag), others are so long that you can not believe when you realize that they took so much time to set up such a punchline (example: student's gag prize) and almost everything is directed without any art. Do not misunderstand me: about 1 every 10 jokes can be ridiculous (iron / phone is probably my favorite). There is also a wonderful nudity that shows once again that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is also a comic male nakedness). And I agree with others that it is deliberately stupid the title song is actually pretty damned! But none of these reasons is enough to give this film more than * four.
