Varning Spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad movie, about such an interesting and true story. He had such a promise, but acting at best was ridiculous. Some sets were beautiful and real. The others are something outside the thematic park. I laughed as I watched serious scenes. I really wanted to love this movie, but I could not. The best part was the struggle between friends who ended up dying the "king". I loved the punishment from Cuenca. And, the last shot made a beautiful picture. There are so many better movies to watch. I do not recommend this.
