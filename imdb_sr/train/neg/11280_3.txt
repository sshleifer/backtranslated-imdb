This film is about the life of a man who made a mistake. His job is in failure, and he can not fertilize his wife despite multiple attempts. It just does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the movie makes any sense. The story is so badly said that I just can not understand it. It's a shame because the sets and costumes are well-executed and are sufficiently visually stimulating. The recordings are well composed throughout the entire movie. However, these redeeming features still can not compensate for a bad story and a bad story. I'm amazed by the great names who have agreed to act in this movie. It's the loss of their talents. This film is very bad. Avoid this !!
