I went to watch this film with the most positive expectations. I saw Jackuet's previous film (marsh penguin) and I heard a very positive review of this on the radio. However, I was very disappointed. Most of all, this film is terribly boring. Literally nothing happens. I tried to describe the content of the film to my friend and we both laughed because I just stuttered things like "then comes winter, then spring, then there is an eagle and a river, and once dark, the girl goes to the cave, and the other the way the fox has babies and so on.After about half an hour I began to sigh, zaws, turning my eyes, cursing the reviewer at the radio station, hoping that it would be over soon, but the film was going on and lasting.When it was finally over, I drowned so deep into the chair that I looked something like Stephen Havking. The most disadvantageous di The films of the film are (a) a girl, which is obviously there to give children the identification to identify themselves. She wears the same clothes throughout the film (for a year) and shows exactly two facial expressions: Joy and Seriousness. but a film about the beauty of nature, like this one, would have done better without her human presence. I was always hoping to eat a bear, drown in the river, or something like that terrible. (b) An adult girlfriend's voice comment, which tells us nothing but negligible, obvious, boring, superfluous things. (c) music, which desperately lacks subtlety. When a girl is happily jumping around, the music jumps around. When a fox hits an eagle, and music becomes dangerous. He reminded me of the very early days of filmmaking and was too predictable to enjoy. However, many children who watched the film with me obviously liked it, at least somehow they were involved. So, my warning applies only to adults: If you are older than ten years, avoid this film. You can get a better (and cheaper) dream in most other places.
