The previous reviewer said the film was not that bad. What?!?!?! The film glorifies child abuse. Oh, but Silvia Kristel was naked in that, so let's give her 5 out of 10 stars. Why not 10? Since filmography was "agonistic", the child's appearance of shock was "unrealistic" and a fat friend "irritated". Nowhere in the review, the reviewer does not express any insult to the fact that the American film in 1981 had scenes of a child who has sex with an adult woman. I accidentally caught this cooked movie in the tavern while I was staying at a hotel that had Shovtime. For me, even if a fat friend got into a storm and was credited with an Oscar, I would still have to give a movie to only one star. This film TV, Hovard Hessman, acted in the movie at the same time as appearing in VKRP, which is particularly funny. But do not tell me about it!
