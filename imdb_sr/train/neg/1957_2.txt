Most of the time I enjoyed this movie, but I got the feeling I was watching a children's movie. I honestly think that someone wrote a script and then, while recording, decided to add some blood, nudity and language. this was a great downturn. There is what children believe in magic that exists in movies such as "babies" (pigs) or "angels in the field" that defies evil villa. Parents ultimately trust their daughter in her ability to see the spirit and use this skill to supernate victory to the tooth fairy. when I bought this movie, I thought it would be a b-movie response to the terrible darkness of the fall; somehow manages to make a better 1/4 coin, but they do not. made a worse film and probably lose the same amount of money lost in the dark.
