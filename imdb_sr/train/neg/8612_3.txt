This was a movie that could be watched, but the plot was a bit weak and most of the joke was from some of Rodney's earlier films. With these words, it took time to look. I gave this 5 out of 10. So, in essence, it's one of those movies that do not go out on the road to see, but if you find it on the tube, take the opportunity.
