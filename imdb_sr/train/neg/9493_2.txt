This ridiculous film offers a standard "hippie mentality" from the 1970s in a walnut shell and we are dull in this process. It is an attempt to rationalize the absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old-age sexual fads and wash people. The naive young hippie played by the homeless (Kai Lenz) walked and slept with all the wrong guys, and then one day he met ridiculous (Holden), at the age, claiming alcoholic drinks and washed as an actor, and she decides that in "love "with him. If you think it's superficial, the whole movie contains such scenes. He constantly says how much he "loves" and she just met him, she is skinny and very quick. I could not even laugh in the whole movie. Obviously, he only uses it as a meal card, but the director is not immature enough to think that we will buy that there is actually any love. The disgusting scene is where two are naked and have sex, I had to rewind it forwards, because it almost inspired me to vomit. Throughout the film, the corn bowl offers music from the 1970s. Avoid this if you can. Grade D.
