I do not know what would be great in this movie. What's worse, why would anyone try to see this? First of all, there is no story. It could be said that even without a story, the movie could be worth watching because it causes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, scream, fear, ...), but in my opinion this film does not do it. You only watch images for +/- 2 hours. There are several useful things you can do. I assume you could say that the movie is an experiment and is brave because it misses all the above. But is this worth 2 hours of your precious time and 7 euros of your money? For me, the answer is no.
