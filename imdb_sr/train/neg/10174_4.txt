I saw it in '94. When it's finally released. Obviously because Orion's paintings were bankrupt, I do not think the film was published a few years earlier. I remember him as a very boring movie. I was constantly discussing whether to get out of it. The shop was not interesting or interesting at all. It was an American imitation of third-speed graffiti. None of the performances make it worth watching. One of the biggest disappointments since the local journalist gave a high rating.
