I registered only to give this comment (which is already quite similar to what is already here). The act is worse than subordinate, exhibits on the usual stereotypes, it has some of the worst displays of inexperienced female objectification (not all of them have brain) and has some of the the most famous lines that are familiar to man. Including, but not limited to, "It's okay to see what these guys can do," I should note that when they show falls involving innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for innocent people and start hating the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most explosive black people who just look at people wrong. He may or may not be a good actor, but this film does not allow such a character research. Want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of bad guys? Oceans 11. This movie just asks you to hate the bad guys instead of catching the audience. Even cars can not compensate for this coincidence of the film. This Enzo, who destroyed Griffin, perfectly describes this film. Just bullshit.
