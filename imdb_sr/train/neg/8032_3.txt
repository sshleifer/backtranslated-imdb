This played a great role with famous stars such as Tirone Pover, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevei, and much less known short-timers. He also had Technicolor, one of several films made in 1939. Now bad news ....... unfortunately, I can not say much positive for the story. He showed James' guys in a completely positive light .... and Hollivood had been doing it since then. Why are these criminals always shown as "good guys" is beyond me. This film glamorizes them and makes their enemies - people in the line - into evil human beings. The latter was so exaggerated that he was meaningless. Well, it's a movie for you: evil is good; Good is bad. Hey Hollywood: Here's the news - James's guys were criminals! Really - look!
