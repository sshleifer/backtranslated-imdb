Reason to watch this blow ... err ... honoring a big movie called Se7en: - It's on while your channel surfs and there's nothing else to do. - Someone pays you to watch it. Make yourself a service and climb to the DVD for Se7en, rent it, download it to iTunes, or put it in your Netflik character and completely skip the Flock. The Flock is the same story with a few edits. Moreover, editing is just Se7en and actually takes you out of the story several times. The worst is probably flying over desert helicopter shots, with the sounds of people fluttering over the radio, except that there are no police helicopters flying over them in this one. knock off. If you want to be nice, you can call it "Danak", just go ahead, but go watch Se7en.
