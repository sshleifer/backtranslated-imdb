"Plants are the most emotional and the most powerful of all life forms," ​​reports a slaughtered victim in the "Seedpeople," a silly, tiny remake of the Bodysnatchers Invasion, "Trifid Day," and about a thousand udders. And why are seeds more dangerous than plants, are they asking? Because, according to the same doll, "seeds can hunt us". Yes, I can remember one terrifying incident when MooCov was just a calf, who ran to the house from school by the hungry seeds of dandillion ... Yes, right. Unfortunately, the "monsters" in this little turkey look like a cracked little muppet, some of which roll around like evil twists, the other floating around the wires. There is not even the slightest hint of terror or uncertainty that can be found here. For reasons that remained unexplained, the monsters of the seed were thrown off by ultraviolet light of 50 volts, although they can walk in daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000,000,000 times more UV energy. As you can see, there was not much thought about this cow. MooCov says you're going to the garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
