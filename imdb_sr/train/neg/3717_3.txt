Kris Rok, apparently desperate for a nice starry vehicle, which will be crossed by his appeal to the white and mainstream black audience, updates the 1978 hit comedy "Heaven Can Wait" with the Urban Agenda. He plays a comedian struggling in an automobile accident and who has prematurely removed his soul - therefore, his angels must find another body in which they will be placed, and they can only invent that white businessman. The transcription of the movie as a mild and sentimental "Heaven Can Vait" only shows that Rock's eye was on the side of the office (it was a strictly corporate move organized by a hobbyist of Hollywood players). Why not strive for something more exalted or unforgettable than a silly comedy of reincarnation that culminates in the evening in Apollo? Unbelievable support (including usually the trusted Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addi, Vanda Sikes, Eugene Levi and the great Frankie Faison) are doing what they can, but Rock looks awkward and uncertain about herself. * 1/2 of ****
