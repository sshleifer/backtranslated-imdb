This film really started. He had the potential to turn into a truly cordial, romantic love story with cinema that recorded love between Harlan and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. That really should not have been anything more than that, and for a moment I was awakened that somebody finally made a nice movie for myself, another timeless classic, perhaps a modern myth. Why, oh, why, then you mess it halfway so that the main character (Norton) is another psycho? Maybe I missed the point, but do you really need another movie about psychos? Or is it a need in Hollywood to show the sick side of a human nature that points to a more general state of affairs in the film industry? For a moment, I intended to mention the name of the director; Now I'm left indifferent. In defense of the film, at least it should be added that all actors invest in their roles. Also, Evan Rachel Vood is really great for watching and a good actor with a lot of potential.
