This film aims to be a perversion study. Some critics are swallowed assuming that the perversion is displayed psychologically deeply; In fact, given the weight loss, it is surprisingly boring and shallow, with no motivational substance. Why is the main character as it is? You will not find out from the script. For a better treatment of the same theme (and a funny movie), try Bunuel's Belle de Jour.
