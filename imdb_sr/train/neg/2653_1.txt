I could not believe this film was horrible; I rarely watch commercial TV, but I thought, "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching." I'm fine. Everyone involved should shame their heads. I realized that there are not many big roles for women of a certain age, but the scenario for it was so incompetent, clich√© and confusing that I am amazed that it has ever come into development or that Mrs. Keaton thought that can make a silk purse from the ear of this sower. None of the characters had any conviction and was so incredibly similar. The show looked like classroom exercises START - I looked at the open voice of horror through most of this, wondering "What did they think?". Very, very sad that this has happened. Do not waste your time.
