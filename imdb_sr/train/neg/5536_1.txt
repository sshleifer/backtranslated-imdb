The Revolt Zombie has no redeeming features. I'm tired of people who claim that it's not that bad, and that the effects had to pack more blows in 1936. I suppose it's not true: it's not like IK has grown rapidly over the last seven decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably as boring to this nonsense as the average viewer today. Why? Try to watch the first scenes, and count the breaks between things that happen, an awesome choice when you need to shrink to a close-up plan, slapdash editing that seems to include two seconds for each shot to reduce the work time. Pay attention to a completely redundant dialogue: "I'll make tea / get out / read my book now." "Are you?" "Yes I am." Such an exchange occurs several times. I would usually like to be a big fan of bad films, but watch dumb actors mumbling their banal and boring lines, and we all want to laugh at the movie slowly disappearing. This type of disinterested, snooker of time is much worse than energetic, imaginative minds such as the Plan Nine of Space or Santa Claus wins the Martians. Those who claim that this is "better" than those more interesting movies have a backward idea of ​​fun. This film is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs openly into astonishment: it's bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom. Which is far worse.
