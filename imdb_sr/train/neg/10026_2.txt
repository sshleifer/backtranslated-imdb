I had a certain expectation for the film, because it had a beautiful star and that is the return of the spirit of Akshai and Saif. Well, I hesitate to watch the movie because it was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhooma 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared with Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. When I started video credits, I felt nice because it was nice. Well, the very first scene itself has rejected me. Then, the main disadvantage of the film is the action sequence. Me and my friends laughed to watch this fucking fight. It was like Akshai against some 30 thugs and all of them had machine guns! Uh ... you have to see this to understand how heavy sequences are bad. Another thing about the movie is too predictable story. He reminded me of some of the films from the early 80's. Well, the only thing worth the movie is sexy Kareena, which looked very hot in this. 2 out of 10. Boys, please ... please ... do not look at this thinking thinking it's a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this in order to laugh at the terrible fighting scenes. It's all.
