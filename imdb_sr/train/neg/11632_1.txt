I watched this movie at Sneak Preview screening and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. Full of jokes is dick and fart and is not proud of action sequences (such as shooting in "Little Germany"). I made a small list of things I enjoyed in the movie ... and which I did not agree with. 1. Penis Dave Foleia. 2. Freaks on the fart. 3. Poop jokes. 4. Dude was a cunt. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. Taliban 7. They are laughing at Bush again. 8. Dude has blue hair. 9. Plot. 10. The murder of a minor 11. Uwe Boll was in him. 12. Most actors were just outraged and there. Now (little) good 1. Dude uses a cat as a silencer as in the game. 2. A lot of actions. 3. Crotchi made a return (and a creator of the Post) 4. Uhm .. I did not have to pay for it. 5. There are a few moments when this will happen. Boll repeated that. He made another crap game in film adaptation. Част вам, г. Boll. 2/10
