the only scenes that made me laugh where the Christopher walked with him (crazy movie director), the rest of the movie was just boring. In the first hour or so nothing actually happens. jokes that should be ridiculous are not the zeal Jones Douglas is really exaggerated. Julia roberts does the routine job of a former ugly duck (yes yes!) in a neighborhood girlfriend (where I've seen it before?) who gets a guy for a short time. what would happen to the main characters. If the cusack really fell in the building in a suicide attempt, the movie could be much more interesting to watch.
