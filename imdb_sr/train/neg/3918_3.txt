This film may have been the greatest experience I've experienced in renting movies based on IMDb reviews. All in all, I just found it to be a second-order movie. Leslie Cheung is certainly passable as an antihero, and Ma Vu carries with it his joyful competence. On the other hand, Ma Vu's make-up (hair on the face) is so obviously fake that I just could not take it seriously. He looked like a teenage heavyweight dressed for Halloween, along with a beard of $ 4.95. The language of the trees looked like something from a bad film in the 1950s, although POV images from the viewpoint of the language were more like the symbols of Sam Raymy in the newer "Evil Dead" trilogy. Pyrotechnics was ho-hum, and the ultimate battle is as boring as you can. (Actually, this was the closest reminder to me on the episode "Lost in Space" in which Robinsons were caught in a sandy storm and ...). times in the form of European fairy tales. There were no tensions and no complications. In fact, you know immediately when you get to know the characters that are good, who are bad and who will survive. I just returned this Netflick movie and then I sat down write this review. The first thing I did was to check the date of production. Yes, it says 1987 ... not in 1967, which I thought might be. And it quite sums up: production values ​​and FKS are typical for the 1960s. Action and action seem much older, because Hollywood actually produced some interesting and challenging films of the sixties. ** From *****
