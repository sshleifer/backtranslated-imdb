This film had the potential to be far more than it was. But this not only does not deliver, but at the same time leads to torturous self-righteous preaching. The difference is that this time should have a southern accent, which he noticeably lost several times in each scene. He's as good as usual, but hardly stands out. Speaking of the story, a tangled story in which Cusack is a self-governing mayor, a boy who just needs to look for the "real thing". this way. Cusack's character loses all credibility in the end, who, without revealing, preached and tortured. The final scene makes the last nonsense deep. It's also completely incorrect, but I will not go into law. This is a bad film movie. It seems interesting for the first 40 minutes, then it's really a bragging, proselytizing, self-righteous movie for the last hour. Better with a foolish crap than this bunch of garbage.
