I think the biggest failure is something that can be bored. Bad is actually better than bored. This thing has no breath. It has an interesting fact that it is happening in Cambodia. How many American films from the 30s were held in Cambodia. However, the conflict is difficult to grasp. Even the hull movements are a little confusing. What drives him to a massive stalemate is a love story. I do not know why these two guys are so full of blue blondes. I thought I should continue to use my zombies (like they) and forget about it. The movie is retiring. Perfect microcosm is the place where one of the main characters is following the Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphs are kept (or anything else) explaining how to turn people into zombies. I thought he would never get there. One guy works two steps. It's stopping. He looks around. The other is hiding behind some columns. He does two steps. It's stopping. He looks around. The other is behind the bush. This is short movie. Then, there is a bad acting and an impeccable dialogue. I really have a lot of patience when it comes to B film. This is unbearable. By the way, one more suitable title would be Revolt Hypnotized.
