Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he does not have any business to be the lead except in a low-budget movie. He does not really have a lot of charisma. Rio Ishibashi has much more presence on the screen, and unfortunately he is not the main character. Much of the screen time goes to Rooker with bricks. Danielle Harris (from the movie Halloween 4 and 5 movies) plays her daughter, and she is cute and fun, but she's written as if she was not too smart and one of her stupid mistakes kills one of the main characters . Comrades Fred Villard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just looking at what's happening to these characters is invaluable. Vincent Schiavelli plays Consigliare the local godfather of Mafia, and it's hard to say whether he's doing the movie as a comedy or not. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. It seems to be in every extremely low budget in the movie. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Watching so many comedians and comedic actors in this movie, I felt like a gimmick. Is it a parody of Iacus movie? It's hard to say in some points. There must be very little Iakuza action. Support for Thugs and Goons is scary and well-thrown. Some of these types of films have Thugs that seem to work in local comics stores or as boys in Piggle-Wiggle. All in all, this film is very uneven. Sometimes it looks like a comedy or a parody. Then at other points she works as a good action movie. Then he's scrubbed to the end. Without the contribution of Danielle Harris and Rio Ishibashi, this film would be rated Zero in my humble opinion.
