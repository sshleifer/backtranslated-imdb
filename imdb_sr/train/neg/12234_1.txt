I think it was pointless to produce the second part of a movie like "My Girl". "My girlfriend" was a very good movie, but it's funny to make the second part of a movie where one of the main characters (Macaulai Culkin as Thomas J.) Dies. The story is over after the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to get the story going. It was pointless!
