In Strip, Modesty is strong. Alekandra Staden, who plays Modesti Blaise, looks more like an anorectic model. She does not have the moral or personality of Modesty in the comic. Modesty would never give the woman advice to show more skin to earn more money. I can not see any similarity to my comics with Modesty and this film. As a film impossible mission it would be about Ethan Hunt locked up in a high school detention room in conversation with the janitors about going to high school, and Hunt would play DJ Kualls (in Road Trip). So, if you're not a fan of Modesti, you will only get angry. If you do not know much about humor comics, rent another movie, do not waste time with this. I can not understand how Kuentin Tarantino can put his name on him. Tomorrow I will ask for a refund in the DVD rental store.
