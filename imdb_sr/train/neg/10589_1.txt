Universal Soldier: Return is not the worst movie ever made. No, this honor should go to a film that tried to make some sort of statement or to perform some artistic venture, but failed in a pathetic or offensive way. However, perhaps no film I've ever seen has tried so little and managed as completely as the Universal Soldier did: Back. This film is a sci-fi / action travesty that virtually nothing recommends. The acting is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The action is terrible and predictable. Special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone who is still connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves. USA: The return makes the previous Van Damme ticket a revolutionary film masterpiece. Some movies are so bad, they're good. Trust me when I tell you this is not one of them. I'm really not sure what else to say. I doubt that many people have thought about watching this movie if they are not already, but just in case: do not.
