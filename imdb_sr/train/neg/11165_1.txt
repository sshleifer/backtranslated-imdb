I mean, really ... or I suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is a really bad movie. It's stupid, ridiculous and just not funny. After all, since I saw the review, I knew it would not be a great movie, but I did not think it would be so bad. What happened with good old times when you could find smart funny lines in any movie? When did actors not have to play funny roles in an attempt to be funny? Now we are here with movies like this, Borat, Little Men, Scari Movie 4 where I could not find funny parts! Just skip this piece of garbage PS (Sorry for my English)
