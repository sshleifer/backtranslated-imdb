Follow the same route as most extensions. The first one was great. The other was an average and this, full of bad acting and some stupid dialogue and a lot of suspicion of unbelief, this film was weak. as well as the boss with that stupid eye, could have been much more than that. The first one I liked very much. I wish they had gone more in those ranks, not what they did here. An old-fashioned phone in that room? I understand that there is another one in the work. Blah!
