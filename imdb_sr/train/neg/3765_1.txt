I've always been interested in anything about Bigfoot, so when I asked for a rental film, this one caught my eye. It was THE BEST $ 4.50 I've ever spent and I want my money back! Please do not spend money on this! This was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole film was so incredibly boring and I found myself turning a lot of eyes and I did not even look through it. I just have a lot of that. The acting was terrible, the effects were horrible, everything was really bad and untidy. It's all a really bad, boring movie and a total waste of time and money. I hope that one day I will make a good movie about Saskatchewan, but by then I will have to sit through countless cheap dumbbells like this to find the right masterpiece.
