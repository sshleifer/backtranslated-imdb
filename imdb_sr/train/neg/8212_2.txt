I've read all the comments on this movie. I'm a big fan of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this film was based. The film is an ugly and degrading fiction of truth. I do not criticize him for changing small details or events for dramatic purposes; It is not a documentary. But the script changes the influence, reaction, reality and change in EVERY main character. This significantly changes the true relationship between Harar and the young Dalai Lama. From ridiculous rivalry for Tibetan (which degrades the culture of Tibet) to Harry's gift for the music box, to Harrara's heart's change, everything about this movie is wrong-except for brilliant photography . I understand that the shootings from Potala (palace) are smuggled from Tibet. However, they change the true story of the relationship between two people, One of them is very important for this world, in order to build the film The star is sad
