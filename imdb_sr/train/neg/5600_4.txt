Fully experiments with the sci-fi are not successful. Usually in our films without the horror we still get large amounts of blood, but not here. Summarize very funny scenes like when prisoners are forced to stay at least 12 minutes, and if they drop out, they are killed. the guy falls and has some kind of apartment on the floor for about two minutes while his friends who were bothered to keep it from the floor. The city is an obvious model, but not bad. and the ultimate explosion is at best ridiculous. And do not run me on terrible battles. 4/10
