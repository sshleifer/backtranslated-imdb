At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the pop corn as loud as possible to quench the dialogue. This is absolutely not a movie about girls. All the guys who love it are those ladies who can make sure they stay away. Stupid story, a central dialogue and a whole cheap movie. I've seen many, many movies, but this is a new winner in a bad category. If you see it by chance, the only thing you will be looking forward to is the end. So you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can.
