In my life I've seen many great and horrible movies. I'm not an expert in professional criticism, but I definitely have something to say about this. First, these actors are the worst I've ever seen ... Their acting is so unrealistic that even you want to throw the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think that these actors were not interested in quality. Another terrible thing is in these dialogues - they are so miserable. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It seems that your 14-year-old son might be better off behaving. I think this film had a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old European car ... Please, if my message arrives - save time and money.
