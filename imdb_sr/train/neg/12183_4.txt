Christ. Continuation of one of the most beautiful films of all time, at least it has the power to exclude songs (entertaining a reprise of an intolerable "Tomorrow"), but continues the tradition of torture and immodest. This time, Eni and her friends go to London and get caught up in Joan Collins' conspiracy to blow up the Buckingham Palace or some sort of shit. The movie has a bizarrely sophisticated attitude toward its epitomized face that is in conflict with how irritating it is: every time a little juice "jumps" to the lizards! "I could feel that teeth are powdered." Good luck, photographed, soft and boring, the film has only one unforgettable line ("Let me go, you stupid genius!") And the fact that it's not the original to recommend it.
