What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and acceptable premise with both decent and talented actors, but somewhere the film loses it. In fact, it never really started. There was little excitement when we found out that Angie was not really pregnant, and then she found out she was, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot of film, was terrible, and his entire character was not nearly as close to it as being important for this film, except to extend it. I really would like to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe I'm not trying to have a clean comedy, which unfortunately was not, but perhaps a drama with comic elements. I think the movie could be very funny, because both actresses are very funny in their own way and sitting here I can remember a number of scenarios that would be messy.
