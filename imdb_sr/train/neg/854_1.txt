Ladies and gentlemen, do not be fooled by the movie "Stanley Kubrick". This is a very bad movie that unfortunately was declared one of the deadliest horror films ever made. People should shake their hearts while thinking about a true horror movie. In Shine, there is no real horror, but what we found is just a na√Øve, stupid attempt to create a cold horror. Everyone knows how good they are. It's all good in the movie to look at the icy valley. And the hotel where the majority of actors were placed looks good. The word about actors Jack Nicholson seems like a lost, lazy soul that is never really safe in what you should do. , a colored actor who is busy most of the time with the pampering of a child actor. It is not necessary to blame the bad weather for the tragedy. This can not be avoided because the film was filmed and poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.
