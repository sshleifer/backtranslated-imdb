As long as there is 3D technology, I think an animation has been made for it. I particularly remember the cartoon Donald Duck's film with Chip and Dale in it. I do not remember the name at this time, but the plot was that Donald worked in the circus, fed the elephant peanuts, and Chip and Dale stashed peanuts. This was made to look at the 3d probably in the 1960s. If you've accidentally watched Meet Robinsons in 3D on cinemas, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of its origins. Probably there are about 100 cartoons specially made for viewing through 3D glasses. This claim was a bad move because it is not difficult to prove that they were wrong. Above all, this looks like a bad movie.
