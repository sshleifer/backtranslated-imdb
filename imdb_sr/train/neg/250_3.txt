Seeing three other versions of the same film, I am afraid that this is by far the weakest, primarily because of Scott's boring and lead performance. His emotions are so mild that it's difficult to get involved in the movie. Alistair Sim showed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at its worst, you do not realize that Scott says a dialogue with a lot of conviction and when he goes through his metamorphosis, he is also unconvincing. I can not imagine any actor in this film that coincides with those of the Alistair Sim. Even the musical version (and frankly, Muppets) download this is better done. Frustrating.
