In this film, it is difficult to find positive results. It seems that the producer had to earn without much effort and that is why we were treated to the full display of Galaki, which is the brightest excuse for a film in history. Police girls looked extremely sexy in their small uniforms. More action shootings by two police officers and a lot less Galaxies would be a way to go. Of course, this would contribute to the budget, so they decided to fill the space with those poor repetitions. Ms. Olbrait is great and sexy, and acting is the first. Ms. Stabs, which I previously heard, but not seen on the screen, also seemed very desirable, but she seems to lack the basic acting talent. Except Ms. Albright, this is really rubbish.
