so I discovered that this documentary is strange and really pointless. I know that he got awards and things, but I personally did not enjoy too much. there was no humor or drama in her to interest you, only a bunch of vierdos and their jobs. some of the people are quite different, which is not bad, it just did not leave a good impression on me. I was basically boring with this film, without offending my creative writing teacher. The theme of the circus throughout the film was somehow cool, but I did not get it, and the robotics and lavatory circulation is definitely not my thing. the thing with green animals was neat, I really liked the garden a lot of colorful flowers, but how did these four things work together? I just did not make much sense why someone would make a film about it. But if you are in such things, you can enjoy it. who am I to stand in your way. I'm just warning you of the possible suffering.
