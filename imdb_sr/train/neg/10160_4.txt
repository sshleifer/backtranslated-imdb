A typical Lanza flick that had a limited audience with a low line story that was compiled simply to justify the Lanzin MGM contract at that time. As reported by Lastlyberal member (above), Graison could not endorse Lanza because of his obsessive advancement toward her (and sometimes on the camera). In addition, his monastic way and the constant smell of alcohol in her face during the scenes they worked together were unbearable. After filming together the second (and last) film, "Tost New Orleans", Normally silent Grayson fell into Louie B.'s office. Maiera and told him with insecure words that he would never work with Lanz again? period. Maier considered Grayson much more valuable for MGM than Lanza, so Grayson's statement was stuck. Grayson continued to act in numerous widely-received (and far more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later in his life, when he was asked to compare Lanz and Keel, her answer was that there was no comparison between them, and that Kil was great to work and had much more attraction to the "real people" in the audience.
