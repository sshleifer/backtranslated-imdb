Every movie that has naked scenes Karen Allen and I'm still bored out, it's stink! Karen stuck in Paris, and she gets acquainted with a kind French man with whom he is about to have sex soon. Of course he is married, ("But, cherry, why this would be a problem?") What might be interesting is the conflict of culture is (believe it or not) just boring. I went out. Perhaps the movie got much better after I left; but it should be much better to compensate for a broken start. My advice, if you find yourself in this, run, do not walk, to the exit. Save time and energy. Surely save money. Too bad the production company did not save its money.
