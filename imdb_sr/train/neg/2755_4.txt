This is the most cruel collection of clich√©s, arranged on a straight line, with no obvious plot or any decent mode of action that I have seen for a long time. Kanibalizing scenes from Star Wars, the Fireworks, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter, went on a comprehensive war on the intelligence of the viewer. Is this movie good? It was not a movie at all! Even if it is not so low that it would actually be ridiculous and achieve cult status as a comedy, the film offers some laughter. The trick is that the copied scenes are placed in the context of their original films. Gandalf can be fun to speak Korean, Basilisk looks funny if you compare it to a kitten, and an evil supporter can entertain a turn around between Sauron and Egg Bing, or whatever it's called. Conclusion: any pleasure that comes out of this movie depends entirely on the state of obsessivity and imagination of viewers, not the director / writer. Shame on you, Shim!
