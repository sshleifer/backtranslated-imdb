The only reason we give this film even to one star is how much the end ended in laughter. I had great hopes as I usually love bad campfire holiday horor films, but this simply did not qualify. It's actually just a bad attempt to get the character somehow slowly into insanity, which is not a bad plan yet, but it's bad here. There are some scenes (such as an ending) that are not meant to be funny, but they actually laughed loudly. It was several times when I thought the film would really go in an interesting direction, but it never fulfilled what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a flash, try Silent Night, Deadli Night.
