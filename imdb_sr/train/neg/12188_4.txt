Although I can not deny that his films are often entertaining, I have always felt that Martin Scorsese is a bit overestimated in his abilities. His use of colorful stylistics in a large number of his films as if screaming "Look at me, am I not a imaginative director?" His best film I saw was the one with the least added bloom, the superb "Raging Bull". For this remake it seems to have been a business as usual. The boring film film that led to the 1950 situation was so scary that it itself distracted attention. Melodramatic close-ups combined with sub-parallel imitation of the classical "Psycho" sooner will probably cause smiles of mockery rather than a sense of atmospheric horror. The rating for "Psicho" was brilliantly disturbing, this 'homage' just sounds puffy and boring. Even actors, who can sometimes be decent, give acting performances that only scream "caricature"; the notable exception of this intelligent reversal by Levis as a striking daughter of a teenager from the Bovden family. Of course, it seems appropriate, but as soon as it opens its mouth, the aura just goes away. Now I'm not an expert on American accents, and I originally came from Manchester's surroundings in England, but he could certainly come up with a more convincing southern move than that? As a gifted physical actor, he almost goes beyond this fatal flaw, but not entirely. It was troubling, as De Niro fan, to wish he was out of the screen, not interested in his performance. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS.) - The ultimate style of the whole film stretches to the funny finale. When will Scorsese learn that underestimating the situation can sometimes raise tension as efficiently as if to give the viewer a visual and audible bombardment? I also thought that the reputation was too respected to resort to a "killer-not-dead-yet" cheap trick that less talented individuals could use. All in all, a completely ridiculous 'thriller'. Scorsese and De Niro did much better together.
