Like last year, I could not sit on the whole thing. Okay, Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was unclearly engaged. Or, to put it more correctly, of all the total boredom packaged in the theater, it was at least not the Top 10 most lucrative. Many exhibitors, on the other hand, were in this prestigious Top 10. I did not know that the whole thing was made an autocue (although I knew it was scripted), but it was really awesome to see those supposedly good actors who are not able to insert an expression, turning a look out of the word and tackling the simple words (Natalie Portman, if there is no director, there is no one). The night of beautiful dresses and boring speeches were long and tiring, Beionce Knovles had some good songs and there were very few decent speeches and recordings. Adam Sandler wins the award for the worst exhibitors. For help writing this review, I would like to thank my mom, my dad, my lawyer and pedicure for all who believe in me and I want to emphasize that I have high metabolism and of course not to starve for a month. I will not cry ... thank you.
