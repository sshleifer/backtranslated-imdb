Another look at the horror. Interesting differences between American and Russian films. However, from my American perspective this film was not very good. The protagonist, Marie, played by Anastasia Hille, was not a pleasant character, and it was hard for me to recognize her. Most of the time she was embarrassed and she was confused for the little time left. And too much time was spent to get to the main location of the movie. Then it was a long time before real tension came. Once this happened, it seemed that the volume was used as a major effect, which was more boring than anything else. The concept was more original than most direct films and did not use sex to make up for a slim plot. All in all, I would recommend it for rent, but not for theater visitors.
