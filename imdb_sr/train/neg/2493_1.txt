A really horrible movie. At first, I did not know that this was an effort on Kiwi - but I quickly realized that all the characters spoke with the hard-hidden accents of kiwi bats under false American ones. Why did it have to be set up at all? - it could have been set up in the NZ, and then the actors could use their normal voices. Surely someone in the production team could hear terrible attempts to talk with US accents? Bad movie. I'm surprised that it took so long - how did it get out of the can? It seemed like a very bad attempt at the Segal / Villis type of action flick. TOTAL MONEY WASTE! If in this piece of garbage there were money for taxpayers, I would have a revolution to bring all the money back to the vault. I'm still hurrying (I get it, Full!) On the absolute garbage I just saw. Why did I continue to watch? Well, I'm a fanatic and I can not help it, me!
