Eddie Murphi for Best Supporting Actor ??? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. Jamie Fock (who can play) is walking through this film as a zombie. Beionce ??? That worked? This film fades with respect to CHICAGO or any other recent musical. Had there been no great singing and performances by Jennifer Hudson, I would give this ZERO. typical Broadway and Hollivood rap.
