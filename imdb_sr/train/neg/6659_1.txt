During the first 3 seasons, pretty unusual parents were tasty as sweet and sweet and infectious. Now it's tasty like Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you will need after looking at the latest episodes, where all sweets are replaced with insults and violence that result in no laugh. Cosmo, one of Nick's finest characters, grew into an insulting nasty jerk that actors Gui would not even want to know. Timmy became a selfish arrogant jerk that Bart Simpson would genuinely beat the bale (and gave Timmy's snotiness, it would have been a lot of beating). And poor Vanda ... a real charmer who has become a victim of her husband and goddess, is now labeled as "an instinct" to care for the welfare of others. Plus Cosm's stupidity causes everyone pain, but he has never been punished for it, nor does he teach any lessons. What pretty much summarizes Butch Hartman's attitude towards children: they are rude, vulgar and not too bright. Thank God that this messy toon has been canceled, along with dear Butch Hartman, Danny Phantom. Bar Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosma.
