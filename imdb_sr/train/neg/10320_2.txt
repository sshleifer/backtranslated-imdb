I really hoped this would be a funny show, considering all the hyper and smart pistols. And I'm talking about hyperpoil, I even heard an interview with the BBC's Vorld Todai, a program that broadcasts around the world. Unfortunately, this show is not even approaching. All the jokes are obvious - those that sound kind of funny when you first hear them, but then they look crazy - and do not get any new treatment or twisting. All characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - good - central (I'm fine). It's a classic CBC recipe - one that always fails. If you are a Muslim, I think you would have to be silly to believe in any white person, and if you are white, you are a little offended by the fact that almost all white characters are portrayed as either being or not, or both. It's not that ridiculing white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in it. It's just a problem when it's not funny-like in this show. Canada sizzles from ridiculous people - so much exports to Hollywood on a regular basis. How come the producers of this show could not find them?
