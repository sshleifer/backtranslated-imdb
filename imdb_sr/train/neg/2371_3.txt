I'm not a big fan of Freddie Krueger, but that does not mean I do not like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a very good actor. But without Roberto's insult, this film was sucked. The acting is terrible, the plot is really weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the acting team that is even worth watching. Friday 13th franchise (I thought the remake was the best in the series.) But this is not one of those films. The original was good, the other was better in my opinion, the third was fine, but I did not, All you do is not make the same mistake as I was watching this shit.
