This was one of the boring "horror" movies I've ever seen. The college boy has a nightmare epic that includes wandering ghosts in Alcatraz. Trying to deliver the mix of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and the standard vampire tariffs in the form of a bad video of the 80's, this film is congested with a full-fledged and exhausting slow story. Though such a bad and often funny movie (a digging of these shoes and a terrific dialogue), that would be a good material for the mystery of the Misteri Science Theater 3000. Do not be fooled by the proud memorial of the film in 1987, the winner of the Silver Scroll Avard Academy of Sicence Fiction, Fanatasi and Horror, or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that Toni Basil has a role in the film. It's a gigantic disaster, albeit one with a small cult (see other IMDb comments for this movie).
