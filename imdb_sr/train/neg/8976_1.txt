The first point that calls attention to "For Ever Mozart" is the absence of a summary in the IMDb. The explanation is easy because there are no stories, scenarios, complications, or anything that might recall the minimal structure of the film. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most appreciated and pretentious film industry directors, and this senseless shit is among his most humorous films. I believe that he himself did not understand what this story is about; but there are intellectuals who explain and explain this messy film, and it's funny to read their criticisms. My voice is one. Title (Brazil): "Pair Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
