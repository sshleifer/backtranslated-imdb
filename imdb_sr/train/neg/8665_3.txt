This is a low-budget film Roger Corman horror / creature. DinoCroc is created when manipulating prehistoric genes. The constructed crocodile first kills one of its own, then gets the taste of the human and becomes a rapidly growing terror after escape. None of the characters has any depth, but then they are not a focal point. We got only a few short glances on the huge two-headed descendant of dinosaurs and some of the best "kill" scenes in a small budget movie. leg for the leg and I'm a crocodile myself. Nothing remained at the dock, but at the top of the foot. Without real roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Veitz and Charles Napier. Most of the pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and a disgusting professional crocodile hunter Costas Mandilor. I was most impressed by the tempting Joanna Pacula, because the Honored Doctor P. DINOCROC reaps as a cucumber cucumber.
