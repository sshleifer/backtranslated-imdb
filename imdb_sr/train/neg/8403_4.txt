I gave this four purely beyond its historical context. It was considered to have been lost for many years until it appeared on the beach in the early nineties. Spade Coolei has several numbers. I suppose it had something to do with work at the ranch. I'm not quite sure, because the plot was so minimal that nothing really remembers me. I vaguely remember that it was a Western music comedy. Even Stooge seems to be going through moves. All in all, there is not much to be recommended here. If you are not a Stooge fan then do not bother. If you are a fan of Stooge, then hold short trousers.
