... then you better not watch this movie. They completely destroyed the premise of the show. In Duke's movie, they're idiots, Daisy's a tramp, Roscoe is malicious, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... Only Cooter and Flash are loyal to original characters. At least Enos is somehow close. At one point they open the door to enter General Lee - said Nuff. , but it was fun and the characters made sense. This movie is like Dumb & Dumber introduces Simple Life.
