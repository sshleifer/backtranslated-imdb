After I saw credits with only one name I recognized and who was a preacher in this film (Russ Convai), I did not expect much from this film and I was not disappointed. A man plans to kill his new wife persuading other people to be crazy and to take her life away. It is unknown to a man that the plastic skull he uses, on the contrary, the spirit of a woman, apparently his first dead woman, revenge his mind and uses the right skull. A simple plot with a twist of irony at the end. If you are tired late one night and when you need a dream, it will help you sleep in that sleep.
