This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This film has nothing positive about it. Some of you actually love this movie! I've seen a lot of movies about Dracula and I liked everyone I saw, but when I saw this movie, I told myself, "What is this, damn it?" What a stupid movie. Now Dracula becomes the one who is, because it is Judah. For those of you who do not know who Judas betrayed, Jesus Christ, and then he felt so guilty of hanging himself. You must be joking. That's the dumbest reason I've made Dracula evil. Who asked for a reason? What a piece of sh ** movie. Whoever has ever come to this sad pronunciation for a movie should win. Even Dracula is terrible. If you've ever seen this movie, you would not even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Was that name supposed to impress me? Do not waste your time and money on this garbage.
