I'm a B movie lover, give me a genetically mutated bat and I'm in the sky. These movies are good for stopping thinking about everything that's happening in your world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing. Then he was Hammerhead, who was so horrible that I had to apply to IMDb so I could warn others. The first was the science of creating a man-shark, to which the movie barely touched. In order to make the viewers interested, they only made sure that they had blood every few minutes. During an attack scene, the camera went off the attack, but you saw what was obviously a pot of blood thrown by a stage worker to let you know that the attack was bloody and that the person was probably dead (what incredible special effects). Returning to the science, I thought it was very interesting that female respondents were kept up and that the testing equipment required to be tracked through the breast tissue. In any case, this film had bad work on the land, a terrible story, and I'm sorry to say that I did a bad act. Not even Villiam Forsithe, neither Hunter Tilo nor Jeffrei Combs could save this stinker.
