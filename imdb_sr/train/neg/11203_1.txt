The screenplay was badly trying to recreate the "Exorcist". But put in a blah blah a love story that makes you sick, not keep you up together. There is no substance in this film. She had the potential to be something special but fell him down by showing a crowd of people to take care of things that nobody cares. Extremely boring, I wanted to leave the theater when I saw it, but the stupid tickets for the movie were expensive and I had to withstand the gloomy a torture that seemed to last forever. Nothing on the screen related relevance to what the characters said. They use computer graphics here which, instead of being interested (as I intended, I hate CGI), only destroyed the film even more. Some people say that this movie was terrible in cinemas because it is "thought-provoking" and "slow-paced-no-action-because it's an intelligent movie" that's so intelligent or provoking thoughts when the story is basically about the beautiful boy H Is Ledger a priest who has a love interest and does not respect his religion? It looks like an unspoken concept. Oh, and there's a mumbo jumbo about the "sinner" (the movie was originally called "sinner"). The Lame Concept, but the film got the idea of ​​a "sinner" too seriously, so the film became pathetic and deceived as it was dark and intelligent. Yes, I know that in the Middle Ages there really were sinners, but this film only seems to sound messy. Nothing in the movie has been done well and I forget why I even tried to look at this movie. If you want horror movies that actually have depth, watch Rosemary's Babi, The Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen, or any of the Romero Dead Trilogy movies. Stupid dialogue does not equate with intelligent people, and fans of the mainstream film think it's the same type of people who think it's a funny movie like Hulk's movie masterpiece. If you want um-numbingli boring horror, watch the Order. This film makes the church like a slide ride.
