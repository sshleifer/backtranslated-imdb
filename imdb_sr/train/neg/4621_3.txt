Since I was looking for this film high and low, I actually found it when I least expected it, I played on the Sundance channel very early in the day. Why did I endlessly search for a little project of vanity that Chuck Barris made over the last years of a TV show, I have no idea. The movie is simply terrible. A scripted portion that relates to a week. Of course, the highlight of the movie is to see the right performers who were "too hot for TV" or discarded for some reason. That part is still horrible, but bad, which was pleasant in its own way. Now that I've seen what I've been looking for so long, will I see it again in my life? Resoundingli NO !! Do yourself a favor and just watch MUCH much better "Confess the dangerous mind" or find the old copies of the actual performance. The girl is behaving where the leafy popsick was provocatively fun, but if I have to endure to see how Jai P. Morgon flashed, the audience probably made me sterile. Looking back, I am very happy that this was a huge failure, because it was a massive hit, it could have been "The $ 1.98 Beauti Shov Movie" and that my friends would surely bring the Apocalypse. > <br /> My grade: D
