OK, so I'm an original fan of Vicker Man and I do not usually like British American-made films, so why did I put myself through the most painful film experiences ever? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and maybe I had a moment of insanity? The movie was horrible! A little at first with a fall / fire was not at all relevant to the film, and the female police officer knew where Edward was going, so in the end, when the two girls visited the mainland, it would not have happened as the whole thing would be explored. The history behind a knitted man has not really been explored-and I presume that it was set up in America did not help the entire pagan subject. This film was slow and did not contain the atmosphere or uncertainty. I must say that the best part was at the very end, when Nicolas Cage was on fire! I am in a desperate need to see the original again, in order to cleanse my disappointed soul. I really can not say how disappointing this movie is, please do not see it if: A) Do not like American re-British movies B) Are the fans of the original C) I hate Nicolas Cage
