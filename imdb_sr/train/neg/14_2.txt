There are cases when the movie ends, it wants to get a refund for the time it's spent. This was one of those times. I almost gave up in just 15 minutes to withstand ... and I want to have ... The pace that a man goes from a flat, controlled life to one of the complete homeless and irresponsible could never be so fast. From the Graduation Celebration to the Predictable End Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) a man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, by violence and by changing the mind of the substance. Of course, the female part is understandable when watching the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kellei). But for a pound for a pound aspect of drugs, violence and commitment to the person he just met, it's impossible to understand. Honestly, apart from being able to watch Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keene, this film has no redeeming quality. Save money, save time ... do anything else ...
