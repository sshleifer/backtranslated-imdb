Just imagine, it cost a total of $ 250,000 to make "officers". How the hell did they spend $ 45 million to make this magnificent music spot? A practically unknown actor, two or three sets, with no special effects that I could see ... I know, he must have been spent on that professionally designed, economical, tense scenario. Shoot, that bar had to cost bundles. Anyway, I guess Jerry Bruckheimer would not be caught dead by producing something for less. I'm just surprised that he did not blow anything up. In any case, it was not a horrible movie. Women's tracks had some good chemistry, and the soundtrack was fine. IMO It's just a shame that this central project could have been made for $ 5 million without any loss of production, and there could be 6 more Indian movies worth five million dollars.
