I can not see why the authors made this film. The film from 1972 with McKueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McKueen was an extraordinary actor, and Baldwin is just an inadequate actor. There is no passion in his play. And the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It's almost bored though filming in 1972 was harder than in 1994. I do not understand the way Baldwin was detained from Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story. So I think there was no need to process, or if they decided to process the classic, they must choose a great actor for the first role as Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
