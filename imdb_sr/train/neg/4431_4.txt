This agonizing comedy-drama has received surprisingly great reviews since its release in 1979. I remember opening the LA Times movie section and looking at the 2-page advertisement for the "second chapter" filled with great inscriptions like "Better than Goodbie Girl!" and "Neil Simon does it again!" What does Neil Simon do? He takes the autobiographical situation (he is too soon after the death of his beloved wife) and makes it rusty, unpleasant and, worst of all, unfortunate. James Caan plays Neil - er, that is, George - a writer who can not return to life after losing his wife; Enter the witty Marsha Mason (real Mrs. Simon ... soon will be former Mrs. Simon) who tries to love George despite his mood and general melancholy. Mason is very attractive here and maybe he saved the day that Caan's indifference is not (not to mention the sub-plan of the pain-thin, blonde Valerie Harper, which leads to the process of stalling). I loved Mason's fall in the end ("I'm beautiful! I am NUTS about myself!"), But I did not see a happy ending for these two people ... and time proved to me that I was right. ** from the ****
