There is a big difference between publishing an original, intense, pink, frightening, up-fest, and actions like movie director Eli Roth and his team did with "Cab Fever" and simply acted like that. The film follows five college graduates in a cabin in a forest that begins to appear fatal, while one after another is subject to this mysterious, fast-paced, carnivorous disease. Friends do not turn one after the other, and hardly can look at each other, and even less want to be in the same vicinity as they are. No matter how rough it sounds, there is a certain spark that stands behind the basic premise of this film that could work in the hands of smaller flirtatious filmmakers. Unfortunately, what we have done is badly drawn characters whose only purpose at first glance looks nice to make the inevitable decomposition a more contrasting, hacked script so packed that it leaves the viewer to equalize the dialogue, and a few incomprehensible backgrounds that motivate little more than (in one case) on the screen of director Roth. This is a messy movie in several ways! Avoid this time the pursuer.
