This movie was sometimes fun, sometimes it was even fun. The basic message I received from the film is that women are responsible for all male troubles. Every time a woman is shown in a movie, she is a lazy person, because she is crazy or lambastic by some poor type without obvious reason. I think this message is not good for women or gay men. But it's a comedy and an artwork, so it's just someone's point of view. Even if I do not agree with that, they still have the right to do so. Funny movie, but some of the comments that others made are simply stupid. Best movie ever my foot.
