So there is an old guard and a dying man, and there is KEVIN, the world's greatest woman. Kevin wants to impress her incredibly senseless, brotherly and girlfriend AMI. How she gets back from work to ... a random house ... she finds her "friends", sexually confusing KILE and a truly rebellious DAPHNE. Soon they are joined by Daphne's boyfriend, the macho crazy NIK, the sexual madman. And there are also creatures from the title, terrible little dolls that kill people by giving them a desire for the heart. The desire of Kyle's heart is to mate with a creepy, funny woman in the spandex. The desire of Nick's heart is to drop bombs into a primary school cafeteria ... I mean a nightclub. The desire of Kevin's heart is to beat a thin robber with nuns. The desire of Amino's heart is to be a disgusting slut. Daphne is already a disgusting slut, so there is no desire of the heart. By the way, a really disgusting band sings a really strange song. The hobgoblins are randomly returning where they came from and then exploding. "Citizen Kane" can not keep a candle on this real masterpiece of American film.
