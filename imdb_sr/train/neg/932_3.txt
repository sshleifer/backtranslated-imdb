I watched this movie and hoped everything would be better. What's so great about a guy with no emotions? * iavn * You never see Alek showing emotions for anyone except his son. Yes, I know that's why his son is the only one who told him to lose his nerve (if you can call it that way), I understand. Characters are undeveloped, connections are not enough time to be understood. In one scene, Sara says she will not fall in love, and the next time we see her, she talks about how her death really shook her because they were so close? Logical synapses are abundant with this film. It's as if someone was watching Boogie Nights and wrote this section to mimic Little Bill. Even a scene in which "loses nerves" is the same as when Little Bill killed his wife, all the way to the face (or lack). Yes, Villiam H. Macchi is good at showing a man without emotions - he was there, did it - can you tell Magnolia? , developed characters and plot. And I certainly do not have my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
