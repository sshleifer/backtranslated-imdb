The worst movie ever made !!! Please take a look at Real Movie Critics from the professionals on this movie. Comments made on this site are obvious from people with some financial interest in this movie. I find the positive comments very wrong. I think it's amazing how negative comments are so bad about this movie, and positive comments sound like the Akademie's speech. Do not lose your hard earned money !!!!!! This film is retarded !! I can not believe that such a movie will ever be made. Why would Hollivood spend his time on that? This film is an attempt at nothing. I wonder who the loser actually would have sunk his money by producing such rubbish. I went to the hit, and the officer even told us not to waste time and money. I did not listen and spend my time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It's really "the worst movie ever made!"
