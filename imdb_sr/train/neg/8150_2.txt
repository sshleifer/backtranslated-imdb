If you want an undesirable and reasonably interesting watch or not, then it's okay to watch this. It's not that bad, really. Yes, there are more loopholes in the logic than I would like to describe here and I could tax the patience of people - as I myself, I must admit - who are prone to throw things on TV occasionally, but that's funny at the very least. Just because it's not always intentional funny, there's no need to allow it. However, if you read the book - or any other Brookmire book - then you would probably best avoid it. I read them all and when I first watched this movie, I despised it. I have elaborated it in detail and, in fact, to a large extent on another site. The TV shop has virtually no relevance to the book and only serves to outwit and slaughter many faithful (and even angry) Brookmire fans. Best advice ..? Look at this, then read the book and just DO THINK the comparisons and submit your assessment.
