How good is Gvineth Paltrow! This is a real movie for her ... It's a shame that's a full-fledged role. I did not read Jane Austen's book, but I can not believe it's so superficial and characters are not much more than caricatures. Probably it was not easy to cut up to 600 hours of book in 2 hours of play, but I expected more than watching old pieces of furniture and tea glasses. I took relief every time I saw an actor who did not exceed the sign of exaggeration (several times).
