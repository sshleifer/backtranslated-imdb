Greenthumb Grace remains free of money after the death of her husbands, so she turns around raising her bucks to pay bills. Sounds promising and always reliable Brenda Blethin does not disappoint, but the material is sitcom. There is actually a scene in which Grace asks his young gardener to give me "Give One" (Tokens) and he thinks he's looking for sex and seems unpleasant. Yes, that's humor, so it would be boring nuns. It seems that saving Grace does not know what he wants to be: a stunning cinema and a magnificent rhythm provoke memories of Ryan's daughter, while the ease of decency of the local inhabitants could be lifted from any episode of antiquity. It accelerates after the first hour, but by then it's too clich√© to take care. The peak manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameful Deuk ek Machin I've ever seen.
