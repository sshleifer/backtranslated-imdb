Occasionally a new entre from foreign films is served. It's their great attraction. They take life and serve it raw. American films rarely dare to touch banned subjects of society. Too much interruption and morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty Dollars, determines their choice. Something that calls on European directors. In addition, audiences around the world remain hungry for "different" films, especially those who offer a tasty bite from the poor, dreadful body of mankind. Despite the fears of directors or producers, many audiences are craving for beauty, poetry and intact taste of life. That's what the movie "Lion's Father" offers to the curious audience. The family maintained their belief that the unity of the family stems from the unity of obedience to tradition. Yet, when the patriarch of the family forgets that his members are men and humans, filled with angry, unbridled dreams, and dark passions, then these two are created against themselves. Selton Mello plays Andrea's son trying to control his inner passions with his father's stagnating philosophy. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Anne's young woman who is trying to extinguish prohibited thirst from family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the older brother. The film offers many, but it takes an extremely unusual time to say it. ***
