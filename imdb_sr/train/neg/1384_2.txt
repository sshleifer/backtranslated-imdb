Jet Li is one of the best fighters in the world. He's been over 20 years old and puts others in a genre of shame. Although large in Asia, he is almost unknown in the United States. Black mask should be a movie for him, but it does not work horribly. First, it's synchronized. Although it may have the value of the camp (dubbing is not near and has a flat tone), it seems unsuitable for a regular movie viewer. Second, the director in this film, Daniel Lee, is doing a terrible job. He cuts the scene so fast, sometimes, you do not know what's going on. In other cases, the camera shakes and shakes. The fans see Jet Li movies for fantastic martial arts. However, the director arranges the scenes so quickly that you do not even know who is half the time! In other cases, the scene is left hanging (ie Li begins to cut the hole in the jeep floor, while the thieves hold the weapon, two seconds later, and Li and the love of love are already under the car!) Other scenes are so incredible that they cross over Points that are totally funny (killer CDs? Just give it a star throw !!!!). Liu needs a director who is less inclined to cutting machine guns, and more to create a cinematic mass scene. Added rap / techno music goes from right to intrusive. The action has the capabilities, but all the cartoon characters have subtracted cartoons that subtract every credibility this film strives for. And do we really think that the love interest will not recognize Simon, because he has a half-heart? Would not that give her hair, lower jaw or voice? If you want to see the movie Jet Li, try with Iron Monkey or his classic Shaolin temple. This messy mess is a complete loss of time ..... 2/10
