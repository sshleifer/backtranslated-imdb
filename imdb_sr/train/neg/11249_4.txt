Visually stunning? Most likely. I've seen several movies that look so good. Ski Captain and Vorld of Tomorre use impressive cinema, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically known, but something completely new. It seems to be the period of the 1930s or early 40's. The film talks about recent attacks on New York City mechanized armies of theft generators and the like for some inexplicable reason. Also, the mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide. Who can stop them and save the world? Okay, that does not mean that the captain of the sky with his wise journalist girl is always handsome for guidance, and in his wings he is a reliable, fundamentally competent assistant. What the Ski Captain has in the atmosphere and graphics is missing in telling stories and characterization. The action for this movie is ridiculous. In this regard, the film is going to be a serial-like film series of the past years. They had fairly distant stories and bad acting - but none of them, and I think none of them, had the budget and the big names that this film had. Two academic singers and Jude Leo could hold a film on the surface, some thought, but the Ski Captain was sinking poorly. Despite its fantastic dark look, I found myself wanting the film to end and that I could continue with my life. I had a little interest in the story that caused little interest. I did not even care about one of the portraits of the portrait. Paltrow was terrible. Jolie was a joke with virtually no content. The law can not bear the tradition of a liner that is too visible on its limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, he's not Vill Smith, Mel Gibson, or even Vesely Snipes. The sad thing about the captain of the sky, at least for me, was that she had kept so many promises that she was still delivered so little. I was bored for ten minutes in the film - I waited for something interested me - and never came.
