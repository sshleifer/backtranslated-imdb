Please, even if you are in the worst mood, refrain from watching this movie. I do not think anything was ok with this movie. At the recommendation of my friends I watched this and literally I washed 1h and 48m of my life in the closet. Bad acting, stupid direction, bad story, and pathetic action sequences - and when combined, you get "Double Impact". Even the least expectations are not met. I guess I've learned one thing - never watch Van Damme action. They are pure wasting time!
