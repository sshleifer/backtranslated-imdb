it turned out to be another unsuccessful attempt at a funny science-fiction channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script, and interpreted the song, but I'm sure it was a 17-year-old teenager who thought it would be great to get a crossbow in the movie. AAAAAAAH! when I saw that part, I lost all hope. Then ... they went to the hero in what looks like a ship that sailed Christopher Columbus! when they reached Heorotta, (which was supposed to be a Nordic hall for honeymooners), the scientific group of idiots decided that the arrogant looked like a large stone castle. when I saw that part ... I wanted to scream. I really wanted this film to be good, but science fiction has not yet produced a good movie, so I do not know why I was hoping. Oh, and Grendel and his mother are also stupid. (this comment is out of the question about "Grendel") If anyone from the sci-fi channel reads this ... there's some good advice. NOT A FILM WHICH YOU ARE PRESERVED ON A GREAT MONSTER WHO CAN HELP PEOPLE IN HALF, WHICH FISCILLY IS NOT A SCIENTIST! AND ALSO, STOP THE HEALTHY ACTORS AS STEPHEN BALDWIN TO BE IN YOUR FILMS! THIS DOES NOT SUPPORT THE FILM, OR AVOIDING THE WORK !!!
