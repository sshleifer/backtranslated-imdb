Yes, unfortunately, I encountered a DVD and found it to be incredibly terrible. First of all, the characters are shit. I mean, come on, if there's a jerk in an orange hat who calls himself 'Orange Sherbert' the best creative idea, these guys could get to the character, then definitely should not be on the movie scene. Poor "costumes", bad "interviews", and basically there is no "wrestler" on this whole disc with any charisma. "Wrestling" in Splatter Rampage Vrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and gigantically refusing to trampoline. They will make sure that they gamble together all the time, making the experience more like a child's play than a "fighting mortal fight". Basically, the Splatter Rampage Vrestling is a pretty vague clone of Backdard Vrestling. Only, instead of blood, weapons, criminals, and RESTLING, we get a trampoline, giggling kids, FROM SOUND, and a guy called Orange Sherbert. Fight or not, avoid this DVD. That's terrible.
