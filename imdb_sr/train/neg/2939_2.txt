As others have said, "No, Luciano" is a more appropriate title or response to the title of the movie. For fun, a big opera singer should be singing ... not that he's a horrible actor. Only this film smells. The first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family movie, but - after that it is nothing but boring soap opera. Pavarotti, like "Giorgio Fini," loses his voice several times, and Dr. Pamela Tailor (Kathrin Harrold) comes to rescue. The singer then falls on the doctor, the doctor slowly falls for the singer, the two of them constantly quarrel and continue and continue. Pavarotti has a winning smile and a nice type. Harrold breaks things up and after watching her here, it's no wonder that she has not become a star. In the film is a nice sight to enjoy, good shots of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the movie. I was bored and I do not remember much about the other half.
