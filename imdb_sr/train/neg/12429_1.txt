Recollecting the dirty details of this subtle "movie" is like digging into your chest cavity with a rusty, salty spoon. Maybe "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was a bit on the predictable side, but this pathetic excuse for the movie is just one of the most shameful offerings for commercialization I've ever heard. A boy who is fighting a spy / terrorist when he is alone in a house in the Chicago suburb with the goddesses? Funny! Why should this film be made? I am a person who believes that even horrible films are not waste of time, but learning experience. However, this is actually a waste of time. It should be avoided at all costs.
