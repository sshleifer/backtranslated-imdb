Luise Rainer won an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role was not necessary. She did not speak much and looked pale during the entire film. Louise's character was a slave who then married the character of Paul Munian (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but they were very convincing in their roles. I hope Paul Muni gets an Oscar for his performance, because Luise certainly got her Oscar. It must have been a revolutionary actress, one of the first methods. This looks like something Hollywood often does. Al Pacino played Italian and Cuban. I felt that Luise's performance throughout the whole period was not silly, and when she died she did not change in the expression from previous scenes. It remained the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I guess I did not see her.
