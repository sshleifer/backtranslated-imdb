Would not it be great if you would not put another movie for a movie on all these stupid, meaningless, i get more sex than you are teen movies? In the perfect world, yes. Still, this is worse. This is not humiliating for the stars, it's humiliating for the distributor. All jokes are basically students who expose things that people probably do not care about, but that's "funny". Devon Sava, who was actually good at the final destination, is simply boring in this film. That's why you are wondering if it's intentionally bad. Grade: F
