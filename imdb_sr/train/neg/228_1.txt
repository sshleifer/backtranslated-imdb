I thought the film was in New York: wrong! It's a little British rural setting. I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama .... Well, to the last third, because after the story it becomes completely "abracadabranteskue", a symbolic word for the French presidential mandate. So, even when it comes to nonsense, motives would like to bring a sincere feeling. What's left for me? Perhaps, a good duo of an actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redheaded cop is a little invisible to me. The high doctor surprises her stroke, and McDovell delivers fine acting as usual, all in a delicate, gentle and almost dumb attitude. This softness confuses me, because as other visual artists or directors, the same pattern is repeated over and over again. In her case, it is like, regardless of the film, the same character is always defined by her feelings, her values, which live infinitely different stories. I still do not know how to set the boundary between the artist and the work. Another positive side of this film is the female touch and interesting different points of view. Women have their own way of life, even if they are all. It brings a lot of tolerance and learns to testify that the same and unique reality can be seen in many ways as humans. Finally, the film is quite visible, but the great finale reduces the desire for the next vision.
