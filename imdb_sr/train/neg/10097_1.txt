I stopped beside BB and picked up 4 zombie shifts to watch over the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects will be raw, the acting will be sub-pair, and the sets will be suspicious. So I do not expect much. But it should at least have a story. The stories cost nothing but time ... apparently, they did not even have time. "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that everyone looked like were whores of new waves. Zombie picture on the front of the page NEVER appears in the movie. It was absolutely hard to watch and had nothing to offer a genre. The drive duration was only 81 minutes, but it was 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the film because she was on a computer in another room), it sounded like zombie pornography .... what if you think about it, it sounds kinda gross ... but it was not even that Okay. The only thing I can say is that the writer might have tried to do too many things and ended up with an unbearable confusion. Free rental, and I still feel like I'm stuck. I rated it with 1 out of 10 because IMDb does not allow me to use decimals.
