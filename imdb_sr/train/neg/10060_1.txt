The author sets the "path of discovery" of his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry, as he thinks that (the film was completely and deservedly forgotten) "The Bright Leaf" about his ancestry. No, and he does not actually reveal any of the slightest interest in this absolutely stupid and self-reliant glorified home movie, suitable for showing at (singing) family gatherings, but certainly not for a commercial or even non-commercial release. A good reminder is why most independent films are not picked up by large studios - because they are boring, irrelevant, and do not care for anyone other than the director and his immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!
