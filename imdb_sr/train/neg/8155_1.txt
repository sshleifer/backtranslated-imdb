I actually love Robin Villiams in his more serious roles (eg Good Vill Hunting, Fisher King, Warp po Garp). These are my favorite films by Robin Villiams. But Seize the Dai, although he was acting well, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Villiams movie (worse than Death to Smoochi, Club Paradise and Alladin on the ice). Every good story will have its ups and downs. This film, however, is a giant. I do not need a good Hollywood cheese, but I have to have something different than 90 minutes of complete and complete hopelessness. This film reminds me of "Love Lisa" (which is actually worse), because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall. The answer? Who cares.
