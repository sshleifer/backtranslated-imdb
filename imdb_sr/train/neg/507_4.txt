Unlike my fellow reviewers, I'm always trying to find something that can be used in any movie I see. Something must be lost in the translation of the word "Krvavica" from the Italian in the title; almost as if the producers originally wanted to record a Gothic story of a vampire, and then changed their minds, but they could not afford to give up their dramatic introductory series, and they still put it on the movie. This film was made in 1975, recently released on DVD and comes with its theater trailer, which in some aspects is more daring than it can be seen in the movie, and now everyone who buys this movie anyway already read his synopsis and knows what he can expect in the mid-1970s I bought him because I was attracted to Christa Nellie (most often referred to as "Christ Nell"). The absence of actors that I frustrated most of all of these Euroslease films from the 1960s and '70s. he hoped that Imdb would show the role of characters while someone heard their names in the film, but without a list of actors, it is very difficult to link them to the actor in question. I think Krista Nell was playing "Cora", but under this massive hairstyle, costume and make-up it's hard to make sure it's different. Most of them are shown two-dimensional portraits of actors of their parts and no one stands out. Maybe something is lost in the dubbing process. music was atmospheric and, of course, if you are in a beautiful lesbian pornography there. The external sites that were used were good and I wanted to know where they made a castle on his island. North or Republic?) In 1902, so that everyone sports athletes in costumes. Some of the scenes that I found unintentionally funny, especially those scenes of sex!
