This film consumes almost every talent of every actor in what is best known as "potboiler". Follow each other until you try to quench the popcorn. In this film there are so many dead stories that I guess at one point that they were made by merging rejected TV series. Kuynin's Mexican role in drugs is ridiculous, and his associates pulled out immediately from the 1970s Kuinn Martina show. Costner's figure is wooden and gives us no reason to believe that he fell in love with Mendez's wife. Nor did we convincingly state that we believe that a woman is curious about society and that she will jump to the first hot body. Definitely a 'B' movie at best and a great loss of time for everyone involved.
