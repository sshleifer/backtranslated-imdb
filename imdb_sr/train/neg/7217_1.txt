I just watched this DVD at home. We love Westerne, so my husband rented it. I started apologizing halfway. Saddles, costumes, accents - everything was turned off. A part that made me so angry when the guy did not shoot a "collector" with his bow and shot while he was taking the fat guy's body. His only excuse was "he only had two lightning rods." We watched him all the way to the end, and, as someone else said ... too many bad things that would separate one of the reasons why it was sucked. I mean, the fact that the boy accidentally grabbed an evil stone from the collectors of the same month and the day he was found, what is the purpose of that? And why was there a grave courtyard where everyone died on April 25, but people whose souls were taken away by the collector were still walking? If you want the movie to mock after a few beers, this can be your movie. However, if you want the real West, you hate this movie.
