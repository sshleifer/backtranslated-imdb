This little show is obviously a little stupidly bumped / spin off the original series. Compared to the live series, this show is the ultimate crap. The live broadcast had intelligent jokes and stories. While the animated series is essentially a tinted shade for younger viewers, but I think kids can give up this shit. He uses magic to fix it. This is the basic idea of ​​each episode. The most striking episode was when Sabrina used magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. Then the Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes Harvey to become her slave. This then leads to a bizarre, but rather interesting scene that Gem says: "Just worship me for now," and Harvei descends on his hands and knees and begins to kiss his feet as a god. (which is perfectly fine because it is her slave to control the mind) But this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or effort.
