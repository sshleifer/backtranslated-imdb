Dr. K (David Hickei) was trying to master a formula that would end all illnesses and disabilities, but living donors needed to complete their job. His brother Richard (Dennis O'Neill) has a son named Eddie (Derek Philips) who was admitted to a medical school. Eddie has a girl named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas) who is too lazy and plans to attend the school in autumn. She and Eddie continue their relationship when Sarah cancels things with her current boyfriend who is also dragging and Ms. Walt (Bill Sebastian; Eddie's best friend who recently paid the job of sucking his girlfriend). Eddie accidentally hits the car and appears on deadly deaths when Dr. K. suggests to Richard to "recover" Eddie using his secret, illegal methods. When Doctor K applies its serum to Eddie, there is a terrifying result. Eddie's face flashes massive nipples, and he also has a taste for human flesh. Many will die so that Eddie can feed this uncontrolled appetite that can not be extinguished. Soon may even pose a danger to your father and girlfriend. Eddie Monster must be stopped. . The premise, which looks like an interesting fest-fest, can not even deliver zombies. The blood is limited by several chewing gum, but most of the violence occurs outside the camera. Using time to talk can be really disturbing.
