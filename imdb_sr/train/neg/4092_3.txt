I love Fulci movies, I really do not work and in some boring ironic way, but I recognize that they are hopeless and incomprehensible to many people. Conquest is the place where Fulci tries to test his epic fantasy genre and fails. Structurally, it's like most Fully movies you've seen. Some things happen, more things happen and occasionally one scene can be tangentially connected to another. It's really like Conan without sets, no scripts, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is not an actor), no budget, stupid dog soldiers and a crowd upstairs. It was Difficult to pass and I could live without an inch of Vaseline smear on the camera to give it that video metal.
