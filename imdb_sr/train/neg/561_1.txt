Well, I saw this movie yesterday and that's - unfortunately - worse than you could think. First of all, the plot is idiotic, it does not make any sense. The scenario is full of deliberate entertaining dialogues. The audience laughed many times. And uncertainty is very low. The actors play it, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments, but also some very bad moments of acting. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like "I want you" and looks like, for example, a mild, very mature woman who behaves roughly and not at all sexy. This erotic tension from BI1 is completely gone. From the technical point of the Basic Instinct 2, the central film - better than the typical DVD, but at far lower leverage than the original movie. For example, the scene of crazy joy is bad. Director of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven, and he shows it. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his performances. The script is run by people who do not match Joe Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The movie looks cheap and sometimes badly edited. I'm sorry, but my first thought after leaving the theater was: "Why did not they make this movie before and with the original talents behind the success of the first movie?" All in all, the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first basic instinct was a classic and it was some sort of break in the popular cinema. It was challenging, sexy and controversial. He had Sharon Stone's best performance in his career. He had a specific style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately, the Basic Instinct 2 is an inadvertently funny movie, a poorly directed and secure Razzie winner in many categories. It's a shame that they shot this movie.
