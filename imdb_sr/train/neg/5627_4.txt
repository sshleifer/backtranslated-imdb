As I watch this movie, it's interesting to see how much it marginalizes black people. The film spends its time showing that the most powerful black man is impotent in him (except for the heroic moment). For most of the film, other black men (and dark black women) in the film are in the background, barely visible. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some pretty visible and three-dimensional signs of support that are light-skinned, and some white characters of some warmth and dignity. But 99% of Black Men in this movie are nothing but invisible men. No background, no consequences. Such a terrible flaw, but nothing but unusual in the mainstream media.
