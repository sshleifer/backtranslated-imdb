This movie is not terrible, really. Someone commented that Mo is a type of American Europeans who laugh. But there are those, and not necessarily the Anglo-Saxon jahos, who do not care for the French; and Xavier's character will not mourn them. Consider its stereotypical attributes of the French: 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check it out. 2). Reedy, inadequate look, check, despite: 3). Great respect for the kitchen. Check it out. 4). Strong working ethics. Check it out. (Forget about the fact that he is allegedly a rich stockbroker, looking at him in a movie that looks like it was put in for ten hours of work.) 5). Nice woman, check it out. Despite this: 6. Poor interpretation of marriage vows. Check it out. 7). A great sexual ego that says an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. Check. No matter whether Mo is a peasant or not, there is no reason for it to fall into this suicidal European TV, except what the script dictates. On the other hand, like other male reviewers, I enjoyed watching Karen Allen's sweet, tiny body. I'll give you a four-star movie; Two of them are for it.
