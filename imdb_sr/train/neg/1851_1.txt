"Friend", obviously without taste or class, I proposed to look at the work of Ron Atkins. If this is a representative of his opus, I never want to see anything else from him. It's an amateur, self-inflicted, criminal bad and self-indulgent rubbish. "Kurva mangler" in the title is angry low budget film that kills a bunch of whores. There is a little nudity and some erections, but no element could save this from the scourge of the executioners. Lighting is terrifying, the dialogue is childish and mostly shouted, and the direction is unclear. I saw a dock about American filmmakers during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of them. He was saying that there was something important in his work, but after that, I do not see anything special. There is no style, and terrible video effects (such as solarisation) only amplify amateur behavior. Not even so bad is not fun. Avoid.
