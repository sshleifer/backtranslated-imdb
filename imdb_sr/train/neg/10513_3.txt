This film was a pretty loss of an hour and a half of my time. Basically I love cheap movies about the horror monster, but this film was a disappointment. The main defect is the lack of an explanation of the creature. When they entered the house and found the man he could hire, he explained to them. He actually does not say anything about them except that his parents were killed, and unless I did not miss something, I did not say how he managed to escape or ... Not to mention the fact that he does not give any clue or reason why he only survives remains and essentially feeds creatures after their own experience of death. It would seem that she would have the opportunity to go after a "cross-incident".
