The words can not describe how bad this movie is. I can not explain it by writing. And you yourself realized that you would understand how horrible the movie really can be. Not that I recommend you. There are so many cliches, mistakes (and any other negative things you can imagine) that will only make you cry. To begin with the technical one, there are a lot of mistakes about aircraft. I'm not going to list them here, just to mention the color of the plane. They were not even able to show the plane in the colors of the fictitious airline, but instead used 747 painted in the original Boeing Fodder. Very bad. The action is stupid and made many times before, only much, much better. So many funny moments here that I lost the account from him very early. Also, I was on the side of bad guys all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. The "Executive Decision" would undoubtedly be your choice over this, even the Turbulence movie is better. In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this.
