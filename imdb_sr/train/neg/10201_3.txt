This is a typical thriller of "perfect crime". A perfect crime and an investigative officer were executed, ignoring all the traces, immediately knowing who was to blame. The audience must wait for the whole movie to get the culprits caught. The result is like any episode of "Columbo" or "The Murder That She Writed". The director himself calls for a story about hackers showing the policeman watching the Matlocka episode! This story barely completes 90 minutes, but the director insists on the use of all 120 minutes of filling each clich√© in a book. Skip this, you do not miss anything.
