Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are here at the top. They deserve an Oscar nomination for their performances. I am a big fan of TV shows. Their music walls and everything are so talented! I am also a great exponent of SARCASM !!!!! IF YOU A CLUB FAN DO NOT READ THIS !!!!!! The performances are terribly weak, the dialogue is awesome and the jokes are not even executed correctly (sorry, the director). Jokes are so incredibly bad that the 8 little, passionate fans of the S Club did not laugh. They thought I could do better. They are. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "fat, ugly who started the mosh band" must thank his lucky stars who left him when he did it. One of the worst movies ever recorded. BECOME THIS FILM! DO NOT IDE AND SEE! You will not laugh! VI will KRI! 0/10 RJT
