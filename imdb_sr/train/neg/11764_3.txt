I must say that I really enjoyed watching this film and finding a new life in it that would separate it from most boring and excessively made Mexican films. I have no idea why, but I believed in Seko, Pudor and Lagrimas to be the one that will give us the freshness and confidence of our non-existent industry. Maybe it was because the soundtrack (which I listened to before I saw the movie) sounded different from others, perhaps it was because she dared to include new faces (except Demian Bichir who is always favored by Mexican film directors) and allegedly dealt with his scenario with modern social behavior, perhaps because the photo I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical. It turned out that the film was a great audience satisfaction and a great disappointment. What Serrano is doing here is a very old-fashioned "battle of the sexes" as in "all men are the same" and "why all women ..."; blah blah blah. Nothing new in it, even that, uses so much common ground and cliches that it finally mocks without leaving any valuable reflection on the female / male state. Full of ordinary crowds on the audience, such as the confident jokes about the clich√©s I've been talking about before (they always work, always) and screaming shows (it's a good movie in their context) ... and I mean literally screaming. The original characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir showed themselves, according to Serrano, more pathetic. I completely disagree with Seran, it should not have been that they were simply treated as puppets for his lesson ... he made sure that we got his message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only firm ground in which this story could have been stand. After all, this is, after all, a very fun movie and you'll probably have a good time watching it (if you accept it manipulated).
