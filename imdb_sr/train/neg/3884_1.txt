Many months ago when I was seven, I vaguely remember that I saw a trailer for this movie. It attracted my naive feeling of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this film. As wise adult people, they told me, "Absolutely no! It's a bunch of garbage." Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first kid in my block to see the "Unbelievable melting man". It took a little time - maybe a couple of days. I forgot about "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment faded. It's been twenty-five years before it has again entered the original position of my thoughts. While searching the channels on a digital cable, I found this long lost relic film. My curiosity was excited and I decided to finally take part in this fruit that was forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. "Incredible Melting Man" is perhaps the worst film known to man. Films such as "Def-Con 4," "Metalstorm" and "Freddie Got Fingered" appear to be nominated for the Oscars. As someone persuaded the film company to produce this film out of me. Do not make the same mistake Like me. They were right.
