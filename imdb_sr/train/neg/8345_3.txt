This film could have been much better, especially with regard to talent. Larenze Tate's screenplay by Frankie Limon was not good, especially in music performances. He can not be synchronized well, and his scene manners are Larenz Tate, when it was supposed to be Frankie Limon. Showing women as a bunch of gold diggers is written all over the world. The forces they obviously pushed, but it just made the characters even more unrealistic. The positive results of this film were the portrait of Miguel Nunez on Little Richard and the very character of little Richard. Lela Rochon is, as usual, an eye of sweets, even in a conservative role. It is a pity that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivice A. Фока пропали. Frankie Limon's entire saga was fascinating in real life. It's a shame that this film collapsed.
