I generally love horror movies, but unfortunately this turned out to be one pound of cheap buckets in the hands of my friends. We wanted to watch it, ready to scare ourselves and end up sprinkling food wherever we laughed so much. The concept is not that bad, but why have they decided that the number ten in the series will be happy I do not know. The worst thing in the movie are the actors. The work with the cameras was bad, special effects are actually not bad if I am generous, but in general the story failed to connect at any level, because the actors were as effective as a small bunch of badly burnt elm. They were wooden out of the ordinary, especially a young, stupid actor who was fifteen years old too young to be seriously regarded as any government agent. He looked more like a public school boy. There was a really fun sexual scene in which he looked like he was bobbing for apples while a busty lady riding on him, and later his diapers were hysterical, but then I remembered that it was not supposed to be a comedy. I desperately lick the brain to find something positive to say about this film, except for the occasional flashy breasts, but it just does not exist. Let's hope the ten were a lucky number and they do not do another, I'm not sure that the ribs could handle me.
