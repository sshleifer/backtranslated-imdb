I think that's almost everything I need to say. I feel obliged to explain my actions. Basically, I have never seen such an armature production, and I mean all the meanings of the word. Although working on a physical camera, the work of the MIC and other technical aspects of this film, ridiculous, unfortunately, they are not the only areas. Unlike some classic independent films that have preserved their characterization and plot with their scripts, this unfortunately has a terrible script, horrible acting and, worst of all, terribly boring characters. The crime is what for any independent movie that is being distributed as a Haiku tunnel, there are still 101 indie movies that died in a silent death. I do not know who the Kornbluth brothers are in Sonia, but that may be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever received distribution. I'm pretty worried about having picked up this. The only part of the movie that contains any intrigue is its title. However, the reason for this is even lowering. I hope this review will save a few people who might be intrigued by the title of these films to watch it. I've seen a lot of movies in my time, and I'm very sorry when I was in the cinema, but this was too much. I will never forget the tunnel, because I have marked an important point in my life experience of the film. It's a shame that it's such a low point.
