No doubt one of the most shameful productions of the 1970s, GAOTS seems to really want to be something important. The tragic truth is that it's totally worthless at every level that it can not help but laugh. Having reached the desperation of the earthly elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, the city's day in the wild follows the day ... they walk along the shady path, as long as they are pontificate as U.C. Berkelei coffee. Almost every line of dialogue dialog that has been delivered here is nasty bad ("I feel that life itself is composed of as small sections as this rod ... but is it so beautiful?") After what looks like eternity absolutely nothing it happens (well ... OK ... we are treated with some nudity and lukewarm soft sex scene), there is finally a VERY anti-climatic conflict that includes a couple of veteran veterans who create nature and perform some pretty rough folk ballads with acoustic guitar. Nothing essential or interesting does happen IN THIS TOTAL FILM. I thought Larry Buchanan's painting "Stravberries Need Rain" was a bad example of Bergman's respect. "Golden apples" are equally bad, but the repeatedly random vote he represents makes him unforgettable. 1/10
