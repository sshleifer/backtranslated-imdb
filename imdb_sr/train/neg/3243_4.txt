By far the most important condition for any movie that follows the cheaters is that they must, at least occasionally, be able to pull us down, as well as their stupidity, cops, mafia and (ideally) each other. . But this film NEVER pulls this out. Each scam can be seen miles away (especially biggen!) Nor are they very interesting, complicated or sophisticated. Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this by quick dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The lines are fine, but they are delivered so stiff, unnatural, stylized that I thought that maybe some sort of smart thing about being all behaved all the time ... but not. As for the psychological complexity, the main character is somewhat suppressed and makes some funny forced Freudian wrinkles about her father thinking she is a whore, but she overcomes it. I really liked the street scene. He looked like a picture of Edward Hopper.
