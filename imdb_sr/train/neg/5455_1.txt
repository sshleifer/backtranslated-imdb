I saw this work at a California film festival. God, what did the director mean? Film professors should use this film as a case study on what they should NOT do when filming a short film. First, this project does not make any sense. The film happens partly in "The Vaistation", a stupid bar in the middle of nothing, where nothing really happens. So bad that I almost thought it was a comedy. The main actress Julia Reading is a step below acting in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including the boys played by Jacob and Fenner, but as if the director had no idea how to work or use his actors. The only thing worse than acting was a dialogue that bordered with an absurdity. The writer (which I assume is also the director) writes every character as if he was auditioning for a comedian bad guy. It's easy to overlook. The production design is pretty good, although Vaistation looks like a regular bar. Costumes and makeup are fine, and I understand that the production worked with a low budget. Only when characters speak, or try to push the action forward, the film is cracked in a bunch of shit. As I said, this movie is horrible. It's as if the director / writer watched many sci-fi movies and threw all the parts he liked in the mixer and came up with this. My only hope is that he used someone else's money for this, because if he used his own, he's a total wardrobe.
