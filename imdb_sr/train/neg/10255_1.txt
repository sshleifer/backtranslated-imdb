He has Christopher Lee, has huge computer banks from the 1970s that make noise as the letters appear on the screen, have radioactive isotopes that not only shine in the dark, but emit pulsating noise, have volcanoes! evil aliens dressed up in a nun! tide waves! earthquakes! ekploding cars! explosive coffee machines! and as the climax of the entire planet explodes. How, for God's sake, this movie has managed to be so incredible, um-numbingly DULL? The answer, my friend, because 90% of this film consists of recording, most of them include long tapes, tweaks or zooming in combinations, or occasionally all three, which do nothing but the crews give something to do. There are endless footage of our protagonists who ride, get in and out of the car, drive again, walk around and watch things, get in the cars and drive ... I just sat and watched the endless parade niggling in mocking stunning "Say something, please Neko , just say something ... Do something ... anything ... ... "Dialogue, when it comes, is horrible. "Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale from ours." It was a typically meaningless line. The scenario culminates in the destruction of the world with recorded footage justified in this speech by Lee as the alien alien: "Planet Earth has transmitted an excessive amount of disease, they pollute the universe. All the planets of the light years away from here will suffer if not destroyed! "This is the writing of the Neandertal SF scenario. This is the type of motivation you found in 1950's Japanese clothing that is designed for children of 7 years. That's, and I'm collecting such things, the worst of the English SF movies since Buster Crabbe retreated. He does not believe this film was published the same year as Star Wars and the Close Encounters. Lee, who always hit me as a smart, helpful actor with a secure knowledge of his limits, delivers his lines as if he were going to kill his agent to bring him into this bunch of shit. I do not blame him.
