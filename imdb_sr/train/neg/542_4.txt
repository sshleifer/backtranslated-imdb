First of all there is the Gujarati Theater, and there is also Bollivood. Both have their own strengths and fans. The director Vipul Shah should look somewhere else instead of the Gujarat Theater when he produces Bollywood production. First he made Aanken (adapted from Gujarat drama) - who had a unique story, but could not stand it as a Hindu movie. Now he has adapted another Gujarat game and called the Vakt - the race against time. All in all, emotions are alien. The event is not for Hindi films. For example, playing roles between father and son is best left to the Gujarati Theater - do not bring it into a Hindi film. Even the comedy is best left for Gujarati. All the performances are average - nothing about it - about how Šefali Čaja Šah is outstanding.
