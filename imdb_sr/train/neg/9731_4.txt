Others have already commented on the "fall" of director Tobe Hooper, but what about Brad Douriff? He was perfectly capable of choosing good projects (as he proven acting in the same year "Ecorcist III"), so why did he agree to appear in this? Of course, he gives a fairly crazy play, and the movie is not so bad; It's just uninterested, uninteresting, and unattractive. These are three "no-" too many. (* 1/2)
