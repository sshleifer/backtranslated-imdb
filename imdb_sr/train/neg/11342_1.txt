I should explain why I gave this ... "piece of art" with 1 star of possible 10. Simply because it is difficult or almost impossible to assess impartiality. it would probably be the same if I gave it 10/10 - explanations would follow anyway. I do not like these senseless up films like HOSTEL or so - I think it's disgusting and pretty terrible (in all possible contextual meanings), but as I learned after watching this movie - there is a genre that is called a "historical drama" - and probably it would be the case of the 10/10 because there are plenty of that and Tarantino would be more than happy with it (and did Kill Bill 3 to spill more blood on the screen than here to show it to be possible). but the thing in the genre of "historical drama" is that it is a sub-category of "garbage films" where John Romero is an imperfect g-imperator-of-gut and can not automatically be judged as the default film - because these are films that are deliberately made bad and you can not really tell if the comic bad moment should be like that, or it's just bad. It's for people who like to enjoy a bad act, a bad scenario and a bad thing. And in a way - and I'm one of them. there are days when I need to see a really bad movie and look for some garbage and here it is - the day is saved! but this is definitely my opinion and does not coincide with anyone else. What I wanted to say is that if you want to watch some horrible movie - then Fellini Casanova is definitely a choice, but pay attention to my advice and do not rate it by default.
