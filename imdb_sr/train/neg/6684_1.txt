This should be repeated under the title "An unusual case of unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented the non-horror Snorer as a shock movie". It's a long, boring story of fraternity, whose joke is so transparent that Flounder from the Delta House can see through it. Jeff East, an actor in the debt payment phase, can be forgiven for taking any kind of job he could get. The same can not be said of Charles Martin Smith, who previously worked for such heavyweight heavyweights as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on the tape, but, fortunately, not on DVD. The stored garbage belongs to the landfill and nowhere else.
