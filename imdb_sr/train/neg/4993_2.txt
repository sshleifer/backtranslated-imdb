I went to watch this film, expecting 'nothing really a lot' of the film's action, it's still very disappointing. The introductory scene promised a small action with the primacy of comedy. He keeps you in the first half until then, expecting that the time for action will now come. Well, none of this is happening. The film pulls and ends you only to the point of annoyance. You wonder what the director was thinking. It did not make sense. The film was missing in all aspects, it did not have a real story and it looked very hollow, even if "Rambo" was in it, I do not think it could even help rating it at all. There's simply no logic in the movie. Perfect way to waste time and money. By far the biggest irritating film I've ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same view after they submit it. Definitely not for people who have little sense in the movie.
