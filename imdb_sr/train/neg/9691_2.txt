This is a shallow hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic story about the plan of a jealous young woman to separate her father and his fianc√©. Is the incest or just a glance through the eyes of a daughter with the Electra complex? Who cares? All characters except Anne (Deborah Kerr) are empty and broken. Seberg is poor (I agree with the comments of the "boy with his chest" from the previous review). The plot was plodding. This predictable material was enough for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately stretched for an hour and a half! If you want to see great dresses and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend "Catch a Thief" - in which you will get extra bonuses of fun stories and cute characters. I love movies that I am entertained. I personally did not care about where the movie was set. Regardless of time and place, I want a good story - a comedy or a drama. I also want to see some nice characters. It does not hurt if I can contact them. The poor Deborah Kerr gives typically good performance, as did David Niven in a contemptuous role. The rating "2" is exclusively for Kerr and Niven, and for cinema - for rich color scenes and a dark, malevolent black and white scene. Unfortunately, all the great cinemas in the world can not save a bad story with unpleasant characters. The sower's ear is still the sower's ear. Consequently, watching this mess was a serious loss of my time.
