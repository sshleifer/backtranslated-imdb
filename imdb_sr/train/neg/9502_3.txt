This film was bizarre, completely inexplicable and hysterical for watching with friends while drinking in a large empty house. I really like introductory things with Lisa wandering around the lost city. I want to be a wonderful stranger lost in an exotic European site, although perhaps not in a small budget. Definitely come to the end where there are unusual sex sex scenes that have been cropped (in any case in a DVD copy). Do not try to figure it out, just go and watch the strange parts ... what's all. Do not look at this if you really want a plot or characterization or anything that makes sense. Pretty nice, though you may quit this and decide to watch a real horror movie, say, Dead Alive.
