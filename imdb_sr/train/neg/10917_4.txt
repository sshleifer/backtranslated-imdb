I am a fan of Columba, especially in the rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oscar Verner after the Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very short. The initial entanglement and complications were obvious and could have been speculated in advance, even years before the modern detective broadcasts of today. But it was fun to see crazy couch patterns and "modern" electronic equipment and, of course, compulsory suburban humor that is having fun in modern art for sale. A high-tech home is Jetson's or Disney's version of Tomorville, and it's fun to think of writers who invented those "traveling gizmos". Columbo episodes. However, we should be grateful for cable television to broadcast these episodes.
