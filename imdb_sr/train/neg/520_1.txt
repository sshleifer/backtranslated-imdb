After we counted the use of this word, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes of the movie, we listened to some really bad actors who are about a woman and a horse, and behaved pretty much like the 12-year-olds were wrong and we switched it off. The reliance on uncharged cursing and insignificant humor is a sure sign of a losing Hollywood movie, a product of the vmaaginal and talented writers. We gave her a second chance, thinking she would be better. No dice. Later, my boyfriend skipped the rest of the movie in case it improved, still without dice. The main character had a cool bicycle. I would not recommend this to everyone, except perhaps to really immature adolescents, or to guys from fraternity.
