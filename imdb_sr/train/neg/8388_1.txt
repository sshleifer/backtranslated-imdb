This cordial story of hope is coming. I hope that you will never have to endure any of this again. * cough * Razzie award * cough * I did not like this movie because it was awkward, predictable and meaningless. As I watched, I felt as if I was in a psychological experiment to determine how low the standards of movies can be obtained before people complain. When I asked for money back at the end of the film, I was informed that I was looking at the whole thing 'I was not entitled to compensation'. The manager of the manager told me that several people had already complained and received a refund. The film summary is quite simple. A thief stealer steals a diamond and poses as a baby to avoid the police. However, below this smart display lies the repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious sketches. Or not. Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people hitting the pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see the dwarfs being shown as babies by the thermometer in the anus? Do you love tired jokes? Do you think the babies say 'goo goo goo goo goa gaa'? If you answered yes to any of the above, then this film is definitely for you. Although in some places it is charged as "The Worst Movie of the Decade", it's probably a movie or two that's up ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. I gave this movie to 2 stars, because we all know that a single-star review indicates the bias by the reviewer, and then the review would not be taken seriously. This comedy is aimed at a less intelligent audience and can not recommend it to anyone with good conscience. Save money for something funny. <br /> <br /> Respect
