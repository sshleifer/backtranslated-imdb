Watching him live at night makes you wonder when the world greens this shit. The young couple goes to speleology on a honeymoon, they are attacked by blind mice and the husband begins to run around in pajamas by attacking various people. And where are they? They are in the desert, then skiing, then they are in a small town that seems to have mountains in the vicinity. The city is managed by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vengeance against a wicked doctor. The skiing hospital is led by a real guy with fine thick mustaches, and the wife looks like Marie Tiler Moore or Marilin Kuaile. There is no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger. Special Effects and Makeup Guru Stan Winton made the effects for this movie. I suppose you have to start somewhere.
