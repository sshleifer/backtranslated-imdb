To tell the truth I'm a little stunned to see all those positive reviews by many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decide to watch this movie. And after I saw her, I was really disappointed, and that comes from a man who loves this movie about the movie. I'm surprised in this movie completely - it's like a naked childhood movie for absolutely no reason and it involves little children who curs and swear. I was not at all right, but this really went too far to my account. Synopsis: The story of two guys is sent to Big Brother's program for their reckless behavior. They met there with one child with breast augmentation, and the other was a medieval freak. Only the name that is not related to the story itself. They are not a model and do nothing but serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (although it is expected) and humor is chrome. And have we already seen the same characters (playing Mec Lovina) in many other films (such as Saskuatch Gang?). I think I laugh three times and I almost fell asleep. Well, the casting was fine, after all, he is the one who produces the script. And acting is so expected when watching this kind of movie. And the direction, what does one expect? This is the same guy who brought us the Vet Hot American Summer, and that movie is bullshit. But somehow he always managed to bring some star to attract his terrible film. In any case, I felt not a total rifle, but a total waste of time. It seems that only naked scenes are the best part of the movie. I really can not see why I would recommend this to anyone. Professionals: Elizabeth Bank? Two toples scenes. Cons: No funny, horrible story, nudity and children do not mix together. 3.5 / 10 Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Rating: F)
