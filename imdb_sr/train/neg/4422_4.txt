This is a real bomb. We should believe that Merle Oberon is the daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to Tom DeLai of the 1930s that he is worthy of support as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can not go anywhere, but is surrounded by politicians and their kucking, shocking women and is supported only by friendly uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two maid in a meeting with a blind man, and Gary Cooper appears. Some footage of the rodea may have been revived, but la "Misfits", but there is no luck with this. Garry later enters the gala dinner, chaired by Merle, and although he is invited to sit down and join a group, he reads a lecture on snobbery. Where did this sudden cowboy elopement come from? The most intense scene in the movie is the phantom party that Garry keeps in his unfinished house for his absent wife, Merle. Will this never end? One to be avoided.
