This was a better movie than the average I thought was on the cable. I expected something like a cheese melodrama and bad special effects seen in classics such as Christmas Hurry or First Daughter / Meta / Shot, etc. Ron Livingston as a stubborn SVAT commander. It is good to see that he again visited the same material with which he had so much wealth in the Band of Brothers. Producers and designers did their homework, because all the scenes and footage looked like they happened on that day in 1997. because FKS will repeat all 50 times ... take 2 hours and enjoy it.
