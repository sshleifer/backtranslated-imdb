Let me start by saying that I will try not to put too much spoil in this. I usually enjoy Robin Villiams movies, but this jewel was not one of them. It was charged as a tense thriller. The night listener was anyway. There were 6 people on the day of opening the theater, 2 came out for good reason. In my opinion, the film was poorly written and directed. The act was fine, but again there was nothing to do with it. The film talks about a storyteller who reads a good book of a dying child. However, here * insert the ghost * no one can check the existence of children. So Villiams goes to Visconsin to try to find the author, but all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boy. That's it, that's all. Wait about an hour and a half and ends the movie. He had as much excitement and winter as he was visiting the dentist's office. Homosexual tones, or gossips, had nothing to do with the story, and the film had a little bit of cursing, but it seemed that it was thrown there for no reason and it made little sense. In conclusion, I really can not write a decent review of this film, because there was nothing, it was just as amazing as watching a dry color. I gave it 2 because acting for what was worth was fine and it was not directed by Uwe Boll.
