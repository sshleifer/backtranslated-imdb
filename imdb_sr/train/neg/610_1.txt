I bought this movie on the cheap in the sale, after I read the DVD case case and assuming that in no way I can not lose it, if it was a garbage then there is no loss, if it was good then it's cheap ... <br /> < I watched him ... I am usually a fan of Christopher Valken, but in this film he was commanding a very small screen presence, it seems that he does not do much, even the death of his friend near the beginning , which provokes "action" in complication, seems to be very hard hit, and his eventual vengeance is just boring and unreasonable true. Normally a movie that has topics as big as revolution and revenge are capable of capturing the audience and attracting them to feel something for the characters, but watching this film more felt like watching a series of confused, and almost random events that are loosely related to the ultimate conclusion ... Br /> At this moment I cried ... <br /> <br /> I thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of watch I have undergone, the scene in which the pilot is sacrificing by himself refusing to jump out of an explosive cargo vehicle because he does not want to kill civilians is not Liko tragically sad, how terribly disturbing and painful, though not as bad as it has emergency surgery on a wounded girl. The acting was poor, the script and the story were weak, "action" was even weaker, and "visual" were, but they were not very visual. To sum up, there are good films, bad films, films that are so bad to be good, movies that are terrible ... And then at a brand new level is "McBain".
