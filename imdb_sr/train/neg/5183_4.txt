This is the first of these "8 Movies To Die" collections I've seen and certainly did not want to see anything from the rest ... although I heard that at least a couple of them were decent. I do not know, this was not terrible, but it did not help much. Your basic dysfunctional Cannibal family in the suburbs, mom and dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?) Where they continued to bring home food storms whenever possible. The best part of this was the mad Goth sister, who, of course, invites friends from a school who never leaves. In any case, of course, we have a butcher in the basement and so on and so on. This family is like the Savier Clan version in white bread, they are nasty and do bad things, but they do not go without a soul. I see a lot of comments from people who loved this, and I guess I do not know what I missed, but I found it very central and that I would not recommend it to anyone. 4 of 10
