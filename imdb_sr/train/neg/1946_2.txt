As a mother of two young children who were or should have said that they grew up with many reincarnations of Scooby, I feel well positioned to comment on the historical and actual version of Scooby. If we did not see any episode as a family before Shaggi and Scooby got a trace, we might have enjoyed it as a lightweight, nothing special Saturday Morning cartoon. But this is essentially a problem in the current format, so easy it will not have the longevity of the "old" Scooby and Gang. I am sure that it will succeed in fast cash yield, but I am sure that the long-term purchase of old and young people is in a very real danger of being lost. My six-year-old son who was watching the new version was really unhappy and without any incentive said he looked really bad and why it was not like the last series (Where are you). Scrappi Doo was an anomaly, but it's still infinitely better than this. Let's hope that we will get a clue that will refer to manufacturers.
