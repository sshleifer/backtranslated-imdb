Imagine the scenario - you're in the cinema just because you're in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're done with museums. You think you could look at the movie Sarah Marshall while the trailer looks like that and you do not have to deal with your brain. It was sold. Options? - A job at the bank, in Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You saw Bank Job (an incredibly decent movie about robbery) and In Bruges (again, pretty good) so you're at two. Do not you think you're looking at Clooney or a fine office football uniform from the 1930s, so go see the real night? Wrong. You take $ 8.50, go to a stranger on the street and ask him to hit you in the face for $ 8.50. It would be better if money is spent. In fact, it's more comedy than horror / thriller or whatever it should be. If I financed this film and they showed me that as a final cut I do not know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. The insults of any intelligence ... my roommate laughed loudly in most films, as well as acting, could also throw robots (or maybe dogs) into roles, be more realistic. The detective must be perhaps the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Haiden Christansan (I hate to play it so much, I do not care how his name is written.) So in the summary "not good"
