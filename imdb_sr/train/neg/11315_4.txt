He was still a naive for the aesthetic sense of Piuno, I loved this film, although the "unfinished" ending was giving up. As usual, Piun is developing a distorted sense of humor and the Kathi Long fighting is extremely impressive. Beautifully photographed, this feels like it's done for the big screen.
