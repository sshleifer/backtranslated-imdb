I first read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! It is a classic historical romance set up in the 17th century when the western country was a few days away from London, and the law and order were much more difficult to implement. Unfortunately, this version of the book has several slogans with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. The values ​​of acting and production are fine, but the way the story was rumpled was terrible. Why do television adaptations work? Why would they think that thousands of book lovers would want to change the story? One of the great mysteries of life !!! The BBC made an excellent version that was broadcast on Christmas in the early nineties and I'm still trying to find a copy! Listen to my advice, read the book and do not bother with this insignificant version!
