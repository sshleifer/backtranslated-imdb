Apart from a better performance than the two actors, this movie is really, really bad. The value of cheap production does not help. Of course, you would not really notice that production values ​​are cheap if they do not try to convince you that they had production values ​​to start. Even for the genre of B-movie genre like myself, this movie is really shit.
