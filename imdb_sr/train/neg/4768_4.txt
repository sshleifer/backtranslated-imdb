I recently came across Nine Dead and read the current reviews thinking that I can deal with the average movie. This film, however, was slightly below the average, yet viewed. The script was poorly written and the acting was in average for a B-level movie with a pair that seemed to stand out as pretty good. The action borders with Sav, teaches people what they wrongly did in a situation and try to tell them to even more value their lives, but that's the real place where the comparison ends. Nine dead are trying to have the heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main mistake I found in the Nine Dead was a slap to a flashbacks viewer that happened 3 minutes before the movie and were completely unnecessary and completely inadequate ending that people would not see coming in bad ways. Except for any spoilers, I've seen worse than bad movies, and even they have not badly done this. Good movie, bad acting and ending ...
