Toni Scott directs a thriller sport film that should attract even non-sports fans. Some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too damn spore. Well perk up! It seems that the outside is disgruntled by the seller (Robert De Niro) while the inside is a psychotic fan of San Francisco Giants. In addition, a new sluger (Veslei Snipes) and a certain savior from depression arrive. Our salesman hides a killer obsession when the hard hit of all stars falls in the worst career crisis, and the giants are afraid to collapse with him. De Niro is a personified terror. Snipes looks very natural as a player. Other members of the cast include: Elen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arrbanville. You're free agent ... enjoy. Violence and a very strong language are expected and you receive money.
