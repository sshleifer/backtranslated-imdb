Yes, I admit I cried during this film. It was so incredibly disappointing that I could not help myself, but I was crying. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) repeated this. The first is to have a Million Dollar Man (a former professional wrestler) on their program, and now this too. Omega Code follows a series of sketched religious-oriented films. It was quite fun, but at the same time it was disturbing that it was so biblical inaccurate. The film follows what is known as the "biblical code", not the actual biblical scriptures. This film is extremely badly made; from his writing to his direction to his hilariously terrible acting. His depression is that people actually made an effort in this film. It looked more like a late night movie somebody would watch on an American channel or directly on a home video, not a theater movie. Depended on that.
