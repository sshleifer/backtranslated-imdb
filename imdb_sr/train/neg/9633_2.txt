Is the rich, sick Elizabeth Tailor succumbing to an angel of death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or has she only overreacted - or, more precisely, excessively - as usual? In fact, both are applicable in the wandering, twisting disorder of Joseph Losei's director, called Boom, appropriately named because temperaments in a lush, luxurious environment are almost ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs on an unnamed Tailor's Mountain; she dresses him in a samurai dress with a sword. Although the great look in the wide screen, the picture is otherwise rather deadly, the failure even to Liz 'Dick-philes should be avoided (collective "stars" attitude towards film career in the late sixties have come to madness) over here). Senseless, confused and confusing, "Boom" is a disaster - although the screenwriter Tennessee Villiams, who adapted his own unsuccessful show "The train for milk does not stop here anymore," said she likes it very much! * from the ****
