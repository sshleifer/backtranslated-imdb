It seems that Anita and Me are a little more than an excuse for Meera Sial, the author of novels and scripts, to pass on her prejudices, complaints and general antipathy towards the English. The general sentiment of Indian superiority over English in this film is a foul. , Racist, ugly, eating poor food, and decadent - obviously, if turned Indian culture, the local priest can be "bought" at the end of the film. Indian family is beautiful, smart, educated, can speak many languages, care and love parents, and fodder food. The film was so insidious that I was amazed that the BBC financed it at all. If it was the other way around, the English family in the Indian community shown in this way, the movie would be seen as a racist. There were a few moments when my eyebrows fired so far into my forehead, I thought they would slip into my hair. First, the tape scene between women at Divali's celebration - under the text: The English are dirty and promiscuous - and men - a subtext: The English are prostitutes. Second, a meal with Anita, where her family is lying about Neemina cutlery - subtext: the English are so stupid, you can make them do anything. Weddings are the subject of contempt - obviously everything is through the film. Character Anita was drawn so horribly - almost a woman fell - that I ended up a movie that was angry. This is not a "Band like Beckham" where humor is focused on love. exaggeration of behavior and customs of the community by someone in the community, and a film about two girls from different backgrounds to come together. Instead, it seems that Anita and Me transfers that form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, because the English version of the Indian almost untouchable caste, and this is emphasized by a series of covert attacks on the film series 'other' community: In English. I felt that Anita and I are part of a hate-based business. On this basis, the BBC should not finance its production.
