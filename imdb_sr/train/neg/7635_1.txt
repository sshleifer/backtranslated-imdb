I completely agree with the critique of the reviewer Variety that the film is never so funny, lively or perceptive in the creative process as its assumption seems to be justified. It is narratively disorderly and lighting is really problematic. If the film should be guided in character, poor lighting does not improve the acting and sometimes it is difficult to observe the facial expressions. Many non-South Africans will have difficulty tracking spoken English in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in that process. Last year I watched a movie at the world film festival in Cape Town. The comments and reactions to the film ran from an invisible and messy to a welcome break from the movies about our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chov will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the extraordinary films about our history of apartheid will really be ranked among our best in our 110-year history of the film. It is not surprising that the film disappeared from the Cape Town cinema just two weeks after leaving and most of the cinemas in Durban and Gauteng. The attractiveness of the South African audience is clearly limited.
