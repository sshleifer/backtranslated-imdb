Vhoa. In Twain Cities, we have a station that displays "Big Bad Movie" from Monday to Friday. Tonight was a movie with Carrie Fisher called "She's Back" about a really disturbing woman who eventually got killed when the rapists broke into the house. Bea (Beatrice) is returning to persecute her husband. She wants to be revengeful to her murderers, so she "returned". And he will not let him rest until he does. It irritates him infinitely ... and the spectators! This movie is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Hey, I still love bad movies (my favorite movie is Xanadu). I really shook my head during the whole movie, wondering who would think it would be a good idea for a movie. Bea is so boring. The action is silly; acting is bad; the story ... well, you get my enthusiasm. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie - really a really bad movie, check this out. You will not be disappointed. Heh.
