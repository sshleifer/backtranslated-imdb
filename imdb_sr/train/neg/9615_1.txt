From this adaptation it is obvious that it is not. Not only did he leave a plot behind him, he invented his own! The things he chose to leave were so ridiculously incredible that I was happy that he decided to exclude some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was blurred, inconsistent and shocked. I do not want to say anything about the actors, but they can not act! Dickens is hard, of course, but this is pathetic! Mikeber was nothing short of Kramer in the mid-nineteenth century, and the less talked about Betsy Trotwood, the better! If you want to see the true Copperfield, look at the wonderful adaptation for the BBC. As for the screenwriters, I think he read Cliff's notes!
