This movie had all the elements to be a smart, sparkling comedy, but for some reason it went awry. Maybe he did not know who his audiences were: but it's hardly a movie for men acting and acting, but it's too slapstick and stupid blond to completely like women. If you see Legal Blonde and her sequel, then this is like a confusing, terrible sequel. Large actors like Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also manage a lot more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller are lurking in supporting roles that are stupid, not funny. Many things in this film were color-coded, various editions of uber-clich√©s, misunderstanding at the last minute, "even a childish party chaos." This only points to the dash of script writing. It should be possible to find this movie pleasant if you do not take it seriously, but that's so obvious - better than you will probably feel frustrated and more and more disappointed how the scenes move.
