This must be the worst movie I've ever seen. I bought a DVD and did not work, it's a good DVD movie, it's just a movie, it's actually so bad that I do not think any of the actors did it from (or before judging from acting). There is no real conspiracy to talk about it and there is no real horror. Production values ​​are garbage even for low-budget films, and some external scenes are difficult to hear because of the wind on the microphone. Overall, there was such a bad movie that the viewer might think of turning it into a porn if they do not know better (which is an improvement). There are only two lines in the film that are ridiculous, and both of them are turning around a transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly deserve to watch all 76 minutes) As for DVD marketing, I feel completely deceived. I mean, I read back. I expected it to be bad: He chose his weapon. He chose his victims. He raised his nose. He turned to GIRL! But I thought it might be fun. Also, the case claims that it is digitally processed, I would like to have seen it earlier, the print is so grainy that you can use it as sand paper. The case also says that this is an absolutely disgusting movie, WHAT IS THE WAY ?, disgusting production, acting. This film remains welcome in the first five minutes, (if you are thinking about buying this I would say buy a 'bad taste' instead of being a much better movie and it's funny, there's Peter Jackson, director of LOTR In it.) By the way, if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since then, please place here as I would like to know, to find out whether there is a bad movie up there, or if someone in this movie ever bothered to learn to act
