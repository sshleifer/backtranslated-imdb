This is the case with a bunch of people who think they are so smart to have a story that matches the weather. Do you remember all the political conspiracies caught in the camera in the years leading up to Watergate and sometime later? Most of the films that tried to make money so powerful, about such a powerful, so intelligent conspiracy plot, are actually caught in their own excitement. I was never a fan A conversation I think was dated as the other conspiracy at the time, but Coppola was true to his main character, and Hackman was a pretty interesting actor he was watching. I mean, these conspiracies are mostly drowning in the artistic circle of the hero of the noir. Many questions without answers, lots of dis-communication ... Well, this requires at least Bergman to make a film about such non-visual bases. The next man is the perfect example of his time: one political soup served with an idealistic character and a horrible conspiracy around him. No part is interesting by itself and the whole does not get better. In fact, you can say how bad it will be in the first sequences that accentuate the 'watch' of the murder without any progress. The worst pedestrian directing, like most films, is one pompous accumulation of scenes that surround the violence of naively brought under the eyes of the viewer.
