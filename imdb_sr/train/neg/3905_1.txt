Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate Fiasco, costume drama, recklessly directed, scriptwriting, acting, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende, not so much a better novel. I hate Meril Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and other actors, including Vinon, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, are trying to overcome such an awesome scenario. A lot of mistakes (like, for example, when snow falls in Christmas in Chile?) And very cruelly, with a tone of evil called "magical realism," this is highlighted as the worst film of all time. It's totally bullshit !!!
