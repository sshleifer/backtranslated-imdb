Somehow they summarized the sixties, the ten years that radically changed our country, in four hours. And how painful it was for four hours. They mingled major events and events and "claimed" that they were two families, and you barely saw the African-American family. If I were an NBC, it would be embarrassing and embarrassing to broadcast such trash. What was fun was this happy family that you saw at the very beginning of the torture in so many ways, but she was able to attend every great event of the 60's through the country. The second family was such a factor. They may have devoted a total of five or six scenes to this family. That poor son ... Please, NBC, do not make any movies about any other era ... leave it to PBS and History Channel
