The only thing that The First Pover really did was that it allowed Jeff Kobo to play one of his great, diverse psychotic criminals who worked so well for the past 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor to Lila Bettger who specializes in those parts of the fifties. But that's not enough, The First Pover is an inexperienced twitch that has Lou Diamond Phillips lost as a LAPD detective. who has a specialty in capturing serial killers. Kober is his last catch, but Kober is in the league with less power and they will team up and make Lou's life miserable for him. Even after Kober got a gas chamber, his spirit returns in every form. Micheltie Villiamson is at hand as a Louin partner who encounters an uncomfortable end that includes a demonic horde and Traci Griffith as a psychopath and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun insight is there to help Lou. Will he be able to fight the forces outside? As the film finishes, you no longer care. Lou was really trapped in a turkey. Perhaps the devil made him do this film.
