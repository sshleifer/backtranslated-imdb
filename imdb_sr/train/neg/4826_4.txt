I see what the director was trying to do, but he missed the sign. The main actor was really good, but the installation around his moments takes you out of it. The camera works, i.e. Lighting and exposure is some sort of amateur I could forgive if the direction was tough, but not. The sound was a little off, and it also got you out of the movie. I see that this director could be a bit better in the future, so it can not be completely excluded, but do not expect a dvd movie to be as good as 28 days later or anything else. that. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh, yes, and apart from lead, the acting was pretty bad if you asked me. But I'm a movie snob, so take it for what's worth.
