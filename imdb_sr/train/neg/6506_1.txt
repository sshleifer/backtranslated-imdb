Unless you are a geeki student of a movie who has to see everything, this film will not only be a waste of your time and money, but a great disappointment, but it will also make you angry beyond belief. Hopkins decided to hide it and encrypt it under so many incessant chaotic layers of seemingly random audio video microcontrollers, so that the patient's patience after a short time became less and less. Why would anyone like Hopkins choose such a difficult, heaviest and very unstable project as his first scenario, the first result and the third film, could have assumed. Maybe he played with him in his mind for so long, until he became unrecognizable as he became, not even for him. The result is proof that he does not have enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result. Even the weirdest Carpenter and Linch films, to mention only two unconventional filmmakers, had a 90% greater coherence, 95% less characters, and 99% more streaming stories. Sir Anthony, you have advocated for the stars, but unfortunately missed for a few light years. Please hold on to acting, in this department you are an incomparable giant and nobody should ask for more than you, even for yourself!
