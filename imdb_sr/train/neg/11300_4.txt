First viewed 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Ioung): The third universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two in terms of the final result from the perspective of the viewer. The story is similar and the results are ho-hum. This time the location of the story is the USA, because the new follower of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country in the hope that he will be able to revive him to kill the descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time, Mummy plays Lon Cheney (which does not make a big difference because it does not require much to do for this character). The new priest becomes a guard at the morgue in the city and sends his mother to do her dirty work after feeding her leaf juice. Again, the girl is on her way, since the priest falls on one of the bridegroom's descendants and wants her to be - immortal with him (we have not heard it before?). The plan, of course, is prevented that citizens love the mummy with torches (similar to Frankenstein's monster) and the burning of the creature ends the story ... how do they get the sequel? I guess you'll find out with the next in the series? or not.....
