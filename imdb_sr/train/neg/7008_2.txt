Annie Potts is the only highlight in this really boring movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really very upset that someone steal Corvette he and his colleagues turned into a hotrod (probably the most arduous car to be featured in the movie), and goes to Las Vegas with Annie's evil genius who stole his pride and joy. I would dig my eyes after I watched this was not fun to watch Annie Potts in a very early role, and it's too bad for Hamilton not to take a few lessons from the acting. Danni Bonaduce also says goofi cameo.
