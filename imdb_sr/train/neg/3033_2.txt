I am VERY great fan Jenne Jameson, but this film is horrible. At that time, Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and was the director of this film, and Jenna was the most popular porn star ever. Well, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as she could to make this big budget porn movie. Now I know why they do not make big porn movies anymore. In the world of imagination, porn stars can act, but this is the real world and can not function. Therefore, they have porn stars there, if a woman is as beautiful as Jenna could play, then she would try to get into the mainstream movies instead of pornography. Just because your beauty does not make you a movie star. A good example of this is Tracy Lords, when she was a teenager over her twenty years, she was one of the prettiest, sexy women in the world. She forced her to move to mainstream low-budget films and could not play. Where is she now? I gave her 2 instead of 1 grade just because Jenna is so hot, but she has better movies she made then "Dream House". Come on, Jenna, we do not want to hear you talk about how much we want you to have sex. Also, Jenna, you have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you did an anal movie.
