Last night I caught this movie at FKS, and as I sat and watched it, it occurred to me that it could have been the worst movie ever. Bad acting, bad cinema, bad sound, absolutely incredible fight sequences, stupid characters. It all became the funniest bad movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I was thrilled with my pure absence of anything half-competent that I had to continue to watch ... and they made a sequel!
