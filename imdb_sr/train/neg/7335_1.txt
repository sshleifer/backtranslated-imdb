This is perhaps the worst version of the show I've seen - a few times on the scene except for the movie. Very good idea for the setting - the US South can give a credible background to the extreme reactions of the hero, the alleged violation. Ali execute! Viddoes is a very dressed Beatrice that gives a particularly bad performance. Waterster, a fine actor, is not much better than Benedict. The poorest performance is in the role of Don John - it makes Keanu Rivs look good. Perhaps the desire is to make a caricature along the line of a bad guy who bounds a girl on a runway, fits with a stack of stones from Dogberry and his people - but the acting makes you regret it. The successful setting includes a scene in which they fooled Benedict in the belief that Beatrice liked him - would casting an actor's competence be brilliant. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict approaching is well produced. All in all, I had to compel myself to continue to watch, but that certainly did not keep my attention. Very disappointing. Given these last comments, I am almost 40 years old. I've been watching Shakespeare's scene and film production for more than 2 decades. Can I suggest when you try to defend your friends, talk to a piece, not attack other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in terms of facts. However, I can assume, because of your indignation towards young people, that you are in sufficient age, in which the dictation of the old days is more in your taste. My favorite couple was Rilance and McTeer on the London stage. . Unlike Viddoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic performer, can act.
