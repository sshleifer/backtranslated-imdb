I can remember Bo Derek's peak and British journalistic attention (especially the troubles of Sun & Nevs of the Vorld) - all of which follow her small role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Understandably, she made a lot of tension in her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and perfectly shaped chest. Unfortunately, the acting is and has never been her forte! I think you should make one of the threefold disc collections you always find in suitable DVD containers - Orca, Tarzan Ape-man and Bolero. All of these films could be nominated for "They're So Bad". It would be a guilty "must buy" mine! If ever you read your press, or this comment, Ms. Derek, please do not offend. - You have always had a mild point for you and there are more important things that are happening in the world around which you have to worry than your acting skills. Much Love.k
