I had to get out of the theater. After an hour, everything I saw was people who cheat women, run like dogs in the trail, and use the f-word as a diabetic using Ecu. No, thank you. It was especially frustrating because the film could do a lot. Any character could have been very interesting if they were given more work than dealing with bullying, talking about it, and swearing to one another. to be a kind of character development, everything that happened was the second sexual scene. The development of the plot in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1) several murders occur, 2) Vinnie sees the scene of the murder 3) Vinnie stares looking across the Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheating on his wife, and 5) Joei (the most cute character in came out of the house of their parents. More than that, I did not wait to see it. The photo and the reciprocal relationship of the characters were remarkable, but NISTA NIÅ TA for them. The flood of sex and vulgarity was not worth waiting for another hour to be Something Happens. Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill, or Shavshank Redemption. Or is it a better study in the community and interpersonal relationships?
