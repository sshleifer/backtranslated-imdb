The world's biggest joke. The biggest, most exclusive joke in the world. Emulating the boldness and "every" humor of the office space, this film drives the attraction of this film into the country by making humor so that it is only legally to be respected by legal secretaries who write books. The audience is asked to take over the unknown role of the secretary of the secretaries, and then sympathize with the dumb protagonist. The whole film is focused on a legal secretary who finds free time, listening to music and writing a novel while doing it. These are his goals. You can not imagine a slap in the audience when (about half) learn that he had a job that fits into all three criteria, but then he let it go! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely remove the motivation of the audience to empathize or even find entertainment for the protagonists who previously rejected what complained about the lack of it. In addition, the great stumbling block, the insider humor of the secretary does not succeed because they have to be clearly explained to the audience every time they happen. Without that, the audience would not notice anything particularly strange. Humor is effective only if you do not need to explain to the audience thoroughly what's ridiculous.
