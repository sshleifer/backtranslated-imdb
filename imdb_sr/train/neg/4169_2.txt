I gave him 2 just because Natassia Malthete (like the Kuintana vampire) looks sooooo sexy in this movie. Sure there is very little logic in this movie, but also most science fiction vampire flicks. The film probably tried too hard to get rid of the traditional story of the vampires. Unfortunately, she went too far and made the whole story not only unreasonable, but also ridiculous. It's too cracked and too many scenes that have taken away the body, which makes me feel sick. A good vampire film should be more reasonable that you do not have to see a lot of blood - we all know when a vampire jumps onto a man he / she will do what the vampire will do. A few shots or shouts are all that is needed to describe the scene (like the one at the end when Quintana tries to sexually excite Rosa, all she needs is a few groans, your imagination is left). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
