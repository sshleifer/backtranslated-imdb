I picked up this DVD in the Dollar Store. The DVD was 2 for a $ 1 stand, but after Michael Madsen had it, I thought I bought it all the time, because I did not see a movie. I must say that I do not like the movie. The film played more as a documentary or a commercial for religion than anything else. I found out that the direct use of Flash did not add a story to me. I'd rather watch the story in chronological order. I will not reject it as one of the other commentators, but it can be a long time before I consider watching this movie again. Who knows, since it was a film debut by Michael Madsen, may have some archival value on a future date.
