Tromaville High has become an amorphous devastation of dirt due to the consequences of accidental release of toxic waste near the nuclear power plant. Unrestrained chaos is full of meaningless violence and rude behavior. Pretty horrible, obviously intended to be, the confusion of the film with filmmakers who loosened the reins, allowing the non-regulated free rule to suppress. The Craft was far below the Tromoe list of targets for this bloody sleazefest. Honorary society are bumps with spooky facial features and wrinkled suits. A German teacher, who becomes a member, through a "toxic kiss" has traces on one side of the face that really gave me anger. The poison monster, who sent ANNOIING punks to the end, is pretty cool. Br /> The type of cinema experts will wholeheartedly accept.
