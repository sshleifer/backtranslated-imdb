Shazbot, is this a shame? In fact, here's a list of 100 that makes shame: 1.) The unsuccessful return for Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels essentially plays the same role he played in the live remake of 101 Dalmatians who was not too succinct to start. It must have a funny way to promote your Purple Rose Theater ... 3. Disnefluff. 4.) Another disappointing reminder that Vallace Shavn for Disney was what Jet Li was Bob Hoskins at Unleashed. 5.) Rai Valston, the original marsh from the TV series, played a part (read the "cameo") in this film and died two years later from the lupus. Accident? 6.) Terrible Special Effects. Seriously - terrible. 7.-100.) That damn story, fried clothes that Vaine Knight ("Nevman!") Brought to a boring degree. My favorite scene? HA! Hahaha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Good! You - You're a joke. Okay, let's finish this review with the moment of silence for the agony of this franchise's death, and if you like, you can say a quick prayer that Disney does not forget this travesty and do something stupid as a movie adaptation "Moore and Mind" starring Tim Allen .... ......................................... ......... ...
