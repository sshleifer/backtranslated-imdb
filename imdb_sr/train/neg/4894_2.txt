Redundant, eternal videos, useless videos, useless scenes are what you will find in this movie. In other words, it seemed to me technically poor. Music bits are amateur-oriented (no synchronization in future dance, poor post-synchronized, bad and obvious improvisation of actors from time to time, etc.). The film is long and dull. In the end, it makes little sense and makes even less sense. There are some good ideas though. Some of the comic elements are actually an effective, especially start-up scene. However, the film deteriorates and deteriorates so it is extremely unbearable and impossible to understand. The trailer I saw was very dynamic, which is not true for the movie. This means that the mismatch between the trailer and the actual movie is something that is very close to cutting.
