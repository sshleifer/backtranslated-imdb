This film had a mediocrity, laziness and recklessness written all over it. If you want to make a movie about a vampire that has already been made a thousand times, you'd better do a good job. I will be the first to say that this film has not cut him. Some terrible / horror films simply fail to break the mold "let's do something banned and abandoned for fun because all the stories are just lies" clich√©s. Unfortunately, this was not different, like all the horrifying films, when you once walked that way, there is no return. And end? How do heroes do the same thing over and over again throughout the film, but then they mysteriously circle at the moment and in the end can not do the job? The end was very anti-climatic and written part 3 that I will never watch. A horrible movie.
