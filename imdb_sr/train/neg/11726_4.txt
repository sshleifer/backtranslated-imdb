Vesely Snipes is James Dial, a hired killer, an agent of the CIA and cleans a special operative. During his free time, call the cowboy hat and breed horses with cat names such as Beauty. Enter the Collins agent, his supervisor. Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist who is in custody in the United Kingdom. Of course, Great Britain as an ally is an excellent place for secret operations and recordings outside the courtroom. The assassination is a great success, except for the fact that the escape plan has exploded. So, Dial's partner and local connection were killed in action trying to escape from the police, while Dial became hot assets with London police officers trying to get to him, and the CIA is trying to get rid of it. Fortunately for a Dial Safe House routinely visits teenager Emili Dai (Eliza Bennett), who likes to hang out with cold blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the United Kingdom's evil police ... < br /> Such a script I have to say more? On the plus side of Vesely Snipes is Veslei Snipes (whether it's a pro or con) and the movie is quite interesting. Minus editing is very unrelated and has a hurl effect on the stomach.
