That's exactly the one that frustrates me most. A great actor, an excellent director, a great potential for a story, then they destroy it all with a script that does not go anywhere ... and does not say anything while going there! There is no depth here. No depth of character, no depth of complication, no depth of surprise, uncertainty, or common sense. We know what's going on, we were told how they plan to solve the problem, solve the problem, we are surprised by the end of the end that does not create any uncertainty, and then suddenly complete the film. A futile opportunity. On the plus side, Glenn Ford leads the role of a British (and one French) actor who are all fantastic, working an incredibly impressive job with the one-dimensional writing they got. One of the absolute favorite is Herbert Valton as "Old Charlie", which gives some wonderful pieces of humor and warmth to a dark and serious movie. I also thought that the movie had a wonderful look at it ... all the shadows and fog ... a very film noir in the feeling. Although actors are doing the best they can and directing is comfortable, it's still not enough for me to recommend spending time watching the movie. There are many better Glenn Ford films: Big Heat, Gilda, an affair in Trinidad, etc.
