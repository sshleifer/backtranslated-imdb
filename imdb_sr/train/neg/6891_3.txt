It starts a very good, nice introduction and accumulates for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost. The character is in the same mold as the main protagonist of American Pie and Loser without a supportive actor or an innovative story that made Pie films more commercial success. Be honest - Heather was pretty poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did the best they could but did not have a significant story or script to get the teeth in the film. how they come - so predictable I marked the spoiler box for this line. My advice: avoid at all costs, unless you really have nothing else to do / listen to or watch, and even then you will feel that the producers only deceived you for an hour and a half.
