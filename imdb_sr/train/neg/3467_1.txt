On the cover of the box of this film is the name of Kyle Minogue, but she has the same destiny as Drew Barrimore in "Scream". This is the first thing that makes this film a chromatic one; They are trying to sell a movie with someone who is in it for 5 minutes. Of course, we must have this movie with young kids who do not know that the killer is moving around. Above all, Molly Ringwald of the 80's, a film glory of the 80's, is the star of this beautifully written film. It's a good career move for Molly to get some money in an Australian movie, so she will not be mocked in the states. he never finished because this stupid creature kills everyone in it. Through the film, we should guess who the killer is. A short story, remember our little girlfriend Molly, does she save the day ... or she? This move is simply bad, rent it if you want to torture or simply break it into your local video if you see it on the shelf. Do not spread horror.
