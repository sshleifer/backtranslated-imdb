How is it possible to make the film so bad? Bad acting. Bad script. Just a shame. This is just one bad clich√© after another. This movie actually has some great star names. Unfortunately, they are singers, not actors. This film was hardly had money for good reason. The appeal of black cowboy films is simply not there. Too bad they did not have a good story.
