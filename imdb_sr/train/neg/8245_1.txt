I can not believe anyone liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget indie movies, but this one is absolutely sucked. The low budget does not mean that the film must be muted. Horror does not mean that the movie must be crazy. This film was not terrible at all. It was just an up-fest, especially disturbing. The acting was average, given that they were all silent for the actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The film is trying to portray itself as "artistic" or something like that. This is not one of those really great indie movies that cost only thousands of dollars to make, but they are incredibly well-made. This is nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their films of obscured obsessions on the film. Other reviews here also said that the soundtrack was sucked ... because most were written by the same person, and some songs were written by one of the film's writers. There was no buying quality in this film at all. Totally wasting time and money.
