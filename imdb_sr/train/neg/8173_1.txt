One of the saddest slasher ever. I would not see it even ending up like some porn movie, which totally reminds me. The fact that you're watching a small group of middle-aged people in the forest is really unbearable. They made such films for teenagers, who they really wanted when they made this sang-fest? My favorite part of this movie is a wrapper, and that's the only reason I decided to look for this movie, which was part of the Suspense Classics 50 movie, and after I looked at other films in this package, I'll realize that it does not belong anywhere else. So, if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the forest, I recommend Just Before Dawn and Final Terror.
