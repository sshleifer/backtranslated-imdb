This film was quite a disappointment. After a very slow, very intense (and quite bloody) start of the film begins to lose him. Too much complication leaves too little time for explanation, and leaving the theater I wondered what this is about. The characters remain shallow, the story is not at all convincing, most of them do things without naming the parody, and there are also very raw parts ... As a young cop needs to dig out the body. Of course it's night and it's raining and it's got to do it ... Or the Evolution of Evil is "Nazi" plus "Genetic Manipulation" ... Vov, it's really original. However, there are some nice parts, such as the battle scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (although Reno and Vincent Cassel are doing what they can) it's definitely not worth it.
