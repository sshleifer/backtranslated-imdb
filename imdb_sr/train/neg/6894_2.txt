It's sad when you can see what the film was trying to do, and it's quite obvious that it fell far from the mark. Film students should understand this as a lesson and a warning. He'll be a graduate with an idea. He wants complete control. So, he himself writes, directs, produces his film masterpiece. His concept is usually far beyond his budget. Usually he writes an oversized script full of any tag he can make sense of. Usually, he is more interested in a great deal of story than for foul work with actors in individual scenes. Usually, it ends with a movie that is weak in trying to create wonders on a small budget. Usually, it ends with a series of encounters (we can not make justice by what we call them scenes) that feel like they were written by a 12-year-old. And usually he ends up with bad scenes that can not catch the viewer. When you look at the judges from this perspective, you can immediately say that it is just a normal ride.
