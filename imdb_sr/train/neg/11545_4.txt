This British psychological thriller is known in the United States as CLOSING. Exploitation of Ks's file Gillian Anderson, who plays an attractive middle-aged business woman named Alice. She must attend a business party and invite Adam (Danni Dier), who just installed the security system for her, to be her escort. On the way home, crossing the forest on a narrow alley, Alisa's car collides with a deer. After pulling the wounded animal off the road, the couple was savagely attacked by a drunken band bandit. Adam hits the pulp; Alice was gang raped and both were emotionally and physically destroyed by relentless attack. When the identities of their attackers are discovered, Alice and Adam went into revenge ... brutal vengeance. The couple sometimes finds themselves inconsistent about dealing with merciless attackers. Their final decision is to avenge without mercy. Let there be no mistakes; the return is hell. Also in the actors: Anthony Calf, Ralph Brovn, Francesca Fowler and Antoni Birne. Brutal violence, disturbing images, nudity and graphic rape.
