Well, what can you say about comedies. Often there were very poor, moral jobs, and just plain. So is this show! He got a boring actor, although A.Bines okay in his lively way, only stereotyped shit remained ... as always. We've all already seen this, and it's likely to see again when this show is canceled. Because, let's face it, its central and self-righteous idea. As most sitcoms ... Well, in short. If you want to see some good party, you can take a break of 20 minutes in front of the mirror. Make some faces and move on ... It's more fun than this show!
