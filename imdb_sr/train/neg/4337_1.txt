This is just the mask of the beautiful story of Edwin Torres. This film does not follow the story in the book. And, there are so many disagreements with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter even saw the first movie. Al Pacino (original and still the best Carlito) comes out of jail starting original. Here Carlito retreats with his wife in paradise. What happened to Gail from Lorain, Ohio? In this war, she does not mention, and Carlito retreats and is likely to marry another girl. Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. I also like how Mr. Guzman plays a completely different character in this movie. He was Pachanga still on Pacin's days. Now, he's Nacho Reies, a killer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reies had a much bigger role in the book. It's been a long time since I read the book, but where did the character Sean Comb come from? Also, I think this film really pollutes racial tensions in Harlem about which Torres wrote. And the mafia does not get the treatment they did in the book. They are also deleted from this movie. But, it's magnificent that Pleasant Avenue is a bunch of another movie. The book has told a great story. This film could tell a great story. This is just a big disappointment. Read the book. It's better to use your time.
