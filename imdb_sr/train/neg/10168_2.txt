Superdome is one of those movies that make you wonder why it's made. The whole action refers to someone who is trying to sabotage the superb, and all attempts to stop them. How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills' careers managed to survive this is beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing about this is that it was NOT FOOTBALL IN ITS ALL! Avoid this if possible.
