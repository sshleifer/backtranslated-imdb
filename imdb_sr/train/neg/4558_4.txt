Frankly, I was disappointed in the "Expiration Date". Super smart title and interesting premise, but I do not think it's delivered. What was it about? The main character's desire to reconnect with his original roots? Or, more likely, his need is to overcome the fear of death. But he was not set up as someone who lived his life in fear - it seems as if his life was going well, but since the Day of Judgment is approaching, he should now begin to care. I did not buy it. In the meantime, the characters in the movie seem to have no need that is integrated into a comprehensive story. Everyone was doing their thing, in parallel with the main character. Also, what is treated as a "curse" is more like coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why did not he just plan to stay in the apartment all day on his birthday? These are my criticisms, but I liked Seattle's recordings, the cinema was wonderful, the acting was good at times when it was not remarkable.
