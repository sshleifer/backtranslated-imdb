*** Can contain a spoiler. *** If the TOXIO TIME LIFE was a brave experiment in which real-life actors received film parts provided they were asked to combine a powerful recipe against anxiety, antidepression, and anti-psychotic drugs (this is the classic combination of psychological departments that turn patients into the fall of zombies) during the shooting, then this film would have much more interest. Or, if film production was another kind of experiment in which all the actors were deprived of sleep before and during the recording, TOKIO TIME can be easily explained. As such, this film is filled with lifeless, low-energy actors. In a scene where the new husband sat on the steps and talked with his sister, it seemed difficult for him to keep his eyes open. In almost every scene, he speaks his lines seated with every part of his body immobile. From beginning to end, his face expression is best described as "close to sleep". Do not be upset about the fact that actors are telling each other the lines, because these actors can barely finish any line of dialogue. Everyone speaks with a depressing, monotonous voice. No laughter. No shouting. No power. Nobody has enough energy to smash a smile. The result: complete and total boredom. And it does not help make the direction simple and amateur. Avoid this lifeless film at all costs. It's better to look at GREENCARD, which has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional Japanese romantic story, check out A LONG HOLIDAY that has an abundant amount of everything that LIFE TO EVERY TIME does not.
