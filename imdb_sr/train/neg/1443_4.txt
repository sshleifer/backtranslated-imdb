Beginning with a good deal: several times Svaize tells Zulu to his friends or the language is heard among the tribes. It's a big plus, because the normal American and British film audiences think that all people on this planet speak English (in case you are one of them: no, no). 'tenkkrommend' as we say in the Netherlands (it seems that your fingers twist - and not in a good way). I like Svaize, but it's terrible in that. The muscles in his fork prolong the overtime work and he frowns the entire film - someone had to tell him that he looks like a butch. No Patrick: it looks stupid and compensation is due to lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) opted for a style of acting that does not suit the style of her associates. Her acting is relaxed that this film could be set up in the current days. And it's not. Your dress was a clue, Alison. The best acting came from people from the African continent and landed on Oniul as Umbopa. Clear, warm and characteristic, its performance is a joy to watch. General: It's maw-fun on a rainy day. A pity. It could have been better. Sack the director.
