Just for the fans of Judi Garland. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one in which you work with an older cleaner (you've all seen pictures), and a pretty good number at the very end. There are several scenes in which the lines are ridiculous. But, in essence, the scenario is so bad and the film is so out of date that it's hard not to shy in horror. But it's worth 2.50 to rent a movie - just be ready to accelerate it.
