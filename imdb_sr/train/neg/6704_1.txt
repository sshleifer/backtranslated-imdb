this is just a terrible 'comedy' - it's a really bad movie. No funny elements. There are no jokes that are funny. I do not know how some people can claim that this dark short film is "smartest" or "better". Perhaps, if it's the only movie that a person has seen, you can claim it to your brothers. but, I've seen thousands of better movies: the sixth leonard (now, that's funny)! I do not know how brothers are generally considered to be included in the Internet movie base: more like home video than as a real movie. Joke to the side, just skip this movie. The root canal is more pleasant than this unhappy material.
