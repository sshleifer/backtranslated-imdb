"Indian Cemetery": If these three words appear anywhere on the property list, look for another neighborhood. The young couple with their young daughter and son of a young child moved to a house in Maine near the cemetery for pets - and, after a hike, an ancient Indian cemetery. It seems that the Indian soil can bring Fida or Fluffy back from the dead - if you do not mind being a hellish pet dog. He can do the same for dead people - if you do not mind having a zombie killer around the house. Throw into a busy asphalt track, accelerate large platforms, benevolently (an older neighbor, and a kid who really does not have enough control, and I think you can understand what is happening here - an overly, illogical mess that, in its fairness, does not offer up to some fears. Well, there are also adaptations of Stephen King (such as "The Maxum Overdrive", which King also directed.) But there are also many better ones (like are "Salem's Lot", "The Dead Zone" and both versions of "The Shining").
