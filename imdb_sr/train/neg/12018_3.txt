- A little time-locker is catching a mafia boss from a lot of money. Of course, the mafia boss wants his money back and does not care who he will kill to get him. Punk is asking his friend and old mobster to help him save his life. - If this sounds funny, then it is. The complete idea that this Izod-wearing, dina-bugg driver punk can postpone one of the most powerful roles in Rome is simply stupid. His friend can be good with a gun, but he is against a group of trained killers. The old mobster is just more than a comic relief and has no real help when it comes to face a mafia. There is also a sub-story about how a friend's friend was killed many years ago by a mob's boss, but little has been done and it does not help the movie anymore. - Mafia boss, Mister Scarface, plays Jack Palance. I guess it got a name because there's something on the face that looks like a shave nickname. Palance is ineffective as the rest of the actors, doing what they need to get paid. - I've seen pretty good Italian crimes / cops recently, but Mr. Scarface is not one of them. Check Sindicate Sadists or Revolver.
