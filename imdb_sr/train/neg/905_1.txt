A woman named Stella (Bette Midler) is pregnant by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). He offers to marry a sense of duty, but she rejects him and decides to raise a child by himself. Things go OK until a child named Jenni (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager, and things gradually (and predictably) become even worse. I saw a quiet version and sound version of "Stella Dallas". None of them hit me much (and I cried easily), but they were well made if they were dated. Trying to change it in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I assume that Midler had enough strength after the incredible success of the "Beaches" to achieve this. This (predictably) bombed. The story is ridiculous and dated to today's standards. Although Midler and Alvarado give good performances, this film really pulls and I'm bored all the way. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help in the role of support. Bad and dull. Really - who thought this would work? See the Stanvick version of 1937. I'm giving this 1.
