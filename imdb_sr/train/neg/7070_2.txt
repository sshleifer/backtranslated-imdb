Boy oh, oh, oh, golli gee, The most interesting thing about the movie was the joy of the bluescreen effects that were used to create my mom's "invisibility". They seemed to have been filmed on inexpensive videos, and it seems completely unreal, and even in a good way where it's so funny to end up kissing a movie ... I'm not finished I love this movie. Attempts to "steadicam" recordings were truly pathetic. I mean, hey, if they have a small budget, that's fine. You can still make an excellent low-budget movie. But a bad movie and a low budget and effects. It makes a bad combination. In this case, such a condemned combo created the craptastic film "Invisible Mom". If you have children and your children have no taste, they may be awake through all of this.
