I was a fan of his first album. This movie is his bad service. The performances, except one of Rufus Vainwright and Teddy Thompson, are simply horrible. Those of Marthe Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antoni and Jarvis Cocker were particularly boring. Even the one led by Sisters McGarrigle, destroyed so-called harmony Marthe Vainvright. I never saw my wife rising and coming out of the room for a movie and earlier forwarding through performances to reach several segments of the interview, which were also difficult to watch due to poor camera performance. There are many who have been able to interpret the songs of Mr. Cohen, Jennifer Varnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Villie Nelson. I hope there will be another attempt to catch Leonard Cohen on a film that will illustrate his insight, talent and intelligence. So sad
