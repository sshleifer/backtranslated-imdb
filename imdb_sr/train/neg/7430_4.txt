It's interesting to see what kind of career Pierce Brosnan was before Bond arrived on stage. In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays gentle Patrick, who works at the head of the ghetto at "confidence courses". He romans with a woman, who has a standard mid-90s kid called "Eric". A woman's drunken ex-husband soon comes to the scene and begins to mess with Pierce. The man is in. Pierce continues to make vegeburgers. The man then attacks Pierce. Small pieces of semi-precious vegeburger call fall from Pierce's mouth. The battle ends suddenly without the outcome. This is as good as a movie. <br /> <br />
