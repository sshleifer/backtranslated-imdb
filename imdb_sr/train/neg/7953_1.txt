While acting and directing can claim to have some merit - the story is a very bad film about Vietnam with the name of a country that has simply changed. At the very least, the movie would have some credibility, try to have some similarity with precision in equipment, weapons and tactics. No matter how wrong the interpretation of the behavior of the soldiers is the norm. Except for limited use as a silly propaganda about the South African defense forces, it serves only a small purpose - definitely no fun value. > <br /> Attempts by filmmakers - this is a way of not making a war film. Do some research, and you have some pride in your product.
