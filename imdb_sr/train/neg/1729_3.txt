... and how they bored you! Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films from the 70's that have been made without any actors any notes, unpleasant scenarios, sad directions and tireless desire to combine the "horror" with a comic comedy. This film is a palaeontologist who finds a drawing of a water dinosaur beneath the Crater Lake ... a meteor falling from the sky, and a watery dinosaur from the claim claim begins to terrorize and eat inhabitants around Lake Crater. Our local sheriff is concerned about all this. The larger part of the film - when the remains of the blood left behind from what we had imagined must have been a lunchtime dinner - is followed by the bumbling antiquity of two guys named Arnie and Mitch who run the boat. They try so badly to be ridiculous that we get the lines, looking at the business sign, Mitch tells Arnie: "You wrote the bait wrong, it's written B-A-T-E." The laughter here was pretty scarce. Then we see how they drill together and imagine the trunk to be a dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy watch out! The dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun in a bad way. At the very least, the lake is beautiful.
