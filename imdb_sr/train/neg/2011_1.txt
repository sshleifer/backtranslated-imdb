This film is pure guano. Mom always said that if you can not say something nice ... but even my mom would say that I have to do my part to warn others about this movie. desires would simply disappear. I hope Greg Kinnear has fired his agent .. from the cannon given to him by the script. After this, Ben Stiller is probably asking someone to say "There is still something about Mary." I've always been a fan of Vesa Studios, thank you for everything you keep wearing the mask through a movie, so people may not identify a movie with him. embedding the cinema of Batman's films, and then just losing something ... as a coherent plot and half of the decent effects. . If you want to see the effective adventure of the comics world, see "Chasing Ami". RUN! DO NOT GO TO "MISTER MEN"!
