You should know that I am the type of person looking at even the worst movies to the end, often from pure morbid curiosity. I even glanced at Leprechaun to the end before I gave up the temptation to get my eyes and hit them. You should also know that this movie was in my VCR less than half an hour before I made a quick jump for the stop button and ran back to the store just to get as far away from me as possible.
