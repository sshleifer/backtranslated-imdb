The extremely slow pace of the film was probably a direct explicit intention to convey what life was like growing up as a rural teenager in China. However, I found the combination of glacial slow 'plot' and general film style so impersonal that it was completely alienating, especially for Western audiences. Sometimes I had trouble singing some of the characters separately because they were shooting from such a distance. Two hours in, and I was completely gone. As someone who is not interested only in music, it is also very important for the history and culture of China (and Chinese cinema is not otherwise known), I could not engage with any character, and I did not find anything I could. The question arises: if I do not like it, who would love it? Give me Zhang Iimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the job of almost every other Chinese director I've ever seen. This hard work is not measured at all. I'm sorry that Chinese cinema is judging against this benchmark.
