Vov ... I picked up this at local Val-Mart after I read online that it was released early. I've been following this on the Internet for a long time and I had to buy a movie. Vov ... I think the thing that really hit me was editing, or lack thereof. Often appear characters (usually a narrator and anyone who is) with walking ... and walking ... and walking. I am not an editor, but I know you can cut between someone who leaves point A to show them that they reach point B. There is no need to show almost the whole trip! Wow ... Actually, in the end I felt like I'm sorry for the actors involved in this. It seems that they have not been given any rule what to do during the scenes, except that they look frightened or look happy, depending on which action should be added later. Vov ... Why it's decided to work almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM still uses miniatures sometimes. One of the most useful uses of the green screen in this movie is a constant nurse on (according to final credits) of the same group of people who represent citizens of different cities and cities, including London. Sometimes these people are coming and going, regardless of the angle of the frame or the distance from the camera. In one shot in London, it seems that at least two men, at a height of two meters, walked right behind the brother's narrator (starring Anthony Piana without his hamstring). Ever since GETTISBURG, I have not seen such a fake piece of hair on my face. Wow ... Why Timothy Hines talked about this movie the way he did it outside of me. It's a party, simple and simple. With the plus side (at least for me), she provided some of the most prominent funny-loud pieces of excitement I've seen for some time.
