I could not help but think of the mask: the ascent of leslie vernon (a massively even more incredible movie) when I look at it for realistic feelings and great innovative ideas. This could be a GREAT movie. acting is ... from some actors in order. from others ... it's really terrible. Other than the idea is great and the format is great. The story is also pretty good, though it often suffers from big blows to the logical mind. Do not ever think that's true? After all, it's a horror movie. I really want to see this redesign ... I really want to be a fantastic movie that wants to be. (and you can not really blame the minds behind the movie for this) this is obviously built on the shoe budget. and fk really hurts the movie as a whole. Excellent film. ... if he was to be replaced for some better acting and somewhat better foreign exchange. Whoever wrote it, you should go on, the great idea here.
