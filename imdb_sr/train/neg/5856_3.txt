Ð¢. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but it seems to be a film maker who can not mature with the changing of time, styles and fashion. It's as if it's stuck in the same old-fashioned film style. Actors are not bad, nor good. Anil Kapoor generally treats two roles of father and son, but the wrong script often makes it funny and pathetic. The river is good, but then - it is always good, and there is nothing more than that. She gives the best of what she is given, but she always does. In conclusion, nothing special. Raveena is OK, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing. This film is melodramatic, sometimes silly. Maybe the movie is delayed? Well, even then it would still be below the standard. The scenario is terrible, the movie is too big, and the story does not go anywhere. It feels like a film made in the early nineties, but this scenario makes it even older, the style is from the 1950s. I do not recommend unless you are a big fan of the actors.
