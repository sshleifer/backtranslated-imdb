Have you ever gotten that rust to kill an hour or two doing home work and watching a movie so badly that it confronts reason? Well, renting movies one weekend I see the art side for this and I see T-Rek. Knowing that the dinosaur on the package was T-Rek from the Jurassic Park, I KNOW that I have to rent this cause because I was in favor of a bad movie. I was not disappointed at least. Crazy scientists, secrets of the formula, a company that is more concerned about its wealth and shareholders than lives, and of course, big, poorly animated, T-Rek puppets. Was it our film movie, was there a scene clearly linked from other films? Not to mention Reka's hungry is never satisfied ... ever. How hungry he is outside of me, because he does not actually have a throat (Really if you look down your mouth when you eat, it's tight ... like a toy or something). Now, I like to watch incredibly bad B-films from time to time, because it reminds me of the better the film is. This one was hilarious. I'm not even sure whether it should have been a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes in which, without error, you laugh. Whether I blame the movie budget ... yes, but the acting did not help. All right, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, and for some women's roles ... when you cry, should not "tears" come out? Meh, I will not be angry at this movie, I knew what I was getting into and if you were looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend: Watch this movie, then watch Jurassic Park and then the Lost World back. Пишите г. Spielberg thanks the letters the next day.
