My address should be enough. It confuses me that a culture so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) would throw such a tape as a "nouvelle vague" cinematographic movement. By the 20th century France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and smart philosophy. But as soon as you hand them over to the camera, they start behaving like VOOOHOOO LOOK HOW TO BE! PLOT? THE THEME? PSHAV! WE AFFECT THE FILM WITH A ROLLED PARK DRIVING ON A ROLL AND A CIRCUIT! At least it's not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the back of the people's heads. Oh-la-la, the artiste's house.) No, Truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity. But also a safety camera in the fast-paced side. The two of them can not be different. Haha, just like all of you who are not working in a film school: I bet the vein just jumped from the side of your door. But do not leave without reading the last sentence of my review. Anyway, if you love French literature, hate this. People who love this movie probably have never read any other book except the jokes of Jack Kerouca or perhaps the "Guide to the gates through the galaxy." Or maybe they read the lyrics of The Doors and think that it's deep in motion. Whatever floats the boat. Ironically, this film inserts some (bad) allusions to Balzac, one of the best and most important writers who ever lived. Good try, Truffles. But you are not near the field. Avoid this film as a syringe that is infected with AIDS. If you are the type of person who likes to think, then you are following Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese masters Kurosava (IKURU), Kobaiashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA ). If you are an idiot, enjoy Truffaut, Godard and Andy Warhol. And for God's sake, push that vein into the neck. You look like a cabbage.
