Venders was great with Million $ Hotels. I do not know how he came up with this movie! The idea of ​​giving a situation after spt11 and looking at American society is hoping, it makes 2 out of ten. But this is not a film. Is it the best that one can do with a great idea (West-East conflict). Important things happen in the Middle East, and they are only published on the MAC screen * American fingers that are actually at the level of nonsense (because is only an ignorant of facts). And the most important thing is the idea given to religion is kinda funny to me. On the final scene, Lana says we just stay quiet and try to listen. I am praying. "The thing is not religion, but it ends with this: How will you see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray." "The lights are already shining on the truth, and nobody wants to see it." Ps: "My home is not a place. These are the people. "The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence, but it's lost behind this movie. (Incidentally, as" someone "is listed below, the American best guy is not the best, they are just" poor "and "hopeless" who apply for an army that needs a good salary that is not provided by governments!)
