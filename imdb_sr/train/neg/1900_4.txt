Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master of a car thief who is forced to return to the "game" when his younger brother faces death because he failed to comply with the order for British criminal boss Raimondo Calitri. The deal includes "raising" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will execute its punishment. So Raines quickly gathers a crew he can trust and asks about the task. But the police are on track, and some of the cars on the list are not easy. It seems almost impossible to finish it. She has a rather stupid role in 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Vill Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Oliphant. They all deserve better. Enough power to launch the Porsche 998 Turbo. The trouble is that this is largely the case of too many cars parked in a parking lot, many characters, insufficient flight. On the other hand, we have no doubt that this is Bruckheimer / Simpson's production, a rogue that spreads with loud sounds and whips of cheese, mounted on a scatter, and directed by a sword by Dominique Sene. Basically, it's a big budget remake H.B. Halici's indie movie from 1974, the same name, with a space that offers the potential for an adrenalin car based on a car. Unfortunately, the potential that has never been achieved. There is one or two strong impact moments, surely safe, but still pleasant. But if you excuse the dots, the film never comes out of the first speed, it's more a pleasure to work with your bunch of characters who are trying to make a stupid scenario {Scott Rosenberg}. Car fans will get something from it {cars are eye-catching, and fans of unintentional comedic films {check Ecclestone's moment of carpenter's grief}. But no, it's all very bad. 4/10
