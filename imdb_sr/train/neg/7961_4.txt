Five years after the original Creepshov, another inferior horror sequel was written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshov 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories are really original or stand out. The first story is the horoscope, the main story of a wooden Indian statue in search of the vengeance of murderers of its owners. The effects are really neat in this story, but it's too familiar to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the older shop owners. The second story, "Splav", is a story about Steven King. These are four teenagers who unconsciously spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon children will scream for their lives as a watermark in which each of them appears without obvious reason. However, instead of being uncertain, children are burdened by poor dialogue and the behavior of headless heads, which prevents us from really worrying about what is going on. In this segment there is also unintentional humor. The third and final story is "Hitch-hiker", which is actually a retraction that has been rearranged for Creepsh 2. The original story, Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film. It is then adapted for the famous episode of the Tvilight Zone, featuring Inger Stevens. "Hitch-hiker" works best of these three offers, but it's not without problems. Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse, who ends up with a jerk, or at least he thinks so. However, we do not know whether to sympathize with her or to condemn her. As with many average stories of this type, characters exist only to tell stories with their trades. The wrapping of a story with the bully looks a little unwise. Tom Savini appears as a "reptile" in this war. The good thing is that there were no further extensions. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
