The battle scenes play as slow-down Jackie Chan and the attempts of the smart are pathetic (the worst drama: "Guess what? This time I heard you are coming"). The stars are an uncomfortable pair: Brandon Lee, despite the horrible lines she has to say, actually shows the traces of charisma and charm screens - things Dolph Lundgren is completely free (at least in this film). Note to the director: in the future, please keep away from any love scenes, especially when your main actress will not make any nudity and you have to rely heavily on the double body. (* 1/2)
