I have a nice movie collection, and this is added. Number 274 to be correct. The title was the first to follow me. Splatter Universiti. I thought it would be a great horror movie. Did I ever make a mistake? Do not misunderstand me, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been much better. I love all the movies, but this one was one of those who smiled more than panic. Poor sound quality, poor performance and poor shooting arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 of 10 stars. The film is ideal for a good laugh. If you are looking for some of these films to make fun of you, then this is one!
