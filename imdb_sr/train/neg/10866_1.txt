Let's see where to start ... bad acting; I'm not sure if I would even call it, because it's more like reading without effort. The actors seemed not to be in their parts and they seemed pretty lifeless and voluptuous. There must have been a scene or two with nakedness, but that could not preserve this film from his lifeless characters. To make the main character a benchmark, it is an insult to people who really do it. The verses did not have a rhythm or flow and seemed more in line with meaningless attacks. Budget? Did this film even have a budget? It seemed like they spent less money than I saw in the IouTube video. Poor lighting, props, poor sound production. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that way. The story might be good that people were actually interested in doing it, but there was no life for this movie; I do not care who ordered it. In the past year I have seen some really bad shifts, and this is definitely at the very bottom. Do not waste your time or you will want to listen to this impartial review. Check the ratings, you will see that the 1s quickly surpassed the fluffed 10s with almost nothing in between. I wish I looked a little better before I spent my time. What a shit!
