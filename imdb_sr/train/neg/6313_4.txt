It is not often that we recorded a film about life in the interior of the city from the perspective of the Afro-Caribbean community in the United Kingdom, the last case that can be remembered was underrated by Babylon in the early 1980s. about Bullet Boi, a movie advertised as a British version of La Haine! So La Haine is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment gives this film the authenticity that has been missed in other British films lately, but my concern is that this film, unfortunately, ends with regret. The film intelligently deals with the escalating black issue of black violence, which unfortunately is all common in London, but I am concerned that filmmakers now use casting type in complication, as opposed to characters that are equally harmful. Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a movie that could be fun and inspiring for all of us, but unfortunately missed and created a movie that only intensifies the idea of ​​being a young black man in London the only future is violence and tragedy
