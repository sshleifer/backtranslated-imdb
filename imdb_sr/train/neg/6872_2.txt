This show had a pretty good story, but a bad dialogue. The main character was particularly boring. It is quite obvious why this show has been canceled, although, as most UPNs have shown, I never knew it existed until it was in syndicated re-broadcasts. and movies that made me think that the producers did not have the original idea in their heads. I have not commented enough. You must have at least ten rows of text. The special effect was not bad for the 2001 broadcast. Gnom was a nice character.
