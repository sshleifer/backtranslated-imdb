This film made me feel like I missed some important scenes from the very beginning. There were continuing errors and plots that stopped abruptly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Vhoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, in addition to always believing and respecting Danny Glovers's taste in his choice of role, "Grand Canion", for example. I just could not finish this film after what seemed like eternity, but it was probably just over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about characters that would make you sympathize with or sympathize with them, there were no emotions about this movie, and the clippings of their past were poorly decorated, confusing and unnecessary. What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama, and not as a comedy (although I think the comedy in this situation would be better because I like to watch white people who went crazy and began to act like complete idiots, laughter) became the loss of my $ 1 credit in the video.
