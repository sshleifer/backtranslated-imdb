CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most expressive, worst, over-all riots I have ever seen from France. There is nothing worse than the French production that is trying to overcome films made in Hollywood, and CR is the perfect example of such a horror / action / buddy flick. I almost stopped him halfway because I knew it would be nothing other than French guys trying to appear. The film starts promising, like some kind of spacious horror movie, but quickly changes genres, from horror to action to k-file type, to flute, which in the end means that CR is all that and none of it . There are so many clich√©s that at one point I thought it was a comedy. Painful dialogue and quiet pauses, with faded exits and disappearing only at the right exponential moments, I did it to myself. I thought that only movies made in Hollivood use this broken technique. The scene scene, with Vincent Cassel running for the killer, is so overly focused and overly done that it's almost a matter of beauty. The peak at the top of the mountain, with a stupid discovery of the killers with Cassel and Reno playing "comrades" like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, completely disrupted the little credibility that the film had until then. It's hard to believe that the director THE CRIMSON RIVERS also directed GOTHIKU, who, although she had problems, did not even come close to the horror of this overburdened, confused film.
