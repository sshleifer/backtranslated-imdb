The characters and characters are funny and barely qualify as a "plot" and "character." The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out of focus and blurred. The fact that Fulci filled the entire film with fog does not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence. The inconsistencies are quite entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, but he cares for a new guy for a minute of the screen and has a whole woman on the side. Although it shows its anti-social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in a poor b ***** who is just thinking about his job! . Maybe he destroyed his career, but he was not much stupid than Zombies. It's worth hiring if you like pushing Italian movies or desperately want a sword and a return or something bizarre. How do you sleep through someone who is pulled into a 2 meter pit from your head and screaming for help?
