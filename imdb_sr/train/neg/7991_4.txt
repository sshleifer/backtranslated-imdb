Color the story numbers and the central actors rescued by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply sensitive. It effectively records the delicate transition of the girl into adulthood, and very sensitive and inventively deals with cultural conflict, the main family experiences. Unfortunately, this good movie call is closed in a bespoke and extremely intricate plot that manages to engage in religious conflicts, a conflict over a road construction project, the sexual life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man living in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and so on. And all this does not even include the central action itself, which refers only to the hopes, dreams and frustrations of the two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point in their lives. In fact, I was shocked when I realized that the whole thing should take place during one summer (and that so much film was made in 1.5 hours!) Finally, the film is melodramatic, every action point is predictable, events that change in a large number of cases take place, then they are forgotten 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are extremely untrustworthy. The most shocking thing is that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a completely predictable "reversal") and then he is completely forgiven and the whole incident is forgotten. Similarly, the secondary character was introduced solely to die a few minutes later and provide another "uvrt". It's all completely mechanical, all the way to the end that neatly connects all ends (well, not everything, only those that the movie thinks you care about).
