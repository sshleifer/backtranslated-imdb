I thought that I was pretty melancholy, especially when I was watching movies that are very dangling and jerking. But not for this (which surprised me!) And I'm really surprised to see how people have so highly praised this film. In movies there are several disturbing facts: 1. Despite the guilt - Ben's real intent to save 7 lives in order to redeem his past, I find it disturbing that the film seems to encourage this type of suicide action. Some people can understand that this is a heroic action, and some think it's cowardly, in the end it was a disturbing action for me. 2. Movie story line is too dramatic, but the logic is too simplified. Medical blood type is needed to be an organ donor. At the end of the film, we learned that Emili had the last blood group that limited her chance to get donors for a short period of time. However, it seemed that Ben had a rare blood type, as well as the one that enabled him to be her donor and, despite the rarity of Ben's blood group, he was able to donate not only the heart, but also the kidney, cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases requires not only the alignment of the blood group but also the tissue antigen. 3. Why do doctors allow Ben's organs to donate despite the jellyfish poison that he used to kill himself? Perhaps I would over-analyze the whole story, because after all this is just a movie. However, some of the troubling facts mentioned above are hoped to help you review your plan to watch this movie. If you go to the soap film, go. But you go in search of intelligent entertainment, let this go!
