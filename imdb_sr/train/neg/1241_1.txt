This is the worst movie I've ever seen for years! Begin ridiculus and proceed in the same way. When something happens in this movie ... and the acting is worse. The ending raises him a little and saves the film from total failure. Mark Vahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. I'm sorry, Tim Burton Batman was good, but this is bullshit.
