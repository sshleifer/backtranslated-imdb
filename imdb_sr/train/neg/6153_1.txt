Let me begin by saying that I saw this film as part of the settlement. I was really bored on one nice day of 1997, so I drove to the movie rental store. I asked the officer what the worst film he had in the warehouse. Without hesitation, he took me to "Lucy Stiff." He told me he would give up a rent of $ 1 (he said it would be wrong to charge more) if I would promise to watch the whole movie. So watch how I did it for free ... This movie is horrible. Even divine. I do not have to go into the details of the plot, I read other reviews. Jokes do not make sense. The acting was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the protagonist was exhausting. You can try to view it as something you laugh, but it's so bad that it's not even funny that way. Avoid!
