This film was so predictable that you always hope that the suspect is a suspect innocence, and that there is still another big craft coming. But ... that does not mean it. It just keeps it staggering, and continues to ignore it. Mary found very incriminating evidence in him and still trusted him? And what was "catching the trap"? There was no trap. She faced him, said "I'm sorry, I have to kill someone." He went away and that was the end. They try to use other suspects, (for example, an older carnival girl at the end), but they are completely underdeveloped. In fact, all the characters are underdeveloped. They do not have depth, and the environment is simply weird ... who hangs in a recycling plant? His distraction and nothing is well developed. For example: When he left his place after having drunk a beer, he found the pictures and she ran out, and he caught her and ended up having sex in that car ... what was that? Her reactions are not shown. She was scared in the car as if she could have been raped - but then we only see her shower the next morning. Booooooooo It could be much better .. sooo much better.
