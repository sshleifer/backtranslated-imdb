Can I start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I really respect his work. I wish he was in several films that showed his talent. With these words, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. I should say that I put all my guilt on a bad scenario. Affleck is a very talented actress, Ves Bentley had a great performance in American Beauties, Melissa Sagemiller went well, and Eliza Dushku is currently a girl in Hollywood. I do not think any of the actors has entered the script, and I understand why. To say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an exaggeration. He had the twists you expected, but they just did not lead anywhere ... except they got confused. I just realized that the end is very anti-climatic, because there seems to be no sense or answer to any question I had about the story. I would like to be able to give this movie a good overview, but I can not. To be honest, the only thing I think will be daunting about this movie is that you paid for it.
