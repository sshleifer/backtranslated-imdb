Now I have recently enjoyed watching how I watch the hilarious comedy Bachelor Parti, one of my new favorite comedies, laughing until a series of movies is hurt. So I naturally wanted to see a sequel, hoping to have the same laugh, but instead, Bachelor Parti 2: The Last Temptation was made by the American Pie generation where it is without taste and defeats the purpose of the first film. Yes, the first film has a nakedness, but it does not appear in every scene. Also, the plot is exactly the same from the first, it's not always a complaint with me, but this may have been a little more original. The only thing is that I am glad that in this film at least the old actors from the original do not appear, because it would be stupid or really stupid. Ron and Melinda are engaged, after just 2 months of fun, they are all against. Melinda has a wealthy family, but they are pretty happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother, Todd is afraid Ron will take over his job. So, they go on weekends in Miami for a bachelor party, and Todd will make sure to catch Ron in a picture that will tell Melinda to change his mind about marriage. Mom's Eve 2: The Last Temptation has a couple of laughs here and there, but above all it fails to deliver what the first film has achieved. These guys, Ron's friends, were more disgusting than cute, except Seth, he was kind of ridiculous. The only nice faces except Seta are Ron and Melinda, everyone else just more or less affects your nerves. You want to watch this movie? Just watch Girls Gone Vild, that's the same thing but it does not try to pretend it's a movie. Stick to the original Bachelor Parti, this is a movie that will lead you to the tears of laughter. 3/10
