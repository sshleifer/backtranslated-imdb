Get SciFi Original Movie and mix a little alternative / revisionist history, and you'll get "Aztec Rek". It is obvious that Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, had to first capture the Tiranosaurus River and its partner. That's the goal of this movie. Considering the land, it could really be sucked in; The fact that it's just a kind of suction is the tip of the paper caps. There are several problems. To begin with, Cortes plays Ian Ziering. Even with black wig, Ziering as Cortes is convincing as Akl Rose playing Gandhi. And although Cortes wins the autochthonous nations of Mexico, the All-Hawaiian ensemble seems to be here in Asthma. Rejecting, T-Rek (i) look pretty good, although every time one of them gets a shot, it's just been healed out of CGI. And they die too easily; I suppose that if T-Rek was in real life, they could probably have been cut or at least wounded by some 16th-century rudimentary weapons. But it takes away something from the movie. There are also some graphic T-Rex-swallowing-human scenes, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they were doing well. There are many actions, and the whole angle of colonization prevails over the entire period, but does not overwhelm the angle of the dinosaur, unlike other recent SciFi Original dinosaurs "Varbirds". All in all, a central (but decent according to SciFi Original Standards) a film that is modest 4.
