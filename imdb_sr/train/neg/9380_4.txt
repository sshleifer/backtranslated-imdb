The last few weeks in the life of a dead woman in a rogue have been told in flashbacks. Like a rogue, the film wanders aimlessly and quite meaninglessly. Mona, a lazy, crippled, and drug addict, is not cute, and Bonnaire does not do anything interesting. Although there is some pretentious dialogue that attempts to explain why Mona chose this poor way of life, her motivation is never really clear. The episodic nature of the film, which includes some random characters, becomes tired after a while, which makes it look much longer than it does. It is also difficult to believe that an attractive young homeless person will not attract more attention to men.
