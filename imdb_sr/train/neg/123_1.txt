Oh, brother ... after I heard about this funny movie for fifteen years, all I can imagine is that old Peggy Lee song ... "Is that all there is?" ... I was just an early teenager when this smoked fish hit the US. I was too young to go into the theater (although I managed to sneak into Goodbie Columbus). Then the screening at the local film museum was shown - In the end, I could see this film, except that I was as old as my parents were when they decided to see him! ONLY the reason why this film was not condemned to anonymous sandstone of time is due to the case of obscurity caused by its release in the United States. Millions of people gathered in this stinker, thinking they would see a movie about sex ... Instead, they got a lot of big plans of tickling, defenseless Swedes, street interviews in mild shopping malls, rude political pretensions ... and poor co- care simulates sexual scenes with relaxed, pale actors. Cultural icon, sacred grail, historical artifact .. whatever this thing is, cut it, burn it, then put the ash into the lead box! Elite estates are still waiting to find value in their boring pseudo-revolutionary political spevings. But if there was no censorship scandal, it would be ignored, and then forgotten. Instead, the rhythmic title "I am empty, empty" has been repeated for years as a pornography (I'm curious, lavender - for gay movies, I'm curious, black - for exploitation movies, etc.) and every ten years or something rising from the dead, to be watched by a new generation of mammals who want to see this "naughty sex movie" that evolves into the film industry "... Yes, avoid as a plague .. Or if you have to to see it - you rent video and quickly switch to "dirty" parts, just to finish with. </ br>
