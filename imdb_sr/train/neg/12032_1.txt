This film was terrible. It was hard for me to watch this all the way. I did not understand the meaning of the film. What was the purpose of this film? Soundtrack was bad, the acting was bad, and the story was uncomfortable. The two main characters in the film were very boring and their dialogue was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among the members. I do not know the fact, but I guess most of the actors were the first. The film could easily be reduced to about an hour and a half without losing a plot. This shows how many useless scenes were in the movie. I'd rather have a channel for two hours of film. I want these two hours back! If you want to watch a good, funny family-friendly movie made by a bunch of mormons, take a look at Napoleon Dynamites.
