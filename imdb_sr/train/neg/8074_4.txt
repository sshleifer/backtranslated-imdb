As a cousin who gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has his heart in the right place, but he travels with a bad execution. Written / directed by Stephen Carpenter freely from other, better films, such as Jacob's Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Iour Eies). For those who have not watched any of these films, I will not give that space; Suffice it to say that it is not nearly as well resolved here than in these two top-of-the-line films. Melissa Sagemiller plays Cassie, who will go to college. Her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and former boy Matt (Ves Bentley), both friends, and Annabel (acerbic Eliza Dushku) are in a car accident after being killed by two killers (?) In transparent masks. She survives the wreck, but while attending college, she has visions of hospital temptations, and dead people reappear and disappear, leaving her in complete confusion: who is dead? Who's alive? What is real? The surviving souls have the appearance of a bad one - there, done - it, the discharge of a teenager who is filled with blood, spattered with blood. True, it has its share in scenes of killing stems (in abundance, repetition and dying), but at least trying to build uncertainty through ideas, and not cliches, unfortunately quite unsuccessfully. It causes confusion much more often than cohesion, because the story becomes dull, messy and unconnected near the key points of the mystery (predictable as it is). they are looking for a film that is more concerned with building an unfavorable facade of reality than supplying a body number. It deserves Carpenter for an attempt to create something beyond the derivative horror film; Too bad that he created a derivative psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves praise for showing power in the central show, actually developing her character and causing some sense of emotion such as Cassie. It's great that filmmakers try something else, but the film ends with a mixed bag and an unsuccessful experiment. 4 of 10
