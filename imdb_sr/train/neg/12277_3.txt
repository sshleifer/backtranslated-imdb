I found the "Arab plot" in a cheap bucket and I thought I discovered the lost goods. People, there's a reason you do not hear much about this movie. The plot is blurred, the pacing is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is lively as a plump, cold tofu, leaving her flat by the end. Even Sean Conner can not save this.
