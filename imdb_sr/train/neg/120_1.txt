When I first saw this film, I quickly noticed the actress who played Lucille Ball. Rachel's portrait of Luke is absolutely terrible. Lucille Ball was a stunning comedian with incredible talent. Thinking about a legend like Lucille Ball presented in the way she was in the movie is terrible. I can not believe from all the actors in the world who could play much better Lucie, the producers decided to come to Rachel Iork. Perhaps she is a good actress in other roles, but she plays the role of Lucille Ball is difficult. It's pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but at least you could find someone similar in appearance and talent. If you notice York's portrait of Lucy in episodes I like Lucia as a chocolate factory or vitavetavegamine, nothing is similar in any way - her expression, voice or movement. Pino play Desi Arnaz is terrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricki. He is small and lean, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is incredible. Although both Fred and Ethel were not similar, they were not as bad as Luke and Ricky's characters. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest you watch A & E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read a book from Lucille Ball itself, or PBS 'American Masters: Finding Luci. If you want to see a document, "Pre Laughter" would be a better choice. Casting Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better compared to this. At least there is a similar aspect, not nothing.
