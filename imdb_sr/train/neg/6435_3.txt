It's hard for me to believe that someone would put this film in the same context as the exorcist. Where the exorcist was subtle and dreadful, Stigmata was dull, clumsy, and too formative. for a spiral of patronizing exposure that makes it unbearable. My interest in this movie has reached the peak when compared to Ekorcist, and my visit to the official site has increased this interest. The website has had a lot of stories about "real" stigmas throughout history. However, the scene around the scene, the film is so obsessed with its search for "honesty" that initially becomes comical, and then it's extremely difficult to look towards the end. I began to doubt when the priest who was in charge of exploring possible miracles entered the beauty salon where our heroine cuts his hair and obviously flirts with the priests. begins to receive the early Christ (Stigmate) and is confused and upset by temptation. The priest was sent from the Vatican to investigate the case. Did Frankie have Satan, or a vessel for Jesus Christ? The only wonder in this movie is that it finally ends.
