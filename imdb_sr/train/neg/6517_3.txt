I went to the screening of this film and while he had a few moments who were laughing at me, he had some big flaws. First, it presents itself as a witty venture of a real distributor trying to find love in LA. What turns into depressive, narcissistic and unbridled craziness through the history of love and the professional life of a film director. The jokes are quickly worn, and you suddenly do not worry about the dates of this man progressing. The funny thing is that the director at the same time presents himself as an extremely unpleasant and very defective character, and then he expects us to be concerned.
