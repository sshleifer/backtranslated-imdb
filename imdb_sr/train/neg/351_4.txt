First seen on February 16, 2002. - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Misteri ?? / Thriller with too funny complications. Despite a highly talented acting, this film is too predictable and is simply underestimated. The film audience is not stupid, and I hope it will not constantly charge some of the pockets of stars, even though they are involved. We think this film will be something about Conneri's conviction against the capitol in the beginning, but it turned out to be nothing more than a standard, made for the audience, running the mill, we will never end up again, the thriller. We are embedded in every silly character in character, while shown to us when needed in the story, and we are ready to overcome this thing. Yes, there is good acting, especially Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in a psycho-supporting role, but the story does not work from the beginning to the very long-awaited end.
