Go and rent a movie immediately. It will be on the lower shelf in your local video and will be covered with dust. No one will touch him for years. It can even be a special $ 50! Worth ten dollars, I swear! Bui it! There are not many films that can be compared with this - the celluloid version of that shell formed at the bottom of the garbage after several years. Yes, I gave her '1', but it really deserves much lower. The 1-10 scale was not designed with such things in mind.
