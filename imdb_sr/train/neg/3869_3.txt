This is the second time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. These remarks come from someone who finds Kane and Ambersons as incredible, valuable films. However, the rest of Carey Velles, unfortunately, is scattered on material unworthy of his talent and too weak to withstand his film embroidery. And when a potboiler like Shanghai, the lack of anything important to hang your movie tricks, is just kind of sad. I could not tell you what he was researching here. It's all the same as Velle's incredible Irish failure; which requires a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the movie. Several Velles projects have become this bridal and baroque. Mr. Arkadin (select version, any version) is similar to a project. The material is unimportant. It simply can not bear the weight of all that. For a director who trades a drama based on reality (like here), he never feels any attraction to bind his beam to reality; or a coherent story. The scheme of murder for hire is ridiculous. Happiness to Velles, because Haivorth cut her hair and pulled it out. The camera loves it. She is the brightest, most expensive, sultry and exotic femme fatale ever put on the movie. But her betrayal comes so late in the film that it seems like a desperate decision, made so that the film has a genre that fits it. The movie can not be saved by noir convention in the last 60 seconds. When everything is said and done in L.F.S., convolutions are all for what?; to convince you that you saw something thoughtful? to give Velles more to do? make you turn your eyes? Velles has no sensitivity to the size of the story, nor does it directly tell the story. You wonder what Shanghai has to say to anyone who is not enriched by a billionaire, organizing a fourfold cross-plan of killing, or fans of fans in film concepts devoid of meaning or content. Prepared, meaningless, unbuttoned.
