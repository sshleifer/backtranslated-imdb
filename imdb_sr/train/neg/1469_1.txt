Like watching movies about neighborhood summer camps, the "Indian Summer" is a boring challenge to sleep. Eight camper alumni are barely represented, when incredibly boring flashbacks begin for signs that we do not know anything about. Fine actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Pakton are completely lost in this film. Observing one camper that "everything looks so much less than I remember it" is repeated at least ten times, enough to rotate. Expected jokes are neither funny nor original, unless you think that short film is a real "urlik". This film was a great disappointment with regard to a lot of engagement. The "Indian Year" did not make me nostalgic, just sick. - MERK
