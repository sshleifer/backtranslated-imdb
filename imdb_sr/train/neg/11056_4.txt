I was so disappointed in this film. I do not know much about the true story, so I was eager to see him playing the movie and learning about a small part of history. With such a powerful true story and great actors, it seemed like a safe combination. Well, somewhere the script has failed. It was so scattered - is this film about his childhood? his love life? his disability? his ability to speak? his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there's a way to get involved in a good story, but this film was not. I stayed cold by seeing characters that were unacceptable not because of their disabilities, but because of their personality. Other small fluke: 1. Sound recording with heavy arms. It's the seventies - we've already got it! 2. If he is such a phenomenal public speaker, why were we not treated more than a piece here and there - even then mostly in assemblies?
