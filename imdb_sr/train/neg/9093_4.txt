I've seen this movie for the first time and I've never heard of it before, probably because of a bad message. First, the direction itself is pretty good, the actors are well played and CGI (I'm not a CGI fan) is magnificent. But it just does not make a movie. There is no story at all, no messages behind wonderful exploited talents. Or I have to remember people, the art of the director is not only your vision, but also how to tell the story. And this is what lacks for 7 minutes. There are only 4 ratings.
