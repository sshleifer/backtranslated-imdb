The only thing worse than a surfer without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves. For viewers who love surfing this movie will be a gigantic disappointment because the total number of minutes of surfing is struggling to reach three. perfect wave, but for any wave. J.C. (Sean Pertvee) is an old surfer who flirts with her girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as there will be a grown-up bliss with the woman she loves, three old friends appear surfing and persuading him to hit the beach looking for monstrous waves on Bone Yard. The trouble is that there are no waves all the way to the end of the movie, so most of the stories are scattered in the wacky array of unrelated events on the beach. The acting is mostly central. Sean Pertvee has a few comic moments, but mostly his acting was earthly. Evan McGregor was decent as a wild man who deals with drugs, which is by far the most interesting and weird character of the crowd. Probably the most entertaining performance was reversed by Peter Gunn as Terri, who turned his corpulent body into an uninterrupted view. Catherine Zeta-Jones was as sexy as usual, but her character did not have enough flesh to show her many acting abilities. There really are not many comments here. I rated it 3/10. It's a real robbery on the beach.
