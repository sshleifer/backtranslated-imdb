When I was a kid, we were always babysitting, and we always rented a movie or watched a movie in the cinema. This is one of the films we watched. This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen, I think it could be a movie of Valt Disnei Pictures! Mars is thrown to the ground, turns into a man, makes friends with a man, and tries everything that can be returned home. But he is hindered by the wonders of the Earth. The only good comment that can be given is the selection of actors, Back to the Future Christopher Lloyd as a Martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurlei as Brace Channing and Daril Hannah as Lizzie. But in addition, it's totally shit. Bad!
