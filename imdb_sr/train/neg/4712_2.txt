This show is probably the biggest, most arduous, most dangerous steam that I've seen in children's programs that actually become successful. The main character, Johnny, while I realize that he should represent an ordinary child, is not sympathetic or even tolerable. The jokes are lame, exaggerated (i.e. "Wow! I did not see this coming" "Gag. Come on, it was not even funny the first time. It's not even sweet" and it has no form of primitive wit or inspiration. it's easy to look ugly, while children are not particularly critical of artistic talent, they still prefer sweets, I can not stand watching the show, because in some ways, the artistic style is just ... rude. . I can not just say that this gets so much time to broadcast. While I understand that no the stalagia can be a little irrational and I should not hope to return ... I really do not have old cartoons. Return the Dekter's Laboratory, The Poverpuff Girls ... everything except this shit. I suppose it's just a wish. /> Simply, I advise you not to waste time on this show. I believe that really good cartoons can be enjoyed by great children, and it does not interrupt.
