Boris Karlof is Matthias Mortel, a dying, lonely old walnut who lives in the Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his doctor: "Do not try to be a Doctor Doctor! I'm sick of it!" He calls his nephews and nephews to his home and warns them that they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness "reducing the brain" (?) *** SPOILERS *** Morteval / Karloff ending dying, and killer "toys" (designed by his dead brother) begin killing relatives. The mini-top fires the real bullets in the face, the knight of natural size in armored attacks with an ax and a dance sheik that stab people with a knife. One guy who is strangled makes some funny faces. In the end, Julisa and her boyfriend find Karloff, who is still alive and hiding in a dungeon where the steel gates are closing out of the room. She plays recurring music on the theme of the organ (the type of lethal rush used for the killings), the brother spirit begins to speak ("The whole house will go with me!"), And the villa rises in flames. This senseless disorder is too dark, boring and stupid the dialogue never fits with your lips.
