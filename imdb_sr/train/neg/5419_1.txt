Why do filmmakers always go against the author? I think that things need to be cluttered by the interests of viewers, but look at Anne from Green Gabell. They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply wonderful. I can not believe they chose to merge three novels together for Anne Avonle in such terrible confusion. Look at everything they missed doing it. . . Paul Irving, Little Elizabeth, widow, Vindi Poplars. . . and Anne on college year, for God's sake! Would not it be wonderful to meet Priscilla and all the other gangs of Redmond? Kevin Saliven should have taken things for one movie, instead of confusing them all and combining characters and events the way he did it. This movie was good, if you leave new novels !! But L.M. Montgomery is a wonderful job, something that should not be denied. This film was lowered after seeing the successful way Anne of Green Gabels had revived.
