This grainy film has a cult character and one of those features you just had to see. It may be hard to believe, but there is a rural community in Southwest Arkansas, Fouca, who knows that the legend is true. This story is told in the documentary style of Vern Stierman's storyline and captured at real locations in conversation with real people. The legend changes with the story, but during the late 60's and most of the 70's, Fouke's visited a creature similar to Bigfoot that traveled Boggi Creekom. Long pressed with three fingers and standing at more than 7 feet, this bold creature occasionally caused damage and frightened the "beebers" from most communities. I personally crossed the Boggi Creek Bridge in 1974, and the coat on the neck returned. Of course, it was about 1 hour in the rain. As I arrived at Shreveport, I was laughing.
