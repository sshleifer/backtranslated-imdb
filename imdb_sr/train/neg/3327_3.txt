Two sisters, their twisted brother and their cousin have problems with the car. Then, they are happening at the home of Dr. Hakenstein, who need to use the body parts of three nubile young women to experiment in order to bring his deceased lover back to life. They're telling them they'll help them get home in the morning, so they'll spend the night. Then a good doctor starts working in this low-budget horror comedy. I discovered that this is a little fun, that I can not get out of the way at all (I encountered Netflik instant view & streamed it to the throat 360), but better then I expected it to be for Troma acquired film. Most of the humor does not work, but these are still some parts that made me smile. Plus late, the great Anne Ramsey has a small part, and she was always a treat for watching.
