With MASSIVE advertisements that appeared on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and that guy, my son was bothering us to see him. Between DVDs and theaters, I have already seen so far from exceptional (Incredibles, Shrek) to really bad (Vall-E, Brother Bear). But this was the worst movie I ever saw, kids or children. It was "when will this stupid thing end?" type of experience? OK, it is focused on young children (or better - it raises the intelligence of anyone over 3 years), but I have never seen anything so predictable, repetitive, and slow. Then when you finally feed, but it's easier for the film to finish, there's this bizarre thing in the end that you think is the setting for a joke, but there is not one - it's serious, although it's hard to say what they are trying to achieve. 3-D effects ... yes, if you have never seen a Vievmaster, they are a big thing, otherwise (if you look at the screen without glasses, it seems the same process). Even my son was bored to the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. Bad in every way.
