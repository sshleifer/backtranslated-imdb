Basically, cruel intentions 2 are cruel intentions 1, again, only poorly derived. The story is exactly the same as the first (even some of the lines), with just a few exceptions. Actors are more unknown and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and attracting me to watch it, I felt dirty in the end, because it can be compared to watching a soft-core pornography. I'm not sure if I blame some idiotic lines on actors or writers ... and I always feel bad talking about it, because I know how hard it is to work both, but it was basically a two-hour time of losing my of life. It's literally amazed that some movies are made, and that's not an exception ... I can not believe they would make a third.
