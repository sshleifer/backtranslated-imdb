S.I.C.K. He really is in favor of So Incredible Crappi I killed myself. There was absolutely no acting. The best part of the entire production was the artwork on the cover of the box. Budgeting this movie was enough. The recording was a sub-narrow street. The production seems to be underground recording for mafia hits. The products used in this film were stolen from the clothing store. The ending was so predictable that we should move too fast for the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book for this movie, I'm sure it's better. I would avoid this at any cost. I enjoyed the intimate scenes that they made with the whole movie worthwhile. Just kidding.
