Anyone interested in science fiction should start with the basics. Everyone is saying that STAR VARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to start, which is fine, but the truth is TERMINATOR and this film, SOILENT GREEN, is far better choice than these series. SOILENT is probably the best-kept secret of science fiction. It remains one of the largest, but most memorable films, but the impact of its environment is becoming more realistic with every day. Charlton Heston overestimates his role, but still works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, mostly uses SOILENT GREEN more than anyone else, and his final scene touches. is an incredible fortune (a small jar of strawberries costs $ 150). Soilent's Chief Executive Officer was killed and police detective Thorn was on the case. Secret Green is not a mystery if you explore a movie. SOILENT is pleasing to watch, but the whole scenario is a joke. It's as cheap as the entire production. The screenplay and drama of the actors made the film, but they were completely ridiculous. It seems that all the morons and nobody knows the rules, especially the policeman Thorne who likes to just enter the flats of people, studies around shamelessly and steals everything he wants. The character interaction keeps your attention on the film, but you still realize that SOILENT GREEN is shit. Pleasant piece if you have time, but do not expect anything more.
