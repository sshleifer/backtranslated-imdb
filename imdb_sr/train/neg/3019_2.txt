how can you grasp her difficult, glamorous, violent story about the bounty hunters with * that accent? It's absurd. In addition, the visual style of the director is tortuous and cunning, the action is shallow, boring, confused repetition of a gangster movie, and acting is inconclusive. The film introduces new characters throughout the entire movie and is said to be in a fragmented flashback - mostly out of order - it seems only to make you nice and confused. The film ever shows you things that do not happen and later say "that it did not really happen, it happened" - you see (apparently) the murder of the (fake) 'first lady'. What then did we see the first, wrong, sequence of events? Terrible choice in casting, intricate, messy plot and overhead style that causes headaches. 1/5.
