This quasi-j-horror film follows a young woman as she returns to a childhood village on Shikoku Island to sell a family house and meet with old friends. She finds that a daughter of a village priest drowned a few years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then find out that Saiori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. Connections between dead and alive are already decreasing, and friends and villagers see ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good in this movie. Unlike stellar J-horror movies, uncertainty does not actually build, the result does not seem overly dangerous, and the end of the boundaries on the absurd. for a long time, so it borders with the moss. Sometimes you get this in poor Asian restaurants or cook your white rice for too long. In the end you eat it, because you need it with a meal, because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but almost destroys the meal due to the sticky, ineffectiveness of all that. 3/10 http: //blog.mispace.com/locoformovies
