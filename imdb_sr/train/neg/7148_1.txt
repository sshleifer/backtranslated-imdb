Before I watched this movie I had very low expectations and I just went to see cars. In the end I even complained about it. The land almost does not exist. Character development does not exist. There was so much clich√© and so much force in the film that I could only watch and wonder how it was even released. If not for exotic, I would not even rate this film. 1. The attempt of a coherent story is destroyed by the pure absurdity of this elite cult of race and ridiculous characters that make up his members. In fact, the action of the film is so predictable and simple that an average child can predict the majority of the story. Bad acting, bad shop, bad jokes, bad movie. You can not see it. Instead, play Gran Turismo HD and it will saturate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad taste.
