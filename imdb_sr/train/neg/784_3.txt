Despite positive reviews and projections at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. The story is very similar to other films where a teenage immigrant family needs to overcome many common personalities of her age, as well as to fight against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does this by selecting a kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, who for some reason falls in love with her, she faces her problems and victories. In Girlfight's boxing, Band it as Beckham's football, and now it's Kung Fu. But Fighter is a much worse product than the two, it was simply embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan, an actress who plays the role of a teenager, may be able to do many things, but one thing she can not do is work. Her presence on the screen is anemic and awkward, dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions, are terrible, her body and face language are amateur actresses, badly referred to by the director. The rest of the actors are a bit better, but they just can not preserve this clich√© film with stereotyped characters and shallow complication. Apart from a few relatively good moments, this film has nothing new or interesting to offer. Even the fighting in kung fu is not the reason to look at this, it's already so boring. The slowdown was really unnecessary, choreography was basic and lacked inspiration, and most kung fu scenes were just training or standing in all sorts of kung fu positions, not fighting. Not to mention how funny it looks when a small and skinny girl struggles with big and muscular boys and refuses them from her legs. The only reason why this film is noticed at all is because it is European. It's very easy to publish this film - The first martial arts film from Denmark, but do not be deceived, it's not. It's just a drama about stupid teenagers and her problems, which, by the way, are not very convincing. Bad movie with unpleasant lines, acting and story.
