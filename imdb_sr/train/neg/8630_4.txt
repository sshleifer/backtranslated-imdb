I know that in this episode there are other things besides what I will talk about, and in fact I think it has some virtues; for example, the fact that we received a very negative opinion about Jin, when we saw the Sun's reflection in the "House of the Existing Sun," we see Jin's side of things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. But in this story there is an element that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly weakened my enjoyment throughout the episode. So far, in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it was suggested that the Sun's father is someone who is enriched with murky, illegal methods. I thought he might even be a mafia boss; Mafias are working in Korea, just like in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable option. However, in this episode, we find out that the Sun's father is actually the chief (or executive director) of the Korean automobile company, and that what Jin was doing was a physical attack on a government official (who will actually be killed) on his behalf. Perhaps I am particularly sensitive to the fact that I accidentally work in the automotive industry, but I would say that SPECTACULARLI is offensive and racist even to suggest that such things happen in Korea; these enormous serious companies such as Hiundai or Kia (which must be a model for this fictitious automobile company, because they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) work with these mafia-like methods, instead of any normal automotive company Vest. it's just unbelievable for the writers to have a chance to write something like that in the story, and that there was no noise in Korea. I feel like a foreign "Buy an American!" propaganda, showing foreign car companies as criminal, unreliable, third-world.
