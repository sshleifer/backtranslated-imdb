I'm sorry that people call kamal hassan 'investaaiakan' maybe I'm investing for them tollivood! comeon guis .. this movie is a thriller without excitement. Get out of your investment and just watch some high-end trillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lamb. <technically good, but the style over the substance of the kamal does not look like a cop, there is no excitement whatever pulls and bored to the end maybe save 3 valuable hours of your life if you skip watching this movie. Kamal in its best edition is the best in tollivood
