I saw this movie a few days ago and I jumped through the terrible parts. I have to admit, it's pretty decent ... until I started to think about what the characters were saying. Logical Problems: 1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be pretty fit, does not give any sound until he is killed. Do not you think he tried to take the killer at least? 2. When it is noted that the teacher of the gym is "SOOOO in love with Lis", I almost screamed on the screen. When your best friend's family was killed by a teacher who was in love with her, you do not give such comments if you have half your heart. 3. As soon as Nash asks uncle how many exits are in the house, and his uncle catches it that could get to danger, it would not be wise to be Donna, boyfriend, aunt and uncle pulling in a car drive away, far away , then the house is attacked by the HRT and the police so that the killer has no way to get out? <br /> <br /> I could go further. And on. And on. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters were not sufficiently profiled to really feel empathy when they were slaughtered and there were too many mistakes. However. > This movie can be good for teenagers, or young couples who just want a fun evening out. If you do not take into account all the fools, it's the main movie.
