These sophisticated swords and film flying poems are a decent early talent display by John Woo. The cinema is great and some of the sword papers are truly remarkable. Unfortunately, the movie deals with boring stories and obviously low budgets (check some of the combat scenes if you suspect me). Still, it's worth seeing it, especially if you can catch it in the letterboked.
