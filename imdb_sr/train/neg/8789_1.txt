I checked this on a DVD for one dollar, so I could easily smile as this horrible movie unfolds. Every time you think it can not be worse, it's inevitable. The acting is absolutely horrible. The plot does not make any sense. The title of "cold revenge" in the American DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. Action scenes are obviously taken in their first shot. There are many mistakes in the dialogues that indicate that it simply does not intend to do the second attempt at least to try to make the movie bearable. I can not remember seeing a worse movie and occasionally getting bad - well, except unstoppable with Veslai Snipes. No, I'm deceiving myself, while it's bad, Unstoppable deserves the best prizes for Oscar in comparison to this piece of shit.
