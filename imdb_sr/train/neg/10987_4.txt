I really enjoyed the novel Margaret Atvood 'The Robber Bride', and I was delighted to see the movie version. A woman frames a boyfriend for his murder, and his friend, a former journalist, tries to clear his name by checking a crazy friend of a dead woman. Luckily, the film script fixes Mrs Atwood's awkward plot, focusing on the story of these two men, the victims of women who have overturned ... Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I am pretty sure they are completely fictitious for the film, I will eat the cover for the dust of my hard copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to carry a movie. Zenith's manipulations are not interesting if we do not see them happening to a man, and the life of a man is screwed. Roz, Charis and Toni tell their stories - a man. Because it's not important that a person does not hear them. All I liked in the book. It hurts me to push them aside for the man's story. I do not usually look for feminist corners in the media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as it is. If I had not read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie much more. So, if you love a cop and a former policeman, and you want to read more about them, you are not lucky. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy the magnificent prose and characterization, subtly lay the knot through the plot. It's the same story: the film dug it, burned it and sprayed it with a man's fear. It's like Zenith's vengeance Margaret Atwood.
