This foolish film is a piece of shit and boring like a repetition of a full house. For all people who want to see an excellent, exciting and cool horror movie, you should not even think about looking at this bunch of meaningless work. in my opinion. I have one question, what did they mean? Make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad actor 5) bad directing and last but not least bad scenario. I mean, I'm not like I'm quarreling about every movie, but I was disappointed when I watched it. This film should be banned in the box, locked and sunk into the sea. So, please do not do this again, please, please!
