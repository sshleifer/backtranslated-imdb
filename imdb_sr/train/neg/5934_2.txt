I would not consider myself one of the greatest fans of Leonardo Cohen. However, he is an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. By far the most valuable element in this documentary is Leonard's thinking about his life and career. Heat and humility. Unfortunately, most of the musicians who participated in the concert did not discuss Leonard's music / literary ways. The exceptions were Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton, although Leonard highly values ​​Rufus Vainrights interpretation of his songs. who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect with him. There is much talk in this regard, but the viewer is not drawn into the person of Leonardo Cohen. This failure is particularly noticeable in interviews with Bonn and Edge. They see Leonardo as a special icon, but they can not translate their exact value to Leonardo Cohen. Cooperation with U2 is farce. The entire registration live looks like an accelerated job. And as in the whole film, only Leonard Cohen remains his part and can tell about his work. The complete installation and script is very similar to the higher education project. The use of effects such as echo, slowing or flashing images are poorly placed. Some of the work on the camera is sad. Part of the song is hardly reminiscent of any associations that I might have expected. Sometimes the author of the film seemed to add psychotic elements to the film. Perhaps a reference to his former use of LSD. Some unintentional humor ... at one point Leonard says that he influenced the music genre. At first, you can not think of the name of the genre, until eventually it says it's punk, the punk players really picked up his music. The next scene in the film is a live cover "I can not forget" ... "I can not forget, I can not forget I can not forget, but I do not remember who"
