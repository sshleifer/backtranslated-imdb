It's a shame for the shame that a nice actor like Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to be thrown into this piece of torment. The film was not only bad, but it was horrible and of no quality. It seemed that the plot, (was it one?) It was not where. The Russians have been foolishly killing or killing games, and the rest of the actors should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances. I quit 3/4 times and turned it off. "1" is terrible only because there is nothing lower. Do not waste your time on this, you will not miss anything.
