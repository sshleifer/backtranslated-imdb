I mean, what group would you sing about a crazy car? So what if there are ten, it's too immature that a little child sings about my women seriously! And the name is pretty rough, naked brothers? just because they take off trousers ??? HOW I CREATIVE. I do not understand why they need a TV show. I think most artists do not need a TV show about themselves, especially a bunch of naked brothers. Heck how many are in the group. And what about the movie? Jesus, Nick used to be the light of my years of growing up, but seriously. Many parents would not allow their children to watch this especially with the name of the band Goli Brother, his stupid, non-creative show that should not be broadcast on television.
