An interesting change from the first. there was more mystery in this movie than in the first one. Even when it ends with the question of what happened who was the killer. There are several good parts of the film, the first half starts slowly, and then the pace is accelerating in the last half. The whole movie is pleasing. The story is 22 years after the events that took place in the first film, Norman Bates is from asylum and back to Bates Motel, but when a woman who claims to be his real mother appears, things start to go wrong. Perkins again plays the old Norman, and the scene was great at the end, he swung it was very difficult.
