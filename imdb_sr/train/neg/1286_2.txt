How does Scott love kittens in purple? Very, very carefully. Now I have a clear advantage over many other reviewers in being born in Scotland. Too many Americans seriously understand this simple nonsense. , as Orwell had. Jessica Lange has the accent that the production of "Brigadoona" based on amateur dramatic society Vells - must be rejected by the way. Liam Neeson - apparently popular among ladies - wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose grandmother once left the train in Edinburgh Vaverley. And Auld Enemi? Where would the Scots without them hate and blame for everything? "Robin Hood - Prince Thief" looks like a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison. And Alan Rickman was at least funny.
