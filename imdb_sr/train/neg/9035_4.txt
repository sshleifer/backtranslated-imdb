Born in the sixties, I grew up watching TV "Movies of the Week" in the early 1970s and loved the nasty films that were routinely screened, including "Crovhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald", "Satan's School for Girls", "Kolchak Night stalker, etc. But this one is just stupid It's obvious that the writer is trying to capitalize on the terrible Manson murders a few years earlier, and Dennis Weaver from "McCloud" and "Duel" fame as a father who leads his family on the beach. encounters hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize their families The reason for this has never been explained, and Veaver's pacifist attitude is hard to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, beat them, or something like that, just do not sit there and brag about it. The show is pretty poor, the story is incredible, etc. Susan Dei looks sweet in bikinis, but that's all. Ignore this if it's broadcast on TV.
