This was the first time I saw it when it was selected as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and I thought it might be interesting. In addition, I am a fan of MacFlyscher's work, and this began with the look and feel of his cartoon from the 30's. With both of them, I thought it would keep my interest. I was wrong. Just a few minutes in, and I had a rewind button in advance. I went through it for about 15 minutes and thought it was it. After that I read some other reviews here and realized that I did not give him enough chance. I shot him again and I looked at him. There are 75 minutes of my life, I'm not coming back. I can not believe there are no more bad reviews. Personally, I think that's because it's hard to get at least 10 comments. How much is the way to say that this is a waste of time? The film comes across as if it was made by a few kids who are ready to blame the world and think they can chest, curses, and vomit jokes. The characters are flat. The "Swinging the Alphabet" parody is a chromatic, essentially calibrating melody, passing through A-E, striking an obvious "F" swear, and then I have no idea where to go. Traveling through the intestine to the expected landing does not work for the first time, let alone the next. The whole movie is what you would expect from someone who is trying to "extract South Park" Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and what is not funny. This can be fun if you are tall. Otherwise, it is not.
