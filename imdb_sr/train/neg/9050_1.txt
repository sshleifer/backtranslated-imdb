I saw this film in its entirety in the sixties and seventies, that, it was creepy, and could have been an adventurer of the series "Faces of Death" that was popular in the 80s and 90s. Bearing in mind the state of the so-called "education of drivers" these days, this should be looked at for everyone who is preparing to learn to drive. When you see violent death in all your mountains and horrors, surely (if you have any sensibility) you get a more true perspective on the responsibilities that you need to drive safely, what a moment of thoughtlessness or carelessness can the driver do. I worked for Bell Telephone in the 70s and 80s and at one point he was in charge of keeping the security class. I found this film in the company's library, I showed it in a session, a number of people got sick and had to leave the room! Unbelievably, most of them later said: "I did not know that a car accident could have been so terrible!" This film, and others, "RED ASFALT", is certainly a reality in its most picturesque form. I will never forget that, I would just like to find a copy when my children attended "driver ed" in high school!
