This film is a 90-minute Ramones concert with short periods of nonsense and absolute boredom. What is this high school? Unless you are a great Ramones fan, NO and I repeat DO NOT waste time like me. This is extremely invisible from start to finish. This film should be called Ramone Fever. It seems everyone likes this movie. There is no plot in this movie. As for teen comedians, you scratch the bottom of the barrel with this.
