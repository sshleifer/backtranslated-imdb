This movie is really stupid! I saw it as an 11-year-old, and even then I thought it was pretty funny! I would recommend this film only to children under the age of 12. I really did not care about that, but I think she answers some very good questions that children must be aware of, such as: 1) Does the money buy the money of happiness? 2) Do I lie to (parents) about things that I do not think would be approved? 3) Does the money buy friendships? 4) Is everything money? 5) Should I not tell my parents when someone tries to hurt me? Of course, these are very unrealistic situations, but I think that if parents talk about these problems with their children, you may also need to watch this video to show / scare your children that lies have the potential to hurt you.
