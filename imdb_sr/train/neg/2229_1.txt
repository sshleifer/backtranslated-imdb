Maybe this is not fair, because I only succeeded in half the film. One of the few films I really could not watch because of lameness. The act is terrible, working with cameras is horrible, the action is ridiculous and the whole film is unrealistic and messy. For example - during a coke deal, coke is just kept in a briefcase - I'm not an expert, but I think people put it mainly in the bag. They use the same stupid sound effect. every time you throw a blow (that's what's above the 'hot' sound) and use pistols with sound effects. The worst movie ever.
