High heels are tricks. They can raise women (or men who redeem themselves) at newly discovered heights, give a sharp attitude about style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be dangerous pain in the foot that will inevitably lead to travel, falling and extreme tragedy. Tacones Leanos is more a disappointment than a stylish high pillar. The Almodovar drama of mother and daughter is certainly modern, but in terms of complication it is a creepy and busy affair full of confusing, complex characters that never fully get involved or make sense. A few moments of comedy, Tacones Leanos is simply not interesting. The best thing comes at the beginning in the marvelous shameful case of the murder that a child has taken. From this brilliant piece of black comedy things are rising, but then the film comes to the heel. It has enough solid acting performances and there is some stylish, artistic direction that you would expect from Almodovar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos is not an impressive piece of Spanish film. With the story of murder, shovba, femininity, a broken relationship between the mother-daughter and the person who was alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informant, this could have been a melodramatic force. Instead, it's bad. High heels stand safely.
