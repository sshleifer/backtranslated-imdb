this movie has everything; The smart work of the camera, which resembles martin scorces, or oliver stones, the action of 'heat', the explosive action of the jerry bruckheimer film, the witty tarantino scenario and the epic sense of the word 'godfather' Judge reinhold the figure showing the fire temperememt, but also shows the true emotional depth and intensity. His performance reminds me of Robert Niro's portrayal of a powerful la motto in a wild bull. Action scenes are really astonishing, because since when the bull had a film, such a high octane, yet modern scene of the car was shown. Special effects push the limits of technology and filming up to their limits. The Independence Day set a standard that clearly coincides with this film and outperformed it. Overall, great acting from her list (such as the Oscars Night Entertainment Party!), Elegant location, capture action, and tight script.
