The name "cult film" is often given to movies that continue to appear, or are sold in the home movie format, for more than one generation after they were first published. Superchick, first published in 1973, is now coming to this category. Cultural status is largely a result of the constant interest of women who consider it an early and effective feminist film. Despite the "Supervoman" connotation, "Superchick" is not a character from a cartoon but a very competent young lady who works as an air hostess - a career option which in the 1970s was considered one of the most glamorous openings for every girl , which also allows her to mimic a traditional matel who has a wife in every harbor. Since she has the status of a black belt in karate, she is in a position to make it clear that she is very satisfied with her unmarried life and in no way is obliged to any of her big male fans. This film is a situational comedy that avoids the generally much shorter live appeal of an open fox. His attraction to feminists is enhanced and the peak in which our hero uses her karate skills to avoid abduction and save all other travelers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. In order for this film to attract men and their partners, the director wisely ensured that he freely sprinkle with his sweets. Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light comedy for watching, which you will soon forget after watching. It's so unforgettable that it's likely to be just as pleasant if you look back in a year; despite his age, he can maintain his cult film status for some time. However, dialogue and acting would make it difficult for this film to score more than 4/10.
