Once I used Vesle Snipes' name as a trail to look at a new, unverified film in which he appeared. So, for the first time, my recommendation of the Snipes-Method movie has failed. Totally. First I should come here to see these reviews. Snipes should be ashamed to allow his otherwise serious effort to get lost in "Contractor". One of my worst fears of flirting came to a bitter accomplishment. I was afraid that a faint, murky, pseudo-documentary, "uncontrolled" direction and style of editing (first brought to the attention of Paul Greengrass "Bloody Sunday") might have propagated other films. Greengass's painful style then led to nauseating new heights in the last two of Bourne's trilogy of films. My fear has happened. In my opinion, these films are made very bad by these methods that cause disease, which mistakenly replace the blur for "improving the action". But "Bourne Franchise," as Greengrass likes, calls his cow in cash, apparently persuaded others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in search of quick, big money. The action should be clearly photographed and presented, not just to indicate poor, lazy cinematographic techniques. The "Contractor" goes so far as to imitate "The Bourne Ultimatum" in silent sounds. , in the hope that their juvenile (seemingly rated) audience can not feel them. For example, if I hear a copper radio that snaps "Iankee-Romeo" one more time, I'll just scream. The chances are good, I will not hear again: surely I will not see the "Performer again". I recommend to those who have not yet seen the "Contractor": just satisfy the calmness that this deficiency gives to your life. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10; I am tempted to reduce it to 1.
