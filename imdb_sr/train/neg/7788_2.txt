I noticed that all the other reviews of this film mention "healthy" and "fun". These people often have to leave the house. I do not know why shillings for this rude, soulless piece without a brain. Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent, and his incompetence surpasses only his co-star Pamela Austin, the former model (another reason to forbid the battering practice of applying talented models to a ruthless mobile public, violating a habit that unfortunately continues today). Good support (Terri-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortion, among others) is trying to get some sense out of this, but without success. I noticed that two directors share a loan, although "credit" is not the word I would use (nor is it a "director"). As for "healthy fun", there are many such films available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to go through this. Find one of these movies and skip this one.
