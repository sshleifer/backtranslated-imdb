I'm sorry, but I will ruin your line of plot and end in hopes of avoiding the holiday fiasco like the one I'm currently confronted with. The father died, and the mother asked Santa Claus in a letter to return him to the family for Christmas ... and Santa Claus. Dad is peachy, happy, healthy, and completely unaware of the fact that he died. Everything is syrup sweet. But as a parent who recently watched as my five year old loses the best dog friend, it was a horrible movie. Now my son is convinced that everything he needs to do to return his friend is to ask Santa Claus! Do not underestimate the will of a young heart - no assurance will convince him that it was just a movie and that his dog is NOT coming back for Christmas. It was heartbroken to look at his joy only to know that Badnjak would have to face his loss again. I am ashamed of you on behalf of all believers who have recently lost loved ones. It's hard enough to deal with losing one time for a child, but there are some desires that we should not even show as a possibility.
