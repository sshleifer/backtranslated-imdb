Soon after you look at this movie, you will understand why he did not even come to the cinema! This film does not deserve the mark "overkill". Instead, this is a common theme in Hollywood, to tear off earlier good films with catastrophic moves, sequels, etc. does not exist. I seriously felt like watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad. P Diddy should stop stabbing movies with his terrible acting, he made me smile every time. The only good thing that comes from this movie is Jaclin DeSantis, which looks great in this movie and I enjoy watching this movie. If you are a big fan of Carlite's Road, I recommend that you do not watch this. If you still decide to watch it, then treat this movie as if it cut off the original, because that's exactly what it did.
