The people who praise this film are a real disappointment - I hope at least Leonard will see some good $$ from this, because his life savings have been misled by managers a few years ago and now it's over 70. But this film is simply terrible. At the very beginning, Leonard says he is not sentimental in his past, and then the next hour and a half of the film highlights all the worst sentimental elements of Leonardo's song. It's so bloody PRECIOUS with its endless big plans over emotional singers. Cohen's interview was done in lo-fi video by big plans and so I wanted to see a mid or long shot of his whole body! I do not care about the performer's comments, especially those of the oversized ego boys Edge and Bono. None of the artists in this movie did any of the songs as good as Leonardo's own music, and if you're thinking about seeing this and having any doubts, pay attention to them. This would be acceptable PBS special, perhaps, only one time. But I'll even try to get this DVD. When the film finally shows Leonardo's half-performance "Tower Songs", Bono ruined the verse. Even occasional good performances (Antoni, Rufus's first number, Marthin Traitor) are corrupted by the context of the remnant of this storm blab. Forget this, and buy Leonardo's latest album if you want to honor him.
