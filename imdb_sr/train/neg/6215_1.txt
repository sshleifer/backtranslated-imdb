This was really a waste of time ... the movie has a bad story, the story is fragmented and ends with many holes ... although the animation is top-notch. When the film started, I tried to give him the benefit of doubt by saying to myself that this could be interesting at a later stage, but it was never unique. The same plot was performed over and over, but what worsened was that the main hole was the whole story of how to kill the villains ... The writer could do much more with the whole concept, but he or she did not seem to be had their heart in it and wanted to close the film as soon as it started. All in all, too hypo, but is not able to deliver.
