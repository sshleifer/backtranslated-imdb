Oh my God. My God, I can not get over this movie. It was awful. Terrible, terrible! Do not even spend your money to buy it in a 99 cents bucket. No, I'm avoiding at all costs, I warn you! It was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life! First, G-girl? Are you kidding me? Get the right thing that sounds like a new Barbie doll. Super women? Are you kidding me? It was a false false false lieutenant. It seemed that people in the city did not even care that the blonde who are flying and approaching the city rescuing fire ... Ohh big! Jesus, was it just me or did I do it? movie seems offensive ?? I suppose you should be a super hero is a pair of double D, blue hair, without glasses and leather leather suit? If it was trying to be romantic ... but .. God, I do not know. It was terrible, if love means taking someone to the show, then having sex in bed and in the air ... than having had love! It was pathetic, everything went too fast. The guy was the guy first, but he was dating G-girl .. than they broke up than he was dating with that Hannah girl ... and that's just going on. I must say that this movie made me wonder ... How the hell did this get in the cinema? !! Avoid this film at all costs.
