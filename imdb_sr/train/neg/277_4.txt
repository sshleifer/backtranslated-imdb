The performance Lillian Hellman, adapted by Dashiell Hammett with the help of Hellman, is becoming a curious project originating from the persistent Varner Bros.. Paul Lukas, returning his role to Broadway and winning Oscars for the best actor, plays the anti-Nazi German underground leader who fights fascists by pulling out his American wife and three children across Europe before finding refuge in America (across the Mexican border). They settled in Washington with their mother's rich mother and brother, although the tenant who lives in the mansion is immediately suspicious of the inhabitants and spends a lot of time in the German Embassy playing poker. It seems that this drama needs to be focused, and when we understand what is the heart of the material (wise, honest, direct refugees that teach Americans who have no head in the sand as the world has suddenly changed), it seems somewhat patronizing - the viewer is literally put to the place of the cousin, to whom he surrenders. Lukas had several speeches in the third act which undoubtedly won an Oscar award, but for most of the image he seems to do little, but he enters and goes out, enters and leaves. Like his wife, Bette Davis declares like no one else and does her wide eyes on a good advantage, but her role does not allow much color. Their children (all with divergent accents!) Are alternately humorous and boring, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has nothing to do with the role of a wife (and the dissatisfied texture she brings seems totally wrong). The intention was to show us tactfully, tactically, only because a man from the time of World War II may be a German, which does not make him Nazi sympathizers. We got it in the first few minutes; The rest of this delicious, tactile film consists of exposure, defensive conflict and, finally, compassion. It should be an intense mixture, but instead it is rather dry and inert. ** from the ****
