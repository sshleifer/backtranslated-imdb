It was a painful experience, the whole story is actually there, so I will not get into it, but the acting was horrible, this part is at the very beginning, when a brother's scientist goes to work, he actually wears a white jacket at home before leaving. to work, I thought that working with biohazard material means that you should wear sterilized clothing in a controlled environment, and the laboratory itself looks like a school lab, there is a monitor above the cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene. that the city would look technical, and the scientist actually had breakfast in the lab, and beside him, the biologically-marked jar and his boss entered him and even he did not tell him anything about it ... does not mention bad behavior very bad can not be the worst which does not look at my advice and I thought that nothing could be worse than the home of the dead apparently Uvi Boll's films look like classic Shakespeare compared to this!
