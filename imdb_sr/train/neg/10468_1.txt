I did not know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. This was a really horrible movie. The scenario, direction and acting were equally bad. The story was stupid and stupid. The director could make a smart and thoughtful film, but he did not. I was lurking in my place for the last half of the film, because it was so bad. Where was the focus of the film? Where was anything in this movie? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. This was also the loss of my money. You do not see this movie.
