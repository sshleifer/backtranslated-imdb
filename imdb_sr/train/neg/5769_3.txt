Elephants Dream should have been the main open source community project. And while it was a very interesting idea in the concept, in reality, it failed miserably. The film is nicely presented, which is probably the only redeemable factor. The enormous problem with them is, however, a huge flood of light. It's terrible, although I think it helps the movie to dream quality. One thing to keep in mind is a terrible voice acting. While Proog's loud actor is at least half-competent, Em's voice is HORRIBLE. I suppose that when you have a budget that essentially amounts to zero, you can not afford to hire the right actors. It seems to me that they hired one of the animators to do their own voice. In general, the film does not go anywhere. It seems to me that it's more of a movie "Let's see what we can do" instead of a real movie. The action does not go anywhere and fails to show any interesting point. The whole film seems to have been made as an excuse to create interesting areas.
