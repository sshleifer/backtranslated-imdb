Robert Tailor has definitely shown that he is a good drama actor in his role as a gun hunter in this western 1956. It was one of the rare moments when Tailor would play a heavy film. Still, this picture was far from big as shortly afterwards, Tailor escaped on television with a successful series of Detectives. Tailor is here, and his hatred towards the Indians really shows up. Another good performance here was the veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an old man who drinks an old timer. he joined the bison hunting. In his early scenes, Nolan actually did an excellent rehearsal of Valter Huston in his role as Oscar in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in 1948. Record the appearance of Russ Tamblin in the film. Next year, Tamblin and Nolan would join the phenomenal Peiton Place. Writing in the movie is at best stiffened. By the end of the film, these are elements of nature in which Tailor was. What do you think about the writing elements here?
