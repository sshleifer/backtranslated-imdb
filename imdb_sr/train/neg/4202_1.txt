... I miss something here ??? "unexpected plot development"? "they are messing with subversive joy"? do these viewers look at the same arcade vehicle that I just underwent (in the now apparent sub-conscious attack of sadomasochism) ... I just joined this place to make sure that no one else is renting this stinker. ... this film was a disgrace for every person involved ... a quick question: did Sir Stevie read the script before he gave the thumb Kate C.? If so, then it must be the same Spielberg who reviled the "Howard Duck" ... do not give it to me, "it was a hit plai" shit - I guess the MSSR. Reddin is not too pleased ... DVD covers promise "amazing angles" and "twisted story ..." Story !! Story ?? This shit is that old Bobbie McKee and his wandering structured structuralists sound like geniuses ... Sundance? Berlin ?? Toronto ?? I have a home video of a cat that evokes more interest than Arkuette's negative-dimensional depiction of an anxious loss ... and I'm talking about Deuk ek machin for g. Stanleia T .; thank God, at the moment he thought Dave was calling the police! and thank Shiva that the cops just caught the real killer ... what !!! until I get the credits I've been waiting for to be some kind of fight against Arquette and his "hidden millions" ... no, Mrs. Spielberg, you can not escape undamaged: what the hell is that kitchen scene? athletic foot in my hole "gag ???" Are you worrying about this or "just"? I do not know ... hey movie lovers: why not make an emergency night and rent this together with a "jersey" and "white chicks" and then commit a sepuk (or it's a seppuka) ... and take E. Dunsky with you.
