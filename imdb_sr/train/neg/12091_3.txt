Well, Artians from Canada may have liked this movie, but I'm not afraid. If you like the type of film in which the recordings are held so long, you wonder if the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman went to lunch, and perhaps for you. Much of this is like this, with a short coming to the empire of discomfort. I did not consider him shocking or disturbing, like some other reviewers - just a bit unappreciative and meaningless. The only reason I did not give this star is that the act is commendable, and the film is pretty well recorded. However, the plot has little to be recommended. A large part of the film only shows a frowning woman who taught or listened to the piano, which could attract some people. But do not think that this is harmless enough to be ready for some parts of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
