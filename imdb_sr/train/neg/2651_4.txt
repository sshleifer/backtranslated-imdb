The first 30 minutes of the movie were thrilled and it's hard to know what's going on (unless you read the book - which I did not). If you can hold the first half, the other half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet no matter. The way it was captured could be considered to have been produced in the early 80's and not in 2005. Without moments of rest, it's silly, but it's moving without getting bored . I would like to know why Keaton chose this role, her part would be better thrown with the player more at the level of the other players maintaining the balance.
