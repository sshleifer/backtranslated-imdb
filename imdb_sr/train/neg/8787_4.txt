First I heard about Getting Noise when I saw a TV commercial. Before that, I did not even know it existed. I was watching an online trailer and decided to go see him. Now that I'm a fan of films such as The Sikth Sense, I thought this film would give me everything I wanted. It's Michael Keaton, and he's a stone. Unfortunately, the film has not been delivered. He tried to be another sixth sense or a change in echo, and he broke down poorly. It has a very promising start, but the environment only retreats and repeats itself, and ends with a totally poor twist that any monkey could detect. Unfortunately, like most "Scari" movies, today it relies on loud sounds and bangs to make the audience jump. This movie could have been much more. Too bad it was a good idea.
