I guess Gunslinger was not as horrible as most films shown by Misteri Science Theater 3000, but Westernoes are simply not Roger Corman's forte. Showing Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) becoming a sheriff in a city in the west west after her husband's sheriff is killed and must fight bad people, the film is pretty predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new husband, secretly working for stupid Allison Haies (yes, a woman of 50 feet). In short, Corman's star Dick Miller appears as a postman (Miller now plays in Joe Dante's films). I want to claim that you will probably want to watch the version of "MST3K" to really enjoy this movie. They had great fun with them.
