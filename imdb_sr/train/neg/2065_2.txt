I rented her last night. The opening (2001) was long over VAAAAAAAAAI. The scene of the autostoper did not serve the purpose. Some sketches are only retarded. I knew earlier, Chevi Chase was less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, the song Curtis Maifield Total: 7 minutes of good material from the movie of 75 minutes <All the rest was or stupid or stupid. Allow me to give you some advice: if you want a rough movie that bribes TV and movies, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want less rough viewing of TV movies and movies, rent "AMAZONNE WOMEN ON MONTH" or "UHF". Otherwise, do not try to rent this movie. You'll save $ 2-3. IMHO: Ken Shapira's Best Film is STILL "Modern Problems"
