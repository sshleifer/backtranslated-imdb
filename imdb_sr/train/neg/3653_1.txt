I can not help her, but it seems like I love films that are meant to be terrifying and they are simply bad. Personally I put him in his 10 best worst movies right under the creatures of the abyss! Watch this movie and laugh, do not expect to see academies for acting. More chances of understanding the film is his. To be honest, I saw much worse than this. Plus some maniac circling the desert and clearing the same people who just died, it's incredible that it must be original. I think it's one of those films of love or hate. you can make your own mind to your own horrible, but it pulls it somehow that's why I love it
