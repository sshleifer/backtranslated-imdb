I can not believe this movie is allowed. These people should get drunk and beat up dumb objects. They need to be tortured. This movie is disgusting. It's just a shot from the first movie. Everything that is original is strange and makes no sense. It's like some kind of hallucination with drugs. Also, whatever the asshole is braced together, this shit did not even dare watch the first movie, because they constantly called the character of Suzana Love, Natalie, when Lacey was. I felt like I shouted on the screen: "It's LACEI, it's LACEI !!!!". I'm giving -50 out of 10. MY GOD !!!!
