Believe it or not, the "Voodchipper Massacre" gave me a full gonorrhea! That's right, I have a long discharge from me just because a group of children went to play with your camcorder and somehow agreed with the Devil and got the distribution. It's beyond my understanding that anybody with moderate intelligence could tolerate this load of pants. The only reason I managed to go through the whole thing (not without a few suicide attempts) was because I was in the delirium with boredom, and the other - I think I wanted to explore this newly discovered type of hatred. I experienced ... This film "shot video" "horror / comedy" about the three brothers and sisters who were left for the weekend to care for their old aunt's bitch. The youngest kid accidentally pierces the old lady with his hunting knife from the replica. Then they reached the aunt's dismemberment with various tools (apparently she did not have a drop of blood in her body!) And she put her in the rented wood chopper of her dad ... Her condemned son then stopped staring for her mother and the children finished and milled that ass ... I do not remember seeing ever a bunch of boring actors who actually caused me nausea. Seriously, the voice of a blonde was constantly rubbing me with pain. ALL actors were quite horrible - literally just screaming their fake sound dialogue and shooting jokes written by a chimp that just did not care! Now, I can usually appreciate independent efforts, but only those who can understand that people who are not their relatives may be watching this! I do not have to see a 3-minute video of a car that gets out of the road and a painful, painfully long assembly lawn with some funny, lean music over it. Plus, why the hell of this movie has a bloody piano?! There was a piano on one scene there and no one was killed near! I ended up reminding myself of this film. Unless you love unbearable shit, I would advise everyone from half the brain to avoid this trash.
