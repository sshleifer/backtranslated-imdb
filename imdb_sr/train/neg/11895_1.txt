God, what the hell happened here? I will not repeat it, but what kind of movie is it back? Synchronization in this way is the worst of the synchronization in "King Kong vs. Godzilla," Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in her and that suits really cheesi.Its about some criminal is called Dr. a gorilla that has the same power as King Kong, but when this robot breaks down, he builds another, then tries to kidnap Kong. Then Dr. Vho sends a robot after him. Later when I watched the movie I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns began to groan. As she was playing, I hoped that the insanity in the film would end up fighting. The ending must be very bad, because they could re-show Kongo on their island again fighting the dinosaurs. <br /> <Do not watch a movie under any circumstances or if you do it ... beware of the disappointment you will receive.
