I saw that the commentary on the capsule was "great acting". In my opinion, these are two great actors who give horrific performances, and with zero chemistry with each other, for a great director in their worst effort. Robert De Niro must be the most innocent and the most powerful illiterate of all time. The performance of Jane Fonda unfolds throughout the map as she obviously has no problem with the character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Like molasses would be too quick an appetite for the painful pacing of this movie. Although the intention of the film is to raise the story of illiteracy treatment, seeing it as a real "disturbance". I give it 1 out of 10, really one of the worst 20 films for the budget level I've ever seen.
