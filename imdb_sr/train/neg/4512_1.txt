Living in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not come close to even explaining what the gay is. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been missed to bring Japanese culture closer to a wider Western audience and to help demystify the country from which Zen, the Samurai, the geisha world of Kyoto come from. Some of the most interesting moments of the film are when the Americans are shown in a Japanese environment. Geisha dances were not authentic. Chinese music was too used. Less, but essential detail: the proper use of fragrant sticks was nowhere. Sakura scenes were almost obscene kitschy! Interestingly, some Chinese actors were quite convincing as the Japanese.
