Leave it to geniuses like Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, to convince more people in his country to subsidize this wrong film attempt. The sad state of the film industry in that country is the product of attempts to make a film of such a thin material. Most of the paintings made in Spain fall into two categories: those of the Spanish Civil War, who like to present the past as the authors find appropriate. Another type of movie shows a lot of free sex to the viewer, because "creators" have nothing to say. As the movie opens, we can watch Pere's penis while trying to cut it off and put it in one of the plates at the party. Later, Sandra will show everything she got for the audience to admire her. The story of Pereva's attraction to Sandra, a married woman who seems happy to be married, is fake from the very beginning. Pons, "Amic / Amat," but, uh, it has nothing to do with the mess we've been punished to look at in this venture. As for the comments submitted to the IMDb, all negative voices come from Spanish viewers, which is about the amount coming from them!
