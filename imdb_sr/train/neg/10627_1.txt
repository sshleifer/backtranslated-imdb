I noticed that most people who think this film tells the truth or are not born before landing on the Moon (1969-1972), or are not old enough to value them. I think it's a lot easier to re-examine a historical event if you did not experience it. I was a young man in the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The whole world was following the landing on the moon. Our families have gathered around the TV to watch the launch. News headlines screamed the latest events every day, from launch to landing, from the moon's trails to lifting the moon, down to the descent, into a multitude of languages. At school some hours have been canceled so that we can watch the main events on television. During Apollo 13, the world prayed and held a collective breath while people wandered home to an uncertain fate. You could not go anywhere without anyone asking what's the latest. The world is truly a community. Now, with the protection of 30 years after the fact, it's easy to look for a scam, because global enthusiasm and interest are diminished. Our historical textbooks have been left out, and everyone can argue that history is wrong and try to "prove it" with a pile of lies and fabricated facts while totally ignoring the superiority of the evidence that shows otherwise - not to mention proof that it lives in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderful and fantastic days.
