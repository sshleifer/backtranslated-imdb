I suppose this film is based on some kind of true story ... It's about two young girls who abuse an adult for 48 hours; I do not see where the terror appears here ... There are some "strange" and "curious" sequences in the movie and two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh well) play rolls of two psycho-male haters to the balls. .. they do a pretty good job (although some of this is just a little more than the top) The movie is not good, and it's not horrible, it's just really out of date! I mean, this thing is dripping in the 70's .... It's not very bad if you love such things ... you know ... that tang?
