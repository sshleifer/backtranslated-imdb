OK, we all love the puppets, but what about this act? Let's get started, Jessica Simpson like Daisy, there is not one country about this girl and Daisy was not ditty! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest to the one who looked like the original. No offense, Burt, but I did not notice that Boss HOg was so high. It was part of the humor of Boss Hog. Have they even tried someone like Danny Devito?!? All right, now take what you dropped on Jessica Simpson did anyone look at her husband? It coincides with Luke Duke! Obviously these manufacturers did not look at the appearance of old members. The screen was never present on the princes !! That's why the movie was off from the beginning. I gave him a big thumb.
