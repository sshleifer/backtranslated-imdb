I found this film as an ultimate disappointment. The talent available to directors - in particular Stanley Tucci, Chris Valken, Hank Azariah and Alan Arkin (without mentioning the four main tracks) - were completely lost in a meaningless, central story, whose conclusion once did not matter. introduced into terrible, stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is poor, Zeta-Jones is simply unpleasant (she appears to reprise her role of high fidelity, minus humor), Cristal only plays her same old hyperactive, neurotic, boring alter ego, and Cusack simply passes through his part, apparently bored with the whole project. For what should be a "Romantic comedy," there is absolutely no romance between central characters, let alone chemistry, and as for comedy - (possible SPOILERS) well, the only moments of mild humor have come from the back of Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkine - a scriptwriter who apparently could not show any originality. Azaria was quite fun as the Mexican lover and the Walkman made a rather fun turn as a parody of the arthouse-maverick-dogme-type director - but these pieces did little time on the screen and instead (Spoilers) treated us Billy Cristal while the dog breathed in the groin. Pure genius. For the great fan of most of John Cusack's works, not to mention the rest of the fantastic actor, I was completely disappointed with a movie with lots of good ideas and at the same time completely reluctant to research or elaborate any of them, instead of resorting to with the same old genre clich√©s, and even to descend to the depth of the almost "brutal, humorous teenage movie" on time. Very bad 4/10.
