* Spoiler warning * First I rated this movie 2 out of 10. The idea is good, but there are too many stupid mistakes in the movie, if you do not make it a psychic drama that you maybe it was. First of all, she never fights herself. After the very mother's very strange suspicion (which is not convincing when her mother shows her that she is so supportive and loves her later in the film), the victim of rape is not alone. It is also incredibly naive and always falls into strange castle traps. Her friends are incredibly nasty. What seems incredible to me is that Ethan does not manage to control the crew when he changes his mind. Ethan is a very crew leader (hey, they even say it) and people think that the other guy is a jerk, but when Ethan changes his mind he simply fails to convince any person in the crew. that he is right and that his ex-friend is wrong. Everyone simply hates him ... why? The film does not give any explanation. How did he ever become a leader? It's funny that my girlfriend thought I was looking at Beverly Hills when she came. Two actors from the same successful TV series .... an inexpensive way to get viewers?
