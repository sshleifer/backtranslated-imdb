Slasher films are often considered derivatives, repetitive and sincere non-genuine. I'm incidentally a fan of horror films, but this film was so poor that my words fail. The scenario was seriously missing, the plot is ridiculous, the acting is staggeringly bad. Only a stinker, who lost my life. This had all the fun value from the 15th sequel to the film, which was in the first place horrible. <br /> Who Green This Disorder? I only loved two things in this movie. The first was the killer mask - which was nice. The other was an Austrian affinity with humorous professions.
