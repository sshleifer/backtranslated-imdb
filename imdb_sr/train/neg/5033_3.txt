Murders are happening in a desert city in Texas. Who is responsible? A few novelties of mysterious and racial tensions (the latter do not really stand), but otherwise strictly for lovers of slasher, who will appreciate the ups and downs, which are the two conventional elements for these films. Kimmell (from Friday 13th DELA 3 shame) plays quasi-detective teenagers. * 1/2 of **** MPAA: Rated R for Violence and Up, Nudity and Some Language.
