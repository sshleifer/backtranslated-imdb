Will he ever film movies without nudity and sex? This came at 3:00 on Sunday afternoon and I could not believe what they showed. Thank God that my son was outdoors or I would be scared if he saw a soft / medium porn! Do people who make movies do not care who insult or corrupt? The children could look after the church and that's what they show ??? !!! The acting was good and I enjoyed uncertainty, but GEE! There were violence and bad guys, but this can be expected in one Western movie. Randi Travis was really good at his role. If writers, directors and producers simply stopped putting so many unseen sexual scenes. What has to happen to make them stop stopping in that direction? Where can I complain?
