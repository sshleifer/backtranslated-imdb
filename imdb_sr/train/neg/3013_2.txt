Beginning with its long opening of seemingly endless rows of workers on a conveyor belt at a Chinese plant, Manufactured Landscapes are trying to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. His droning narrative assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is completely unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America, and Karl Mark had never visited the British Museum. It has never been mentioned that there is a connection between today's Asian instinct for industrialization and wealth and earlier experience of hunger and terror. At the same time, there is an attempt to show photographs of Edward Burthaine industrial waste as somehow "nice". Most of the film is a slide show of these pictures. They are well-manufactured, museum-sized and apparently appeared on several exhibitions. For me, however, they only show that almost every photo can be made to look nice if it is well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the photos and the voice message of the film remains unclear. I do not think I implicate that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries are rushing to industrialize. Manufactured landscapes, however, offer only strange and bitter hopelessness. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. It may have some value as a demonstration of what is wrong with the American (and Canadian) left.
