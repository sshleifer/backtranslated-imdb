I finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago. VoV still can not believe what I was watching. This is absolutely the worst movie EVERYTHING. If I listed all the shortcomings in the movie, this review would bring me many sentences. (Very ridiculous faults, because I'm so bad) You need to be stunned by the skill of commandos in charge of rescue aircraft. they did not even know how to move. Led-t is such a bad actor ... and the thing I do not understand is how the production wanted to be like a hero, but he's zero. Naturally, the main The defects will be landing at 747, which requires only 3 or 4 tips of the type in transmission to land the plane ... incredible .. as well as dead bodies that did not have blood at all. But I strongly recommend to watch this movie, because it's very interesting to see how bad it can get something
