This is perhaps the strangest view of Santa Claus ever dedicated to every medium, whether it's a book, a picture, or a movie. Santa Claus looks like a pervert that looks at children, and a weird story about the introduction of Merlin to help him win one of Satan's servants, Pitch, does nothing better. It's least funny, with bad effects, even for the 1959 standards. If a child were watching this movie, he would have nightmares and would never want Santa to visit. They would have scars for the rest of their lives. Imagine a child in the "Christmas Story" when they start to scream after being put on a Christmas skirt. This will turn out if a child sees this movie.
