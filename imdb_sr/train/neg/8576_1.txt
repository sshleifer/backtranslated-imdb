A hard-hitting comedy, with musical interludes, generates a fast pace that runs a consecutive pace through the labyrinth of funny and cold complications. Boris Karlof, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong crime. The script contains all the standard mysterious film requisites - sliding panels, secret passages, thunderbolts and lightning and poison dart arrows. Carlof, Lugosi and Lorrae enter into heavy songs and the obvious melodramatic of the gasping age. Kai Kiser and his band offered a great party for people who lived in the 40s who tried to forget the horrors of World War II.
