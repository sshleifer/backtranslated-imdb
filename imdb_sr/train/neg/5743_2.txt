Yes, I know I'm one of the few people who want to push this movie into the dust of oblivion. So let me tell you why I feel so. Actually, if it was advertised as a zombie movie or the like, maybe I enjoyed it. But now I'm totally without a word. * SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure What's wrong * Let's start with the first GOAL error. If I did not know that the movie was called "Darkness - The Vampire Version" and that I did not see some sequences in which some individuals are shedding blood, I would not see a connection with Vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Let me! Another bad thing: what about the metal? It seems that all young people, but mostly so-called "vampires", are in different types of metal, judging mainly by their T-shirts! Do not misunderstand me, but for almost 15 years I've been in extreme forms of music, but nobody will scare me by showing me some funny teenagers in Iron Maiden (of all bands !!!) T shirts run around, pretending to be Vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I can use here. Third weakness: actors. Wait a minute. What actors?! You mean the buddy's friends! The words here would be waste. Yes, okay, the movie is very bloody, but what does it have to do with it? It would be a strong side and something to enjoy, if the "brilliant" director did not choose to create the subject of ART Vampire in this movie. I wanted to see the Vampire, but I was treated by some stupid kids I used to use my baseball bat. Movie creators would simply have to advertise a movie "cheap horror B-class without complication, but much worse" !!! This film is blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And it's bothering me.
