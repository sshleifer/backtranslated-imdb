The man wakes from the nightmare of the sticks. He and his wife go out in the desert to a picnic in the honeymoon. She seems to hear a strange noise, and she is upset by the sight of a bat crawling over their picnic blanket. He wants to go on a tour of the cave, which has something to do with a job that works, but wants to enjoy the honeymoon. She withdraws. They go on a tour, but leave the group to recognize themselves. It falls down a slope, where it is interfering with insects. Follow her. Again he heard a strange noise and he seemed to know that the bat approaching; One is, and enters her hair. He fights against her and attacks him, biting his forehead. They emerge from the cave, but when in the gondola on the ski resort, it begins to have attacks in which hallucinations or visions of the bats attack people. It gets angry when it happens. He is not able to drink alcohol without spit it out. His wife cares about the rabies, and Pasteur's treatment begins, but violently reacts to the injection. And then some people are killed. We see parts of man's transformation into a bat. It does not look like it's just in his mind. Is not it clear whether a bite of blind meat causes these transformations, as it already had some symptoms before bites. Although the title seems inappropriate, the implication in the end is that the same thing happens to the other person. It's not a very good movie, but I liked the diversity of locations in the desert, caves and ski trails, as well as some strange scenes. I did not think this was as bad as other people, and I did not think that the 1999 films were as bad as others thought (I rated it as 5/10).
