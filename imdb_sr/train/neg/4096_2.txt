This was a classic case of something that should never be. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband left her because she did not want to live in a commune with him (he was crazy that Reagan was chosen and wanted to turn his back on society). Just then and then I had problems with the series - come on, I tell myself, is it the same noble Michael Stivic who opposed the right wing philosophies of Archi Bunker? The series continued, but did not have a picasso. Regardless of the momentum Salli Struthers acquired from All Families, he has long since departed. Perhaps, if the series got a different name and was presented as completely independent of All In The Families, it might have succeeded. Well, it's a show business.
