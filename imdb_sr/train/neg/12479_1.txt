DEATHSTALKER is perfect for fans of B-fantasy films; this barely 80-minute tragedy of film creativity that can all be asked - nonexistent planning, terrible acting (except at least the colorful old lady), funny scripting and editing of the schlock, and background in the style of a cheap basement setting. There are no characters who find themselves cute or interesting (especially, the lead has nothing attractive to him), and the actors who have gathered hardly make up nothing to rise above the material of the F-class. If that is not enough, how about the lack of a strong complication (for which this film does not have anything similar) in order to qualify DEATHSTALKER as a major Turkish? I also regretted that women in this movie barely serve another purpose, except that: 1) they are toples and / or scrupulously dressed; 2) rape; 3) have sex with a hero; 4) All of the above. In addition, background music is disgusting; bizarre clash of electronic noise, siren chorus bursts and luminous orchestral cacophony. Sealing in the ear and blindening the eye in one package with something that someone needs to be interested, DEATHSTALKER is probably the most suitable for people looking for something they laugh (and believe me, there's plenty of that). Otherwise, I do not recommend CONAN in the 100th grade to be the least for everyone.
