The film confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create a coherent argument against the death penalty at any level. By presenting the lawful execution of the condemned murder as a catalyst for the apocalyptic end of humanity, the film raises the killer's parents as martyrs for Christ. Somehow, according to the plot, God is outraged that the society decided to free himself from the fanatic who killed his parents by burning them while they were sleeping in their beds. However, this same god has no indignation for the part of the killer. The main character, a non-religious pregnant suicide woman, ultimately gives her life in a defiant but incredible attempt to unsuccessfully save that convicted murderer. In other threads of underdeveloped dance, Jesus returns as a powerless and frustrated rogue to symbolically liberate God's wrath. Modern Christ's vague incarnation not only dehumanizes it, but is also ridiculed by the Messianic ideal of all religions. He is unable to affect humanity for good and without the slippery edge of life waiting for mankind to destroy its self. In the meantime, with little help from Jesus, a mentally unstable pregnant woman finds the ability to reincarnate into her newborn child without a soul that in some way saves all humanity from the wrath of the Almighty. I also interpreted this as a statement in favor of abortion at some levels. This film, which tries to infiltrate many religious themes into the thriller, does not succeed in making any religious point that I could clearly interpret, in addition to ridicule human beliefs. That raises many questions she has never tried to answer. It ignores the religious values ​​of its audience, while trying to portray a rude version of their fulfillment. Silly
