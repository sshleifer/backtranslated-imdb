It seems that Claire Denis's films fall into one of two categories: violent and bloody or silent and intimate. "L'Intrus" definitely belongs to the first category, but it's not as terrible as "Trouble Everi Dai" or "J'ai pas sommeil." Now, since I've seen "Chocolat," I managed to see every new film Denis made. And I was always disappointed. L'Intrus was no exception. She still has to make the movie personal and mobile as the first movie. You will get a lot of Denis rows: an older but still magnificent Beatrice Dalle who seems to be in the film just to show her full lips, the gap between teeth, enough décolleté and a pair of beautiful coats; a black man from "Trouble Everi Dai" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Gregoire Colin, and a Lithuanian or Russian girlfriend. Michel Subor's face was interesting enough, but the camera kept him at such a length that the curly hair that hung over his forehead was irritating, and which was easier when he finally got a cut in somewhere in Korea. There must have been some actions - terrible murders, male searches for the son - and maybe it was complicated, but one view was not enough to understand it, and two reviews I'm afraid not to be considered. First, the result was bold and intrusive (as in "Beau Travail"). On the other hand, the seasons have changed sharply, which has made you even more confused about what is happening. Oh, there were some nice shots, and if you liked "Fridai Evening" with your creations in heavy curtains and sheets, you might appreciate the aesthetics of "L'Intrus". Otherwise, avoid it. I saw this film in French and it is possible that I missed something. But the dialogue in the Denis film rarely exceeds five pages, a double space, and with abundance of margins. In "Chocolate" silence is exalted; In L'Intrus, it's just boring.
