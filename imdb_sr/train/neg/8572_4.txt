A thin story relates to brothers from small towns and their struggle for the honor of the family. David Morse is responsible for a cop and a 'good' brother; Viggo Mortensen, a 'bad' boy, is a former soldier and ex-prisoner. As an actor (especially at his earliest years), Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performances under Method. Turning to the first time a writer and director for this artistic, dull drama, he runs his own script and characters through the same methodical process, slowing the walk to creep (supposedly so that we can catch every nuance and flexion). This approach could be fascinating if there were three-dimensional caregivers, but photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really convincing as brothers and sisters. Worse yet, we expect more of the prominent veterans Charles Bronson and Sande Dennis, who barely get the chance to go through something interesting. The picture is rude with stormy sequences, unsure narrative and confusing montage (always inclined to show artistic excesses). Pen tricks with the camera show a talented eye, but they are mostly irritating. * 1/2 of ****
