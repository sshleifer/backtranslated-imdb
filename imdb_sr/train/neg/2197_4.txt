This one returns to matinee days, when the children from somewhere else to go out took their exits to the balcony after they lowered their younger brothers. It did not matter what was on the screen - little children would sit through it and big kids would ignore it. Adults, of course, would never see it. But they put it on the video, in any case, along with most of the other crunchy, low-budget "B" horrors in golden years. . from television. The inherent and unintentional humor of this film was derived from the stagnant ideology ("bad girls" picked up to replace the broken body of the poor Jan - they had it to come), an overt plot (a crazy scientist, trying to play God), a violent but conscientious monster whose presence in a rural laboratory, so far normal, in science, has never been fully explained), and works by polarizing on a wooden or overhead. This is a great party for parties, assuming your guests enjoy adding dialogue and commentary to otherwise disgusting movie enthusiasts. In fact, if you or your guests prefer passive entertainment, this movie is also available on the video in your Misteri Science Theater 3000, where hosts and puppets of cult TV shows make the necessary accessories for you.
