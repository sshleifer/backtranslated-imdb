Chan Vook Park is nothing if it is not inventive. I'm CYBORG, BUT IT'S OK. It's full of fun little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas that are littered between. Trying to walk with footsteps such as Marc Caro and Jeunet (THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATED), the Park moves into a imaginative, carefree story that is a radical departure from its usual morbid price. Hardly anyone is guilty of their ambition or vision, it is truly unexpected, that is, all the efforts of the Park are reduced to such a small amount. I am CYBORG, but it's okay, it seems, staggeringly take away from yourself as it goes along, with the end result that is a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, the gargoyles are abundant and unconventional humor abounds, but all this does not make it possible to make any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are sweet and unusual and play with the pleasure of the actors, but, try as I could, I could not worry about anyone. The VENGEANCE SYMPTOMS SYMPTOMS is a wrong step, indicating perhaps the Park was a bit overweight, but nevertheless managed to show some of the directing unique flashes and immediately after impressive filmography, it is ready to forgive. None of the confident self-confidence commanded the COMMON SECURITY AREA or SYMPTOMS FOR MR. VENGEANCE is obvious here. I am CYBORG, but OK, it left me so irreversible that I instinctively moved forward from time to time (more often as the movie progressed). I gave LADY 5/10, and to this extent, it probably does not deserve more than 3. For the old days, I will be generous: 4/10
