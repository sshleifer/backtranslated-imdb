An absolutely nasty slasher movie does not have a single redeeming quality. There is camp counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson ... free as a killer; her jokes when they lose people do not even have fun) on the war path of killing teenagers who least behave badly or resisting her plea for good behavior. We launch a bunch of boring, clich√©ed killings such as killing one child in search of his Freddie's gloved glove, a kid who gets a saw, a girl who drinks, one that pushes into a crapper, a baker, etc. . There is no one original idea to offer and just a waste of time. This is unless you want to see Valerie Hartman (who plays Whore Whiskey) tits. Most of the violence happens outside the screen, and even that will not be met.
