I read somewhere that this film should be a comedy. after I see it, I would call it anything but. The point of this film is getting out of me. the dialogue is extremely superficial and absurd, many sets seemed like they thought, and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content, there's nothing erotic in this movie ... everything leaves me wondering about what! the title premise could be the basis for a fun (if politically incorrect) comedy. Instead, we are treated according to cheap, amateur, incomplete drawings, distortion and strangeness for her alone. If I want to, I'm going to buy a CD with Grace Jones.
