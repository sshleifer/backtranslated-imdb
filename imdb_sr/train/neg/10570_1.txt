Do not let MPAA deceive you with their "Rated R for Extreme Violence," which definitely does not represent extreme violence in this boring society. I was expecting a slightly cheaper frame of the 3 types of action promised by the trailer, but its boring boring stupidity with a tone of lame slowly of my flashbacks that make no sense. AVOID!
