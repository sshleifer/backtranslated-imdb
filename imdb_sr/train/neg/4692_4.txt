When I first saw this movie, it was called TERROR ON THE TRAIL and it was the last half of the double sign. Glen Ford, a weapons expert, is called upon to reduce the hidden bomb on a train full of explosives. The tension is slow and constant; and this black and white film takes only an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on TV; Tension and drama have lost most of their influence. This is still a good movie until the early 50's. Together with Ford, Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The thief / saboter plays Victor Maddern.
