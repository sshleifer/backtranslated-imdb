I hated him. If you believe that everyone in the south is a stupid, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, religious wolf, or abuser of children, then this movie may be for you. They are all poor and seemingly ignorant. In one scene, two older men are talking in the store, and one mentions that he abused the sisters before they could tie their shoes. It seemed that a man was proud of his actions, and another apparently considered him to be a normal part of his life. Very nice. Teenager is walking along the back roads looking for her sister and nobody offers her help - despite apparent limping and lack of food or water (no backpacks, etc.). Strathairn's character is not only disgusting and slim, but has turned out to be a religious believer who (typically for Hollywood) reflects the corrupted nature of Christians. The scene in the film is very reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (the one with DeNiro) - Biblical verses pronounced by a bad guy. I am from the Great Northwest, but I think this film is offensive because of the wonderful people I know, who are from NC, VV, AL, MS, KI, TN, etc.
