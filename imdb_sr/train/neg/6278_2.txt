You have to wonder how some flicks have ever been made ... this one has decided to skip why and among many other things and just go outside the debate. Still, you have a number of decent actors who are trying to invest in something in the story. The blue hue during the movie goes over 'once more', which in itself would be depressing, but here it is exaggerated. The idea that this is not a medical condition is not a house or a curse or a curse, but only something that, for whatever reason, begins to happen to our protagonist, and then to everyone else around it, just ends up as if you take a big sip of empty cups. Some duplicates have super powers, but others do not know or do not know? They seem to be as unclear as we are. It's a poor robber of "Snatchers Body Invasion" with "Mirror" Keifer Sutherland and "Sixth Sense", to seriously destroy these three together.
