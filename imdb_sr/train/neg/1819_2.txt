I was looking for this movie for one reason - Al Adamson. He's among the worst directors of all time - up there with Ed Vood, Jr. and Rai Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of horror. However, I was a bit disappointed because, although the film was really bad, he never came near the levels of horror of some of his earlier films from the school. Because of this, this film was not particularly fun to watch bad movie fans. Now I was cautious when I watched this movie, because the title "Naughty Stevardesses" makes the movie sound like a pornographic movie - something I would not review on IMDb. However, this film sometimes looked like this - especially for the first 10 minutes. But, it could be said that the script has undergone many changes, since for most of the film there is no subtitle at all, and at the end of the film there is a plot that comes out of where it is violently and certainly NOT sexy. ! The result of all this is complete confusion. Unfortunately, none of the many parts is not even good. For example, as a porn video, he shows a surprising little and I'm Unaware why they put a 71-year-old guy in some of the love scenes. Surely, the 71-year-old Mr. Livingston looked pretty good - but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him wearing him with a young nymph! Then, when the last 20 minutes becomes very violent, Livingston has become a Rambo-like guy! Talk about weird and inadequate. All in all, there is little that you can recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to take care of him, and the movie manages to be pretty boring, even with such a crazy headline as "Naughty Stevardesses".
