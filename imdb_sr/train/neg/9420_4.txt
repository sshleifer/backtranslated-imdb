Another better "Cleopatra Jones" since 1973 has a statue of black actress Tamara Dobson, who returns to her role as a chic, a super durable narcotics agent who breaks heroin here in Hong Kong. Cross-pollinating blakploitation action-flick and kung-fu B-movie is fun at the beginning, but at the end of the flag. Shooting finals are in front of the assembly line, and Dobson looks less energetic than before (still sexy, and she makes a unique turn in a comic-stiff dialogue, but this environment may have been too much of one thing for her - it's exhausted. Stevens plays the crime this time; she's good, but she can not get along with Shelley Vinters in her predecessor. ** from ****
