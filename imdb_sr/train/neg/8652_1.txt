I thought before I started this film so that it could be good, but when I started with it, I found it was really terrible. They said the film was being filmed in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film was shot in India. You can see Indian cars. you can see lars drinking bisleri (Indian brand water), Hindi written on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah * its really funny and more that proves that it was not filmed in Afghanistan. I do not think I should spend my time watching this movie ... pure time loss ... I would recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie or maybe it's the heart of a better idea, but do not look at this time loss
