Because some people, like me, like to know everything about the movie, even if they plan to see it, including the end. In any case, here is the end I remember, because I could not have more than 8 years when I first saw him on TV. But I will tell you, it surely scared the young child that I was, and I thought about it later, and it still stands out in my mind to this day, although some details are a little vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I do not remember that! I did not even remember that Barnabus was in this movie, and I loved dark shadows. So, in the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Is lured by a judge (Joseph Cotton, I suppose, although I remember he is an old family doctor or something in place of a judge; in the place of the wedding, which, as far as I remember, some kind of cave? Maybe I was wrong, and Shelley Vinters laughs, and the judge has a cloak, and the corner of the camera looks like he's looking at him, and he throws off his robe, and he has goat's legs, and he announces that he is actually her father, the Devil ., and she played right into their (sotonistic) hands, because the "dead" guy with whom he fell in love (the pretense I am Robert Fokvorth) also reveals that the guy who Satan wants to marry, the Demon with yellow eyes, and that, of course, shows Robert Fokorta, and his eyes shine yellow.In the last few minutes of the film, there are a lot of big plans. They laugh and rejoice, except Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and cries or screams or something, and that's the end. The bad guys win.
