I just saw a movie in the theater. The movie has very few good things to talk about. Kareen's beauty and a couple of songs can be. That's it. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone connected with the film will be disappointed, even the Mumbai Indians (Chennai is just the semifinals). But the worst thing I feel about film is the action scene. Now Bollivood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood. But they forget that Hollywood directors have many effects to make them look real. But unfortunately, Bolivian directors do not have that much time. They spend their time on the songs and the publicity of the film. Now such stupid action scenes can work in the south as the audience only pays to watch their favorite actor who kills a bunch of people. But in Bollivood this certainly will not work. All the action scenes that I would like to be able to pass. In the end, even some Chinese appear from nowhere to beat Aksai Kumar. This is the height of nonsense. The audience does not pay to watch such nonsense. I think Bollivood should now forget the action movies. Can not. The last good action I saw was from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiion ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollivood is really sad for action movie lovers like me. Do these people see their film after the end? Can they not understand that the slowdown (which is done using the rope) is too unrealistic and childish? It's better not to have an action scene if you can not do it. I just want to go back to Amitabh's era where films such as Zanjeer and Deevar had exciting action scenes. The sound effect at that time was not very effective, but visually much better than the current era. This film should now open the eyes of Bollivood film directors. Please, do not make any more action movies until you get the art of creating reality.
