Well, the big money machine did it again! Disney's very cunningly used morons like myself, who feel that we have to have every video (good or bad) with Disney's nickname. Why am I still looking forward to these "sequels" that Don Bluth make on a bad day like Leonardo Da Vinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three stories (already a bad choice!) Does not one of the most beautiful Disnei's creations linear story deserves? Of these three, only the latter comes close to the quality of the animation and narrative that I would expect. Music is terrible and modern (which means it will be dated for 2 years) and nothing is added to the story. Why does everything have to be updated? You know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be honored and faithful to the original with songs that reflect the same style? I can not wait to continue sleeping beauty. Instead of music based on Tchaikovsky's themes, we will get music inspired by Britney Spears !!! Disney, if you listen, remember that we are not all non-selective children here. How about throwing a bone or two on fans that were long enough to know the difference between craft and shit?
