It could be a bit rough for me to say it, but unfortunately so far in his career, that's true. Just look at what he has done so far. They barely exceed the 3-star rating. Why I watched this movie? 2 reasons. Luci Lavless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Luci was remarkable in this film, its performance is borne by the entire film. I hope that he will get a "blockbuster" and enter the big league of actors, obviously he has the skills. Greg was not such a striking, typical style of acting on TV. The film is unusually categorized as horror. The only "horror" are short flashbacks, and they run for 2-5 seconds with a bit of blood in them. I would personally call it "Drama / Thriller". But no matter how interesting the story actually was, poor directing, editing and acting (with respect to the Port) it is destroying it. You do not get the right connection with the actors, something that is very important in a story like this. You just sit and watch that you do not feel anything. As if you were watching a bad TV soap ... I think TV soap would be more interesting. My advice: Stay away from this movie ... or better still, just stay away from everything Hurst is involved.
