The typical terrible rubbish of director Fred Olen Raia about the female cyborg hunter (Teagan) ordered by the manager Jan-Michael Vincent to find and kill a fugitive convict Ross Hagen who set a course for the land. Soon, Forest Ranger John Phillip Lav will have to protect a group of disgusting boys at a college led by Richard Willie, who crossed the Hague with his RV to camp. Soon the cyborg will destroy laser innocents by an innocent alcoholic doctor (Robert Kuarri of the Count of Yorga-Vampire Glory) who proves that no one will stand on that road to reach the hide of the prisoners, whose necklace is a monitoring device that weakens his body. The law finds an ally in Le Gordon, an old war veteran of Vietnam, with too many weapons hidden in his cabin. Perhaps deliberately done terribly, this is what lovers of "broken movie" crave for ... effects, acting and premise. At least, the movie has PJ Soles for some eye candy ... even '89, it was pretty smoker. That laser pistol is surely funny ... it can burn some houses, but when Ciborg shoots on a lion, it barely leaves a trace at the location that was fired.
