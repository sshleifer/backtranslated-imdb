This film is another long line without budget, no effort, no talent movies filmed on the video and a slippery title for the scam of insignificant renters in the video. If you want to know what to watch this movie is, catch the video camera and red food color and record yourself and your friends wandering around the night at night and attacking people. Congratulations, you just made the "Hood of the Dead Dead"! Now, see if the distribution company will buy from you. I saw a small budget, shot on video films that showed the talents of filmmakers and actors, or at least, but it does not. Avoid if you are not a real masochist or you are entertained by badly performed horror films.
