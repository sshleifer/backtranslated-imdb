I must admit that I did not finish this film because it was so incredibly stupid and not worth watching. I watched her with full children, who also did not laugh with stupid and rude humor. The director, Bob Dolman, appears to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitals that he override the real story I grew up with. This is not a good movie for kids! In addition to the fact that the content is so rough, the film is just stupid and has a bad flow and no intelligence behind it. What a waste of perfectly good stories. If you read the book when you were younger and loved it, then do not waste your time watching a movie that badly destroys it to anger you. Buy a book for your children instead.
