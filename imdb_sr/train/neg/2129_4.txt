In my humble opinion, this version of the big BDVI musical has only two things to do - Tine Dali and the fact that now there is a recorded version with the original script. (OK, Vanessa Villiams is good to watch.) But for me, that's all there is. It seems that most actors walk through the show - Chinna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is, and it's no wonder that people are going through Harry McAfee when he is starred by George Vendt who seems to be returning to Boston's bar stool. Jason Alexander is passable, but this wig has to go and saw a better dance in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it is good that we now have a scenario scenario, but I hope that young people there, who have never seen a musical, do not condemn them all on this.
