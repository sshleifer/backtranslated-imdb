I can not believe this film was horrible. I feel generous even by calling it "film". The acting was straight, the installation was terrible and the action leaves many big questions unanswered. The assumption was OK, if it is non-original: a small group of aliens lives in the United States and is trying to slowly take on humanity. But from there it goes fast downhill. How could they convince a "man" to accept an alien as his wife to make them alien to the human hybrid they need? They show the alien larvae, but they never show what it does. They have a plastic surgeon that can produce perfect skin at the industrial level. They are bound by a huge foreign monster with teeth. The end was too painful to watch. I guess I'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boklietner would have anything to do with this. How could he say to a huge alien monster with teeth: "Get out of him, son of a bitch" with a flat face? The fall from his Babylon is long for 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
