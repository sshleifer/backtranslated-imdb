Kurt Thomas plays Jonathan Cabot as a kind of gymnast who is training for a special game that involves hunting for a group of ninjas, but those ninjas will have no chance, especially because Cabot is a gymnast! Overall, Gimkata is an incredible movie, a horrible act, a godly script and a really incompetent directing make quality below human standards, but this movie is so awesome that it becomes really, really funny. I mean a dialogue like "I know I'm going to beat them!" or "Ha !, yours through!" just add the false value that Gimkata has more. In addition, it is (wise) the only movie that has a hero and a gymnast who finds things to swing in a warm moment.
