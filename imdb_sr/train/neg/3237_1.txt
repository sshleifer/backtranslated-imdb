It's not that I'm kidding with joy when I see realistic bloodsheds, but when I put a DVD in the expectation of bloodshed, and what I get is a bloody scene (the eyeball) at the end of the tail of a raging splash and rotating the Table Chair, I finally think "it's 43 The minute of my life has gone forever. " I would not consider this or "Flowers of meat and blood" "movies" as much as exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them. The flower of meat and blood had several difficult places to watch. The devil's experiment is not. It was at best, stupid, and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Maybe my expectations were too high. I put a DVD thinking, "Oh, man, this will be sick." After seeing them as fake, the girl slapped them about a thousand times, I watched it forward. 1) People looking for F'd films just to see how F'd really is, or 2) the hustle and bustle. I was looking for this and another Guinea pig for another reason, but even if I fell into the category of the first one, this movie would not float my ship. Actually, I could imagine that this film increases lust for blood ... as in "Would you just have killed B * TCH already!" So, the conclusion is that the only reason we have this collection film. If you want a slaughter that does not provide a traditional horror, take the traces of death. Of course, and that's bullshit, but at least you'll get the blood and hoses you expect. The only reason I can see anyone who praises this shit is because they think they should. There are no artistic merits that I can understand, there is no reason for his glory, there is nothing. Just a miserable attempt to be shocking.
