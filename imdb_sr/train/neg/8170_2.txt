My friend and I went through one stage (much) before choosing the worst horror movies in the video shop for evening entertainment. For some reason, I bought this one (probably V. V. Cheap). Cheap synthetic soundtrack is a classic of your time and genre. There are also some very entertaining scenes. Among them is the scene in which a man was attacked and defended by numerous incredible objects, so I laughed then (in retrospect, it does not seem so funny, but you go there). > Plus, it's totally shit, watch out. But it's probably worth watching if you like movies like "Chopping Mall". Yes, I saw it too.
