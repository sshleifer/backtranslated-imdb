The next time you're at a party and someone asks: "The other day, I heard the expression" the will of the author. "Does anyone know what this means?" Tell them to sit over 'Head Over Water'. The only way Diaz could survive this movie was by using this literary device, which is often used by bad writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. However, the film does not stand up to the smallest logical analysis. Why does Keitel bind Diaz's hand in front of her, not behind her? Why can he do that with a chainsaw? For me, the best part of this movie is that I saw it on a cable channel, instead of spending four dollars in a video store.
