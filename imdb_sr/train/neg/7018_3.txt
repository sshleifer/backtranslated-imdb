Totalli forgettable. Especially because of the bad acting. This is the first movie I've ever seen with Dak Shepard. To my surprise, he has been present since the late 1990's. I thought she was a newcomer, because the acting was so bold. I can say the same for Liv Tiler. Although I saw her in other films, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not an actress who will give the character a fiery, emotional personality like Diane Keaton, but it was rather strange to see her speak with her whisper. There seemed to be no good chemistry between the actors at all, and I think Diane Keaton felt that too. She is a fantastic actress, but she seemed to be a little exaggerated in this movie. She looked as if she wanted the film to be returned as soon as possible. I would not blame her.
