Rookie suffers so much. In the film there are random music songs, a long and meaningless script and a sufficiently powerful slapstick to make Jerry Levis blush. Noonan and Leavitt simply do not know when to give up. It takes an hour before the story finally comes to the main action, and the characters have experienced shipwreck. Then the guys begin to play Japanese sailors with a standard racist cartoon of the day. It's a shame that the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt play stupid, stereotyped Japanese guys. But it becomes quite tedious after switching between two sets of characters. Then it just ends abruptly. Even naked Julie Nevmar can not save this in the towel. In the movie there is really a little charm and it's over half an hour too long. The story only tries to try to set funny situations and failures. Stick to Martin and Levis. At least Dean had a charm, and Jerry had that animated face.
