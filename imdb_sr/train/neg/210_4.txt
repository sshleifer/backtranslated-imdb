Maybe you should not compare, but Vild Styles and Styles Vars are the original Hip Hop. Beat Street has many original early hip hop artists, but it's clear that this may be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. But if you see this as the original Hip Hop culture, you're mistaken. It's exorbitant and has a Hollywood sauce. You'd better look for the first two films I mentioned. They transmitted the grain that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this film is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even sparse. This is probably because, although the story, acting, dialogue and direction are all horrible, music and dance are what people like. Yeah, I love dancing, but at the time I thought it was the electro death of Hip Hop (I'm very pleased when '86. A new generation of classic hip hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemi, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie, to mention only some), and I still do not like most of the rhythms in this movie and that's why I'm not going. I mean, Vild Stile does not have a lot of stories, but music is big and authentic. Of course, the tastes are different and that's fine. But as far as I'm concerned, this film is garbage, except for a break at a break and some of the music, so I can not evaluate it more than 4 out of ten.
