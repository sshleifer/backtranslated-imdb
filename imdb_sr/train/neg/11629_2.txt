** SPOJLERI ** HAMOSH is totally unrealistic, missing complications, and it was basically just to see the stars appear. The most suspicious scene in the film was when Shabana Azmi was showered, and then we watched her from the PSICHO TV scene. This film actually expected users to believe that the character Naseeruddin Shah has enough good memory to remember where the shootings were fired and how much! *** SPOILER STARTS *** In the end, the killer pours out his bowels Shabani Azmi long enough to allow the character of Naseeruddin Shah to pop up and shoot him! *** SPOILER PLACE *** It's a bit humorous (only a little) at first to hear directors and actors who throw insults to one another and hear Shabana Azmi exclaim: "Oh sh-t!" baaaaaaaaaad movie! Rate: ** from ********** (2 of 10)
