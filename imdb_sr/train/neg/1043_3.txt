What a bad, bad movie !!! I can not believe that all this is an exaggerated, amateur excuse for a real movie !! I left the theater in the end, stunned as to the bad direction and the camera's work! And reading fans who claim that there is truth and reality in this movie when it's all in reality is a crazy attempt to woo the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and raw. At least this movie has shown to me once and for all that Sundance Festival has become a complete joke and that showing here more signs of bad film than anything else. Avoid at all costs. You want your time back! I know that I am.
