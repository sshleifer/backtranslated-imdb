Saving is the worst so-called. Horror movie I've ever seen. There's nothing terrible about it. He does not deserve to be in such a genre. First of all, I do not see how many people can think this shit is such a great movie. If I wrote something bored and extremely funny, this would make me laugh, and it would be too uncomfortable for me to give this foolishness to others. Second: acting is terrible, and the main actress is terribly ugly. Third: the story is vain, it was used earlier, and the excuse that its cheap movie is no excuse. Read the summer report at the end of the case, he reveals the whole story. I do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to throw away something that will leave you sorry to watch it. I feel very bad for those thieves and the irony of their name. Everyone greets Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
