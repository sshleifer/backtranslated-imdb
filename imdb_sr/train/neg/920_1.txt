Seriously. I just finished my first viewing of the Demonic, and the words let me down. I remember the time when I saw Charles Band movie on film and my heart would be knocked. It was never Ves Craven or John Carpenter. He was a bastion of hope for a little man. The guy whose films came to the video store instead of the multiplex, but still shaken harder than most of the trendy garbage we normally had to bear. And now ... this. The painfully-obvious Californian footpath doubles for the "Alps", and the abandoned driving tunnel should in fact be an "ancient cave". I mean, they did not even try to go this moss thing or shoot it in a way that suggests it was something other than the old tunnel for the train! Ugh! Instead of an angry demonic gladiator, as it covers the title, we are treated with a guy who wears the latest clothing in Val-Mart. There is a fairly cold look in the body, which occasionally revives it to bend and jerks, but it does not even teach it to stand for the last five minutes. Why could not he be a villain? Instead, we have Brother Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch. Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is related to such a bag. I love movies that are so bad, they are good. Damn, I occasionally enjoy a movie that's so bad, that's just bad. This, however, is just imperceptible. A perfect example of making money, not making a quality movie.
