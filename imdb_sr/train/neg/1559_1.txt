This might be the worst movie I'll ever see if I live up to 100 years old. I think a group of first-class students could think of better plot lines as a class project than this. I'm stupid that I watched it, and God is pitiable to the souls paid to produce this movie. After I finally turned it off, I had a need for vomiting. /> No one had a clue about photography when he did this. No one had the idea of ​​acting. Nobody had any idea about anything. I can not believe that F / Ks sometimes show this shit. The only time I saw him on one of Starz! channels - not even the main one. And that's about three o'clock in the morning.
