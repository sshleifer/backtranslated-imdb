"Vhite Noise" had the potential to be one of the most striking films of The Ecorcist. Since the EVP is allegedly true, it was really easy to go on to be a real fact. There are not many movies that really make fears in people's minds. As I said, this movie could have, but it's not. The film itself degraded itself to the passionate PG-13 low-end film. Nothing can be compared to "Ring" or "Sixth Reason." Someone really should take responsibility in the horror industry and just make a movie that does not just make us think, it just makes us jump, scream, everything the horror film should do. I am honestly ill from the PG-13 Horror Genre, because it becomes his own genre. We need old days, blood and bloody day, Freddie Kruger, Jason, the days of Mike Miers. Few films can think that this mentality is not so scary. Then why try to get it out? A few good jumps in this movie are nothing more than one of the stupid endings in the history of the film without any resolution ... do not spend money on this movie.
