I would not be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say that this could be a good performance .. This show is good only if you do not know what the "talent" is .. I will not even say it is offensive it (I know it can be offensive to many people), because that's not exactly what bother me about the show. What is troubling me is that people are watching this and think it's funny ... It seems to me that our generation is getting stupid and actually scared that someday they will be guided by people who watch this garbage. Silvermen) goes through everyday life .. It's like .. As if it was not done a million times .. In fact, almost every joke is either done or is racist .. Sarah also likes to sing .. I love her voice .. it's .. no lyrics ... The lyrics are awesome .. who loves to sing about many things .. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to see hot women put all the rest down and make they feel like shit while at the same time fart and talk about every race, then this show for you ..
