If there is a grade of 0 stars, I will be happy to split it into this absolutely horrible pile of waste. The fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that, if made different, could be brilliant, it only worsens the situation. The basic task of closing a group of people in an experimental chamber is fine, but VHERES EXPERIMENT? All I see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes who are chatting about music and culture that I do not know or want to know about ... The challenges are pathetic and stupid. The reality of TV is to show REALITY. If you pose a 'challenge', do not play with excessive food props and stereotypical cultural elements in 'Friday Night Nights'. make them a real challenge. And as far as 'earning' money awards are concerned, that's fine, if they are really used! These people are crazy. If you just made the show a better one, the real idea would be magnificent. But that will not happen!
