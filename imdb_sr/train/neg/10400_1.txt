Enough enough ... Sometimes they just have to stop making movies based on a concept that's long dead. The first Tremors film was excellent. The other was ridiculous. The third was tortuous. The TV series was depressively terrible. And this film only drives the stake. Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry, now we have a series set in the Wild West, in the 1800s, and are fighting against grabowes. As a repetition of the first, they must learn how to beat them all. I guess it's a little fun. Otherwise, this direct video, just like Tremors 2 and 3, goes too far. Oh, and I keep wondering how this event was never recorded ... did they simply forget to record this unprecedented event? I think that something like this would be making history, so our friends in the first movie would not be so unprepared. Films like this one that destroy the original just drove me out. Avoid this trash.
