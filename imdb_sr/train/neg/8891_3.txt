He is easily the most famous of all Shakespeare's plays seriously disappointed. A bad direction, stagnating in studio work and unusual performances spoils a fine tragedy. In the city of Verona, the hoodies and Montagues have been fought for centuries, but the tragedy is inevitable when Patrick Ricart is born, and Montague falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), Capulet. The bloodshed is coming out soon ... Work in the studio, especially in the daily scenes, seriously stagnates the energy of the show. It's a story that, with its energy, deserves to be shot outdoors. Together with this, the costumes are disgusting, with too many hooligans and funny clips. The battle on the stage looks terrible, with too much strain and running around to make it attractive. He controls the intensity of the character when the action takes place, but his magnificent accent and the mild, often non-expressive eyes limit his reach. It's very difficult for the audience to connect with this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be good Julie - she records a naive character, but a little more disturbance would be welcome. Supporting roles are not much better. Laurent O'Connor's brother is fine, but too many of his best lines are cut out. Mercutio Anthony Andrevs is on the scene, not on the camera. He pushes and gestures too much and looks pretty funny. Alan Rickman, underlining his role, has virtually no presence as Tibalt. He developed the edge and intensity to deliver some fine performance on the screen in later years, but this has not been proven here. The prince can be a great role with his short performances, but actor Lavrence Naismith does not give the role of cameras. Only Micheal Hordern, in his best role in this series, comes out of this with any dignity. His hood is well-played and a joy to watch. Take one of the other versions of this story.
