This film is similar to the play "Blithe Spirit" written by Noel Covard. The action of a woman's ghosts and media is closely related to Covard's writing. I am surprised that films of this nature do not recognize the concept of the original writer. I understand that the public may not be aware that this is something that happens, but it is. Husbandly. These films are so expensive to produce. I'm really joking when the script is genuine. I even had fun when it was an innovative way to produce the work that was previously published. Some samples are listed (such as Topper, etc.). I understand that movies are still a relatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I am not satisfied when the taste of the public is taken for granted. In this situation, the taste of the public is ignored. I am looking forward to a better production of movie entertainment. In this case. I'd rather see the show.
