"Cave people" exceeded my expectations, not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. Basically, here's the show: Cave people are an alternative race, they face prejudice, etc. It's very possible the dumbest idea ever made; They were almost a decent prison for writers. One performance had cavemen who entered the club, tried to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. This was reminiscent of listening to Andi Rooney's 22-minute dialogue, followed by the death of knives of knives over dwarf cannabis. For those who have not seen this show, here's a sample of the dialogue: "You're sure you're okay with going out with a caveman." "Yes, that's fine. I had ten thousand!" Funny ... Maybe the best I ever saw. 22 minutes of cave people with terrible makeup, solving serious social problems ... Sounds like a fun night. I also love how bad recent ideas are to resort to making sitcoms from car insurance ads. I wonder if the next Gecko will do, so I can get a new title for the worst performer I've ever seen. I would even say this is worse than "Viva Laughlin". At least the "Viva Laughlin" was stripped of something that was inspired. Such shows give me hope that there is a comet somewhere in the Earth. Irresponsibly sincerely ...)
