I found Horrorvision almost invisible. Although I was only 70 minutes in length, I still encountered a rewind button in advance. The act was "if I scream and say *** to a very intense" school. And the story was at best a scenario that still needs to be elaborated. Until I go to Full Moon for an excellent movie, I've never seen them produce such bad things as this.
