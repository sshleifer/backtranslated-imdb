I can not say exactly what I mean about this film, it's against the guidelines, I've watched lots of movies, and this must be the worst yet, Extremely low budget, I assume that all money was invested in the slaughter scenes because I could have better than the camera 8mm and the crew of the apes. It was so bad that I registered only to comment, because I had to tell somebody, the place to rent the movie was not enough. But this is my value of 2 cents, I suggest that I borrow from some poor juice that rented it and I watched it. Because I certainly would not spend money on it again. I am leaving you with this commentary. I hope you did not make a place to rent when they will not give you back money .. =)
