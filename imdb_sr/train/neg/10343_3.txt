The Golden Age of Disney cartoons dying until the end of the 90's. This Shov Kuack Pack should not be considered even the DuckTales spin because the show has barely had anything to do with DuckTales. It's about teenage Huei, Devei, and Louie, who create problems for their uncle Donald and talk in hip-hop genres and are fully dressed as opposed to DuckTales. I prefer the little adventurous nephews from DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg, and ducks are the only animals that live in Duckburg. No references to Scrooge McDuck. Stories are repetitive, action is boring, but animation is good. If you want a lot of humorous humor, I recommend this to you. If you want a better Disnei shov, "Darkving Duck" or "DuckTales".
