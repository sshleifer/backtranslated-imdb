In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think that every studio can make Westerners, except Varner bros. They try a few times, it's always funny (except perhaps because they died with their boots - that the cavalry is west.) I read Humphrei Bogart, watching James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head, said that Looks Like mushroom. The truth! Kagni and Bogart are too urban, too much KSK centuries to be credible in the Western film. The story here was not surprising, and it did not help. Every 10 minutes, I realized that I can see Bogart and Kagney drop their small pistols and put their hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a black car of the 1930s.
