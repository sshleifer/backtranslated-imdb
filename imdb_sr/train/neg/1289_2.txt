This was the new lowest level in the West. Writing is terribly bad, the characters are impossible to point out and are disgusting, and violence is terribly and technically not very convincingly executed. And Tobei Maguire shows us the other side of his talent, the moonlight through his part with those fuzzy eyes and his rugged voice that only issues manirism here. 'Ride Vith the Devil' is one of my five worst film experiences ever, a western one that will never be overcome in a negative way.
