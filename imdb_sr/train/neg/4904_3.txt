Teamo Supremo are three children consisting of their leader - Captain Krendall, Girl with a rope and Skate Lada, with their own battles (buza! Chika! Voopa!) And equipment and movements. They work for governor, Kevin, and they are recruited after they wanted to be heroes and play in that game. They also lead normal lives and have family and school duties, but most actions take place outside schoolteachers. Zlikovci have rather unique and unique features, such as Mr. Vague and his people who never know what their plans are, but still behave. From the evil robot to the vicious baron, the three of them have to meet with them and stop their evil, and often strange, plans to gain power, vengeance, etc. The animation is quite beautiful and smooth, but the style seems to be deliberate. Backgrounds have overlapping colors, and buildings look futuristic. The music is pretty good, and the show is not very bad, although the style is not my favorite. Plots are almost always meaningless and funny, but it's still a cartoon and you can not blame them for that. However, it would not be in the same ranking as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
