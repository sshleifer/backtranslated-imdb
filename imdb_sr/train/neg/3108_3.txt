Another chapter on the current issue, what happened with the sense of humor Mela Bruce? It starts pretty well, with Mel as Trumpy mogul Goddard Bolt ("You can call me God"), who accepts a bet that he can not live on the street for 30 days. But at the moment when the film comes out on the street, it turns into a mess that is loaded with a path, with occasional "ridiculous" pieces (Mel sees a black dancing kid and tries to make guild gangs and wings, hip, hip). Leslie Ann Varren is nothing but lost. The worst part is the music number of this film, in which Brooks and Varren are playing a quiet dance at Cole Porter "Easi to Love". Brooks's musical parodies are most often in his films; here she plays the whole thing, like a dance copy from an older guest star on "The Carol Burnett Shov" (where Rudi DeLuca, co-writer of this film, began his career). Start renting Charlie Chaplin KID, who was covering the same country 70 years ago and did a lot
