This film was bad, at least! The abundance of top-class cars is embarrassed to be featured in this LAME movie. It starts with a race of L.A. to Las Vegas to finish for 1HR 45min ... in the Ferrari F430. I did this for 1HR 50min in the small 4-cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie does not fit those cars. Obviously, these writers are precisely this and are probably driving under the speed limit with their hands at 10 and 2 hours. I remember seeing on the news that Eddie Griffin broke down a $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo that went 30-40 MPH >>> ioutube.com/vatch? V = cNVrMZKS2kms <br /> I .. The director of ANDI CHENG is the biggest SELLOUT !!! He shames his race. I wonder only how many people orally pleased to break into Hollivood. He participated in a film that shows American America in such a negative and FALSE way. Asian women >> whores for cheap money. Asian men >> are losing compulsive gamblers and thugs who are constantly beaten. What is the fear of the Asians? Why should they always be displayed in such a negative connotation? I'm sick of how Hollywood UDEK portrays the Asians in ANY negative and false excuses.
