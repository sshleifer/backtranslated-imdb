I rarely do these comments, but I felt compelled to spare others that I suffered in watching this movie. It's so stupid and unbelievable both in the whole story and in the details that you just can not stop believing. The problem starts early, when you see a government researcher gathering in the new Porsche and dining with his team at a restaurant that looks like a castle, looking at the Capitol building in Washington, DC. Such a life on the government's side? Hah! It just worsens. In the end, when a bad guy starts killing good guys, this other group stupidly plays you want to die in order to cleanse the genetic fund. Special effects are pretty good - the money of each producer can buy it - and the main actors were great in other films, but the scenario and direction are moronic. Many people wondered if there was some deliberate intelligence behind the previous, fantastic stupid movies of Paul Verhoeven (Shovgirls, Starship Troopers), but this film should stop questioning. He's just bad.
