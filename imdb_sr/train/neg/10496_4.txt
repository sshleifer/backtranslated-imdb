Gdai Mates! I just watched Croc Hunter movie. It was fine, but the performance seems more real. this seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funny lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described Snake Zombies as subcutaneous needles. ieeeovch! For real you know it hurts. and I can not jump high? Everyone seizes them for a tail and stuff. There were two MAJOR photographs in this film. when Terry discovers that baby Joey goes like "We have to nurse them, just like a baby." Voah! I thought he'd be picking up and breast-feeding that kid. it would still be PG-13. While he was on Terry, did anyone notice a film and a lot of what Terry knew about ritual mating. She knows her sexual things. the film takes place in Kueensland, Australia. I want the koala, dingo and joei! Steve's Dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. although a small one who turned out to be useless against the fierce dynamics. Oh, and if anyone else sees this, try to agree with me to say that this peasant dog breed was right in the shot from the crocodile. ate her sheep! I'd be crazy too!
