What the "executive producer" is doing in the film. If I remember correctly, it is a person who has raised financial support to make a movie. In a number of films played by Sean Conneri, you may notice that he is the executive producer, which meant that Conneri himself raised money because he was the main player. Unfortunately, it should be emphasized that a large number of films played by Sean Conneri made exclusively because he managed to raise money because he is the main Hollywood player, this is usually an indication that once the credits have been read that the executive producer and star of the movie is one and the same film in itself is nothing other than a starred vehicle with a story / scenario that is not scratching PROTOCOL follows the saga of a Sunni Davis kooky bimboeskue cocktail waitress who advances Mrs. Davis (who has trouble combining two sentences) , results in unusual and less likely situations. Havn, who is also the executive film producer, do you understand what I'm saying about the story / scenario is not the beginning?
