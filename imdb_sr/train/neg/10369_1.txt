As a writer I find films that are so bad, which makes it a production of complete slapping in the face. Talk about insults. I write better stories than in the 8th grade. Poor acting, bad writing, poor directing, and when the result is added, the result is complete and complete failure. The only thing that this movie can accomplish is to deceive consumers not to waste time. Who would have a bad light written so badly? It's not artistic, smart, smart, tense, mysterious, scary, dramatic - NIS. The characters are flat and boring without development. The parcel is recycled as an aluminum can. Somehow they managed to cast several famous actors who must all be quite desperate for the job or hope that one of these budget independent films will prove to be the next "Pulp Fiction". This script should have been used to set up a cage for birds, not a movie. Oh, and last but not least, a woman of 5'210 lb, of course, has the strength to kill men and women twice as high without a fight and one stroke. Avoid this bomb as it will infect you with STD.
