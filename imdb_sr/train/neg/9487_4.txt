Actors, although nothing special, everyone is doing a good job, the story looks like a good idea, the scenario is tolerable and the end has a pretty good craft; So what's wrong with him? For starters, special effects are really bad (if it's done in the 1960s), it might look fine, but in 2003 there's simply no justification for visual effects like that. I am laughing at the fact that the DVD is very proud of the Jeepers Creepers special effects creators. Second, the direction is weak, this movie simply does not record the essence of the story, Doctor. giving souls to hospital prisoners in a devil (or a creature of a demonic type) should be tense or scary; It's just not. All in all, this is a pretty bad movie, and although it's tolerable and sometimes mildly fun, it's probably best to leave it alone. A pretty sad 4/10
