Kevin Spacei is very talented, but unfortunately the director is not his forte. I had great expectations about the movie before I rented it and maybe it did not appeal to me so much. I admire Spacey's attempt to make a movie that takes place mostly in a small environment, but this is not an attempt to count. I found the film boring, boring and stretched. The act was nothing spectacular. Garry Sinise did much better, especially since he is aware of most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films. The only thing that impressed me about this movie was one shot of a car wreck from above. The central line of the road was perfectly centered, and the camera was moving along the line and behind the wreck. However, that shot was a very "ordinary suspect" and I presume that Spacei got an idea from that earlier film (which is very good). If you want to see an incredible movie that takes place in a small environment, take a look at Hitchcock's lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have watched her before you take this.
