Terrible use of scene cuts. All continuity was lost, either because of a horrible scenario or lethargic direction. That evil robot ... must have been a jazz dancer? Also, one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard (monologues who usually drown with music.) And ... where did they get the props? That ship looks like a cardboard of milk ... I had better special effects at 8mm at the age of 13! I would recommend to every student of the film to watch this movie (5 minutes) so how to learn how to not make a movie. Or ... is the editor's fault? It's really bad, because the scenario was actually a good concept ... just poorly done to the end. (I'm sorry, Malcom. You should have sent a "duel." You're too good an actor for such a stinking bomb.)
