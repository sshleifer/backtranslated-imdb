Well, at first I was excited to download an animated open source movie just to destroy it demo tape. The animation is excellent, the synchronization of the lips is terrible, and you are watching the movie, hoping to understand what's going on, just to realize that nothing happens. You do not feel emotions for the characters, just a pity for the creators who spend their time. I've seen short dual emotions in half an hour! This could be a great short film, if they just took time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone in Blender is excited to show off their software and its rendering capabilities, but the sad story is what makes the movie.
