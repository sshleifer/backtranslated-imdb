This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead. He uses it first to his brother when he is killed in the drive. His brother then infects other members of the gang. In some scenes, zombies are seen very slowly, and in other scenes they run quickly, which does not make much sense. The acting is central, but the story does not help the movie. Makeup consists of blood on the face of zombies. I'm sure the budget for this film was very limited. I believe that the film could have been better made that the story was more original and with a better budget. If you do not want to see a good zombie, you do not see this.
