All I could imagine while I was watching this movie was B-grade. Many talked about his redeemed quality, as this film depicts the realistic presentation of the effects of the drug and the individual and their later spiral in a self-sustaining state of unfortunate events. However, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were excessive and therefore unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. and intricate. You can read most of the other reports about this movie and they will say almost the same as I would. It is permissible for some actors and actresses to be attractive, but when faced with such annoying action ... it seems to be only a movie now. The action is bad and broken: a few shots thrown there and there and the final shot to the end. Nothing really needs to be written about it. As others have said, "bad" movies are great for watching for the very reason that they are "bad", you enjoy the fact. This film, however, is a void. Nothing. Moreover, if there really is an educational film that would scare people away from using drugs then I would seriously recommend any number of other films dealing with such issues in a much more effective way. 'Rekuiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and contempt in Las Vegas' and 'Candi' are just some of the examples. Although you should also look at some of the easier movies about the same theme as 'Go' (Total, Serious and Fun) and 'Halfbaked'. In the end, the one who can use the line in this film, released by Vinnie Jones, was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Tvo Smokling Barrels'. Thinking that something of that great film was infected "Loaded" is corrupt. All in all, I strongly suggest that you save money and your time by not looking at this movie.
