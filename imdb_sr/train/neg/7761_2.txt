After a series of power interruptions at a remote zoo on the island, genetically modified tigers are at large and fierce residents of the island. Man, the sci-fi channel has made some bad "original" movies, but I think this may be their worst so far! This poorly written and directed "Jurassic Park" offers all the usual clich√©s (crazy scientists who think that people have been killed by "miraculous losses"), characters walking only long dark corridors, teenagers who work only in the brain movie is to die a terrible death, etc.), and, not surprisingly, there is no uncertainty. The special effects are horrible - the head of dolls in the major plans of the titular beast are bad enough, they look like rigid tufted dolls, but CGI, which makes computer-generated dinosaurs in the "Walking from dinosaurs" looks alive in comparison? They're just terrible. There are some worse, but most seem pretty unconvincing. Oh, and the mortal scene of scientists in the end is really one of the worst things I've seen for years. I could not even even smile that it was so bad! Do not waste time, this is really really bad. 2/10. Oh, and here are some interesting attractions for you: this movie borrowed music characters from the 2003 sci-fi movie "Alien Hunter", which was far superior to this shit.
