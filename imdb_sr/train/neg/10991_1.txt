My brother is a passionate DVD collector. He looked at one envelope (two models on the toilets) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed with him to watch what turned out to be probably the easiest film (I use that term freely) I felt obliged to sit. I did not dare to get in touch with my brother, he surely cursed the account in his squeezed poet. The biggest name in the whole film is Michael Clark Duncan, which appears in one scene, and the "film maker" has decided to show every shot (about four in total) through the film. Actually, the whole movie follows this suit. The fact that the DVD contained deleted images was a shock. (However, I went to bed without looking at him). Not surprisingly, I found this disc without the case behind the TV a week later.
