This sequel is totally uneven, unwitting and wandering into a "plot" (if there is indeed) and trying too damn hard to be modern (funny, pre-style songs are in style in the 21st century style) and sweet (zeh: too much has been produced, with the animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile conspiracy. Even Glenn Close (and she's usually very good) goes through this film, parodied like the original De Ville and the lead from the Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that does not even look good. This is a very good example of a bad and meaningless sequel. Even Basic Instinct 2 had complicated, characteristic and acceptable behavior. This is not. That's bad.
