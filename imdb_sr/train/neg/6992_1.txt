The action refers to a female nurse named Anna, who is caught in the middle of a world chaos while eating zombies begin to grow and take over the world and attack the living. She runs on the streets and is rescued by a black cop. It's good for now! I usually enjoy horror films, but this movie does not deserve to call it a horror movie. It's not even exciting, just funny. Even "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like looking at a pile of bloodthirsty drunks who are not able to get into the shopping center for more alcohol. The heroes who closed in shopping mall, to avoid eating them out, are no better. Although they seem to be not drunk, they leave the impression that they are mentally handicapped. Save money instead of spending it on this!
