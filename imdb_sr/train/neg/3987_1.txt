I got out of a couple of films before they finished, but I could not finish this piece of garbage. This was the greatest burden of racism that was trying to pass as a legitimate film since the birth of the nation. The characters were slightly more than cartons. I do not see how any actor wants their name to be linked to this movie. Lee needs to have better things to do to throw out such garbage. I know that I and anyone with the brain have better things ... to look at the dry color. I would like someone to make a film about interracial relationships that really deal with this topic. There is much more depth in this subject, the shallow ranking of an outraged director such as Lee.
