But I got over. It seemed to me that even the author of the book favored Caroline. I was so sorry about the character of Louise, and she was constantly compared to Esau who was evil, I just felt that the comparison was a bit rough and unrealistic. Still, the film was bad. I would not really see it, unless you are ready for a great downturn.
