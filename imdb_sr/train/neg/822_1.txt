There are two parts of this film. First, there is a funny prologue of the film that is so hysterical and concordant that it would almost certainly be appropriate for the 'Simpsons' Troy McClure to narrate. Then the rest of the film begins (starting with the title song that really does not fit into the rest of the film), which, although technically okay, was killed by an obscure, inconsistent and unconvincing complication, not only uninteresting characters, but characters which do not make sense. This is especially true of Spivent Mickey Rooney, who was allegedly involved in the plot and part of the 'organization' all the time, but what would have happened if Hackman apparently arbitrarily decided to take him with him? In that case he would be a totally redundant and unnecessary figure, which is in the end and further. The overall problem of the movie is that it is completely reluctant to put any detail on who or what after this conspiracy. As if the filmmakers did not have the courage to tell us that a certain part of the society would be able to create such an organization and instead hoped that the lack of explanation would be sufficient and the audience would make their own conclusions. Simply put, the film fails at all levels.
