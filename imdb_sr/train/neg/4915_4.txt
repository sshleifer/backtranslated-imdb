One of the previous reviewers wrote that there seems to be no middle ground for opinions on Love Story; Someone loved or hated it. But there seems to be a significant distribution of thoughts on a scale from 1 to 10. For me, this movie is rated as 4. There are some beautiful scenes and locations, and Rai Milland turns into an incredible job like Oliver's father. But the film did not do a particularly striking job to tell your story, and the story was not so unique to justify multiple views, at least not for me. Maybe I'm a little snob, but I'm avoiding movies with Ryan O'Neal - I have not seen Barry Lindon - because most of them, but not all, have been ruined because of me because of his presence. The sole exception is Vhat Up, Doc ?, in which his direct performance is perfectly underlined for the stupid protagonist Barbra Streisand - and, by no means, he takes the chance for Love Story for good measure! McGrav and O'Neal are inclined to turn their lines, not to play them. This film is distinguished by the beginning of a fine career: it was the first film by Tommy Lee Jones.
