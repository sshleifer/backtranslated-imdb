First, this is a very outdated movie, which is not focused in its presentation of the left political revolution. Frankly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to stop being an intellectual (which in itself is meaningless, since the answer is just because it's intellectual), it's down to despair; as if everyone should return to monkeys in the name of equality - it's simply funny. Our intellectuality is just one of many human qualities, but that does not mean that we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible level. But without a doubt, this impersonal message is associated with Godard's use of rock music; From there and Rolling Stones. The song 'Simpathi for the Devil', whose creation we have witnessed and from which film is named, is actually nothing special. The sequence of chords, which is not particularly original, was used for a much better effect in Led Zeppelin's 'Thank You' (Led Zeppelin II). In addition, 'Sir' Mick Jagger declares in his usual nebulous way (like Bob Dylan) - notice how the first melodic phrase repeats again to form a verse. The black panthers shown in this film, seemingly do not know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes include the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that actually undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the sixties and today (indeed, a message that will disrupt the behavior of Rolling Stones at the time the film was filmed). No wonder, DVD is free with The Sundai Times! For a true historical exhibition of sympathy for the left, listen to the masterpiece of Luigi Nona, "Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore".
