I do not remember coming out of the cinema except this one. And not only that, but I was with 7 friends, and we all wanted to go. An inconsequential plot, clay characters, violence without meaning. I did not care when the good guys died; I did not care when the bad guys got it. Fantasy and magic were as thick as pudding of the liver and there was no coherence. In short, fine fun if you accidentally spend eternity in hell.
