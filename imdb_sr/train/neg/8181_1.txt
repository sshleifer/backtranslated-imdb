I went to see this movie (I actually went to see Famili Portraits, which included Cutting Moments + 2 other short film by Douglas Buck) at Mar del Plata (Argentina) ... I could not watch! I had to cover my eyes after the first half of the cutting times and sometimes I looked. As it was over, my stomach was turned upside down and I felt a light head. I just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the second short start (BTV, of course, I was not the only one who left the room). It was VAAAAI too violent and disgusting for me! I am impressed with the many brave people who loved him. I just do not understand how you can love such films! The shocking and bloody and terrible images I've seen are stuck in my head for two days !! I'm also trying to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw it all and told me about it) and I just do not think it makes any sense. I mean, this amount of violence and stuff, it makes no sense other than trying to shock people. I do not think this is a good enough reason. There is absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say "Well, at least" to "the thing about it was good". But well, I guess I will never understand such films.
