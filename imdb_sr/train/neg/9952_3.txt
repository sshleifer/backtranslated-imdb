I just sent a friend's message to the film school about this film. Something that should be avoided when making a movie - characters playing senseless, exaggerated, tangled monologues on the screen that are ultimately banal and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal prohibitions are so outspoken that they actually draw attention to a movie that is designed as a film and effectively neutralize that intention. Is it an act, or a bad script, or both? Deep solo monologues while drunk? And how is such an unattractive, unappreciated and verbally damaging character capable of sleeping most women who meet within minutes of meeting them? (I had to applaud when one fish finally kicked him out in the street, despite his sneeze and self-pity). . The upcoming fate of mankind, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our forehead or right hand in a bizarre biblical mode, is presented to a person who is so cleverly exposed in his role as guardian of empty space. This film is hidden and at the top - the melodrama is clumsily permeated by the "philosophy" of the pedestrians about the meaning of humanity, life, and so on. It is banal, tense and fatigued. There are some very fine English films available with content similar to this movie. "Nil bi Mouth" is a great, far more interesting trip to the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu. Ditto for "In the Varzone". And although the comparison is not even justified, check out something from Peter Greenaway, who far more skillfully manages dialogue, spiritual and absurd characters and situations.
