If "Exorcist II: Heretic" did not do any service to him in 1977, it's hard to imagine what Richard Burton's theoretical extraordinary figure saw in this gray exercise in non-excitement. You've already seen this: Burton plays a writer who has discovered that at an early age he has the power to move inanimate objects through the power of his mind (and you thought that "Carrie" had no effect on Hollivood!). Although adapted from the novel Peter Van Greenavaia, "Medusa" is played as recycled goods, although the special effects in the cathedral's finishing are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the auxiliary head is extremely weak. Burton is hammi but tired ... even telekinesis can not save him. * 1/2 of ****
