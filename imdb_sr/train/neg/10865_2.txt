I like munna bhai MBBS or "Lagge raho ..." SUKS really SUKS. I never saw such a boring film in my life. And these high ratings really amazed me that Wad happened with the taste of Indian movie viewers? ** MAY BE A SPOILER ** An educated girl needs advice from Bhai, people who discuss their personal problem. on phones, come to the man from which part of the world in r? I agree that movies should be fictitious, but these things are really unbelievable. 2 out of 10. (2 stars are in 15 minutes of good start)
