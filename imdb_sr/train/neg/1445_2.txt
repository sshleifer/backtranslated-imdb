OK. It's not bad to make movies if it was from the original script. But it's not! Which part "There are no women in this story, except Foulat and Gagool" Hagard's introduction does not understand producers, directors and writers? I mean, it's pretty ordinary English. I understood it at 10 years! The beauty of the KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, colonial Africa, an intractable desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. It should be more than enough for even the earliest manufacturers to work. But, nooo, they have to throw a "romance" into it. Pathetic. A suggestion to all the poor souls who thought it would be close to the book. Give up on that. Until Peter Jackson vannabe appears and "do it right", you can still read the book again. BTV, here is a continuation of books (actually pre-kuel) called Allan's wife. It gives a background to the story of Kuatermain. It's a little bit creepy or good.
