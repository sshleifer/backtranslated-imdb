I could not deal with this movie. She failed to engage me intellectually, neither emotionally nor aesthetically. The dialogue was very dense and unhappy. I could not connect with these characters and worry about them and I find it hard to find something that is positive to say about it. I read that it needs to be properly understood. to know some of the more vague aspects of Catholic theology. I will admit that, as an atheist, I'm probably not familiar with many finer details of Catholicism, but I have seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal for the human condition and do not rely on specialized knowledge or beliefs .
