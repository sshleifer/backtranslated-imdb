This movie has become an old hat, is not it? The whole thing is a syrupic nostalgia that has turned into a kind of feedback loop. Sounds like a good idea: a great acting team, some good jokes, and some human drama about what it might / may have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that links them all, as it was in "The Big Chill," one of those movies that created films like this one. You end up with the desire to see more than one or two specific men instead of taking one short. The superficiality that this creates is not only boring, but also disturbing. The script below the average does not help.
