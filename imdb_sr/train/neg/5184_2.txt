I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy with Hip Hop, but I was disappointed at many levels. First of all, the story is so recycled that it is almost unbearable. Second, the environment, acting and stories are not very authentic or convincing. Third, there are many more good black actors to choose from these standard types. And some originality? Thirdly, there were very few Hip Hop songs that were played in the entity - if any. None looked centrally. All in all, the film was a great disappointment, but the style of editing was very interesting and almost made the movie worth the effort.
