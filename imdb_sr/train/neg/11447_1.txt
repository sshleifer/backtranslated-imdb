Probably the worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to go out after the first ten minutes. The only people who laughed at the theater were tinners. Do not misunderstand me, I adore stupid, stupid movies just like the next one, but the whole premise, writing and humor have made it harder. I thought they were going for Napoleon Dynamites with a feeling - weird and random scenes that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, in the end he was forced, unpleasant, and weird. The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I just felt terribly terrible that she (and Sissi Spacek) applied for this terrible thing. /> Thanks, I did not pay.
