This film shows a shot of animal mutilations of an animal that has been chopped off with a machete and bled off her skin. I know that these terrible things happen in the world, but I'm watching movies based on the fact that what I'm looking at does not really happen on the screen. These life spots are not intended to be in movies, they are intended to show people belonging to certain organizations to help the terrible things that people do to other species. I also contact Netflik and other resources to collaborate with this movie! This film should be removed from the public. The person who made this film needs psychological help.
