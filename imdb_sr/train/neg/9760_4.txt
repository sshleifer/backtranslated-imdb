The cameraman's crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so the Israeli side dominated the scene. I was hit by almost completely opposite views of my mother. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the opportunity of enormous life. The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of life in want and despair. With such totally different views, each meeting did not have a real chance for any meeting of the mind. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for each of them. Peace to the Palestinians was freedom. Peace for the Israelites was security. With such an abyss, is this kind of movie truly worth a lot? I ended up feeling that I was watching a senseless propaganda - both sides were unpredictable.
