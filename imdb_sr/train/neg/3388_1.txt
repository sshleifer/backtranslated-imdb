I admit that I was a fan of original stage production. I never watched the movie version until recently on the cable, and I watched it with anticipation, to see my memories revived, because I loved the original show. Imagine my anxiety. This must be the worst translation on Broadway that has ever been filmed. They changed the story, changed the songs, lost their souls. I was expecting a journey through a souvenir, singing unusually touchy music and a mirror, ballet and Hello twelve, Hi thirteen. Not! Not only did they distort music in an almost unrecognizable spot, but they messed up the story, adding songs and exteriors (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) that were not present in the original, and injected "drama" where it was not needed. The original had enough pathos. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, do not be tormented. I'm sorry I lost my time, and diluted my memories, watching this hot.
