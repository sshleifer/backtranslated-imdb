The couple moves to their dream home, unaware that he and his neighbors are built on land that used to be used as a cemetery. The film is said to be based on a true story, although it does not reveal how accurate it is. The plot is barely unique - see Spielberg's "Poltergeist" (1982). In a short time, they experience various supernormal phenomena: they move from disturbing - mysterious shadows, serious daughters' illness - to genuinely funny - toilets that are constantly washed out and garage doors go out of control. There is little depth of the story: when we find that the land was used as a cemetery, we no longer learn anything. It seems that the plot does not develop. The characters are not particularly well-drawn or in any way memorable, nor is the atmosphere particularly special. The movie could interfere with some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any positive message from it.
