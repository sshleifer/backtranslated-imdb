Only a few segments are engaged here. The segment with a garage attendant from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins makes his point, turns around by rotation until the final shot has overtaken it. The problem with this movie is that only a few shots call Paris. The others are so scattered by the theme, the tone, the will and the production that you can also watch "The Best Years of Advertising, 2006" It's really everywhere. It does not develop over time, and nothing prevails in the directors. None of the structures are joined by parts ... so far it is set. -commercial, excessively produced vampire scarf. It has much to do with Paris as an old woman engaging in Antarctica. Fantasy appears. I think first in the Coen brothers segment (Uh, thank you J & E for destroying another movie) and then it appears too much. The purpose of staying in Paris is that you do not need a nonsense to make your days extraordinary. Why split him around the district if Quartier de la Madeleine is equal to the vampires for a losing director? Has there ever been a genre that was more represented than a vampire movie. Every three years we get the same chrome clich√©s for the vampires. The thing is worse because the transition from segment to segment is quite harmless. Get lost. This does not feel intentional, it feels messy.
