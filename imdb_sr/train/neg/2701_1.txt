First, yes, I am white, so I try to slowly walk into all the delicate topic of the race ... anyway ... White people hate black people = BAD but blacks who hate white people = OK (because we deserve it !! ). Where do I start? I wish I had something good to say about this movie aside from unplanned comedy scenes: the notorious scene was Ice Cube and co. You fight with some really big, really strong, really angry and scary neo-Nazis and win !!! neo-Nazi where it is twice as big :), and potera! it's priceless ... This is not a movie about race, tolerance, and understanding, it does not bring ... this is a racist film that confirms all cliches of stereotypes, the white guy who is crushed by a black roommate is automatically transformed into skinhead ... I'm simply terribly sorry what I saw. Save your time and terrible experience of badly written, bad acting, boring and clearly biased pictures, you are dealing with the topic, go and rent American history Ks, now it's a movie
