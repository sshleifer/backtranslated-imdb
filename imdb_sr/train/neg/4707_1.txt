OMG this was the hardest experience of my life watching this. I could even finish what happened to Nick. Their best thing at teenage Nick is Drake and Josh, and it will soon turn out. Children's songs are boring, and children. My younger sister wanted to watch a show because she likes everything that comes to Disney or Nick, but after completing this show, she said "one of the worst shows I've ever seen so bored". My little brother actually fell asleep and envy him. In short, if your old people with no brain activity enjoy this show, now change the channel.
