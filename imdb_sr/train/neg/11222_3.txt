Cibil Richards makes another masterpiece of Full Moon / Surrender Cinema erotic. This time, Jackualine Lovell (dressed in pretty expensive silver clothing) has the task of destroying all evidence of sexual activity. However, she can not resist watching the tape and she loves them. The scene scene is well recorded and set to top music (at least for this type of movie). Actors are largely horrible and mostly very average. Jacqueline Lovel is her extremely attractive self, and between watching sex files she manages to uncover her breasts and a little bit below her. It also fits into a small lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves much better than this kind of travel. Here she looks great naked, but in fact she is much more attractive in her silver outfit that talks about 'drama'. A completely stupid movie with Lovell and soundtrack is the only redemption right. Even for the departure of Surrender, and clearly for the new budget.
