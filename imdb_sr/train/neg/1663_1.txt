First of all, this action is exaggerated - the girl wants to do it, everyone likes, the snobbish girl intervenes, everything looks lost, the girl breaks, everyone likes it again, etc. Heroin, plus trouble with single parents, and so predictable that you can practically recite with her. Second, I really hate to continue to disassemble classical music. They send a message that everyone involved in classical music is tense and snooped and close - in fact, I do not remember exactly the quote, but I remember at one point in the movie, Holly says: "Why they have to be so tense ... so classical It's really offensive how classical music is labeled this way. Third, I've gone through dozens of times, but the only reason I can think of filming this film is to promote Britney Spears. There's no point in it. < br /> And yes, while the actress who portrayed Holly (I'm not sure if it's really her singing or not) had a reasonably good voice, it was not as unbelievable as it did - especially when it was belting. It was over time all the time. 1/10 stars.
