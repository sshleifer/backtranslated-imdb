I saw a change of goals ... twice ... and always the same feeling ... you see that Olsen twins make the same movie ... they like to play different sports, then they fall in love with the boys .. OK now about the movie .. .. first, all such little boys and girls do not play on such big goals ... 2. Football does not play on a timed car ... 3.If the game is at its end, the referee gives something overtime (a minute or more) ... and the ending is so predicted .... I think this movie is bad because of lack of knowledge about football .... if European producers did it it would be better .. and also the actors are not even real and bor ... they suffer from a lack of autentiƒçnosti..OK played some seasons in a full house but it does not make them big stars .... you have to show your talent. ... and that's what lacks Olsen's twins
