"Ektreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another "good feeling," the so-called "heart warming," and out-of-the-rating shows that ABC had time to compose. You understand the problems that these families are experiencing. I'm sorry about that. But do not you think that setting up four broad-plasma TVs, three flat-screen desktops, a basement in the basement would take half of the yard, and cabinets full of designer clothes, BIT too excessive for ANY family? Of course, these families have gone through many things. Of course, they deserve better things than they used to have. But honestly, the things that Ti Pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough to suit the whole neighborhood. Another thing that really disturbs me about this show is that You and his team always have something good to say about every little thing about the family, or the state of the family. To tell a wheelchair person that he or she is 'so strong' or 'very brave', it really gets old after a while. It may sound rude, but believe me; Look at this show, and you'll see what I mean. Overall, this performance is overestimated. If you want to watch it, just go ahead. This comment is just a heads-up for what you will look at.
