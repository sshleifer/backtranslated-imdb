Indeed, one of the most horrible films I have ever experienced. I never took enough time to write one of these, but I felt compelled to show real films after the testimony of this insult, and I feel a little bit upset that I waste time on such a piece of speech to be honest. There have been so many parts that have amazed me with their complete coincidence and lack of meaning (for example, when did the police ever kill people with infectious diseases?) If the hospitals would ever go through such people because of a lack of medication spying on their wife wandering around in his home cloak while he was carrying a pistol as she turned on the bed?). Also, the characterization - as we almost expected in such films - was terrible (for example, the way it blends - I do not recall its freaking name and does not throw it anyway - it turned completely against my girlfriend and I ran away to leave her) and In the end I wanted everyone to meet with terrible ends! The production was horribly unconnected and cinema had nothing to write about.
