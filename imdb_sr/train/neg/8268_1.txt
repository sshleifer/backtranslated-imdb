This movie is horrible. Everything was done earlier. There is nothing original. I can not stand when the writers do not make sense of their plot. One girl wants on her thirteenth birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, sounds like a movie from the '80s called Big. What's even more daring is the acting Jennifer Garner. She does not behave as if she was 13 years old. She just seems to be stupid. From then on, you can hit the entire plot. She got a good job and it happened that a friend she had at the age of 13 worked with her. Wow, how terrible! But, no ... her friend is bad and turns to her, trying to get her job done. But, of course, she wins in the end when she comes up with a "great" idea. The film is also a dance scene I've seen a thousand times before. > I hate this movie.
