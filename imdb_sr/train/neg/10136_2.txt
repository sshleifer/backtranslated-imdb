Nobody would love this movie because of its merits, but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy a movie with mugs for their quality MST3, then this is for you. There is a "Road House" for its meaningless characters, sets and stories. It was bad for me: "I want you to fire those guys" instead of "... send those guys off." F-14 leaves the carrier, but when they arrive, they are F-16! Without a sign of anger or skepticism, Segal returns to work for a general who, just minutes before, oversaw the secrets of "mind" on Seagal. Now he's running out of the bullets and resorting to a knife to kill the guards. So, of course, guards all throw weapons and fight with knives! The hand grenade is boundless, but it explodes anyway. A small secret fighter can fly from California to Afghanistan without charging fuel. Then Segal returns to California - a long journey, i.e. Through Europe - although there is a carrier that gives him air support for 20 minutes in the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the bracket consists of 3 black computers, 2 flat-panel televisions and meter and wall charts. What an asshole!
