First, it takes half an hour to get Hackman out of jail and start doing business. How we waste time, we all know that Hackman goes out to do some business for his masters, why spend almost a third of the film on these sequences. Then Hackman stays in the hotel and the arch of the story does not go anywhere again, it simply proves that Hackman is under strict supervision and everything he says or wants to know the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more wasting time showing a reunion with his wife. All of this should have taken a maximum of 10-15 minutes as simple as set-up for actual action, intrigues and complications. By the time the real action took place, I was so bored that I just wanted the film to end. Hackman is as good as usual, and other actors, but this is a failure of the first size.
