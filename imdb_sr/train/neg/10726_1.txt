I agree with the previous commentary, the beginning of the movie is pretty good, and you wandered about what will come ... What is nothing. All open stories remain open; The two characters who at first seemed to be of some importance were completely omitted from the picture, except for 1 or 2 very short scenes. I wander if Ilja does not do better to completely eliminate them ... As far as the remaining character is concerned, nothing is done with it. She only visits a terrible place, and suddenly the film is no longer about her, but about some geriatric witches who spend days making puppies of bread, drinking home vodka and apparently blinking. Some might say that the film works well in showing the disintegrating society, like IFFR judges, but for me it's just a bad taste, bad camera work, bad scenario and a terribly bad direction. So I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading: 1!
