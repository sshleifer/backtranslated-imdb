I was sadly disappointed with this film because of the fact that he was fake and that the characters were not strong enough to carry films quite a bad attempt of horror. The basic idea for the film was interesting, but unfortunately it was not able to excite me, it really scares me or shocked me - there was one part in the whole movie that I thought was terrible, but it did not even redeem it. By the end of the film I liked the character Kate because it seemed to calm down and become more realistic, the character that played Jeremy Sheffield was not actually needed for this film and I think the director / writer has taken away countless characters that were used for no purpose if I left them on basic characters, making him more solo with Keith's work, he might have succeeded - Jeremy's acting was at least a wooden one and I was embarrassed by looking at the bad chemistry of the screen - or lack of it. What a shame. Frustrating.
