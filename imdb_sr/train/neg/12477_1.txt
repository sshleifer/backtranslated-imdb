This is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit down drinking beer, eating a pizza and laughing. Unfortunately, I watched for myself. My friends and I rented a large block of films and we never could see this movie. He had to come back and realized that it was a loss not to look at him. So I did, and I was impressed how much this film is absolutely horrible. Now, I really like bad movies, and I would probably like this if the "hero" was not so disgusting. I was hoping for the entire movie to drop that stupid sword and let someone kill it! There are very few heroic things in the film. He's fat, disgusting, stupid. He has less redeeming quality than the villains. And what about all the bats? I mean, I like naked chickens just like the next one, but this movie is a bit overrated in that department. Well, in any case, if you love bad movies and you can withstand the disgusting "hero" "Then I'm sure you will like this movie.
