I was just watching this movie on TV and I have to confess, I was a little surprised that it was even turned on. There was so much nonsense, clutter and bad changes that it would be better to watch the old episode of Sesame Street. The acting was fine, but please, you can really feel the "Straight to Video" feeling. The actors / crew made this film a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but just wait ten minutes before the end to hear it. Believe me, you would not even say a difference.
