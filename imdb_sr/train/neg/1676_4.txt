Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dilan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very interesting actors who give decent performance. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Notorious for his charities, drug addicts and a guy who, despite being infected with AIDS, continues to shoot adult films, simply does not make an intriguing character. and the consequences of the brutal mass murder that occurred in the late 80's in Los Angeles, to which Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and eventually released. As in the case of OJ, the guilty factor, regardless of the outcome, was quite high in the "He did it" zone. In this film there is nobody to like, like everyone else. He's a self-serving criminal. There is nothing interesting here.
