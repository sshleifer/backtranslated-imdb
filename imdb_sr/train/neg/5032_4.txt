This film was in a science-fiction 50-puck, my friend got me for Christmas. It's very similar to the first Gozilla movie, and as that movie has scenes with American actors for no reason. One interesting thing about embedded scenes is that there is a tension of the Cold War shown between America and Russia. Like Godzilla, Gamer wakes up for atomic explosions and rampage around the world, paying attention to Tokyo, as no big monstrous film is complete if Tokyo does not bite it. All in all, this is a fine movie. Some of the scenes that include Gamer, especially the scenes in Tolyi, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at that time. If you love Japanese gigantic monster movies, you will really get out of this. I give her 4 out of 10. That this was an unmanaged Japanese version I was watching, I would probably get 5.
