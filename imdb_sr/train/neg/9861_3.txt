I sat over this at GenCon just because it was quiet and I could sleep. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and Villiam Katt? VTF? Was the lady playing Flo and Abe Vigoda busy or something like that? Indeed, a piece of awkward garbage. The characters were stereotyped without meaning (I mean ...) and wooden, most of them looked like they were on the autopilot. The so-called "hilarious" situations described in some other so-called reviews were so exhausted that I cried for the writers. , seriously. I gave her only 3 out of 10 because if she was 2 or 1, she would have to be five or more times a day for Kelli LeBrock.
