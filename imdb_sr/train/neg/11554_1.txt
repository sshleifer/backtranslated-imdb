This film is embarrassing to create a movie. I can not believe it was even mentioned as a comedy - it's not funny. Not only was the script horrible, but also people who were dealing with casting. Gail O'Grady is just a brilliant actress, but beyond that ... 99% of the rest of the actors ... yo. Almost everyone else ... Wow, it's hard even ... wow. This is the rule number one on the comedy "DO NOT TRY TO BE AWESOME". In Canada there are many very talented actors who can play drama and comedy - none of them are used in this movie. Canadian directors of nepotism and casting help maintain bad film in Canada. I understand it's a technical "American" movie, but look at the director, actors, location, etc. I just saw it on the Brava - they should be ashamed that they bought the right to show this movie. Again, there are many great movies that can not get the broadcast time and they show this shit.
