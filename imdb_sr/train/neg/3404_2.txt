I do not want to put this movie on all countless technical things, it should take two days to sketch how the whole thing is not possible. Others have already pointed out all the relevant nonsense. Given all this, I could still enjoy it, but did not include all the maudlin, nausea, anxiety, disneyies, sentimental shit that is nowhere near the city, but nowhere more than in space , where the smallest error can mean instantaneous death. The "crew" as well as the "real" astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their nonsense in front of everything else. It completely destroyed any value that production could have. I'm surprised that NASA has released this garbage so that so many people will get so much misinformation about something so important to them. If you have not seen it yet, save your irritation. Look back at Apollo 13. At least that was trying to be somehow real.
