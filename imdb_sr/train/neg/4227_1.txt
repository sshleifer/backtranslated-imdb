I'm astounded that I actually sat and watched this. I love independent movies, horror films and the whole zombie thing. But when you add ningu, you've crossed a line you would never cross. I hope that the people in this movie have had a great time, and then at least there was no total loss. You would never know that you were watching him. The script? Are you kidding. Act? I think the trees were turning. Cinema? Well, there must have been a camera there. Period. I do not think there was any real planning in this movie. So much of a total loss of time that I will not prolong it by commenting on further.
