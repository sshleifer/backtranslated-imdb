This is a very old and cheap movie - a typical B-Western with a little budget in so many ways. Gary Cooper was still not a star and this film is very reminiscent of John Wayne's early films made for poverty studies. With both actors, their famous style and persona have not yet been fully formed. This incarnation of Garia Cooper does not look exactly like Cooper just a few years later (among other things he talks faster in that early film). However, unlike the average B-movie in the era, there are at least several interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). If you ever want to see a wife who was married to Errol Flin for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita plays a woman's interest and this is a very, very strange choice for casting, because she has a heavy accent (she was French) and she was not even close to being a "movie star beautiful." Otherwise, she was married to director Michael Curtiz. But for me, the most striking and weird aspect of the film is apparently a gay subplot - like the BROKEBACK PLANE from the 1930s (and we thought this was a NEW idea). The character of Garia Cooper was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through most of the film to keep Kuper clean from females. This misogyny does not mean much in itself, but there are so many traces in the film that indicate that filmmakers were really trying to portray them as a gay couple. In particular, in the end, when one of them is killed, the other is hit by an arrow and is held to dying long enough to reach the body of his fallen friend, and then falls - with his arms around him! This was pretty tense for the time and I think this makes this boring movie really fascinating today! As for Cooper and complication, the film is a bit disappointing and very expensive. Unless you are curious about the Damit or homosexual subtops, do yourself a favor and find a better western.
