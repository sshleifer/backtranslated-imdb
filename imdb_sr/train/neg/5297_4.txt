It really bother me when someone comes up with this kind of movie and claims it's one of the worst slasher movies out there. This is not far from the worst, it's still not a good movie, but not the worst. Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the Night brought Charlie the worst. The film has decent work with cameras and editing, which is much more than I can say for many extremely vague slasher films. you see that his pruning saw a split in the neck, but all other deaths are barely interesting. However, the lack of graphical violence on the screen does not mean that this is not a film that is just a slug, but only a bad one. The film was obviously intended not to take it too seriously. The film appeared at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it certainly was a reflection of the traditional elements of the slasher, performed on a face-to-face basis. For example, after the murder, Charlie goes to welcome the city and marks the population less. It's something that can only be smiled. If you are in the movie slasher, be sure to give this movie an hour. It's a little different from your usual slasher movie with the possibility of two killers, but not much. The comedy of the film has largely told the audience to relax and not take a film so that God seriously understands. You can forget the movie, you may remember it. I'll remember this because I love the name.
