Liongate has yet to be proven. Every lionsgate film was insignificant. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they constantly beat me. And the cabin of fever is definitely not an exception. I could not even pay attention to most of the movies that was so frustrating and bad. Here are the plots. A guy for some reason cuts a dead dog. Infected with a random virus, transmits it to children in the camp, children begin to get infected and die, the city learns about it and instead of helping them, it kills them. then water is infected and everyone dies. Seriously, it's a whole movie. All the characters are completely retarded, do not worry about any of them, and one kid should stuck with the boy to meet the world. Me and my friend, we discovered that talking about how fat and bitch our colleague was far more comfortable than paying attention to this movie. We managed to get to the end as we screamed bulls $ @ t, because this movie will make you do it. And I'm still confused by the accidental shift of karate, a random kid, and it's obvious that everyone in the country is completely retarded and crawling. And again, why did this dog attack a girl? Why is the kid who hicks tried to kill sitting in a chair and waiting to kill him? Was that part of their plan? vov. The best plan ever. I can not believe this movie got a theater release. I could barely tolerate a DVD, let alone sitting in a theater that does not move for an hour and a half. It was not scary, nor funny, nor cool, or anything. it's only a 90-minute loss that you can use to ... I do not know, I plant a tree or something. It's more productive than this piece of garbage. Acting, special effects and scripts are a joke. Never pick this up. Cabbage fever gets one nasty scene to shave legs, from 10
