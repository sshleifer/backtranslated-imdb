Unfortunately, I made a mistake and I paid 7 euros in the cinema to watch this shallow, pointless film. My points: The film is based on 2 things: 1) Ethnic perspective: As it happens in most American movies, the writer thinks that an expert is after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately this is not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods does not make a person understand culture. For example, shaving is a sign of pure life in Asia, but everybody tried to stop the girl. The Lebanese people are Christians (they are okay) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we do not make ethnocentrism. So, we do not condemn people after their first question about our life as the father did in the whole film. 2) Sexual Revolution Girls: There's nothing to say about it. Show me the 10 girls who had this on their sexual arousal than I'm going to say I'm wrong. Please watch Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. Black humor must reflect the truth and focus the audience on ridiculous parts. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the film?
