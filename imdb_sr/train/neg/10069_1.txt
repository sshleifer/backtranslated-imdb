This is a horrible movie. Yes, the girls are nice, but they're not really good. A cowboy plot that gets mixed up with an Indian girl would be interesting to make sex uncomfortable. Well, okay, maybe it's interesting, but it's not, because it's so bad and only partial. I can only imagine how close the frames of dancing tushes on the big screen, probably more ridiculous than on TV. (I will not even mention a fight with a knife in the toples between the two women who are tied up and spend the whole thing on their chest. Never read about it in the old West) This is a film that requires a liberal use of fast forward. /> <br /> I love movies with a shlock, but this is ridiculous. There is a reason not to go to such films and that they are not very good, the store throws the back seat on the chest. The original sweets, as they are called, were nudist films or films in which there was no touch, but as the adult industry began to grow, makers either tried to be smart or tried to use something else to put bullets in place. The smart guys were very few who left only hacks that were limited to talent. Comedies often came best with humor approaching the first grade, infantile but harmless fun. Something that can rarely be said about any other janitor's cross dressed as nudia. Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces, but this is done by not having a Western or sex movie. I do not need to watch this anymore. Interestingly, nobody, rapist and killer in the movie did not play Bobbi Beausoleil, a Manson family member who was arrested for killing a schoolteacher shortly after shooting a wrapped up. It is obvious that such things will destroy the lives of some people.
