The latest rumor that moves is that Vh1 begins to make calls to I Love Nev Iork on the 3rd of mid-2008. Does that mean that the Buddha or Tailor left New York or does it mean that New York rejected the winner? I know that Flavor of Love is approaching its third season, so now with Flavor of Love 3 and A Love Nev Iork 3 ..... will it ever be a real winner? I heard several rumors that Chance will be returned for the third season I Love New York !!!! I heard rumors that New York will be especially presented on the Flavor of Love 3. I hope this was not too much spoil to end I Love New York 2 .... I'm just quoting the latest rumor.
