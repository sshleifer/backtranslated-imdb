In the main role of an unknown actor who seems to remain so, this "film" is another inexpensive black film that amazes me as it is published. I do not have any problems with horrors, and especially with scarves, in fact they are my favorites. But when this is done, this really takes a monkey, and it's no wonder the genre has such a tough time. The story is as clich√© and imaginative as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin in a forest that is destroyed by this zombie / spirit. It's not the most stinking story, its terrible acting and dialogue, domestic directing and terrible music. Not to mention the funny effects and some incredibly lazy films - these morons are out in the clear daylight, and we need to believe it's the night? What the hell did the director think about this move? What, he had only one day to download all this? He was afraid of the dark? (Is it hilarious to see a policeman walking in a clean daylight with a torch that sounds like dark black, but)? so they could at least escape from this film without even noticing it. I'm sure one of the teenagers is playing bingo at a local tavern - but she has 40-45. In any case, it's good for laughter, but only for another loss of film and time.
