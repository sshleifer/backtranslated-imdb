Half Past Dead, starring Steven Seagal in the lead, was a big B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a sequel to a direct video, an action movie without loss, but without the opportunity to win anything. It's less fun than the first: in all aspects. But it's a worthwhile look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch the previous VVE stars on the screen or even if you like to watch sequences, even if they are direct or not. I do not think he's at work. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the job, but nothing unbelievable, nothing far from fine. Cinema was a disaster, but the overall direction was acceptable. Anyway, just watch if you want. If you look, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... well, you will not lose.
