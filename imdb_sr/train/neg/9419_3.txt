I never heard of it, and then I learned that it was a man with a deadly lens for which I heard, but I did not see it. Conners made me buy it, and that's not good. She wants to be some kind of crossing between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but that's not so funny unless you find the name General Vombat (?) Funny. He is experienced as a thriller of the straight 70s until the last ten minutes when he is alive. There are many, many flat scenes in the White House between the president and his assistants who do not work. Almost as if the initial cut was too long, the first half was edited to bring up the whole story about the purchase of a nuclear bomb and a suicide bomber, which I think are intended for laughter, but again, so funny. The recording location is great, but the studio looks like a cheap TV. I could not believe that this was done by a man responsible for Kei Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry. Just laugh: Conneri throws his wig before he puts his helmet and jumps out of the plane. Never say it. It never resembles a genius.
