I can not say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. But again, I can not say that this is one of the worst I've ever seen. Okay, therefore, basically, the girl is slipping, she's fine, she wants to go to a expensive school, I can not afford it and must take a Hockey scholarship. He must hide his slip from his friends. Personally I did not like the actress playing Katelin. She absolutely could not cry to save her life, she just made a sound of a title, as if a child pretending to cry to get his way. Katelin was just a boring person. The way she tried to act beautifully and useful to people. And the part in which two skaters call her names and say something about her choreographer and says she "draws a line" made me huddle. We all knew where she would go with her and Spencer. Classically, they did not like each other and in the end they met only typical. All in all, I think this is a movie that you can watch if you love skating, but if you do not mind the main slider is extremely boring. It's good to kill time.
