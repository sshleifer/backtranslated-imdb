I really do not understand how much this movie got. It's ridiculous, unnecessarily manipulative and avoids many big issues - Our business and its preference for sex with men in public places. That's, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood movie just tolerable, but what about all the praise for the performance of Russell Crowe? It seems that a man just sneaks, holds a briefcase and wears an inconspicuous hat and somehow seems to be considered fine acting? Anyone who has ever met a person with mental health problems will realize that Crove's effect is a bit smaller than a cartoon. It's also pretty offensive. And, I dare say, just to the right, to be really terrible
