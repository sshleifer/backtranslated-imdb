This film is the biggest crowd you know, Being and growing up in Vichita Kansas, I know that 90% of the film was Bogus. Apart from the names of some of the victims, nothing else was true. The film seems to have been made with Dad's hands, he had footage that I believe came from another movie along with videos from the slaughterhouse. I usually enjoy watching poor entertainment movies, but because of bad acting, poorly prepared or non-existent sets and a very boring and short ending. It was a struggle to look at the end. I recommend that you do not spend money on this movie or you will be sorry. Krckanje
