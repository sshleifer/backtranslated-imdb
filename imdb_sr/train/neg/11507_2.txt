Gui Ritchie's noble effort was beaten, demolished, raped, shot, killed, stabbed, spitted, beaten, sodomized, abused and left with the dead Madonna's terrible performance. Her acting performance resembled a diploma at Al Gore School of Drama and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie has done a somewhat noble attempt to re-create it, and if you turn off ALL scenes his wife was, this is at best a fair film. I think that the best acting actor ever had to be Gui who was comforting his wife that her performance was good enough not to record again. If you have the opportunity to watch Svept Avai or cut your nails on your feet for 89 minutes ... go to an extended pedicure.
