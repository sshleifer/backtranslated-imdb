This film has been spoofed in the episode of Misteri Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was at its best when they made this film. . I give it 2. <br /> <br /> Zlikovac is hard to understand because of makeup. The assistant says things like 'not you' sound like NACHOO! (think sneezing). It's just a bad speech. Long eyebrows are hilarious in one of the characters. I still do not know what the "projected man" means in terms of complication. I missed something from the beginning. What about this minimum of 10 installation lines?
