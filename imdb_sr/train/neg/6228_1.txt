This film is incomprehensibly bad. It begins with a few random explosions, and then it is cut into a T-Reka sock puppies (!) Publica. She moves back and forth between puppetry and animation in socks, probably because the filmmakers could not afford live actors. I'll spare you a long, tedious, relentless plot that will retrieve this brutal film for brutal 85 minutes. One of my friends found this very rare video in the hobby shop somewhere where it was printed b-movies, and it was purchased exclusively for the purpose of ridicule, but, as it turned out, our intervention was not necessary. This movie is entertaining itself better than we could. I thought Ed Wood's "Plan 9 from the Universe" was the most interesting film that exists, but leave Japanamation / Lego cars / doll sneak outdoors. If you watch this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and valuable, many good laughs.
