Vhattt was with the sound? It sounded like it was all called. Otherwise, bad. Plot = bad. Accents = bad (even Dougrai, and we live in Scotland), Act = bad, Harp = bad, Sex scene - bad / bad. How would the good sound of the actors so badly work? Will he ever get a decent job again? Bad, bad, bad. By the way, we gave him 3 because at least we were tempted to look him all the way because of his bizarre complication, etc. a romantic farce from the 1940s. How was it made in 2004? OK, OK, there were some OK bits. They had a nice house in Bristol. Dougrai had a nice boat. Jennifer looked nice in a small suit. But how come that the nurse got all the men?
