VERY dull, obvious, boring exorcist rip-off with Dobermann with red eyes - this is the degree of special effects in this cheaper cheaper. Richard Crenna has been revived as a chewing gum. Dresses and music from the 70's only contribute to torture. It should keep you asleep almost as fast as "The Corpse Vanishes" or "The Blue Hand". Practically worthless. MooCov says eaghhh what a stink dog! : = 8P
