Deep Shock appears as a TV movie: the whole act of commercial quality actors, a badly designed being to be a "bad guy", and a script that is full of technical, political jargon and importance than knows what to do. I checked it out movie for creativity (I like to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these inexplicably made videos), and I am immediately disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie. Actors I expected because of the kind of movie that is (really quite generic and not thinking behind a certain point). Music was a typical, non-thought-out action symphonic music. I liked the design of computers and technical equipment, along with mini-design. The film even ran very well, with screens that let you know in which set you watched the story unfold. 10 stars IMO. Arrogant search and destruction of the mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protect it ... somehow pitiful. Even the lamer is characterized by a love affair between the two characters you do not see. Tell them that this is a movie that tries to figure out the career of the actors from the bench and video. Do not bother.
