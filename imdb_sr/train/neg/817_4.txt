"You will not shoot at these little creatures, in the first place, they did not do you any harm. In the second place, they can be radioactive." Ah, the joy of a non-budget 50th sci-fi? However, despite the unusual gem, Superman and Mole-Men are quite inspiring, even with 58 minutes of working time. It's out of the cheap (one shot of Superman's flying is incredibly incompetent of several animation frames) and quite boring, though it has a surprisingly altruistic message? dumb mole, diminished actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats that resemble Mr. Mkizptlk without hat but subterranean animals, released from the underground world by drilling oil are not malicious, just misunderstood, and a guy from George Rivers' steel to prevent the local small city mafia He led Jeff Corey to kill them. An interesting counterpoint of paranoia days, perhaps, but with a little more than good intentions to recommend it.
