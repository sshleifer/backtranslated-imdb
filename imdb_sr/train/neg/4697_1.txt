All right, I saw the snooping of this stupid movie. The first film is called and is not real, they are all actors. I can not sing. They are too full of themselves. That's terrible. Yes, kids like 8 to 10 can enjoy, but it's really stupid. I think they say their manager is a kid. And the label is forged. That's stupid. I do not see him. As far as setting up and directing is concerned, it's not so bad. It's a sweet documentary, but it documents a stupid thing. See this only if you do not like good music. Also, it's very rough. It's not even tasty. I hate to be so mean ... but this is really a piece of garbage.
