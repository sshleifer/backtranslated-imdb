I evaluate this film with 3 skulls, just because girls knew they were screaming, this could have been a better movie, if the actors were better, the twins were fine, I believed that the evil, but the oldest and youngest brother, were heavily sucked bad, it looked like they were reading scripts instead of playing them .... spoiler: if they are vampires, why freeze blood? Vampires can not drink frozen blood, the sister in the film says we drink while she is alive ... but when they move to another house, they take a refrigerator that is frozen. end of the spoiler It was a huge waste of time, and that made me angry because I read all reviews of how this film was great, how much the prize won this film, and this film was f * *** ing s ** t !!!!
