Without any features, this movie is a garbage. His jokes do not start to be funny. Humor for children is pathetic, and attempts to attract adults only add unpleasant nonsense to the whole poor package. Sitting through her with her children, I just felt uneasy about what might be next. I could not enjoy the movie at all. Although my kid for whom the DVD was purchased enjoyed the fact that it owns a new DVD, neither she nor her sister showed much interest in seeing her again, unlike Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. you get frequent requests for repetition.
