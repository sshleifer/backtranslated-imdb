How is it that the "Being there" ringing has ever become so loved? People say it's proof that a decent, honest man can succeed despite the lack of intelligence. They're wrong. The film is proof that happiness is everything: I hope your friend invests all your money in Apple, not at Atari; I hope your crab boat is the only one at sea when the storm breaks; I hope that you will not die from shock when luckily you shoot at the butt and not in the back; I hope you do not get AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically reactionary - everyone who opposes social conventions loses his legs, drugs, beat up his girls or dies young. In addition, the placement of products in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is brutal. Emotional manipulative film that is very, very empty.
