I suppose the bad Laurel and Hardy are better than Laurel and Hardy, but hardly. It's sad that Fox's films get a great edition on DVD, revealing people who may not be too familiar with L & H with their LARGEST stuff, and not their classic comedies. with a stupid romantic story about a guy invented by invisible air. He is in love with the boss's daughter, who hates him and prefers a hungry guy. It is incredible to think that the Fock geniuses thought it was what L & H needed in their films. No makeup for pancakes guys look tired and old. The only scenes that work for them in this picture are when they try to get out of the bedroom window at night and a pretty bizarre scene in which Robert Mitchum, like the classic noir bad guy, is trying to sell Oliver Hardy "insurance" to Stan. / / Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget this and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump on the Okford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert".
