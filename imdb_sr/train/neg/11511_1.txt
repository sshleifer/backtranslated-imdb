I had (wrong) wealth to see this film at a show in the United States. After I reluctantly sat through the whole incredible thing, I'm shocked to see so many good reviews here on the IMDB. The original movie was a turkey, but interesting. It fit into those early seventies, a matter of revolution after 1969; this movie just stinks at ......., well, nothing really. That's so bad. Imagine a badly made advertising for perfumes - see what I mean? Looks worse and worse with each of those years, it looks more like a delicate meerkat. shallow, poorly cut, fashion shows. He does not disappoint; wisely dismissed his wife as the star of this debacle. Please, pay attention to the good reviews that this film received from other posters below. These are obviously business objects. Do not encourage Ritchie to continue humiliating by giving him money. <br /> <br />
