I just finished watching the guinea pigs - Devils experiments. I must say that this film, although it has a very good FKS, better than I expected, was NOT a good movie. Frankly, I can not say I enjoyed this movie. Of course it is effective in its way to be shocking, realistic, distorted 43 minutes of torture, but I realized it was very boring (and not as I was hoping). And I also discovered that the torturers were very boring, when they talked and cunningly trying to sound firm all the time, which destroyed it even more (and I'm sure there are some people who will agree with me about it). Now I saw guinea pig 1,2,3,5, and best of those in my opinion is Guinea fowl 2 - Flowers of meat and blood. I will not say much more about Devils' experiments, except the Great Fk, the downplay of the acting from the girl, boring fu ** torturers, I give 4 stars totally because of the FKS because they are terrible.
