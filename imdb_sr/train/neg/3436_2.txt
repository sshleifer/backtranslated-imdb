The girl takes a shower without knowing that a serial rapist stares at her through the skylight. Detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone are hot on their track but are not hot enough because they find him after killing, raping, and eating a girl's nipple. We hope this will be the end of the movie. Not because it is too scary, but because the level of acting is terribly terrible. Unfortunately, this is not the end and months later the rapist has risen as a zombie by the slaughterhouse of Satanists. So he continues where he stopped, with the detectives on the case again, this time the flying baby is also behind him (do not ask). There was a VERY VERY VERY low-budget film (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty in mind), but this is scratching the bottom of the barrel. Terrible acting, crap with special effects, a crazy attempt at comedy and oh yes, and the end is shit too. nude; Anne R. Kei gets toples
