(First, excuse me in my bad English) Of course, only the movie with Jessica Simpson can include serious nonsense like this .. I am a Norwegian and I felt offended and shocked that the producers of this film did not take the time to do research on the creation of this American / "Norwegian" movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. So, I announce my corrections from my frustration: - The country is called Norway, not Norway. - "Yes" is Russian, not Norwegian. Norwegian clergymen never use these black cloaks with this white paper around the door while the Protestant church is dominant away - The truth is that we have traditional traditional folk clothes (which we use only twice a year), but clothes in this film are more like German clothes. - I can not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie. Jessica did not make any sense ... the lower is "Norwegian priests" The only thing I recognize is the Norwegian flag (and viking hats, but it's so stereotypical what people think about Norwegian - Vikings !: O gosh ) Well, I think the people who made this movie will never read this comment. but at least I clarified some things and got rid of some frustration ..! I am proud of my country and I would like to see that people in the US are less stereotyped and more accurate when talking about this country. It was all .. Lenge left Norge! ; p
