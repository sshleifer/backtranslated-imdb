I'm sorry to go against the flow, but I think this film is unreal, boring and too long. I'm tired of seeing Gena Rovlands's long, arduous battle with her and the crisis she was experiencing. Perhaps the film has some kinematic value or is an important step for the director, but for a purely entertaining value I want to skip it.
