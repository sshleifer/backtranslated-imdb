This is a mildly interesting poker of the 80s of the last century that contains some nasty snails with a taste for human blood. If you can go through the absurdity of the whole thing, you may actually get a little less satisfaction than this. The acting is terrible and the plot is simply there to keep the film together between bloody attacks, but the film is not a complete waste of time. The special effects are actually pretty good, and the blood is well made. It reminded me of remake Blob, probably because of all that. All in all, you can definitely worsen for an hour and a half, but I would not suggest you look at this movie, unless you have a strong stomach and if you are in such things.
