I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, compared to Robert Altman's ingenious, hilarious, funny and revolutionary 1970 classic, this show was probably predetermined to be less than central ... even if it lasted for 11 years, it does not necessarily have to be every Good. This performance was an integral part of my early childhood (she was recurring every night, and her parents watched and laughed), but this is one of the memories I do not miss. And now that I've actually seen a movie, I can give this series an accurate critique. By itself, not nearly "2 out of 10" is bad. However, the characters in this show are nothing like those in the movie. Some of them are technically the same, but only by their name are similar. For example, since when Alan Alda was like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is completely different, and his characterization and appearance. New characters are not so big; They serve only to miss you the ones they replace. It's the same with new actors (including Jamie Farra). The only thing actually transmitted to the series is Radar, which is still (although the game of the same actor) is only a bland imitation of the original. What else? Oh yes. With a ridiculous path (it did not matter whether it was used in surgical scenes or not), it appears as creepy, because it happens in other settings. And because it lasted almost four times longer than the actual Korean War, spectators entered this bizarre temporal split that did not function outside the world of cartoons. I never liked this show, and I will never.
