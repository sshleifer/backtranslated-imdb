As a winner of maritime history from the Second World War, and someone not proud of the history of racial relations in this country, I was looking forward to watching this film. What a disappointing piece. I made it about 3/4 times, but I was supposed to turn it off on the scene of a sub-attack. The idea that the submarine will fire a torpedo on the DDE, as if there was a hope that it would hit him, and then be able to "escape" from the DDE while it was submerged, is pointless. And that's just a little detail. The whole movie was poorly written, poorly directed and badly behaved. I agree with others on this committee that this could be a good movie. As if they decided that since all those shameful propaganda films of the Second World War were made with white barrels, they had to make one with blacks. And how bad were those old movies, this is actually worse. It's almost a false advertisement for Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. They turned out to have very small roles. I have to believe that these two fine actors got rid of what is related to this film. I have finished. I've given too much of my life to this shit.
