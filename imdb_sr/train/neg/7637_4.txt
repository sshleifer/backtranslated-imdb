It could have been a very good movie, that I could watch it. The handheld camera was very strenuous. I was concerned about the introductory credits. Several of us watched as they felt very painfully at the end. But we remained until the end, because it was such a charming and interesting movie that gave insight to the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film enhanced the skill. The acting was very authentic. Some of the dialogues were a little difficult to understand, but as if the theater of many non-South Africans thought that most of that was ridiculous. If you get a disease at all, you can seriously consider skipping this movie. It's weird, or not worth the nausea.
