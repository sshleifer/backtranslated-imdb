As a big fan or Cracker series, I waited seven years for the next addition. I'm afraid this episode does not meet the legend. Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years to marry his daughters and is involved in a murder investigation as a soldier who is struck by a flash. His duty in Northern Ireland is going to kill. What I did not like in this episode is the extremely handsome way everything is set up and how the fitz leads to the killer. It's all thick to exhaustion. However, there are some good scenes in the flickers of Northern Ireland that are shooting greatly.
