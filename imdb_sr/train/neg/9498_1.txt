When I search for new cars, I expect that ships will not be shown. When I drink a Coca-Cola fountain, I should expect a drink to contain coke. When I watch a movie that is adorned with the name of a great scientist, I expect it to be somehow relevant to that person or her work. These could have been people who were discussing my diary. Covered material is relevant only because they obscure the science in vain. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it, and the other time I stopped watching it. I love science and documentaries. I'd rather watch them through the latest hits. However, this is far from providing something that is worth your time? Avoid at all costs.
