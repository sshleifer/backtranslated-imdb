This film was the horrible experience of watching movies I had ever had to endure, and worse, the fact that I had to watch it, and I had no chance to stop it because it was for school! Well, the story was decent ... but I think the acting is terrible! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was wonderful. She was the only peak, without her, I doubt I would be able to watch the movie. Every time I hear someone say "daarling," I'm rubbing! I almost attacked the client the other day because they said "it". I remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if it offended someone, I only express my opinion)
