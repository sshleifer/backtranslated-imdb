There is not a nice character in this whole movie. Is it a lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh for whom should we drag? Well, let's see - we find out that he is a blind lawyer who dismisses criminals for technical problems. He treats his colleagues as cattle, leads them to his personal crisis (in the process, kills one of them), threatens the safety of his children, threatens the new boyfriend of his ex-wife, tries to arm police and school administrators - and all this for what ? Because he thought with his little head! I really asked my father and his gang to win drinks from a lawyer and drove him into the swamp ... it would have made for a much more pleasurable ending.
