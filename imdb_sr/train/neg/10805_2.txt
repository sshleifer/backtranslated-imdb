The only reason I made this film was because I live in Cleveland and Shak playing basketball for us now and 2. I've always heard it was terrible. The film did not disappoint. The best parts were Shak's suits. The worst parts were, well, just about everything else. My twelve-year-old son and I were just returning and we could not look at the screen when Shak started to tail and we were wondering why Mak did not want Kazzam to fix that tooth! But for all it's terrible that we just could not stop watching, the story sucked you, like a black hole or live sand or tar, was hypnotic. But it was worth laughing and just saying that we actually watched "Kazzam".
