This is a seriously upset movie. Even though the guys deserved something from what they got ... Sadistic horrible executions were "minor" above the top. The only figure who showed some kind of conscience early in hunting was killed before he could offer some help to sad conspiracy. but it was just a trick to make spectators sleep in a false sense of security, before the joy of what is to come. The only thing that could save a movie for me is that Jack Nicholson jumped out of the bushes and shouted: "Where is the batman?" Kim Basinger could shout. It would be cool!
