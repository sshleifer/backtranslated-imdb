I love many actors / actors involved in this project, so that the film offended me even worse than using unfamiliar things. For 30 years, Nbc will probably do a movie like this in the early 90's. Now I can see a black family where children are involved in la riot and the white family has children to fight and listen to grunge rock music. Soundtrack will have bands like Nirvana, NVA, Public Enemi, Soundgarden etc. This will be the same cheese as the 60's and I guarantee you NBC will do it. You see the biggest problem with the times when you end up buying a network is that when you live in a certain period of time do not think that I live in the 60s or any decades are trendy retro at that time. Next time somebody does something like this, it should put more weight into the project
