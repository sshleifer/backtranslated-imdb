On the islands of Fiji, the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests to open its complex consisting of a hotel and a zoo in order to find a partner for their discoveries. When a bunch of small-collar thieves puts the virus into a security system to take part in hunting for smetlar, the biggest attractions of the zoo? to summarize the prehistoric age from the DNA found in the fossils ?? Escape, kill the hosts and keepers for pleasure. An incredibly lingering and cheap "Sabretooth Attack" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The characters are horrible and not funny or pleasant, and the story is a terrible Jurassic Park with a bad collection of clich√©s. Basically, all lines and situations are bad and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that they are bullied and they like to kill out of satisfaction. My voice is three. Title (Brazil): "Atacue to Dente de Saber" ("Attack Sabretooth")
