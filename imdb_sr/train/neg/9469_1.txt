Audrey, I know that you really respect the memory of your wife, Ted, but PLEASE do your justice and respect his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. Please stop quilling his stories, pictures, fantasies and characters. They become disgruntled with the power of Hollivood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the warm love and innocence of his books. I just want you to listen to the advice of others a little. Save what's left of Dr. Seussa. Thank you.
