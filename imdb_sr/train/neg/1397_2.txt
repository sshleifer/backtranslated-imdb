Let's see, here are the "peaks" of the Brain Machine: 15 setting footage of the pool and the house; 15 establishment of recordings of indescribable office buildings; 5 counts of mild technicians; 7 major guard plans; and countless technical nonsense to show us that this is a high-tech experiment. Various posters commented on the discrepancy between the date of copyright in 1972 and the date of publication on the DVD box of 1977. It's easy to explain. This dog was simply sitting on the shelf unpublished for five years, until someone was questioned by him, thinking he fit perfectly into the post-Vatergate distrust of the government. After I first saw The Brain Machine, my only wonder is that it was ever published!
