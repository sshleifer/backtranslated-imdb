I've heard that this film is much more stylish than directed by Gui Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Tvo Smoking Barrells) before, the problem is, it may be too stylish. Basically, Jake Green (Jason Statham) was released from jail after seven years in solitary confinement, and in two years of cube a lot of money. He is ready to retaliate against the casino owner who was subjected to violence and who sent Jake to prison, Dorothy 'Mr. D 'Macha (Rai Liotta). In this process, doctors tell Jake that he has three days left to live as he dies of a rare disease of blood, and Macha kills him. Loan Loans Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andre Benjamin) demand that Jake pay their money back, and do some strange jobs for them. The film is filled with Jake who narrates through some memories, and through his last three days before he came to a great discovery about Zach and Avi and Machi, I suppose that was. Also starring Terence Mainard as French Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lili Valker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binish as Rachel. These are sequences that involve little animation, repeating rows twice in different perspectives and changing speeds for moments, and it all irritates the point of confusion and boredom, which makes it a silly criminal drama. Pretty poor!
