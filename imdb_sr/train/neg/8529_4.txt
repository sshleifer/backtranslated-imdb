Which mushroom in MGM thought it would be a good idea to replace Clark Gable in the role of the Salvation Army? Ironically, another handsome future star, Cari Grant, also played the Army of the Salvation Army just two years later in a highly overrated SHE DONE HIM VRONG. I guess it's pretty easy to see the craziness of these roles, but I'm still wondering whether the people from the Rescue Army are "hot" and who could watch these passionate people and see them as realistic portraits of the parts they played. I worked for the sister organization of the Salvation Army (Volunteers of America) for a long time, and I NEVER seen some of the ladies working there (which includes me, unfortunately). Maybe I should have been working with the Salvation Army! So, for the most curious, this is a good movie to look out for, but for everyone else, it's bad writing, messy dialogue and uncomfortable moralizing makes for a very slow film.
