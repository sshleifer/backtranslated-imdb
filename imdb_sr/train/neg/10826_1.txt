I can not say this is the worst movie of all time, but just because there are still movies I have not seen before! This must be the most demanding attempt to shoot a movie of all time! The director suffers from the same problems with "There Vill Be Blood" (although he was not so bad in that movie.) The whole film feels like watching a guy trying to impress outside of his abilities, as if sitting in his little director's chair and thoughts " so that the great film director would deal with this scene? "He simply does not have it. I do not know if this film could save a big filmmaker. Surely some of the negatives that could have been polished, but nothing has been brought to maturity. in which all the characters sing, was the worst moment in the history of the film. I kept saying, "Please, please, do not drink a guy who is on the verge of death!"
