Another attempt by a New Yorker intellectual in less than 10 years to make a "Swedish" movie - the first was "Brother Carl" Suzan Sontag (which was shot in Sweden, with Swedish actors, nothing less!) Results? Oscar Wilde said best of all, in relation to Dickens's "Old Curiosity Store": "Someone would have to have a stone heart not to smile at the death of Little Nello." The same thing is here. The "interior" is full of festive intellectuals. ("I am afraid of my anger." Looking at the middle distance: "I do not like who I am." An incredibly complacent family reminds us how much they are brilliant and talented, to the point of strangulation ("I read your song the other day." I do not know - New Yorker. "" Oh, it was an old song I made it. ") Far from not worrying about these people, however, I found them pretty funny. A big part of the dialogue is just as funny things from Allen's earlier films - he just directed his actors to play the lines straight. Since he did not appear in the movie, the cheese Marie Beth Hurt replicates all of her theological, intonation and neurotic habits, turning her into a shameful surrogate (similar to Kenneth Branagh's "Celebrity"). The basic act - a dysfunctional family with a quietly dominant mother - seems to have been more or less erected by Bergman "Winter light", the basic family melodrama is lured with a lot of existential fear. All this happens in the visual / aural tricks: the deafening scratching of the pen on paper, the high surf that pushes people walking on the beach. Allen's later "serious" films are less embarrassing, but far less entertaining. I'll take the "Interiors". Voodoo rarely made a funny movie.
