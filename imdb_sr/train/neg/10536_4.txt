Villiam Cooke and Paul Talbot share the director / writer for this low budget movie about three boys camping in the woods with their horoscope magazines. The feet raised from the fire and the schoolgirl and there ... and the rogue in the town of Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... from Leatherface fame) wander and trade with four stories of blood in exchange for food and heat of fire. One story is an old reconstruction of "Kuke", two teenagers on a lover's tape attacked by a crazy killer with a hand-hook. The second story has a pair of tokens that need to reach some weeds. They stumble upon a guy who knows a guy who has some big ones with # @ t. As they blow full bags, their skin begins to gray and green before it warms and falls. One of the better stories is about an unfortunate man who returns home for Christmas, who can not wait for his mother to die and enjoy talking to a nephew and niece about Satana Claus. The fourth story of the torch fire is about a greedy sailor that washed on the shore, upset by an empty suitcase with a mild, and ending so that the zombies hit him in the sea. it could be much worse. A little numb, but fun to watch, except perhaps a navy story. It is understandable that the cast is not assigned. The roles of the actors are: Tres Holton, Courtnei Ballard, H. Rai York, Johnny Tamblin, Valter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
