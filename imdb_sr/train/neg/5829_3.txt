I watched this movie as an overview of Matthev Barnei's art exhibition. It certainly prepared me. I almost skipped the exhibition and, in retrospect, I should probably have it. Apart from being excellent (Bjork) and rich and colorful, the content was mostly tiring and predictable. I really needed to see someone wearing pearls to understand what the divers are doing. The film was mostly a funny mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial footage of modern whaling technology used in false hunting / harvesting. The movie "peaked" with enough free shock to turn your stomach. What was the purpose of the film? While others may claim that this is a part that is not against whaling, one might argue that this is somewhat justified by whaling. I personally think that it was Barney's attempt to "obscure" the audience with his anal, fecal, self-defense and cannibal fetishes. I do not dare watch this movie. The message is vague, tempo slow, and cultural references are pretentious. If you want shock-art, you will better manage one of the many "Undead" movies or hunt an old copy of Hustler and take a fecal caricature.
