I do not know what this film actually is about. It's like a project of a student art school. They never say why the world is dark, but it's always dark except for a second a day. It has long, intermittent bullets of insects of all kinds for no reason. The little dialogue in the film is meaningless and senseless as a picture. The black woman enters the main hero's apartment. Somehow get pregnant overnight, and then shoots into the head. The main figure takes care of the body until it becomes a shell after which a white naked woman appears. I've never been so enthusiastic about how bad and worthless the film is. Frankly, I would love someone watching him so that they could tell me what they think about it. But I would not want this level of hell to anyone else.
