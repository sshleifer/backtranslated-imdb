What about the actors who took part in that shit? Michael Dorn should adhere to Star Treck. John Diehl, is anyone reminding him of Miami Vice? He liked him there ... Well, whatever - what can be expected of a movie with one of the Baivatch rescuers? Nothing, and we got it. No character is even nice, special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is (very bad) joke. There is no logic for what's happening. I had the feeling that filmmakers tried some kind of "Attack of the killer tomatoes". Especially in a scene where all important people have discussed national security in some type of wardrobe ... If you accidentally see it on TV, switch channels - your TV will be grateful.
