Gui de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man, without any moral qualities. He only wanted success in a society in which all people, politicians, businessmen, journalists, women were corrupt. The only king is MONEY. Maupassant Hero, Charles Forestier goes more and more in the social circle due to his posing for seduction. He is in love with all women who could help him in his action to climb up to society. At the end of the novel, he married the biggest daughter of a daily newspaper owner in the largest Paris church: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has wealth and much more, he will become a member of parliament, and later a minister. "Unprofitable" women are beyond his reach, but he is always in contact with beautiful and useful women. Picture "BEL AMI PRIVATE JOBS" is a story of MORALITY. That's all, but not the story of the Maupassant idea. Why did they put "BEL AMI" in their name?
