This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was some sort of remake, but again, not really. I was very disappointed with the tools that Tim Burton has at their disposal. He had great make-up and CGI available and a lot of money ($ 100 million), but can you honestly say that what we get is just as good as the original movie that was made for less than $ 6 million? The devil does not. In that sense, the film fails. At least in the original film, the scene of freedom was shocking, but in this film there was nothing shocking, not even the ultimate scene, because you could see it. are coming. And, by the way, if you think a little, and I am, you can figure out how to end. I wish I had the time that I lost by thinking about it. This film would be brilliant and fun that it remained in line with the first film and the adopted part "Under the Planet of Apes". Here's how to write it: Astronaut (it should have been more than Marki Mark because he is not good enough to take care of the movie himself, so I would put three guys in) to land on what they would think to be the other planet, meet people (do not silence), the city ruled by monkeys who chased, made friends with some good monkeys, discovered that they were on earth by finding the destroyed ruins, and ended up running into crazy mutant people who live under the earth, a war between mutated men and monkeys arises, and then ... well, let your imagination be wild By how you want to finish it. But my point is that it could have been much more in this movie. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to destroy something good. Think about what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director despite what people think. He is in a trend, so he has to be good at thinking. Sorry or not. If anyone else made this film, it would turn out much better and it would be far more satisfying.
