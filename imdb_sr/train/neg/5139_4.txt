Many horror fans love the Scarecrow, so I will not be popular when I say it's pretty boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it looks like it's pulling so much. I think the main problem is that everything is in the dark. Sometimes horror movies in the dark can work (like Humongous), but they're scared in the dark for the whole movie. It's hard to figure out what's really going on for a long time, and although some of the scarecrows were creepy, most of them were hard to see. If you use a little more light, it might be better. There are not many movies that include killer scares as far as I know, except Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend it through the Scarecrow every day.
