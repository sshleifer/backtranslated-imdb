... through similar ideas by Eric Stanze. Not particularly talented director led not a very good movie, but I found myself looking at the final points, if nothing else but to see what will happen again. The rapist escapes from jail and calls his old flame. After she caught her (although she came in voluntarily) and threatened to have sex (another event she also wanted to do), she discovers that he had kidnapped three boys who had hurt her in the past. Then he decides to kill her (huh?), But he died instead. The girl calms down (or something like that) and takes out her anger at the unfortunate guys in the basement. OK, writing is shit: it's long been tense, filled with words of ten cents and there It's too much. An act of shit: what minute, what acting? Shooting is shit: home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of shooting at the cemetery is just a damn insult. The budget is a joke: get it ... "budget", it was a punchline. But still, there was a charm. In the 1970s, these types of films came out in cinemas with real budgets and talents associated with them, but not nowadays. If you want to watch this kind of violent, sexually exploitative trash (not lying, some of us) then this is all you get today. Some short hardcore shots in the scene of sex, fake material torture, fun with the ax, anal brushing with a broom and a long shot of crazy fish that masturbate with the same broom stick are some of the better things on the menu. It is not good and will not be remembered, but not from the time when Joe D'Amato experienced films like these. 4/10
