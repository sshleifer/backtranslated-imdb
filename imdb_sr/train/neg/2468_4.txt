This was not so great. It's not terrible or hateful or anything, just forgetful. It had some sort of, mind, indecisive, diluted air, as if it never knew properly whether it wanted to go to laugh or to sweep or satire. So we stayed with a weak mixture of three. The actors seemed to be lost. Also, the ideas were really tired and recycled, almost self-zipped. How many times should it be said that in the 50s, in the United States, they were infected with a banal feeling of conformity? And that it continued with aggressive consumerism? And this emotional repression among men is baaaaad thing? Old hat. The biggest crime in my eyes was just how much it was separated from reality. I know it was a comedy and everything, but - especially in the whole movie where you have to keep the public's interest for a long time - you still need some kind of emotional anchor, some related guide through the story, to attract it. For the child of the 'hero' to look at the old woman, two of his colleagues and eventually his father dies painfully in the hands of zombies or anything, and to greet him with a happy smile and shrug his shoulders, then I am struggling to resolve this to any positive the way. Mom was the same. If your two main characters are so inhuman at that level, then you risk losing me, and that's what happened. this captured it well enough, it was a handy movie, especially some of those broad corner of the street and inside Robinson's house. Also, the introductory film was cute, in an unusual way. I thought Billy Connolly was fine and came from someone who was not a big fan of Billy Connolly: Movie Star. I just had that fear to quench him and try to steal every scene, but he played a pretty low key for him and probably the most impressive character in the whole movie. > All in all, it's not a lot.
