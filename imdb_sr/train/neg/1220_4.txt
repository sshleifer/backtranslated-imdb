He may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why she is a long-time candidate for Razzie. Making a movie that's so bad must be a sign that she needs money. She could do an advertisement on why you should not talk to a mobile phone while driving, especially at night on the way to a packed shopping center. Susan Montford should keep up production as she is not as good as a writer / director. It is appropriated by four robbers at the shopping center's parking lot, and the first thing they did is tell her to have a gun. What does she do? She began to push and swear them like she knew martial arts or something. She manages to escape, but she gets lost in the woods after a collision. Why did not she escape to a house? We got four robbers with guns that jurk the lady with a toolbox. Of course, their pistols do not match her key. Ha! Of course, she has iron iron and a screwdriver. You poor robbers. Now she's at home for Christmas - and she brought a gun!
