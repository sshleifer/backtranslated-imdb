I do not know much about filming movies, but good movies have to tell a story ... your characters have to start and finish their journey. In Last Ekite, Brooklyn can, but it is not in any satisfactory way, and I do not mean a happy ending, just to any end. a brutal workers strike, triggers numerous stories of the story. Most include some of the most unusual characters ever to cross the movie screen. But Last Ekite at Brooklin fails to bring these stories to any conclusion ... leaves some of them endlessly, or throws into a bizarre stratosphere for the "artistic" end. Two cases In fact, they contain spoilers. The sad transgender character (an important character in the film), was hit by a car and killed. And that's it for him in the movie ... he went forever, erased from everybody's memory .. does not react to his friends, enemies, lovers ... nothing. In the second row of stupid, untrained and secretly gai striking leader, who was denied the job, his gai lover, and discovered by neighboring bandits, gets stomped by bandits. The final scene of the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the street lights are very, very similar to those of the Nazi death camps ... and the scene pulls and continues and releases ... and the camera goes down to the body of the leader of the work, and he is crucified .... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course, that's for him ... brainwashing ... disappeared. Basically ... no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film .... This film is a depressing piece of sludge. Avoid this. And if you do not get caught, it really deserves the NC-17 rating for huge amounts of physical, emotional, and sexual brutality ... even do not allow teens to watch.
