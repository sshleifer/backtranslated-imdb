I only applied to comment that this movie is really stupid. In addition to having been seized by an executive decision or by Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist story, this is a movie that makes you grateful when watching a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actors when they get such a stupid, clich√© letter. It's bad enough if you look at the movie once you find yourself insulting to your intelligence, but when you find that you are rattling over and over again, you must find that the director is not the brightest bulb in the movie business, nor the producers have decided to bring this story to the screen. You can say most low-rent actors to take over this task, because they most likely appeared to get money and exposure, and not to be part of this joke-of-a-movie to earn them any prizes or recognition. Perhaps they will eventually embarrass them that they have such a bad estimate to get involved with such a loser. I do not see any sense in summarizing the plot or even giving any examples to prove my case, because it would be a cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could bear. As studying well-made films can inspire you to do well, skillfully skillful work of art and beauty, the only thing you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what YOU DO NOT DO and DO NOT DO! Be warned.
