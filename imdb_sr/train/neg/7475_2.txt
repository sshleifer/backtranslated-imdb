To be honest, I knew what to expect before I watched this movie, and I have to say that it has the worst thing I've ever seen. It has its moments, and at the comedy level, it's a lot of fun, but I'm afraid it's not scary, and stupidity has moved to a new level. There are many unnecessary bleeds, and the plot is everywhere. I have no idea why the aliens were evil, and why they even came to this remote part of Vales, (I think who would go there anyway?) But at that moment I did not care because the costumes were entertaining and the bad CGI. As far as B-movies are concerned, it deserves the title 'to be so bad, good' and honored with filmmakers, as they probably knew what they were doing. Can these films continue ...
