I was hoping this movie would be at least visible. The plot was the weakest. I was expecting a lot more given the set line (I wonder if any of them will include this in their CVs?). At least I did not pay to rent it. The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the movie is complete and pronounced PANTS.
