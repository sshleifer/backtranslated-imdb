Absolute waste. The reason why it is so terrible is not to deviate from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. The aforementioned star did nothing to solve the case - nor was anyone else real - it was just a routine police job. Totally boring. You sat in the end hoping to turn around - and get just a huge sense of disappointment. There was so much potential in relative abduction. Could Lt's personal involvement at last muddle his judgment? All the obvious signs were that the stranger did it. But surely a genius like Lieutenant C, with a constant conversation with the injured husband, gradually revealed a devilish plot about the cassette player playing in the shower room, while the masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body, and then subtle traces. It could have been good. It was a total waste of time.
