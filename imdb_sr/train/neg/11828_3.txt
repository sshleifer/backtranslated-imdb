A few months ago, I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this film. The poster insisted that, if I gave the chance to 'Flushed Avai', I would have liked it. Partially based on this argument, I agreed to watch the movie. 'Flushed Avai' has good intentions (At least on Aardman's part), but he lacks the strength to pull it all away. Her best advantage is the captain of sewage / boat, Rita (played by Kate Vinselt), who, IMO, should have been the main character of the movie instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, heavy and interesting, while Roddy spends a lot of time on the screen. One of the things most troubling me about "FA" is the repetition of jokes that are not ridiculous to start with. When Roddy falls into the squat, the film will take care to immediately hit him five more times. "My name is Shoki," says one of Rita's brothers, who at that time, Rodia struck at least three times with electricity. My tolerance to cheap pains that include pain is low at all times. I will not waste my time gossiping around Katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies towards Picard (A similar film is a coincidence, five is rip), but I will say that I am disappointed in Aardman. They can (and do) much better. Try the next time, guys.
