I loved to watch the original Azumi with its mix of live manga action, a striking story, a cool soundtrack, a direction (Kitamura wall!), A montage, not to mention the beautiful Aia Ueto that perfectly filled the part. So I really enjoyed the meeting with Azumi 2, but after I finally saw it, I felt that I won the lottery and lost the card: Azumi 2 picked up the place where Azumi stopped, but these are completely different two different films, much slower, the action is not so exciting and choreographed, and there is not much character development. This was obviously directed by the same man responsible for further downsizing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if possible!) I agree with some other earlier reviewers who say it was a lost opportunity, if only Riuhei Kitamura continued with o Even the real bad guys are too easily killed without too much fighting, and the fight with the Spider boy (right from the episode of the Monkey!) in the bamboo forest is about an unavoidable battle scene. While we were in Azuma 1 we had Azumi 2 was brought to us by Azumi cape cam !! Azuma's rampage in the end was inconclusive, but Aia still works well. It looks great in the cap ... but from where did it get? I do not think I'll watch this all the time ! ...What a shame.
