Although he was not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised to see his name in the loan at the opening of Joshua. Heck, I was not even aware that he was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So, I do not need to say, I watched a movie based on the film, not traces. Some kind of 'Rosemari's Babi', 'Omen' or any other demonic film 'Joshua' is charged. Unfortunately, it fell. Slow, incredibly slow and flat. Nevertheless, I continued to see how this will be solved, hoping that this will be the utmost conviction that the final climax will throw a little light on the subject. All right, I admit, it is (little) but what is the closure. And what kind of a movie with a low budget, or at least he designed it. Person falling? you do not see a drop, you see someone lying in what looks like blood. A man hit a cab? you do not see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bicycle. I'm not sure whether this is called "style" or laziness or simply a lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with crazy mom, a workaholic who is trying to balance everything, a child? Joshua, who can / does not have to be an antihrist and a new born baby who is very crying. She cries how much we see how much she is alive? And what was that? Is there a rat rush or Is it Joshua? Is his mother crazy? Is Joshua crazy? Is he just jealous of a newcomer to his family? Will he become Michael Miers? Or drives his family on the edge? I do not think so. They were crazy before, and no "so-called" act could have made me believe it. Unfortunately, there was hardly any answer to any questions, hardly all the doors were closed. I'm sure it might have been an idea, but for Pete, give me something. Anything. There are many better films for the missing child. Joshua is more like a Mini-Me Antichrist.
