When I first heard about "Dovn to Earth," I was quite excited. I'm a pretty big fan of Chris Rock, he was particularly hilarious in Dogma. But this film turned out to be disappointing. Chris Roque's performance was not as good as his last performance, and the film was very poorly directed as a whole. First, Chris Rock. He plays the entire movie as a stand up comedy. Obviously, this works well in scenes where standup should work, but it does not do so in the rest of the film. Even when talking with another person, he seems to think he's trying to make people laugh. There are some funny moments, but they mostly come in during the standup scene (no wonder they decided to become his comedian). As far as the rest of the acting team is concerned, they are quite present only to give Rock a chance to talk, none of them stands out. The movie is basically a joke: an old white guy who acts like a young black comedian. Although I prefer films with more than one joke, this could still work, and it was pretty funny. The problem was that we saw too much Rocka, not enough old white man. It should be ridiculous because this white guy spoke the jokes of Chris Rock, but most of the time we saw Chris Rock, so it's not nearly so funny. Several scenes in which they decided to show us that the white man spoke like Rock are really hilarious. If he showed up, the movie would be much more fun. All in all, a few moments of laughter can not compensate for the fact that "Dovn to Earth" has badly acted, and is poorly targeted. This was a pretty big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
