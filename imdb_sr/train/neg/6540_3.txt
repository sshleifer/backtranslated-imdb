I can not believe that many so much compare this film with Argent. His work is much more imaginative and more dangerous - and much more fun. The director simply has no ability to build the actual tension. Scenes of homicide - and we face this, this genre is interesting. It was not hard to guess who the killer was, and I really did not care when it was discovered. Cinema is not unforgettable, and the highly respected Gothic atmosphere from the 19th century did not attract me. Yes, a little bit to do. Yes, there are tones of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but unbelievably, they add a little spice or uncertainty. If you are looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
