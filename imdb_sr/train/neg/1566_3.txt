For the Beatles connoisseur, the main value in this movie is to relax and choose flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, missed events, savage exaggerated events, omitted people, weather mistakes, wrong attributes, wrong clothes from poems about the place, and (shame) instruments and other bonuses that I can not imagine now. Defectors appear quickly and furiously, so you will have to be on your feet. I did not give this "1" primarily because of the fact that it was shot in Liverpool and the band Rain to do its best (Lennon's character is credible and works well). Also, the song "Cri for a Shad" is heard at one point and the TO is important for something. So, watch him out of the party, but do not consider it to be historically accurate.
