please save money and go see something else. this movie was such a piece of shit. I did not want to go, but I had to think that I would laugh at least once, NOPE. No laughter, it was so terrible! Chris Kattan will never get a good comedy role after this and a "rockburst's night." this film is quite obvious, it does not have a good humor at all and repeats itself over and over again. listen to me, and stray away from this movie as you can!
