NO SPOILERS. I love horror movies, but this must be the poorest attempt to ever make. Call it "film" is also stretching. These "random-cuts-apparently-fake-and-sticky-violence-and-ugly-women-trying-to-act-sexy-arranged-bad-together" is not worth watching. By looking at this, it's interesting to look like pictures of some family holidays, and it has about the same quality that you would expect when you send a ten year old son into the woods with your new vid-cam and tell him to make a movie. Terrible.
