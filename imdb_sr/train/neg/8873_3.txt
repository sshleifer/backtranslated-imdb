Has anyone stopped to understand what kind of film they produce here? Now a former naval officer becomes a member of a group of children in a cadet school, so this should be a family comedy? Wrong. This is just a brutal comedy directed at teenagers with many bad moments of taste. Perhaps it was possible to look in a very stupid way at this moment, but I found that Damon Vaians's voice was irritating and incredible. Does he say so in real life? If he does, then he has my sympathies, but he will not get any money from watching his films
