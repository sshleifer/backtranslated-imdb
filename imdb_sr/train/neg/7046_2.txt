I saw that dull time on Comedy's HBO channel, so I was totally innocently and obviously assuming it was a comedy. But absolutely nothing is ridiculous here. A good actor was essentially lost on a script that I could write to my left butt - after being beaten by the senseless torturers of the 15th century Inquisition. The first half is particularly bad, because it has some of the most interesting, meaningless dialogues I've met with at some time, and a zero score that I'm not talking about. Just the fact that stars such as Evan McGregor and Zeta-Jones in this small movie, and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. A few nice shots of a wave that hit the cold coast of Britain, but that's all. This is a movie that is made only because people who wrote it have good connections (family ties, preferably) and / or a lot of money that lies around.
