This is the kind of movie you complain about putting your VCR. It's a strange, bad version of the movie "The Misery (1990)" by Steven King. I can not understand how this film got 5.2 points, because there is no story about what ever happened, and when the film finally ended, I got rid of it. Instead ... a lot of time is spent on the same thing. And like in any bad movie, everything happens only at the end of the movie for a time period of 10-15 minutes ... So, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in your remote, because you will be doing a lot of fast redirecting ... do not worry, you will not miss anything important.
