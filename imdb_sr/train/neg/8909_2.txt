This film is chrome and it's not funny at all. Action does not make sense. Some scientists working on the edges of the science open the door to another dimension (maybe a hell ???) and his daughter sucks through it or something like that, then one day, for no apparent reason, returns and now has big breasts and wears scarce clothes (I suppose are the demons in the second dimension done for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend, but she is so gay so obviously more interested in her new girlfriend, and they come across this witch. spell book (they want to be witches or something like that) and the evil spell ends up getting read again, and that's how an evil demon is coming to a country that only a bikini top girl and a discarded boy in love can stop. There are no scenes in the toples for no reason, and the guy who my boyfriend says is a famous wrestler, but his part is completely unnecessary, it's obvious they did something to put it into it, as fans might actually watch this pointless wrestling Movie . I'm sure that no hot girls are hurt either. Additional DVD features were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought it could help explain what was going on, but it actually just made things even more confused. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically, this is a movie that goes on camping on a make-out-then-fight-a-monster, but there's a bunch of stuff (like the other dimension and book seller) than it seems confusing. I did not like the film, but there were only five dollars to the extent. I do not recommend watching it though it was too stupid, I can not imagine any part of the movie that was good.
