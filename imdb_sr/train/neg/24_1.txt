I have to congratulate the genius who approved this. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think buddy, you can not take every piece of cheap amateur shit, whose only intention is to get some money. It's bad, and I think BAD. Anyone with the camera would get the same result, or better. Act, just say: do not go to the supermarket looking for actors. Good usually come with a certain degree or at least have some damn experience! Director. Mr. Jon Keeies, please find your purpose in life, as you simply dissuade the director. Your direction is bad, all the angles are wrinkled (not in a good way), the lines look like they are reading toilet paper, and goddamn music ... it always appears when it does not come out for no reason. And do not go for a writer, by the way. Making movies is not like serving at a hairdresser, it requires art and skill, things that I really doubt you'll ever have. back into oblivion and wait until something good does not appear. Or just go to find a job in a hairdresser. You will have less stress and you will save some money and bad night. Voice: 1/10 (my first)
