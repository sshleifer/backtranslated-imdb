What about the blurry video at the beginning and sporadically during the movie? It's as if somebody put muddy water on the lens of the camera. Violence and nudity can deter some people, but this, along with a mostly bad game, makes a good cult film, I suppose. /> My favorite line is delivered by Tarkuin the Vampire, "Awaj, your breed is stupid." All right, no one should say "unfortunately" in the movie line if they are not English and live in the 18th century. The character of Van Helsing character and the bad girl "Ralli" is not bad. I also liked Master Little who played Ron Little. Evil martial arts! Do not take it too seriously and you will enjoy it.
