I watched this movie last night and, as someone who had very low expectations, he was still disappointed. The most obvious mistake in this film horror is that the main point of the plot (the guy who was awake during the operation) had nothing to do with the outcome. It would end in the same way, regardless. So, what was the purpose of this? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had 4 lawsuits against him and did not think that people would ask questions if a patient died at his desk? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely talented and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just funny from start to finish. I'm pretty sure that if you feel that someone scalpel pierces your breasts, you would have more pain than that.
