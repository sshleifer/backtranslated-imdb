This show stinks. Parents usually want their children to see something good for them. Usually it's educational, fun, and clear. Is it Educational? Not. Doodlebops sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, do not try to teach anything. Is it funny? Not. Doodlebops instead say something that is not intended as a joke, and laugh at it. That's so great, painful. As far as color is concerned, everything is extremely fine, so it's good. But Nothing is wrong in the world of Doodlebops. That's why they are always happy. A child in distress will become depressed because it has never been grieved. The emission is also extremely cheese. Each style is expressed at the highest level of exaggeration and very tattered. That's fun. It's fun for kids, but two years ago you will not want your kids to see it. They will never know how to grow up.
