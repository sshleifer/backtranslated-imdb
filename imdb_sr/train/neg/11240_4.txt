An unreasonably ambitious science fiction from Kerry Conran, for whom this is obviously the work of love. Unfortunately, this is not very good. Everything starts well enough - with an epic, but restrained result, a mix of the style of Lucas and Hitchcock and the great cinema of Spielberg. The film also mentions many pulse sci-fi novels, serials and films as diverse as the Day of Earth, Superman, Metropolis, Planet Monkeys, Iron Giant, Star Wars, and Spijun who loved me. The film, however, does not manage to be as good as any of these reasons for several reasons: the main thing is that it's so much work of love, so concerned about throwing everything on the screen and creating a brave new world, Conran actually forgets to make a movie. There is little or no tension, atmosphere or magic in offer despite air battles, dinosaurs, and sets during the race. Even noir elements fall. This is a widespread way of looking at things - these elements mostly fail because nothing feels really and so obviously false - the green screen looks just like a video game of half the time and it's obvious that the actors are glued afterwards. . Actresses do not know much - Jude Lav is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is boring and stupid, Angelina Jolie is futile - and all this is because of a terrible script - those that have to explain almost everything. It is a decent experience, and some can feel nostalgia, but in the end this is a senseless step into the world yesterday. Nice finish.
