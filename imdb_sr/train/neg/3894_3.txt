The incredible man who melts plays as an extended episode of the Man with six million dollars, but with violence and some nudity. I know that this movie is a little bit ludicrous, but it was impossible for me to dislike it. The acting and script are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30-year film with a $ 50 budget - the title character takes quite a long time to melt, but when it does, it's pretty impressive; we have an inventive death scene that includes an electric shock. It should be noted music, it's crazy - cheese-tastic blend of nonsense. Important details: Admire a slow-hearted nurse who jumps through the glass window for absolutely no reason. * Be enchanted by the day in the life of a cut off head. Take care of psychotic cannibal melting humanoids. His name is Steve. Be awesome when our hero makes a break of hot craze hunting to have a bowl of soup and complains about insufficient crackers in the kitchen. This film is only 70's to hate it. It's sticky and garbage, but I thought it was fun. It could be much worse.
