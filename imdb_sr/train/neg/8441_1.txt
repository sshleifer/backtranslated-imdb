This film was long and boring. It is surprising that he was selected for Kan, although they are prone to pretentiousness. The point is that, unlike other Dutch stars of artistic genre such as Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey is completely empty. Moreover, it does not have any cinematographic quality. A long opening does not mean cinematographic depth, it's just a long boring video. The story was not interesting and the characters had problems that I could not identify at all. The actors did not sway under her direction and seemed to have been lost sometimes. Leopold tried, but she was not the talent I was hoping to be. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really made some waves in Dutch cinema. Leopold just tried.
