This film begins with a certain amount of promise; but, in my opinion, it starts to lose when the protagonist abducted a good Samaritan who helps him when his car breaks down. That this benevolent stranger began to repair his car while he is on the road, the phone call is incredible, but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him bring his family's life back on track. the authors were initially warned not to use in their stories. This film is at best found by myself. The art direction could have been much better, as could have been cinema. The acting was good, as did Eva van der Gucht's singing.
