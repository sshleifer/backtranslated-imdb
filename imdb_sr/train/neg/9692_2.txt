Bonjour Tristesse covers similar topics as a 'wedding member'. Namely, the possessive daughter tries to prevent the connection to form between the beloved family member and the interruptor. While critics love a 'wedding member', I consider Julie Harris to be an actress and an actress in everything that was in her. It's a travelogue. In this film, Preminger is developing, but characters do not do it. The first 30 minutes is pleased to obscure the relationship between father and daughter between Seber and Niven, making unpleasant sexual reading possible. When the conflict is introduced, Seberg can not deliver the depth that this part demands. Kerr pulls the ranking and turns the movie into 'Endless Love'. Saber's empty narration is like Strange Interlude - not good. I really want someone other than Niven to be in his role. Conducting so much time normalizing orthodox British behavior in all his films, never comes to a character. In the most memorable sequence, the evening dance becomes free for everyone in the harbor. Bertolucci steals the whole scene for his empty exercise, "Conformist". Kerr is on board to grab his hands and show another great pain (like in Black Narcissus, Iguan Night, King and Me, Heaven knows Mr. Alison, Tea and sympathy, etc.). Really, Kerr was a horrible actress. I wish every movie with it could end with a fatal crash, or even better, to start with one. People who feel uncomfortable due to ambiguity should avoid this.
