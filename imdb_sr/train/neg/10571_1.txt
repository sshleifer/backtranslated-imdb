my wife is a fanatic about this show. This is the case when I bought her season from one to three and a fourth season on order. I personally think that the performance is one big farce that is equally bad. Alissa Milano was supposed to hold other films about the garbage he recorded, such as Poison Ivi, Embrace of the Vampire, to mention only some of them, while other members of the women's team are equally incapable of their impressions. I saw better special effects in the old series of the Republic that I saw as a child. I can understand why men's tracks have remained in the show for such a short period of time, although I do not know whether it's their choice or not. Please. please do not renew for another season enough is enough, Bob
