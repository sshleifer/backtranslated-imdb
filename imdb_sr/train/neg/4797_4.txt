After the mafia chief Vic Moretti (late Grand Anthony Francios) killed his lady who cheated him with Derek, their new driver / Vietnam veteran, and blamed him for the poor boy, Derek is in a prison where he has to fight with a corrupt warden, Vic's captive brother who leads the prison, and, yes, the illegal experiments conducted by the suspicious CIA agent (the great genre-major and first-time director John Sakon) turned various prisoners into super-human invincible zombies. Of course things get out of control, and Derek, like other unconfirmed prisoners, must save the day after they get infected with prison. John Sakon is an excellent talented actor and as a director of Saxon is ... a great talented actor. To say that this film (John's only director's tour to date) does not have a certain visual count would be a little underestimated. However, the film is not entirely without merit. Dialogue, although idiotic, is bad enough to sometimes be witty. Unfortunately, this is not enough for the film to take it alone and it lasts forever that the film begins to come into its own (which is pretty late in the film). As such, the most I can recommend to this film is to say that if you are a Saxon fan (which I really am), it's worth an hour, just go with low expectations and you should be fine.
