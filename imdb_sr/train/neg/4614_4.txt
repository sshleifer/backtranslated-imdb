It's amazing how this film was nominated for the seven Oscars and won one. Not because it's embarrassing or because the collective credibility of the creative team really deserves it, but because in each category nominated Prizzi honor is disappointing. Some would argue that John Huston, the old Hollywood pioneer, lost up to that moment in his career, but I do not buy him. Last year alone, he signed an excellent UNDER THE VOLCANO, a dark character study set in Mexico, which is among the best he ever did. It honors honor, on the other hand, a movie full of stars, good intentions and a decent script, proves to be a great disappointment. The total tone and complication of a gangster who falls in love with a female hit man prefigures strange criminals who captured Hollywood storm in the early 1990s, but the script is too intricate for themselves, the motivations are turned off and, in general, the story looks unsure of what she's trying to be: a romantic comedy Jack Nicholson (working Brooklyn's accent that perfectly works for De Niro, but sounding incredibly out of Jack) and Kathleen Turner in leading roles seems to be in paicheck mode, just going through moves. they pass through some parts. On the other hand, Anjelica Huston is better, but her performance is sabotaged by the motives of her character: she begins the sacrifice of her big father's disdain, proves to support her ex-husband, and then becomes a vindictive bitch who wants to turn around The color of the film has a washed quality, as it was made in the early 1970s, and Huston is as uninteresting as everything else. Behind the story there is a promise and maybe in the hands of a starving director to recognize him, it could turn into something better, but what remains is like a movie that no one really was interested in.
