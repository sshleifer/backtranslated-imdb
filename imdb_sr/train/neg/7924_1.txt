Film Teda V. Mikels Corpse Grinders 2 is a 103 minute tormented film beverage. The action is mostly a blend of meaningless business relationships among people who mushroom corpses in cat food, while feline aliens, who are losing a war with aliens, are seeking to receive one of these feline foods. Looking at this movie, I started looking for any kind of disturbance, anything to make sure I was doing something else but losing my mind from inside. Several scenes take too long, while characters last forever to do simple things. I heard that Mr. Mikel does not like to use too many jumps too often, fearing that he will confuse his audience. I'm not sure whether this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid". Trying as much as possible, I could not make an effort to take care of any character in an unnecessarily large acting circle, with the possible exception of the elderly who are factory guards. Most actors are a bunch of amateurs who have no talent and who do not even try to learn the verses of "Amazing Grace" before they have to sing on the camera. Although he may be guilty of poor sound quality, because I only heard about 80% of the dialogue while I watched a DVD. This is probably the worst movie ever shot. I listened to the snippets of comments, and Mr. Mikels appeared as a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell did he do with this garbage? I'd like to hear explanations from the elderly who had to lie without a T-shirt on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be earthed. Films that I hated for a long time seem much better. I crave for the mutually appropriate music of Ecalibur and the constant lighting of Dawn of the Dead. I have to do something, anything. You do not see this movie.
