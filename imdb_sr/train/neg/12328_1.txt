It's obviously illegal. Pedophiles are praying for such things. How did they get out of such a movie? This film is summed up in a single word, SICK. Where people go to make and watch such films. As I watched the movie, I did not really mean that he would allow this child to say if he really was sleeping with that woman. I'm sorry if this is a spoiler for you, but I would do it. Where did these people's common sense disappear? Perhaps the creators of this film are pedophiles? Our society is today filled with all kinds of sexual predators who are praying to children, but filmmakers make such films that do nothing else but provoke this kind of behavior. I noticed that on the previous comment, someone asked if there was a version in which he showed them the goal. This is a child here, and somebody is looking for something like this? What's wrong with this picture?
