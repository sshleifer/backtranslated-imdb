Steve Carpenter can not make horor movies. First, the casting was very wrong for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown hair girl from the Buffy Vampire Killer. These films do not go up (usually the key ingredient for a horror movie), no action, no acting and no uncertainty (also a key ingredient). Bentley's all good actor, but he's so dry and clear that it's sad. There were several parts that were supposed to be funny (the continuation of teen horror films) and nobody laughed at the audience. I thought this film was rated as R, and I did not pay attention and realized that it was changed to PG-13. In any case, check out this movie if you like and Still Knov Vhat I've Did Last Summer. It's the only type of person who would consider this film even frightening. And seriously, this is for you Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like Tekas Chainsav Massacre.
