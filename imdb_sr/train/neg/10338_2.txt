This movie is simply stupid. From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the stupid climax, the film is an exercise in woody predictability. Mike Hammer is a true sociopath of detective fiction. Unlike Marl and Spade, who merge parts to solve the mystery, Hammer separates things to get to the truth. This movie turns Hammer into his chest by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too stupid to get away with anything. One of them is so badly drawn that he succumbed to a popcorn attack. Other parts of the film are exactly from the book Three Stooges. For example, Velda dances on a bar or on a bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And interruptions in continuity are shameful: Frau Blucher runs down the centerline of the road when the camera is firm on the lower legs, but it is far across the side when the camera pulls for a wider recording. The worst break, however, is preceded by a popcorn attack. The bad guy lurking Hammer passes an hour after our hero, except that the clock shows that he was seven minutes behind our boyfriend. To be honest, there were interesting corners of the camera and lighting, and the big finals are so bad that they must see, which is the only reason it gets two points out of 10.
