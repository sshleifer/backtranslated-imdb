this film has no complication, no character development, and no budget. It's really shit to put in a short time. Since there is no development for the film, it can not really be seen as an attempt to be artistic or to try to plead against torture. What leaves two more reasons to look at it. To be shocked or to get out of it like a sick little freak. Well, here's a little bit. Reactions of the girl look stupid. It is extremely easy to say that it is fake (honestly professional wrestling looks more real than shit trying to pass in this movie.) They threw it on her, but she fell asleep for most of it, so it's just stupid. is quickly cut from the scene to the scene just before the needle strikes her in. But frankly, the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake, with the exception of the eye, a movie about torture, look at Hostel and Hostel 2. Not only do they both have realistic violence, there is already a real story that attracts you and makes you look after it topics such as American fears of aliens, morale questions, testing how far the person can go, human instincts against civilization, and many other things, plus they are carefully written and contain good humor when the story is not focused on v. This is a much better choice compared to this shit
