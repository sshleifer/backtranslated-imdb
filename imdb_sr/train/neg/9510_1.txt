Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films in 2001. The film is trying to cross Heathers and Bring It On and it fails. When I saw it last January I was so disgusted with the film that I walked and talked to my cell phone with my girlfriend in the last half hour of the movie. I heard that DVD has a director's rez maybe I'll look at it, but this PG-13 trash movie is *** and the worst kind with ***. Maybe the movie had some T & A to do it right. But the legs are lame and the acting is terrible. Above the Troma movie.
