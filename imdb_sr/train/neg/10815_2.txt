I love the book "Jane Eire" and I've seen many versions. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. However, this was one of the worst I've ever seen. I did not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerant and definitely looked like a regular part, but she did not have any emotions in any of her lines. I could not imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. This brings us to Mr. Rochester. Villiam Hurt had even less emotions than Jane, if that was possible. How could two such soulless people fall in love with the mystery, but it certainly did not attract my attention. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during the production. Timothy Dalton (too handsome for Mr. Rochester!) Version is a far more loyal book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect g. in the A / E version of 1997 (which is NOT all that true for the book). Trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
