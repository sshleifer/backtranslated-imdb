Poor Robert Englund makes another flop and at the expense of Tobe Hooper, who usually makes pretty good horror films, but he has failed quite a bit in this. Englund plays the famous Markue De Sade, who was detained in the 17th century for his obsession with pain, and the pleasure of bringing pain on himself, as well as watching others is also in pain. The story is so confusing with a flip flop from one century to another, and I became confused about what is happening and what is the purpose of this film. All I saw was a young lady captured by a strange lesbian who wants to keep her for himself, and the young lady was fascinated by this Arab with a lot of money and finds out that he came out to kill her, and then Englund stepped from one century to another, arguing that the descendant of de Sade was trying to kill her because she reminded him of Mrs. Momoselle (written in the wrong way) or to anyone in the picture above De Sades Wall. The film was horrible, I was surprised by Hooper for engaging Englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and funny, especially a part about the eyes. Englund is trying to get back from his former hit "Nightmare on Elm St." using these needles to draw and take people's eyes. Terribly, absolutely terrible.
