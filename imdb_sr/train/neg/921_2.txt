I rented this one to see Vanessa Talor again. He can act, but there is no way in this rush. The opening sequence is an elaborate shot of mountain landscapes. He must have come from the archive, because the film was shot directly on the video tape. The production values ​​make _Blair Vitch_ a professional look. There is really a poor animated statue, but there are no other effects to be noted. This movie is bad, but not fun. It would be good for players to not mention this in their biographies.
