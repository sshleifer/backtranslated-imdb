As far as I can tell you, despite previous comments by other commentators, this film is currently available on DVD. I found it just a few weeks ago. It is on the Value DVD label and I paid a total of 98 cents plus a tax for it. I found it in a 98 cents store among plastic containers and disposable wands. Do you people who have shelled the beau coup dollars for the super-duper Swedish version of the limited version of the imports feel like you ate? I thought so. This film was really worth 98 cents. 99 cents, maybe I'll start quarreling with you. But it's obviously worth 98 cents. And remember this saying of getting what you pay. Just for the slasher movie mavens.
