To make a good movie, or you need a great actor or a great director. You need at least one of these two. There is nothing in this eye of the Needle. Even I do not remember the name of the director. She does not have to do much in her career. I love Donald Sutherland, but he absolutely can not be the main actor in the movie. He falls. Sutherland is great in the movie when it appears for no more than 15 minutes. I would say, for example, that Sutherland was excellent at JFK Oliver Stone when he talked with Kevin Costner on the park bench for 10 minutes without stopping, even without breath. Wonderful. But Sutherland as the main actor in the movie is not good. Kate Nelligan? Probably good for the TV series. DVD is terrible. Horrible colors. Horrible light. I could not appreciate the landscape of Storm Island for bad photography. This story of Ken Follett was good, but it's a shame that she's turned her into an unintelligible movie.
