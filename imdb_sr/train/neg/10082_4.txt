I laughed through this broken movie. It's so incredible. A woman leaves her husband after years of marriage, she has a malfunction before the real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes out and offers her a job! Hilarious! The next thing you know is that two women go for it. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing sounds true in this film, "Life for women without anything better". An inconvenient dialogue like "I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had the chance to be happy and I did not accept it" does not help. There is a rich, far-reaching mother who does not approve of a new relationship of her daughter. Sassi is a black maid - it's incredible that in 2003 a movie was shot in which a black maid was sacked. Hattie McDaniel must turn to the grave. A woman has a husband who curses and wants custody of the little ones. Sheesh! No cliche remains unshaken.
