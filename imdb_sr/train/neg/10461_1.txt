It's interesting to read Omega Code commentaries ... many of the predominantly positive comments came out of TBN broadcasts ... the movie looks like it was made to go directly to the video, to be supplied in addition to the three - a series of excitement that is another religious group in the 1970s did it. You will not remember this in a year or two. This is the first film I ever saw where it was implied that your religious duty is to go to him and buy as many cards as possible to save the soul ... very shameful ... this only shows that if you are the son of a television channel, you can play a Hollywood producer with lil ole lady of dozens ...
