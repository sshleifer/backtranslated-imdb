The small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a lone avenger and a group of survivors. Released in 1993, "Darkness" won some of the cult after liberation. It's easy to figure out why it's loaded (and I mean burdened), which is energy and enthusiasm, as is the case in other non-budget cult horrors such as "The Dead Nekt Door" and "Children of Ravensback", although this is maybe the truth, this unfortunately is not enough to save it. The film was shot on Super 8, so the image is grainy and dark, which makes things very difficult to see (it would be great to have sheltered the protagonists with a horrible scarf). Keyboard and even more boring Death Metal (seriously, what about this budget horror and poor Death Metal?) While one does not expect an Oscar to be a decent performance, acting is still a strictly amateur watch, because actors sometimes seem almost confused. In the end, I'm sure fans of non-budget foster will love. Everyone else will want to have a little more meat on the ribs.
