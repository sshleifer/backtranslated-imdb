Iovza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're a better person than me! This film, while the great attempt to "imitate" Laurel and Hardy through phenomena, sound and routine, does not satisfy them, or even represent the film of any substance. Curse Larry Harmon. The dialogue was torn off from old L + H films and unrealisticly planted, the plot is cluttered by the useless characterization of other unnecessary actors, Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan, and while Sartain worked perfectly with Ollie's accent, he tried hard to create a wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was the (good) music number? The editing is shocked, the performance is stiff, the lines are terrible, the physics is - incredible - (although they may have been trying to give it the feeling of cheap gatherings?), But all in all, it's terrible. It's even more painful to watch ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made his last film in terrible writing and a photo from the 1950s era. Do yourself a favor and watch as many ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as possible, and learn how things came about. You know what MAGNAT is, right? Stan Laurel did not consistently respond to the semi-moronic moves on each sentence. I'm sorry for anyone who thinks this is a decent update / honor of a boy. Where is the PASMA CLASSIC THEMES?!? Why Destroy "Here's Another Good Confusion"? Why skip "any wise"? Why was there a meaningless bunch of actors? WHY MISS GULCH OZ Wizard ???? WHY SHOULD LARRY HARMON? WHY BOZO!? And did the learning channel help fund the thing? I mean, really. Fart jokes, for God's sake. FART JOKES.
