I'm a big fan of horror flick, and zombie movies are my favorite. However, Zombie 3 is one of the absolutely worst films I've ever seen. Needless to say that I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've been watching for a long time. The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon's "The Return of the Living Dead", but while this film was deliberately ridiculous, this is exactly the opposite. There are some of the funniest things I have ever seen, especially from the main scientific character. His scenes with the general were just hysterical. Also, the effects are subordinate and in many cases untidy, and the death scenes are often simply stupid. That, of course, makes it all funny. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst scene in which the boy opens the door to the refrigerator and sees a cut off the zombie head, which then opens his eyes and somehow OUTSIDE THE FRIDGE (apparently pulls clumsily with a little wire), clinging to the neck guys, killing him. Zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? He defies every physical law to a famous man, and this is one of the absurd things ever taken. It's just one of many really stupid moments in idiotic confusion. I can not believe he got such a high rating. If you are a fan of bad films, do yourself a favor and rent this fool.
