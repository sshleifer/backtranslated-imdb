Horror movie! It must have been against some real stinkers who were nominated for the Golden Globe. They took up the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and destroyed it to be unrecognizable. My complaint is not that they have accepted the facts; that the story is good, that would be perfectly good. But it's just bizarre - in all likelihood, the true story of this artist would have been made for a much better film, so why did they come to this boring scenario? I suppose there were not enough naked people in the factual version. In the end, it was abruptly covered with a summary of the artist's life - we could save for several hours if we would have favored the rest of the film with the same shortness.
