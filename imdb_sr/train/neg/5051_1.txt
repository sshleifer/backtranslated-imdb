I am also amused and horrified by people who claim that this film is so precise about Vietnam, and I WAS NOT. This film is true of the entire war in Vietnam, while the beatings of Rodney King are true for ALL police officers. Yes, bad things are happening (but they are not), but in general, people are there just like you and me. They have morale, do not kill machines, do not do all drugs. Crimes were an exception in Vietnam, not a rule. They have happened much less often than you would bring hyper to your faith. Oliver Stone has the ability to film films that show that the war in Vietnam was brutal bloodshed, but based on reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe in stereotypes about Vietnam, do yourself a favor and find out the truth. Fact: Vietnamese and NVAs have done much worse things to southern Vietnam than any soldier in the US armed forces. Fact: World War II soldiers treated their enemies much worse than they did in Vietnam, and they were welcomed when they returned home. The finest Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; Although the war was badly driven from a political point of view, no one could claim more than our soldiers, and it is a great shame to claim that such a kind of "mostly true" fiction is the way things really existed.
