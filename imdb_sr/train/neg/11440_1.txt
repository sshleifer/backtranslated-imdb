Otherwise, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I think ever. My wife and I were bored within 10 minutes. Not to mention boring, it's totally unbelievable. Women (not lesbians) do not swim together - nor do they "accidentally" kiss. Brothers and sisters do not live together in their thirties and run around with a swinging together and dealing with trails in the central park. Men do not find out that their wife and sister have kissed romantically the night before the wedding, and then they never talk about it with that woman. Absolutely funny. Heather Graham is perhaps the worst actress in movies today. She laughs when she needs to cry and vice versa. The only movie in which she was good was Boogie Nights - and that's because she did not act. I can not emphasize enough how bad this movie was.
