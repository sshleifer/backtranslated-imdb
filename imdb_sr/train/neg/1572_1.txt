One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, ridiculous 'action' (it's clear that cars travel slowly), an awful script, a terribly unsatisfactory ending, and an incompetent direction make up the hash of the movie. We know that Judge Reinhold is a good actor, but he needs to be ashamed of that detritus. There is not a lot of tension in the car, and when the characters find themselves in moments of hope, they are for some reason laughing like meaningless bans, even "high five" when they see the bridge down! Also, the chain of events that leads these people to sharing the same car, credible. Apparently based on true events? If this is the case, the truth is obviously strange than fiction! Unfortunately, this was shown in such an incompetent way.
