This became a cult film in Chinese students, although I watched it until it was broadcast in Channel 4, Great Britain. The 'spirit' that wishes to convey is that independent artists 'resist the commercialization of the music industry' and maintain their 'purity of the artistic soul' and would not 'sell for dirty money'. it's really dizzy and superficial; The diologist is mostly pathetic. action is bad. Sceenplai is full of artistic pretensions. It's a fantasy movie for kids and it's all <br />
