A typical Italian movie from the 70's, original and good music, but with some interesting, interesting but not fantastic photographs, poor and sometimes confused stories (for example, Role of a dog's wolf and where does the boy come from?) With a bad dialogue, a beautiful ambiance. The reason she is still (relatively) well-known and is likely to be bare scenes (including typical pseudo-coitus 70s) involving 11 and 13 year old girls with older teenagers (Eva Ionesco and Laura Vendel) - it is interesting from the socio-political point of view to see how these representations of very young adolescents were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the United States) 30 years ago, and now it's more than a taboo. The story revolves around one girl's violent behavior (Laure) by the other two characters and her discovery of sex, which is a fairly accurate display of a teenager's life. The character Eve (Silvia) does not evolve to the very end of the film and already seems very much engaged in erotic art - for her there is no "age": she is a very futile young girl who is already aware of her sexual charm, but is ultimately only used and ends The movie cries like a little girl she still is. The boy is an extremely disgusting bully, while Laura comes as a very naive and poor victim.
