The most powerful movie of all time? Not to mention by '68, should not they cross the white ones in brown faces playing the "Indians"? My favorite parts, however, must be when the girls laugh and blush as the cyclists drag them into rape. Rape is fun! Who knew him? Let's see, then there is a clear reversal of Hustler (the personality of the boss is actually playing the pool as he seizes the chance to destroy Indians with the main rebellious type), terrible acting, the so-called musical characters, maybe just-good-are-only -Sorry-you-what-to-think, the lack of anyone who is actually an Indian in this movie. And who should we fight for? I have to say that the figure is that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Although his films tend to advocate strong women, I have heard from at least one source that in real life he is a misogynistic idiot. Why did I look at it, you ask? Do not ask.
