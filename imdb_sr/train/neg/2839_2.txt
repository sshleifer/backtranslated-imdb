This movie is one of my favorites. It's not really good, but it's great to laugh. Dialogue can become incredibly ridiculous and behave badly (eg, "Smaller, can we ask you a few questions?" "Of course." "We think you can help us with the answer." Make sure you watch Brock, the white man who attacks the main characters There are only two lines, but he is one of the best guys in the movie!
