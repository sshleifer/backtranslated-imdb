What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean, I like Seagal first. I love all his films until the mid-2000s. His wounds are some of the best in the genre. This, however, does not fulfill its good name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lavson (Seagal)) would be expected as a mindless action movie with Seagal in a typical form. However, what we get is a crime mystery, borders with a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in the shadow of his weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who mutate in superhumans when taking drugs. What happened in this movie. Shooting Sagala is a disgrace, ruin and shame. Why dub? The story is terrible. This got 2/10 from me because of the scene in which Seagal sought support, even though he had an army with him, and a hilarious battle scene in which the seagal waves hands with a girl turned to the camera! "Revenge is a two-way street," says Seagal in this movie ... well forget the revenge Steven, you need redemption!
