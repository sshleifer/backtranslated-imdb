This movie is nothing like "Office Space" except in the room. Office Space was hilarious. I would not recommend this film to anyone, because I did not laugh even during the whole movie. Mr. Cornbluth's self-lenient tirade quickly become bored with 15 Jason Alekanders in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or watch it in someone else's home so you can go if necessary.
