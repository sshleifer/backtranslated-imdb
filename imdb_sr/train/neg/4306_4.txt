There is one good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! I'm sorry I'm so dumb, but that's true. Too bad she did not do the act. This would at least make this confusion more tolerable. We see more breasts with the fish, but she is not even close to Lola. And man, is Armand Assante old or what? Man looks like shit! "Consequence" is the usual B-movie you would expect. The story had the potential. It's like they had good ideas, but they did not know how to do it. Cinema is simply terrible. Ugli! The director is uninspired and the end result is a mild thriller with lame complications and washed actors. Lola Gaudini is great as a fox in a cheap, slutty way, but even she does not save the "consequences" of the garbage and not the ridiculous garbage, just plain old stinking waste.
