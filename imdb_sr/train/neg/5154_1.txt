This is the only movie I've ever left. bad acting - bad performance - bad acting - bad directing - bad cinema - if they started to make a bad picture, they could not do better. I hope they are proud of his party. I'm surprised that anyone linked to this movie ever re-hired at Hollywood. do not waste your time!
