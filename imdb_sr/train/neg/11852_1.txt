This film allegedly portrayed the bachelor of a 'female man' who was ready and willing to calm down once and for all. However, I do not care if his mission will be calm, because I did not care for his character. I do not understand what all these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class or charisma. At least there should have been a way to get down to poor ladies except for the saxophone, but without success. Just because the musician does not make it sexy. Not to mention, the things he did to draw the attention of the married woman whom he fell in love within a span of five minutes of knowledge, was absolutely unexpected and funny. Is this man any shame? Had he dressed and stopped working and spoke nonsense, he would be more attractive as a character, but unfortunately, his character was boring. Character Gene Gershon was unnecessarily British. It could have been equally easy to be intrusive with her voice of ordinary speech than a poor British accent that would sometimes fade out of the movie. The only two characters I was worried about were the fish and the frog. Now the two of them had chemistry! Academic nominations for both? STAT! Plot holes, lack of character development, terrible acting, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... What a mess of film.
