Well, no, not really. It's not a good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I really did not feel deprived of the money to rent, and sometimes it's all you can ask for. The action is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the actors are pretty. The director is passable, but the effects are terrible, especially the effects of the werewolves, which are in the film of a werewolf, a rather big problem. There was a pretty decent amount of nudity, which was pretty good for me, but it was not that hot. All in all, it's a pretty average video movie, not the worst movie I've ever seen and if you're bored by a fan genre, check it once. I would even look at him again. Bonus Facts for Horror Geek, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a couple of them) plays the insects.
