The opening scene 'explains' why Hurt is later 'immune' to a 'contaminated man'. It's a pity that it does not explain anything else: how it got what it 'caught' / what it is / why it does it so quickly. Then we go to "Today's Budapest". OK, was it the opener in the past or the future? It turned out that this past is, of course, but for the moment, it looks the same as it will be moved to the beginning. I'm sorry, I should've been paying attention, huh? Or maybe it was badly done. Then there was a lot of confusion about the various jobs he had in related fields, and finally, the mention of how he should die from the original experiment he had done on it. Yup! So, private and private industry gathered to poison one of their best guys to watch the effects? He must have been one of the best guys, he is a friend of Chemical Company, for God's sake. Then there is the substance itself: Technical poison, but mutates in the immune 'carriers', so that we can have whatever we want; poison, disease, allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it is not contagious from one victim of dying to another, only from the bearer. How nice. Then, there is a protocol: they go into a situation without any idea of ​​what is being prepared, or how to prepare for it. Did the producers not have enough money to show how they were made after the crew left the deadly unknown substance? I always thought Hurt would die from a bad cleaning technique, and the open scene would still be closer.
