Most of the song "Over Her Dead Bodi" is so painfully unwanted that I crawled to my headquarters from the shame of the actors. comedy, and still, she does not have any comedy time at all. She bends and bores like a spirit that returns to Earth to guard the cooked psychic from her widow. Faith is played by Paul Rudd, captain and charming, while the psychic plays at Lake Bell, bringing the movie to life regardless of the anemic energy it has. I was most sorry for Bell, because she seems to have some comical skills and worked overtime in an effort to do material work. Unfortunately, she faces the insurmountable task of making any movie that has Jason Biggs tolerable, and she is withdrawn with other actors like Leo DiCaprio at the end of the "Titanic". "Through her dead body" he actually drove me out, because of his laziness and complete lack of effort. I started thinking about all interesting projects that can not be financed because huge amounts of money are being put into this kind of shit. Seriously, does Hollivood think such films are good enough? How stupid do they really think the movie audience is? Grade: F
