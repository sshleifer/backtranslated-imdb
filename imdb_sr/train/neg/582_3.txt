A great book with great features and insights into human nature, especially the nature of addiction, which still resonates today. As for the film ... eh. Nothing special. Kamerman had an unhappy dependence on circling and circling and the all-round circling around him, making the viewer quite troublesome. Why the director did not stop it, it's beyond me - but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow unsuccessfully, to get good performances from these otherwise great but inadvertently acting actors. All in all, poor adaptation. Your three hours would be better spent on reading (or re-reading) the book.
