A boring, foreseeable and uninteresting story about a man polluted with chemical substance (Veller) that goes across the country just to find an ex-wife and children; In the meantime, he kills everything in his own way only with one touch of his own hands. In his dangerous course, a doctor (Hurt) and a young journalist (Natasha) are trying to stop a man. The film has no original premise, but although it could be much better. The final result is only a film without tension or trembling. Even good hunting is completely wasted. I give this 4 (four).
