As a passionate fan of Flashman's books by George McDonald Fraser, I was extremely pleased to watch Flashy on the big screen when this movie was first released. Unfortunately, that was a big disappointment at the time - so I left it alone for 20 years before I returned to look at it again, but it was not the best time to do it again. Mr. Fraser is a terribly misleading writer, but I am not a fan of his film script with Richard Lester. The slapstick preference has ruined the 'Three Musketeers' for me, and the same goes for us. The whole tone and impression of the film is wrong to me. Flashman's books are in some respects exciting, but they are adventurous novels. There is a lot of seriousness in the adventure path that Flashman has - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. It is transmitted in novels, but it is not transmitted at all due to the comic style. It was a huge embarrassment because he could have had a great movie that it was a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I first read that the book would be filmed, the article said that the film would be playing Oliver Reed. I was glad, because Reed was my symbol of Flashman. How would I like to see him in the role. Malcolm McDovell is a good actor, but does not fit into the visual image of Flashman created by books (too skinny appearance! Flashman should be a big boy). Still, Reed was as good as Bismarck. What kills a movie is what makes it comedy. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet (Tom Bell). Great disgrace, because production values, costumes, sets, etc. Excellent, and casting is generally great - almost everyone in the movie is well-known except for Malcolm McDowell. It is possible that Richard Lester's director was responsible for the way the film, such as the recent Flash Flash adaptation, adapted by Mr. Fraser, worked pretty well. Maybe one day we can see that Flashman is right on the screen.
