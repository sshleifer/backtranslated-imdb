MY EYES! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND EVERYTHING WHEN YOU PREPARE THIS FILM! on what drugs are you people! This could be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was on bad acid all the time, I have to invite a therapist to help me cope with the trauma of this epic disaster. From the very beginning to the end, a glossy rope is an unslaved masterpiece of the Satanic cinema. When I thought I was watching this film with my Jewish best friend and his family, we thought: "Oh, hey, this can be funny! A movie could be. All my friends lined up for lobotomy as soon as the film was over, and during the film one of my friends tried to hang himself with a belt, while the other tried to sew his handmade wooden spoons.I wish I had watched the video from the Ring instead, so the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days. who want to see this movie, are NOT PREPARED! you can think you are some kind of "tough guy" so you'll rent it, but this film will make you break, pushed to the ground and urinate on you.
