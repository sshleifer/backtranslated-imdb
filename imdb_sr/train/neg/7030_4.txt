One of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is the taking of famous, classical stories and complete destruction. The Phantom of Mall is no exception to this rule. The screenwriter takes a permanent phantom story about the Opera and moves it to a shopping center in the late 80's. However, the goal of the "Phantom" is now to take revenge on those responsible for destroying his face and killing his family. Special effects give you a good grip, especially when parts of the body start to appear in yogurt bowl containers. Pauli Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be completely disgusting as you would expect, mainly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of MTV fame has not yet arrived. If you are looking for some good laughter at the expense of actors and special effects teams, check this flick out. Otherwise, continue looking for something else.
