This is a big step down after a surprisingly pleasant original. This sequel is not nearly as entertaining as the first part, and instead it takes too much time to develop the plot. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing in this series, but his wisdom is relaxed in this entry. All the performances are adequate, but this time, the script is failing. Action is just a routine and the action is just a little interesting, so I need a lot of funny laughter to have fun during the film "Trancers". Unfortunately, there is little laughter, and this film is, at best, visible.
