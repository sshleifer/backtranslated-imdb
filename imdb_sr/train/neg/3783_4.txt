It was not a senseless experience of an animated film ever, but it certainly can not admire as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamvorks animation and computer graphics, this is a mustang story, later called the Spirit (Matt Damon, which provides first-person narration), and his journey across the borders of the Old West. Basically, he was born free among all the other horses in a beautiful landscape, and then kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he managed to discard all who try to ride him. However, when he escapes from his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two of them form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has something for the Little Horse's female horse. In the end, after several more escapes, pursued by the Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and made a final big jump over the gorge, Little Creek allows the Spirit to leave, and he also frees his female horse, and they run to their homeland and their compatriots. He also plays Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphi / Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as a soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthev Levin as Joe. I expected to see the horses in this film, but it turned out to be more like a Dumbo thing, and the songs of Brian Adams are not the most interesting, but it's not a horrible movie. He is nominated for the Best Animated Film Oscars, and is nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Song for Brian Adams "Here I Am". Okay!
