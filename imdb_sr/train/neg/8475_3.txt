(NOTE: I thought I would be the only one writing what I did below, but I see that the others agree. I suppose it was pretty obvious - it was overweight with the bait. The owners left the holiday for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving a cat (Silvester) alone and locked in the house, meaning that there is no milk, but the cat finds for it a bunch of canned tuna for his relief, but for his anxiety he can not find the opener. <br / > It turns out that the little mouse in the house has ... and the bait lures him. This is evil a sailor who constantly teases Sylvester with the opener and then pushes him back in the last second. Silvester is trying everything possible to open a tuna can, but he can not. This is a frustrating story, and why they make a sadistic mouse "a good guy" outside of me. It's like some of Tom & Jerry's caricatures in which the poor Tom always gets the worst of it, even though the little mouse started a clash!
