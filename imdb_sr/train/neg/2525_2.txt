This film is, as Homer Simpson said, "boring from the church." Maybe I do not understand it well enough, and I thought it started pretty well, but after (START OF SPOILER) Hermann Brown was sent to prison and Maria started working / sleeping with her boss. to stay awake. Again, maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion eventually seemed very compulsive and unreasonable. (END OF SPOILER). In the end, I do not see why others think it's so great, because I considered it extremely boring. Otherwise, I did not watch this film with my own free will, because I had to see it for movie lessons.
