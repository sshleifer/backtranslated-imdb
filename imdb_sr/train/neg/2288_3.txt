Who's Betty Page? I certainly did not find out when I was watching this movie. From what I collected from other sources, Ms. Page was highly sought after the Second World War as the queen of "naughty" images, and that's exactly what this film is about. I never met Bettie, a woman. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of evangelical Christian education and a poor home life that was only implied. The film glorifies her personal life and is reduced to the purpose of the film, "invalid" images. The characters are presented and abandoned within a few frames, but there is a frame after the Bettie frame in her pointed girly, Bettie in the belt and socks, Bettie in bondage ... etc. The film slides from black to white every time Mrs. Mrs. Page visits Miami Beach. Then we return to her gray-hue nuances in New York. Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most precious young ladies you've ever met. When Betty trusts a friend who missed her to be her high school student by getting A, and not A, it can only be assumed that there were only two students in her higher class. The most interesting part of this film is how strange photos of Miss Paige appear in 2007. It's really sad that seeing a woman who is intertwined like a pig on a spit would not even hit the Mi Space or Iou Tube. I'm not sure if this movie was written badly or some crazy editor cut the thing to pieces. I would recommend it only as a source for people who are studying the history of unusual underwear.
