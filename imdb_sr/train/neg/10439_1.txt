I'd like to think like a pretty open guy and that I need a lot (!) That I do not like a movie, but this one is no doubt one of the most demanding, most expensive films I've ever seen! > I do not know what's wrong with people who gave him such a good rating (imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to grades) ... the only thing I can imagine is that people voted for one or more of the conditions: 1. While they were scolded / crushed from their minds 2. They got cash for voices 3. Under the pistol I can not believe I lost a good 1 h 45 mins my life for this pathetic excuse for the film.
