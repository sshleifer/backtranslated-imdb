This movie has upset me! When I think of Cat in a hat. I'm thinking about the cats in the books of the hat. You know, the one who read his parents a few years ago to his children. Well, I think this movie would be very similar! But much to my surprise was nothing like a book! Insted is more like humor for the young. In one part of the cat talks with the garden tool (hoe), the cat talks to her as if his motive (agin adult humor). Appointment of his car, so it was a bit uncomfortable for a children's movie. Below the rating you will find: mild humor and some double enters. I think it means a bit of humor. I wish I could get this movie back! Wal-Mart said he would not, because the film was open. If you're considering purchasing this product, I suggest you rent an apartment before you buy it.
