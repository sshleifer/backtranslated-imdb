I must say that I'm pretty disappointed with this "horror" movie. I was not scared even once I watched him. Also, it's not even tense ... I could guess the ending on half the film ... So ... what's left? The "Ring" is a really terrifying film. .. I want other movies to stop copying from it (eg Brand: long hair). Please give me some originality. I will not recommend this film.
