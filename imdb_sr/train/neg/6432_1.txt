The title says everything. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a tag given to a senator who rely on public ignorance of World War II aircraft. The revolving pistols leaned against the lock that would prevent the rear gunner from firing the plane's tail by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed to the tail. When a senator trained one day on the ground, he managed to take off the tail plane. He could not do that the gun was properly aligned. The officer who was responsible for this admitted, publicly, in front of the camera, that he was responsible - he made a mistake, not a senator. The fact that the film did not cite this fact shows how unilateral it is. This film is designed to do one thing, destroy the reputation of a complex person. Much better program was a special PBS. He was a diligent, intelligent, ambitious politician who overcame remarkable shortcomings in order to rise to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but the shooting of the tail from the plane was not one of them. The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories, one = one-sided stories, so they do not have to think.
