Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who had a small part in the classic "Warriors") was the first person in the community to realize that in his small town there are murderous snail. Not just any snares, but you, but the killer carnivore is larger than normal, mutated by toxic waste worms (which still go just as fast as normal snails, which is not so scary but I deviate). In the beginning, nobody will believe him, but he will. Oh, yes, he will. OK, the killers are precisely above the psychotic lazy people and just below Johnathon Vinters like Morkov's baby in the fever pitch. So the absurdity of all this is evident from the very beginning. Slipping is fun and a bit of 'so bad is good' variety. I appreciate the fact that they said it was a Snail movie, unlike snails: a children's game or snails: another white meat. Probably not worth watching him more than once and immediately forgetting, except that he plays a pretty vague trivial game. The director, Juan Pikuer Simon, is better known for his previous films, "Pod People" (deservingly mocked MST3K) and Peices (which is quite possibly the happiest bad movie ever made).
