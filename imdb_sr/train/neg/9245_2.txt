This video was a masterpiece in 1995. Matthews Perry and Jennifer Aniston have great chemistry on the screen when they talk about what the Start button is doing. I am waiting for Microsoft to release a special DVD with completely deleted scenes, a comment by Bill Gates, a documentary about how Windows 95 can compare with Windows XP, and more! All in all: 10/10 (need to win at least the Golden Globe)
