Excellent Al Gore! You became the first person to get $ 1 billion from a global warming! Like all other people who made fairy tales in the world, this one is up there with the best lies that sucked so many people. Certainly pollution is not a good thing, and I would like all the trees to continue to grow, but global warming is a job! He employs thousands of people who are very insecure. Google! There are only a few things that are simply not collected, but well-made Al, you did not succeed as a politician, but you continued to make a lot of money in the world. What's next? Santa Claus is real?
