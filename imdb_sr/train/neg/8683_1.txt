This performance is not smart. It's basically what's down. The "original humor" that these writers are trying to pull to avoid completely biting the rest of the world bush is simply incomprehensible. In another comment, one quotes several honeycomb lines. George H.V. stood for me. Bush tells children not to watch TV with Fox Nevs. Vov. I thought the episodes I saw badly. The fact that this line is the highlight for the series is pathetic. My problem with this sad excuse for political satire is that these people get a second season. I am a liberal Republican and I know that Bush was not a good president. We all do. But this is not an excuse for quitting this extremely rude time. I set these writers to the same level as the geniuses behind 'Meet the Spartans'. Their formula bites as many already ungainly themed jokes as you can and even put in even worse original material so you can really give yourself credit records. The ignorant, and it makes me more and more unhappy that this shit is being restored, but incredible and original shows such as the arrested development are being prepared after three solid seasons. Please do not look at this shit unless you are one of those green bloody liberal hippies who think that every sentence with Bush and stupid comic gold is. Oh, and Bush's voice is shit. Everything he does is to mimic the Texas accent a little, and it exudes at the end of his sentences. The South Park Bar acknowledges that voices are not correct. If you want a funny political satire, watch Daili Shov / Colbert. Or look for any political drawings on Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, as animation with stop motion action is extremely well done. Look for George Bush as a Jedi bit on ioutube. Priceless
