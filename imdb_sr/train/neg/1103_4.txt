As a young black / latina woman I am always looking for films that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this movie in the video, I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately, I did not. Although the themes shown in the film are interesting and relevant, the story is simply not properly developed. The film only continued to divert and many of the characters appearing on the screen are still coming and leaving without much of a contribution to the overall film. If the director worked better connecting scenes, I might have enjoyed more. Frankly, I would recommend a movie like "Raising Victor" every day. I just was not too impressed.
