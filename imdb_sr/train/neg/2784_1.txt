My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same place as the screenwriter of this film. We were very upset that the JCC brought this film to its Jewish Film Festival due to the way the mental disability figure Frankie was shown. We went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out. We were looking for money back. We would encourage scriptwriters to donate a part of the funds to the Zach's Achad Program to apologize. which he constantly rejects to look at the nanny breast. It was not a purpose that Frenki's character, except to say "hey, be mentally handicapped ridiculous". Challenges like Frank's are a serious matter. Families like mine really are suffering. The Scenarist should explain. Does he / she know families with children with disabilities? Does the JCC see weekly families with children with disabilities on a weekly basis?
