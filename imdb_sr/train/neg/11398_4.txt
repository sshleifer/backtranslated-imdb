I saw this film primarily to see Brooke Burke (like Jill), which I met briefly at LA at the modeling fair, in my first feature film. I was hoping to see her more, but I thought she was acting very well. Since she is such a beautiful and ready TV host and model, it was not surprising. I remained wondering why she was killed and what happened. Maybe I simply missed it. I was not sure about the genre of this movie, and although I loved the actors, I felt like it was for a college audience. I tried to keep an open mind, since the horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt like I was overgrown. It seemed to retreat in some places, leaving in some places speculation about what the evil professor had, and, like many other films had an unsatisfactory ending. I know that much is hard and can be reduced to personal opinions, how many movies you've seen and studied, and those you deal with at a certain point. In short, I find it to be interesting, but not a satisfactory action and ending for me. If Joke (Brooke Burke) returned through the portal at the end and struck a quarrel in the ass, it would be a satisfying end and would earn a higher rating.
