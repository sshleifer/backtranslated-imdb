Ah iez, the Sci Fi channel produces another disgusting movie. I was particularly attracted to the scenes right after the collision, where, after surviving desperately looking for matches, at least half a dozen fires burned out? without a visible reason? at various places of the wreck. Fire seemed to be a prevailing theme. They searched the corpses for lighters and matches, and finally found a box that raised fire each day, apparently 12, but no one ever gathered a tree. Then when the vegan (hah) burned the bodies, what did he use for the accelerator? I mean, these guys were frozen? Well maybe not. Despite apparently low temperatures, all they ate was bleeding. Maybe I'm just, but even in an incredible story (none of the survivors have heard of a jet, or a disgusting snowman, to the very end), if you take care of small things, bigger deals become more acceptable. Oh, what's the prologue (1972) with the rest of the film? A revolver, warm enough to hold it in his hand, froze and did not shoot. Give me a break. Well, at least we have Carli Pope, another extraordinarily beautiful Canadian girlfriend. And, with a bit of irony, Ed Marinaro is a trainer. Well, I would add, the rabbit that they ate (despite what looks like chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now that the squirrel (or rat) was a rodent, it still looked like a chicken. And the writers missed the right opportunity to record someone "Has a taste like ..."
