It's stupid, stupid, in this totally unimaginable, supposed black comedy. In essence, what begins when Chris Klein tries to maintain a low profile, eventually turns into an uninspired version of "The Three Amigos", with no laughter. To make black comedy work, it must be unheard of, which "Play Dead" is not. In order for black comedy to work, it can not be evil wit, which is "Play Dead". What "Play Dead" really is, the city is full of jobs. However, Fred Dunst makes a fairly correct imitation of the character Billy Bob Thornton from A Simple Plan, while Jake Busei makes a pretty imitation of Jake Busei. - MERK
