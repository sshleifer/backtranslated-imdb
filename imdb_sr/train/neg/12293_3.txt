This only breaks because David Hasselhoff plays. Well, let me hit it. Compared to the garbage they call horror today, this film is not bad. She has a beautiful Leslie Cumming. It's great hot, but it can not speak very well. With her, she is a great scene when she was supernaturally raped. She shows her beautiful body. Linda Blair does nothing here just like Hasselhoff. 3/10
