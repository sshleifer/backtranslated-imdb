I started to melt, so I'll make this review short and sweet as much as possible. There's this astronaut out there, and he's going to a spaceship with two more guys, you know? Except that something happens to expose it to radiation, and then when they return ... well, it does not matter what happened to other guys, but our astronaut began to melt! No, not only to burn, but MELT! Like ice cream in July! Well, maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. In any case, it becomes red and boiling, and the fact that melting makes it really crazy. I suppose he also checked a manual for a "melancholy man," because he suddenly knows that he must eat human flesh in order to prevent him from completely dissolving, and he begins to separate people. other characters, but in a film in which a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need someone else? What matters is: Who will eat, and what will remain of them? How long will it take to dissolve into nothing? Why is this film made? Where did they get the money? WHEN will you fall asleep while you watch it? I almost melted, but I still have plenty of time to tell you that this film is terribly boring, although the idea is really cool and kind. Make-up is neat, but everything else is ... SPLAT
