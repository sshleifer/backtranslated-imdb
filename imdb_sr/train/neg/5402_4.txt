This film is so incredible; - the whole room is a bunkum; The fact that a serial killer (a vampire or otherwise) could fly around the unexplored and kill as many people as the film implies is ridiculous. The vampire himself would not look unreasonable in the White Lugosi film. Most of the acting is so woody that actors should be treated for dry rot. I'm waiting for someone to make a decent film from Steven King's novel (with the exception, perhaps, Stand Me). This film suffers from what most Stephen King films do-a lack of money that is used for "special" effects, bad actors, terrible characterization, and dialogue. This film is cheap, sticky and does not succeed in anything that is trying.
