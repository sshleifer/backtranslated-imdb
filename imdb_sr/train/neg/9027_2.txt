Revenge to viewers maybe. I sat through this two-hour movie and waited for another act to get the film to its title. But Costner never refreshes his mistress, the fate he dies and the film ends. I stayed wondering where the rest of the film is. If the movie is called Revenge, then the hero is better to get to the end of the movie. I had the choice to see this or the Black Rain in the cinema fortunately I saw the movie The Other Brothers in the Cinema. There was one good thing about the movie and it was his beautiful melody. Listen cd.dont watch this horrible. 1 of 10
