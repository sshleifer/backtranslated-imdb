OK, the movie is good, but I give it 1 because the idea is that a computer virus becomes an organic virus of a fairy tale. This type of shit only adds to those who do not know that computers are virtual paranoid misconceptions that a computer virus is just like an organic virus. First, code sequences and dozens of 1s and 0s add a computer virus. The organic virus is much more complex, even if it is smaller. Although considered to be one of the simplest forms in the universe, the organic virus binds to your cells and binds to RNA, and then changes its RNA code. Explain how something similar can be processed from a monitor? Maybe radiation has some effect on the cornea of ​​users who turns your eyes into these viruses? I saw it, but obviously, the writer did not think about it.
