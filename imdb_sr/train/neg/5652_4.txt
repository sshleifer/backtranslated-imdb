This is not a bad movie ... but it's the guy your girl makes you look. The story is not bad ... it just makes an hour and a half look so long. It's hard for me to destroy this movie, because I really like the idea, but it was just long and thin on the story ... too bad. The main character does not always seem to change everything from start to finish. I mean, it goes through something "life changing" and he can barely smash a smile. I really thought Mac was really good. His strange impairment prevented the film from becoming a complete disaster. Maybe I just do not "get" this movie. If anyone can explain me, I would like to be informed.
