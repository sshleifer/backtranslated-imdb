I am the actor, producer, director and what I will say are facts. This project was the worst film in the history of the film. From producer to director and editing this so-called. The film is a joke and I mean the big joke. Why would the Blockbuster issue such a shit? I take my work very seriously and this film is an insult to my profession. Did the director try to make a bad movie? I do not think so. I've seen bad Zombie movies, but this takes Coffie cake and everything on the damn table. THIS MOVIE SUCKS !!! I really hate to speak badly about other film makers because I am one, but please consider taking over a different profession. I respect the fact that you have completed the film, but I have to ask you "DO NOT CREATE CRACK", I mean the makeup on your girls, the terrible Zombies, what did you mean? For the whole nation, that I could vote Zero and that I would. THE BEST FILM IN MOVIE MAKING HISTORIES !!!
