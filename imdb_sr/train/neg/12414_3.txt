Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Vinningham are a good match that shows very different brothers and sisters, but only Vinningham is able to bring something convincingly or significantly to her role. Leigh, playing band-band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly relies on older sis Georgia, an acclaimed singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. Perhaps because of his double duty as a co-producer on the film, Leigh seems to be pushing into the corner: she is not credible as a singer and, even if it is deliberate, gives himself too much time on the microphone screen. Probably hoping to be on tour, Leigh is wired and nervous and uneven; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions that bite us from her). If Sadie had even the slightest charisma or attraction, we might be able to buy the concept that she would have a (small) break that she was working on. As it is, the likelihood that they will ever be on the stage is lean. Director Ulu Grosbard deals with several intense dramatic sequences, and the editing to the finals creates Sadie-in at the bar with a Georgian sold out arena - and singing the same song - and this is a sadly shaded moment ... but really, what's the point? * 1/2 of ****
