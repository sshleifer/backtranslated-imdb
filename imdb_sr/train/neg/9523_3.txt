The action of this film is not strong at all, it's a lot of holes. If you approach him as a car movie, it's not a bad, a lot of great cars in this. The reason I like it is that I'm from the area where it's filmed. I enjoy most of all by seeing places in St. Cloud MN and I see how the city has changed since the age of 89. This is an interesting historical piece for us locals. It seems that whenever a movie is made, everyone wants some attitude towards him. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores because they were all stolen when it came out on VHS. I had to buy a copy from Japan at Ebai. I find it interesting that the race is in all cities. I did not know that the director from St.Cloud.
