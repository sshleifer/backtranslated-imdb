The film presents the unresolved problems of France with its colonial heritage in western (francophone) Africa through a confused and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman of France (symbolically representing her nation). It is often an attractive and challenging portrait of the desire of a young woman to face the traumatic moment in her past, especially, and the desire of the nation to reach for the "other" that it once "possessed" and shaped. This is reflected in the way in which it fully focuses on the concept of travel (or transit) from the present to the past; They remembered the reality in the undeniable contemporary political and economic facts. All the characters play a symbolic, though limited and inconceivable role. France, which is a visual, as well as a totemic representation of a modern French society, leaves someone indifferent to her troubles, as it seems to still be pervaded with the same naivety she enjoyed as a child-in fact, as a child-appears to possess more of her reality. The rest of the rag-tag ensemble is simply forgotten. Black Africans are, at the very least, offensive impressionistic portraits of former colonized peoples who are now colonized by the poor handling of its material by the director. They are nothing more than a dark and deadly scenes against which a blithe like France asks for a world that she never knew, and hoping for one that can never be found in Cameroon.
