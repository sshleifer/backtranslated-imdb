Let's make a movie about a talk show that already exists and we have everything that's going on in the show! Well, if this idea does not intrigue you, and that should not be, keep away from the ring manager. I was displeased that I saw it in the theater and I could sit through this mess of the movie. I guess Jerry Springer does not play by himself as it's seen from the cheap props for his show (it looks even cheaper than the real shoe of Jerry Springer) and he's only known as Jerry in the movie. The action (if you can call it that way) refers to a daughter while she lives with her mother and decides to start sleeping with her mother's life with a boyfriend. So, the mother's brilliant idea is to call Jerry Springer show, as well as to do it with her boyfriend's boyfriend. (Is it a coincidence that they live in a trailer park)? In the meantime, somewhere else in America, women find their man with a friend in bed together. Well, of course, invite American therapist Jerry Springer! I would talk about the rest of the film, but even thinking about the movie now gives me a headache. Jamie Pressley, who plays her daughter, looks totally unattractive in the film. And do you remember Michael Dudikoff from the karate master of the American Ninja series? Look at him now as a white garbage drunk. The point is that it really looks too terrible and out of the form to call it "getting in touch with your charecter". But if your idea of ​​fun is that Jerry Springer is singing a Countri song about his own show or guys who are connected to the transvestites ... so ... just watch SHOV INSTEAD! ... at least Steve was smart enough to stay away from this film.
