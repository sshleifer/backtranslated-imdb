This film was terrible. I gave him a high grade 2, as I saw it up, but very little. From clich√©s begins to end the movie at the beginning and returns to the beginning at the end. this film used everything in a box of tricks that are used in movie creation just because of it, as a kid with too many toys. There were endless, boring repeating narratives, slow-motion recordings, freezing of frames, flashbacks and merged images, etc. - none of which made a better movie. It's called "16 Years of Alcohol", but there was little drinking or drunkenness, and without showing withdrawal, while the movie jumped all over the place without any meaning. The story was poorly written and extremely pretentious, and the direction was equally bad and the damage was that people put extra money on more films by Mr. Jobson, who previously knew they were in a garbage dump on TV, making the same sense The film was. I thought it was a great fight to bring this to the end, but in the hope that it would be better, I continued with bitter, but it was really a waste of time and I'd better not be torture.
