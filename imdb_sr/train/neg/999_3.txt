Last night I saw "Descent" at the Stockholm Film Festival, and that was a big disappointment. Disappointment because the story was potentially powerful, the possibility of seeing Rosario Davson in a smaller intimate film was exciting and, since I'm a fan (it sounds the first, I'm not!) Since the 'rape / revenge' movement of the 70s, I was I do not need to say very curious to look at this movie. My conclusion: stick to the classic! Yes, the story has the potential, but the dialogue is flat, the actors are unconvincing. Even Davson is empty. Some would say that this is a true illustration of the college of the world in the United States, that the emptiness of characters serves the purpose and the whole of this jazz, but this only makes the entire film undoubted. Just like the scene in which Davson was raped: he seriously misses the intensity! I did not expect anything from the 'Irreversible' style, but still, should not we feel compassion for her? I'm not. Not for a minute, she was so poor until the end ;-) And I read that the photo was impressive. Well, that's good, but it does not break anything. I must admit that the projection at the festival was not so good, so I may have missed something here, but at the end of the film I could not help but think: 'I feel like I'm looking at Argento' Inferno 'again. lol. More seriously, the first scene in the club was beautifully captured and everything, but I had a bitter feeling of seeing a longer and boring version of the scene in a dirty bar near the US-Canadian border in Linch's Twin Peaks - Fire Valk vith Ja '... raw red and blue illumination , heavy bass music, a general lascivious / decadent atmosphere ... No, I could not get into this movie. A pity.
