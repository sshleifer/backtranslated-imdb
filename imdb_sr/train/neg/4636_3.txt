The "confidential" part was intended to return to the popular complaint of the same horrible newspaper, while the theme of racketeering was related to the main congressional investigations of that day. However, despite the acting A-Class B-film and some good ideas for the script, the movie lasts for more than 73 minutes. It's cheap production all the way. What is needed to reduce poor production values ​​is imagination, especially from the non-inspired director Sidney Salkova. Several daylight shots, for example, would help ease a series of boring sets of studies. Stylists like Anthony Mann may have done something with a thick ear material, but Salkov treats him as just another day's workout. It's a pity that the typical style of Brian Keith does not work here, because it only appears as a wooden and lethargic, at the same time a cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. Obviously, Salkov is not an actor. But you have to give it to that small number Beverly Garland who treats his role with characteristic expression and dedication. Too bad, it was not the main thing. My advice ... skip him, unless you are in funny girls who do nothing else but to tear down the whiskey in a typical way with a scarf.
