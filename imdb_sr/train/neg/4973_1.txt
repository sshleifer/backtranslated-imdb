I stopped five minutes when Beovulf got an automatic rifle with an automatic crossbow with a look at him. Not only crossovers do not have telescopic scenes, but Beovulf wins Grendel in the fight against the hand. The terrible, woody acting and eternal darkness that affected all science-fiction films did not help. After I arrived just a few minutes before I felt my tears rising and decided to watch how I liked the reprise, that's actually all I have to say. But, you may just realize that this movie was made for TV and skipped it there. False.
