I think this could be a decent movie, and some of his parts are fine ... but in general it's B film. It's the same with complications, the parts are fine, but there are several holes and odds that do not add up. The acting is mostly fine, and I've seen it even worse. :) The beginning sets the level, driving cars in the desert, making "cool" but completely unnecessary jumps through some small dines (in slow motion! Cool!), as drivers never saw sand before ... It gets a little better from there, but not much. If you will rent this, take another one and use this as a warm up. Keep your expectations low and may help.
