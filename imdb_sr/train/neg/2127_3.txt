Why? For, for one reason, there was never a great scene in any movie than Ann Margret sang "Bie Bie Birdie" at the opening. Again he makes it again in the end (in a different mood!). Both beautiful. Rent it and see it. Even if that's all you're looking at. You agree, I'm sure. Everything about the original was so great that he just did not need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances, as did Tina and Chinna. In fact, all actors and singers in this new version have given their "everything", but it's like trying to improve Casablanca - it just can not be done! It's even embarrassing to mentally compare, while trying to understand the remake, and it's simply not enough, without the mistake of the actors.
