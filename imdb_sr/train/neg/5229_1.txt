the boring things we have here. His five-minute shorts are better than this. I know why? because there are only 5 minutes, not 91 minutes or how long it is. The plot is kinda ... eh .. the last half an hour is fine, the rest is boring and not funny = (I was hoping the trailer looked funny, but the tempo of this movie is quite slow and unfortunately not ridiculous, just plain boring Klaimen run One in the other and trying to make us laugh .. does not work. Maybe the next time knock. Re-cutting this film and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing, but for now it's just not good.
