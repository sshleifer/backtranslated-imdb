This movie is recommended as a good action movie, which I do not think it is. I discovered that the story is intricate and that it's not easy to follow everything. By the end of the film, it's really not that much action and it's pretty dark and it's hard to see what's really going on. I was sure I was hoping for something different, but, unfortunately, I did not find it here.
