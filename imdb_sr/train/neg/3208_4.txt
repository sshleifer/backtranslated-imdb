This film was a great disappointment for me. I waited for this film to appear for years, and I was a true follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. Not only did they cut out half the story, but they also changed the information. A statement that Lucifer Hope's father is not correct. He spoiled her father, but he is not her father. Votes also did not match the characters, and when you hear a voice of a loved one, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. I can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong. Ultimately, if you love Ladi Death, do not watch this movie. She simply did not do comic justice at all!
