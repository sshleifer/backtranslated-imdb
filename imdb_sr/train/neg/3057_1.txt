While "Santa Claus Beat the Martians" is usually cited as one of the worst films ever made, this Mexican film from 1959 is so bad that "SCCM" looks like "It's a wonderful life". You have to wonder what the people who made this film were thinking; maybe they meant that as the third world allegory of capitalist greed and apparent consumption. Nah. . . They were not very good. The same production house made an even more disturbing version of the "Red Cap" in which the haunting obsession of our heroine has unmistakable indications of pedophilia. (Maybe it was the inspiration for the "Highway.") Back to "Santa:" instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas lives on a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit of earth (shades "MST3K"); Instead of an elf, his toys are made by children chosen from around the world; and he had sophisticated spyware to check just who the kids are bad and beautiful. The result is like an Orvellian shop for sweeping the universe. It's enough to exclude you forever. This and other Mexican low-cost children's films were named in English and widely distributed in the US in the early 1960s; It's no wonder that the Sixties have become such a turbulent period in American history. Baby boomers, who were forced to endure these "family" films as children, would be too eager to become revolutionary.
