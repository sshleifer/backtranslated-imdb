I was lucky enough to see the Chorus Line when he came to my city .. I was younger then ... but it was a great game .. so somebody would please tell me why in the heavenly name they had to make a movie out of it ... and why Michael Douglas ??? It did not match the role .. this movie is really sucked by BIG time !!! My advice is not to rent this movie .. save money for something better like "Cats" ....
