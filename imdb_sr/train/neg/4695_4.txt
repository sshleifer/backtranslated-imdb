Several times I watched this movie and I never thought it was so funny, but it's still fun to watch and make a good laugh. About women working in the company and their boss is an asshole and ultimately give him the taste of their own medicine, and they try to get the respect they deserve. The acting is really good. Dabnei Coleman is one of those stars of the 80s who play a good bad guy, and not really evil, just unusual. Dolly Partin is cute and fun to watch in comedies, and she really shines in the south. Jane Fonda does-so she does a little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing in this movie, she has the funniest lines and she smiled a few times, I have to love her. I could recommend this to anyone who loves the comedy of the 80's. I like the film, but there are things I do not like. It starts great and has a good flow, and then everything starts to converge at once and less takes care of the characters. They all have little fantasies about what they would like to do to the boss, and although they were "sweet", I just thought it slowed down the course of the film. As the film continues, it gets picked up again and the funny thing happens, and then it slows down again, just to end up in a quick way that's too good to be true. 4 out of 10 stars, but try if you have not seen it. I think it may be more or less sympathetic depending on the mood.
