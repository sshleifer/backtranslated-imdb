I hired this movie three years ago, and still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I think I never finished. It's worse than home-made video by a high school student. I remember working on a flashback until 1970, and in the flashback it was a polo shirt, sunglasses and a newer SUV, like Toyota Rav-4 or something similar (I do not remember). I do not understand how they could have said it was in the '70s. Maybe he had a cell phone, I can not remember, it was awful. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry a movie and if I could get a watch of my life back. To date, it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty bad ones.
