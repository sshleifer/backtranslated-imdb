Last night I watched this movie and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers. Even the DVD cover looked good. moments that were a bit creepy, but then the mood was destroyed by stupid music. There was rock and opera during what should be an uncertain scene. Nothing against the music itself, it was only in the wrong parts of the film. Whoever edits the movie has no idea what they are doing. The blanket showed lightning, implying that they were caught in It would be more interesting, but it did not happen. The acting was not the worst I've ever seen since everyone is unknown and this is obviously their first film. Another reason why I was disappointed was that the shop did not make any sense. the ship was finally reportedly only one girl, and the rest were her imaginary friends or ghosts, but I'm not sure because it was very badly shown. VhiteFox who wrote the comment here claims that this is a true story. He or she believes in ghosts and ghosts and says that there is a haunted ship in that area. I've never experienced something personal, but I'm not saying it's impossible. I guess if someone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk.
