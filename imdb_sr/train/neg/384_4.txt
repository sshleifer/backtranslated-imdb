I do not attach much importance to AIDS-conspiracy theories, but it is sociologically interesting to see how the phenomenon is dramatized. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, suffering and paranoia of frightened and dying, they often generated such dark fantasies. This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demon of San Francisco. The city, known for its beauty, rarely looked uglier than in this film. The feeling of darkness and decay permeates every scene. While the acting and the action can not be said to be well executed, films of a unique cultural context and an oppressive dark mood at least partially save the film from that total loss. In fact, I found the most interesting performance as Irit Levi as a cruel and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) Police Detective. It is interesting, but not necessarily convincing. Highlights: the use of the desperately tragic Turandot in the movie is an effective motive and there is a sublime quiet comedy of the artist's artist, Rona Atia.
