If there is a hell, it contains a show room where GRAND CANION plays over and over again on an eternal loop. We hope that the presence of so many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfred Voodard, Kevin Kline, Mari Louise Parker - will help compensate for the presence of Mari McDonnell (whose repentance is to watch their films forever). But not. Obviously they injected those other actors with sera made from McDonnell. The whole affair is pretentious, exaggerated, insulting (if you are deaf or you know someone who is, be ready to blow your blood on the ridiculous TDD scene). GRAND CANION is filled with disgusting, self-employed people, but never gives us the reason to love them / understand / sympathize with them or even tolerate them. With a rare exception, they are unbearable losers that would be better without a genetic fund. There is no complication to speak, no character development (these people will never develop), no breaking performance, and the most complex writing you will ever encounter in a movie. The best thing about GRAND CANION? His title. This is one big movie hole.
