Frankly, I can not understand why this film is judged well here, and why Bakshi himself thought it was his best film. I am a big fan of Baxhie's earlier work - especially 'Heavi Traffic' and 'Wizards', but honestly, 'Wizards' (1977) was the last good movie he made. After that, he turned to the main stream, starting with the devil's Lord of the Rings, then knocking with the sword and wizard heavy Frank Frazette for 'Fire and Ice'. What can I say? The story is childish, the animation is the quality of the TV - I insist that it is significantly worse than its 70s - and while the "Wizards" had real imagination, strangeness, incredible background art and underworld, the sensibility of adults, "Fire and Ice" was designed only for 14-year-olds, and has the intellectual power of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. Yes, if you like Up book, you may like it. In my opinion, this is just another passage in quality after the 'Wizards' from which Bakshi never recovered (although he recently did some decent TV stuff) 4.5 out of 10
