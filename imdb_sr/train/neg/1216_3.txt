The genre of suspense films is really diving in this one. The big problem is INCOMPATIBILITY. I understand that it is necessary to create difficult situations that would cause a tension and a tense feeling of what will happen next, but this film was so predictable and simply not convincing. I think that the more I watch this kind of film, the more I am constantly telling actors to direct them away from danger. Continuous making of bad decisions only borders on the fact that it is stupid. If they took the time to make it more realistic, maybe I would enjoy it a bit. By saying this, you may prefer to stay away from this.
