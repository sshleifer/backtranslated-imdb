Infinitely short about the bunch of half-sided men slapping and hitting each other. That's it. We see this about 5 minutes. It was shot in black and white with a tone of half-gigantic men running around and sending each other in harmony with horrible music. It looks interesting, but there is no complication and indeed - the violence inherently this has become disturbing. Similarly, the homo erotica in this is played, but mixing with violence was not a good idea. Some people who love avant-garde material might like it, but I considered it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (upsetting) disturbing. Really - what is the point in all this? I saw it as part of the gay short film festival and the audience sat in astonished silence. I really would like to go below 1.
