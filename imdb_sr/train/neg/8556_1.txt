OK, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I am in an old-age demography and somehow I identify with some stories. Even sometimes sticky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in another film it would be forgiven. Not so easy when filmmakers did not try at all. Editing in this movie is terrible! Perhaps the worst change I've ever seen in a movie! There are things you do not have to go to a film school to learn, and good editing is not one of them, but the identification is bad. Also, the recording ... God, just terrible! I can not even get into the details, but sometimes we only see random things that appear, and this will provide you with a painful experience of watching a movie in connection with editing. This movie is made at low or no budget with 4 casts and crew is no excuse. I've seen short movies on iTunes with much more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what you thought, but this movie is just the masturbation of your ego. You should be ashamed! In conclusion, this film is like what would really be lazy amateur porn movie if it is filled with 3 or 4 sexual scenes separated by long boring conversations and a disgusting masturbation scene. If that's not your thing, avoid this at all costs!
