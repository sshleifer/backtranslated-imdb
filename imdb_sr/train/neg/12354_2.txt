Of course, I did not watch 'GI Jane' by choice. I was more or less forced to watch this movie around my ex girlfriend's house. GI Jane immediately loses credibility trying to convince viewers that this is a potentially true scenario, which, of course, is not. The result is that the story becomes automatically bound by restrictions, limiting the amount of humor (which is missing) or the fun action scene, and soon becomes too serious. The film thus becomes very boring and predictable. GI Jane does not succeed where other action films succeed, mostly because films such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and others are greater than life, but they never say anything differently. They are escapism and therefore fun. "GI Jane" is trying to be real and fails. This is a very disappointing film by Ridley Scott, with a very incredible story, an incomprehensible acting, and the only reason why 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some technical work.
