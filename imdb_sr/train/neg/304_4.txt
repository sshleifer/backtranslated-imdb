This film shows Ruth as a feminine, hard drinking, gambling, premiered sports figure with a small baseball ball. Also, Lou Gehrig was scarcely covered and it was a well-known connection, good or bad, should have been better covered than it was. His life was more than bad. He was an American hero, an icon that many of the great baseball players made. I feel honest about the great baseball player who completely ignored this film. We embarrass the creators of this film to exploit his mistakes, not his size.
