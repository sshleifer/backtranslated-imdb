This is one of the worst cases of movie whores I've seen for a long time. It's so terrible, I'm not sure where to start, or even if it's worth it. The action is a real problem, and I'm sorry, Sli, like he is in a decent performance. But this conspiracy ... Oh, dear God. I especially love the way in which he approaches eventually he manages to jump from the foot of the mountain to the top, while the helicopter is on the road. A one or two-day rise brings him five minutes! I could proceed: but it's not worth it. In addition to the difficult opening (which even a five-year-old could predict the outcome), the rest is insignificant. I'm sorry people, but this is just as bad as the movie becomes.
