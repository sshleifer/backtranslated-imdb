There are bad movies, then there are films that are so bad that they become almost art. This is one of those movies. My partner and I are still both types of shells, shocked, you know, looking into the universe and slipping! You can say that people who were involved (I hope they changed names to protect themselves) had an explosion and were definitely not shy. I give this three out of ten just because of free nonsense and really bad effects upstairs. I laughed loudly for most of the film, so I guess it could be said that it showed me a good time. Beware of spectators, the above words do not in any way interpret the fact that this is a good movie, because it is not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to miss a movie with such a brilliant title!
