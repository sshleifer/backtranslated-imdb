There was something with a female lead who had the perfect life that she always wanted after the worst possible life, starting as a child prostitute and ending with Eric Roberts. But her background prevents her from trusting Dean Kain and eventually destroys it completely. It sounds strange, but I like the position Dean Cain was in the end and the choice he made. She can not hurt her because she loves her and she is the mother of his child (I think the timeline clearly shows that he is his child, not his brother), but at the same time she can not forgive her all she has slept with her brother (which shows love and commitment he felt pretty one way), and then as part of his death. In better hands, it would be a better movie, but for something I caught on a late night cord, that's not bad.
