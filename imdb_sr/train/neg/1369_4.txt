The second film Ami Heckerling Johnny Dangerousli is a parody of gangster films from the 1930s recorded in the Varner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton plays a middle-aged gangster who looks back on his life's heavy blows when he seizes a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has a constant health problem, so Keaton falls into a crime early in time over Peter Boilea. In the meantime, Fargan Richard Dimitri plays rivalry for Boiley and Keaton ultimately rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hasty turning point like Danny Vermin, yes, so, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother who became District Attorney, his wife Glinnis O'Connor, and Marilyn Henner plays Keaton's moll. The movie seems to be cheap and seems to look like a television show instead of a theater movie. The film starts great, and then slows down as expected after the first half an hour. Due to the combination of dialogue and gaga, the film retains its first half, but then it soon loses the pair and goes down into the middle and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton devours the landscape with the best impression of James Cagney. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are just disgusting, not ridiculous. Piscopo makes "once" a little too many. Several supporters are trying to keep a fortress like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Rai Valston as a street vendor, Alan Hale Jr. as a desk officer, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleanser. The other half evolves into a television show type "hit or miss" and never recovers. The final scene that uses The Roaring Tventies is an anachronism like The Call Of Vild Clark Gable film screened on the screen earlier in the movie. I think Heckerling should know better, because the target audience would certainly be aware of the actual date of publishing the twenties. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
