I marveled at Rob Marshall for Chicago, but geisha memoirs are turning out as another failure to permeate Western and Asian art. All in all, the scene is beautiful, but after the turbulent exposition of exotic-oriented scenes, some could only be fed to them. The overflowing cherry blossom, frankly, was exaggerated. Here is probably a cultural difference in perception: the ultimate beauty is not a striking type, because a truly great geisha would not be a gang of gangsters in the film. Some other comments rightly mentioned the biggest drawbacks. As a Taiwanese, I do not doubt that the actresses are great. The actor / actress can play any role when he can look like that. Gong Li is excellent, but the power of emotion shown in this film has not been translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bitter and jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Ieoh, one of my favourtie actresses, did not even look like a Japanese. Some comments mention the unusual delicate, feminine characteristics of Japanese women, with whom they can no longer agree. This is so delicate that I assume that not even all modern Japanese actresses fulfill the conditions for gay roles, let alone two Chinese and one Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know so much Japanese culture. Geisha is a good shot to provoke the curiosity of the American audience. But that would be an insult to film and art itself, if the film won the Oscars for the best costume, the best director or the best picture.
