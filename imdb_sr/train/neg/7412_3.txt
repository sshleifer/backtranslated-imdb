I love trembling horror. I do not care if the actor is sub-pair or whether the monsters look dizzy. I liked this film, except for that confused feeling from the beginning of the film to the very end. Look, I do not need a 10-page dissertation or a capital letter that explains the plot for me. But Dark Floors takes "what is this film about?" thing to a whole new (boring) level. What's this movie about? This is not extremely scary or exciting, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or want to feel frustrated and confused, rent this winner.
