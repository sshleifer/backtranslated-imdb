Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" in THIS ISLAND OF THE EARTH) is the only reason to watch this movie. The story is very thin, and when aviation friends return to America with Cobra's curse on them, action is just a waiting game. See Faith the Snake Voman and try to pretend that the rest is not happening.
