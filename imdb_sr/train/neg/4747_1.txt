I thought this film was horrible. I am Chinese, so I thought everything was fine. Many facts are incorrect. The only real thing about Chinese history in the film was when Vendi's mother explained her husband about the statues guarded by ShiHuangDi. I also thought that the fighting scenes were very sweet and fake. Many actors and actresses were not great. Some jokes that were supposedly "funny" were really stupid. I think this film should get the worst possible rating it could get. Disney really needs to get more information about Chinese history if he wants to make an extravagant film. Mulan was pretty precise. Watch this movie if you want to waste time.
