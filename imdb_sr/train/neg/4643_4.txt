I rented this movie on DVD. I knew that the film would not match what I promised on the back of the case, but when I saw Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) in it, I had to rent it. It starts pretty well, assuming snuff movies are broadcast over the cable. However, the main character does not have anything about her to be sorry for you, and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging. There are too many unanswered questions. There was a great scene in the end that completely surprised me, but all in all this is a very podcast movie, but I think it was worth $ 3.99.
