Well, I've been watching this piece with VERY low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a rather non-talented composer in a parvan whose lack of talent is outdone only by the size of his ego. It's rude, insulting, redheaded and obviously anti-wives. As such, it is a creation that suits Bohlchen, but the average viewer will be moved. No wonder he was never shown in the cinema: He would be bombarded with great time! Even the 6.5 mega-meter cost could not save this completely shit. Save time and money!
