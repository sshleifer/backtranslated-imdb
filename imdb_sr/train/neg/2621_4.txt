I would not bring a child under eight years to see this. With puppies that cling to buildings that run through dangerous machines and listening to Cruell's terrible laughter to list several events, there is too much uncertainty for a little child. Live action gives a more mischievous feeling than a cartoon version version and has a lot of disturbing moments, including a guy who looks like a transvestite, many tense moments that will worry and may scare small children. I do not know what people from Disney thought, but neither the story nor the actors were at their usual level. Puppies are sweet, but this film is at best slim.
