I would enjoy this film a bit more than it was for Jason (Herba). Many early reviewers The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifuna of exaggerating. However, as more and more critics watched the film, they considered it to be worthwhile. Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and that's exactly it. If you watch this movie, you will notice that Evers shouts almost in every line, that is, until he smokes and smokes smoke coldly. Special effects were par for the course in the B film, such as this one. Looking back, there is not much that would stand out in my mind as fantastic good or bad for this movie.
