Few movies have weakened expectations and upset me as much as Fire. The film is pretentious rubbish. It does not achieve anything at the artistic level. The only thing he managed to get was a ban in India. If it was only because of the poor quality of film creation, and not because of the current controversy, the ban would be more justified. Now that I have my troubles from my system, I am more able to analyze the film: From the very beginning of the movie, the film feels unreal, especially when the protagonists begin to speak English language. The director, of course, did not make a movie for the Indian audience; however, it underestimated its international audience by simplifying it. Watching the home-helpdesk in conversation in a perfect English language is too unrealistic to be true. * Then we regularly look at Radhina dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They come as an obstacle and interfere with the course of the film. I continue to wonder how this philosophical dialogue is related to the story. I felt that Surrealism was lost. * Love scenes were voyeuristic and were probably meant to sigh the audience, not as a strong statement. In any case, they do not achieve either. Names chosen for women, Radha and Sita, are the names of the Hindu deities and are therefore chosen to shock the audience. However, since the film was not intended for the Indian audience, the selection of shock-through-names is not intended to achieve its goal, which is absurd. The quality of routing is very bad and some key and delicate scenes are poorly processed. A better director could perform a strong emotional drama from a subject. * The actor who played the wood, although Nandita Das brought life into the role, the others were lost. I always thought Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent is not visible in this movie. The male traces were completely trash. In case you are a lover of the Earth and you want to see more directors, stay away from this. Please.
