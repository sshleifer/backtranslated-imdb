This is probably the worst Christmas movie ever. Action practically does not exist, acting (Affleck in particular) is at best bad. The fans of Ben Affleck are likely to defend this film, but they must deep down in themselves. As far as I could figure out, a plot consisting of Ben Affleck, a million dollar salesman, told the psychiatrist to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn down a list of things he wanted to forget from childhood. When he does, he ends up paying the family who currently lives at home to be his family for Christmas ... and that's it. The movie continues and eventually merges with the daughter of the family .... blah blah blah.
