Unfortunately, there was no 0 for a rating, otherwise I would choose it. This film does not have the strength of the star that the original film had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finnei, Tim Curri, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of the newcomer Aileen Kuinn and a professional director from an experienced professional John Huston (Angelica Huston's father) is what made this film so charming. Even remake from 1999 with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoveth had more to offer than this exclaimed excuse to continue. Before she made this film, Ashlei Johnson was known for her role as a small Chrissie Seaver in the hit Shov Groving Pains. She had several parts in the movies, but I do not know who thought she had enough talent to carry the film on her own. And adding Joan Collins as Lada Edwin Hogbott, funny! They could not get enough enough actors to play major roles like Daddy Varbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but will Joan Collins sign a British lady? I'm not surprised that this movie was bad as it was. Critics were right to disagree with this film, even if it was made only for TV, it was a bad continuation of the movie that is otherwise appealing.
