The original was a good movie. I bought it on a tape and I watched it several times. And although I know that the sequels are usually not as good as the original, I certainly did not expect such a bomb. The romance was straight, the scene is old, speech humor was simply not. This may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's close.
