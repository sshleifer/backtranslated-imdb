Actually, I had to stop him. Do not misunderstand me, you love bad movies about monsters. But this was too boring, regardless of the uncertain music that never takes you anywhere. The actress had too many teeth and the moment she got in touch with one of the beasts was too obvious a clich√©. This film completely covers the cover on a DVD that looks pretty interesting. On the front side, a giant monster is expected, but these sweet ones are not as gigantic as the electric eels were expected to be. He moved to watch another movie called The Killer Rats, but this is another review. Deep Shock is really shit, a big shame considering it looks like a pretty high budget.
