This film makes me think that others I saw with Combs were an accident. The action had more holes than I had ever seen in a movie that was supposedly more than a "b" movie. The acting was so funny that even the memory of Combs's past campistic triumphs was not enough to save him. Taking into account the script, I have to imagine that the budget did not have enough money for things like continuity and original ideas. I'm completely upset that I paid the Blockbuster prices for this garbage. The fact that it was made for television was something that would help me avoid this crime and frankly something to warn these poor people of this film. Avoid this movie, no matter what.
