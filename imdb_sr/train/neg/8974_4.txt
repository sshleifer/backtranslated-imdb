this film, I will not call it a "movie," was basically nothing and functioned mainly for the popular actions of that time. Yes, the war was in full swing, and this film gave the troops and our audience a treat. she liked to watch young Badi Rich on drums. The music was good throughout the day. But one sword for another fast is fast. I have not even recognized Zero Mostel! So if you are one of the "greatest generation", they say, you will definitely enjoy this ... Film.
