This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Indeed, the official Venus does not exist in the TMNT canon. There will never be female turtles, it has taken away a tragic story of 4 male mutant mutants who will never have their own family when they no longer leave. The biggest mistake is to cross the Rangers Rangers in a TMNT with a horrible episode; turtle voices were wrong and everyone acted out of character. They could do such a good job, better designs and animatronics, and NO VENUS. Do not bother with these people ... it's valuable material. the lid was a slow and unnatural look. they do not respect shreder completely. Main baddie, some dragonlord was wiped out. the turtles looked dizzy with the things that hung from their bodies, what about things around the thighs raffs? silly looking plastron!? If they looked normal, they behaved in the face and faded Venus, they got rid of stupid little girls sounds ... and better writing could be good.
