Unlike the "Adventure Buckaroo Banzai", or "Big Trouble in Little China", or "Conan the Barbarian", which are horrible films that have a certain cold and self-confidence that turns them into cult sensations, the Golden Child is only bad. The premise itself is not useless, and there are some fun moments. But here, Eddie Murphi's "flip relation" only deflation any sense of tension or danger in the story. And special effects are stupid enough to do more damage to this tension. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are diminished rather than attracted. Without the feeling that everything is in question, or that the characters face real danger, why should we care? Who Should See This Movie: - Great fans of Eddie Murphi who can not help themselves - I can not remember Someone else I'll give this film 4 out of 10 for an occasional joke that worked.
