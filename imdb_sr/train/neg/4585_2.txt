I was utterly suspicious of the ideas presented in this film, but I was a relative ignorant of quantum physics, other than what I remembered from the excellent "Short History of almost everything" and what I managed to dim in "The Short History of Time," it sometimes sounded interesting. However, the apparent stupidity of the story that the Indians could not see the explorers' boats was ridiculous. I really started to ask what was the shovel at that moment, but then it came to the discovery that one of the speakers actually "channeled" a madman called "Ramtha" and which completely upset the apple for me. What a waste of two hours.
