In this film, three stories are told that seem to have been filmed without the knowledge that it is a combined vignette film. Manufacturers connect three vignettes by connecting them all to reduce Martina Kove, although you never see some of the traces with Kove. The first vignette has a sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman who fears everything under the sun (makes Adrian Monk look brave), paranoia has dinner in the house itself. You will literally shout at Vivian for some funny things. She spent most of her time in a night party showing her incredible qualities. But her film is the worst, if not the most sad. The second vignette is owned by Bill Pacton while showing a portrait of a roommate from Hell. His geeki roommate allows him to fully exploit him, and Bill does it whenever he can. The last vignette was funny as a man feared that death would take him at any moment, just like his friend. which has been suppressed in the olive. It's not very interesting, because the movie as a whole seems chopped along with very few thoughts. Obligation for fans of Bill Pacton.
