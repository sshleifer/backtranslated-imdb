No word can describe my extreme hatred for this terrible depiction of the BTK killer. The rating of this film is one of the ten compliments of this really catastrophic pronunciation for the film. From the beginning to the end, there was no climax. The whole thing is terribly complex; script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. Numerous scenes are literally funny-loud-ridiculous, for the horrific way of collecting it all. This review may look like an unfair and sharp attack on a low-budget film, but this is not the case. Thinking about the movie I just saw makes my blood cooking. Since this movie has ever received the right to produce, I NEVER know. I am almost tempted to really recommend BTK because it is really stand-out in terms of how miserable and disturbing it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of film, this is THE LARGEST. MOVIE. EVER. I spent an hour of my life on this useless garbage, and I would gladly jump from the closest building earlier, if I knew what I was. ZERO van TEN.
