Some movies are so bad they are good. This is obviously not one of them. Based on the true story, this film was true for a story like Pinkie's chance to become a real boy. The acting was terrible, the direction was bad, and he traveled too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to finish and finish and go home. Neither Melissa Joan Hart ever hit her as a talented actress, but then every film she filmed was pretty low. anyway, budget. Like most of her other films, she drops her characters by being too angry, tells her too quickly that her acceleration of words will become more dramatic. She really reveals that she is in front of her crew and talks to the camera, when she needs to hire an audience in her character. Almost the entire film is lowered, and every leg that it may have left to stand on it is destroyed. Probably the only good thing in the movie when it was eventually pinned. But even that was not enough enough to push my depression to such a bad movie. See if your taste in the film is blandier than diced pieces.
