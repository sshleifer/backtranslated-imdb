After enjoying the previous work of Mike Miers (Vaines World and Saturdai Night Live), my expectations of the connection of the 60s were quite high. After the first minute it became clear that this is an exercise to be as childish and unhappy. I turned off after ten minutes. The other day, I watched him the second time to see if I was wrong for the first time. I turned it off after ten minutes. It's hard to believe that even a 12-year-old boy could find this funny. The dialogue is marsrassment, Miers is painful to watch (like Heather Graham), and the succession of characters, including Fat Bastard, makes things worse. In addition to a mild entertainment title and psychedelic scenery, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I personally recommend that you avoid this as a plague, although several of my friends enjoyed it (perhaps their eyes were connected at the time).
