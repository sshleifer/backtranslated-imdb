A long list of "big" names in this film (including the omnipresent John Mills) did not overtake me to the extent that I could not judge the film about his real merits. These are PUNI stereotypes, caricatures and standard scenes, from a modest heroic air to a loud voice. The music was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the film was over: loudly, rising crescendo, grand blossom and ending the silence, but then the film continued! I did not find the right story, accidentally writing, but smartly pressed uniforms and beautiful Jean Simmons (work before nose) with excitement. I can not say that this picture has some of the ingredients that make the movie great. I found him like maudlin, mavkish and minor.
