Since this movie was filmed with an alleged $ 70 million budget and without a complete transformation, it's beyond me. Story and dialogue are out of amateur. Characters say things that no real person would ever say and almost never react to things they said earlier. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The action of the leader is fine, since writing is such a stupidity ... but several actors in supporting the role really lower production. The hero's hair probably should have gained self-confidence, it was so strange to attract attention ... not to mention that she gave one of the better performances in the picture. Finally, for a film about L.A. which is obsessed with gigantic reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you see this, your mind will constantly run, thinking about the ways in which you could take the SFX scene and build a much better movie around them. Unfortunately, there should not be much.
