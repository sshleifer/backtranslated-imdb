They changed the title of this crime into Unexpected Love. The only thing up there is a movie. The script contains a dialogue that would laugh from the third-class recital performance. At some point when a woman leaves her husband, a bad treatment All Miself would play through the soundtrack! No hacking. The actors are trying, but they are defeated by an incompetent, incredibly terrible scenario. The direction is astoundingly bad. No wonder Life has such a bad reputation. How are these things done? I turn off the TV before it's over!
