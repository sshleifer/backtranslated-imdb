Shit. This was the worst movie I've ever seen. All the performances are fine, but there is no complication. Really! No plot! A clown of clowns talks about it, and that's it's your movie. The character of Robert Duvall is senile and constantly searches from the same people over and over again. It brings him the same answers over and over again. I am pretty sure that this film has reached six, because people think that they should like it. Good performances with famous and respected actors, but the actual complete work is steam shit. Well, maybe it's a little misleading, because the pair that comes out of the fresh pile sounds like something's happening and in this movie Nothing to Come! Sack
