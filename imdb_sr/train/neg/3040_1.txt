With this title, you know you get a lot of garbage. It works bad. Script bad. The director is bad. The grammar is bad. The film brings a lot of noise that really does not music and many people shout. The film produces a bad racial stereotype. Why does every film with a black hero have a junkie? Why should a hero always have to dance to be a success? Why should a famous rapper always have to be in a dance film? Why can not the letter "s" be in the title? Hollivood should stop the stupid audience and make a movie that has people with a brain who knows how they speak English. Make self-satisfaction and do not go see.
