Lifetime has repeated this. Can we say stupid? I could not wait to finish it. The action was meaningless. The acting was terrible! Especially with the teenager. The story is played a thousand times! Do we just desperately want to give the actors a job? The reviews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller. After a while, life appeared with a good movie, this is not one of them. Unless someone has anything else to do, I avoid this at all costs. This was a waste of two hours of my life. May I return them? I'd rather damage my face for a brick wall for two hours, then I was soaked with peroxide. It would be more fun.
