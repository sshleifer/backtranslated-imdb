First of all, let me tell you this is not a movie for people who want to watch something funny and joyful for the holidays. This film is cold, brutal, and very disgusting. Marie Steenburgen plays a thin mother who is on Christmas Day because her husband lost her job, they are losing their house, can not buy Christmas presents for children, etc. You got an idea, happy things for the holidays. That's how Harri Dean Stanton comes in as a Gideon Christmas Angel, who in his dark hat and long coat more closely resembles a pedophile who looks around and watches around children all day. Which is the better way to plant the spirit of Christmas in Mari Steenburgen than to kill her family, and then we offer to return them if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a refuge for Nazi refugees. The film puts everything on so dense that you do not care about the happy end when it comes, because the rest of the movie is so bitter and incredible. I'm sure this film wanted to be something like Capra, but it left out the joy and the feeling of what a holiday film should be.
