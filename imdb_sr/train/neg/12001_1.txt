My honest advice to everyone: do not watch the movie. Do not even approach the theater in which this movie is played! Even a look at it is bad for health. Seriously. no jokes. 3.30 in the morning. and I came back from this dumbest movie in this universe. FOUR HOURS DAMN !!! I'm proud that I survived after all! If this is called survival. I am very frustrated. irritated. dissapointed. It was a waste of time! the money went to the drain! no plot. I hope that tomorrow I will wake up healthy and without remembrance of this night !! RUBBISH MOVIE. Happy Day Republic once and for all :)
