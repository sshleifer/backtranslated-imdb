You do not need to watch this movie unless you're trying to kill yourself. I think this film could cause serious damage to the brain. The main characters are the fierce non-hero Kevin, Amy, his brothers, the ungodly conservative girl, Kyle, the asshole in the red shorts who enjoys telephone sex, Daphne, a skinny, aggressive girl who needs to be "cool" and has no sense of dressing , and her overweight boy Nick, a military recruit who can make allusion from everything. No, I'm not a pervert, it's really the way the movie goes. The film itself is excessively separated from Gremlin from 1986, only you will never find a gizma track anywhere. No, these Hobboblin, released by Vimpa Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), let the most daring dream come true, then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed - Finally, they end up in a strip club, where Amy's greatest dream is revealed - She wants to be a stripper! Look, I've been watching this movie through MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Trench T. The robots that came out of this film failure and still bleed from both eyes. Not really, but I would like to be. I do not give you any more complications, because my relapse gave me this great need to drive a fork through the brain. Besides, it's not like there's a complicated trick. It should place a general surgeon warning to this film.
