I'll just put it here, it was the worst continuation of the classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney published what I called one of his greatest films of all time. Now take great songs, add a bad story that looks like that lost TV show. "Put it together and what do you get?" the biggest load Crude I've ever seen. After I saw this, I thought it was all about Disney. The cinder was supposed to end, "and they lived happily forever." Not this garbage. This film did not deserve this continuation. I thought it would be like "A Twist in Time," which was moderate, but better than this. Also, what do we care about Anastasia? She changed sides like Iago did, but did not help anyone.
