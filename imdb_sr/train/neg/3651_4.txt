I expected a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with a few funny jokes, and many who just did not work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing Sherlock Holmes and Moriarti's descendants. It was confusing. It would be more funny if they had a new one, instead of Moriarty. Some things were funny. Burt Kvouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was fun. McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 was not even McGarrett. Connie Booth is obviously very good with accents. She's from Indiana, but she played pretty well English and New York. Unfortunately, it was not much presented in the script. I was expecting an even more funny movie. Instead, I got a pretty confusing movie with a bad script. Ironically, since both Booth and Cleese were together on this. Perhaps they wanted to disintegrate at the age of 77.
