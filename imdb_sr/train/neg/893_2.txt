When I bought this DVD, though: "It seems to be a good comedy about love and relationships composed in Portuguese standards? I was completely wrong! What a disappointing movie! First, it's not a comedy; it's a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it's worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Secondly, the plot is so boring and it does not lead anywhere? It has no structure, only flows like wind in one direction or another? Production is also bad! Mixing sound is terrible because sometimes voices are separated I reminded some old Portuguese films from the 80s, Actually, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I've seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad acting , poor production? I did not have much hope for this movie, but it was much worse than I ever imagined! Forget about it!
