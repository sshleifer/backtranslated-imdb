This film is trying, but it lacks the entertainment of the 1960s television series, which I am sure people remember with love. Although I am 17 years old, I watched some of the series on IouTube for a long time and it was pleasant and fun. Unfortunately, this film contributes little to the series. Special effects are quite bad, and it did not help working on the camera. The script was also boring and had no sense in wonder and humor. Other sub-script films include Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and Magic Railroad and Addams Famili Reunion. Now I will say that I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately it was badly executed and too soon the money went out, and honestly I'm not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy. And I was angry about the suitcase, despite Vaine Knight's spiritual voice. But the thing that made me most angry in this movie was that he lost the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Darren Hannah. , all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has pulled some good performances before, but it seems he had no idea what he should be doing, and the character of Elizabeth Hurley unfortunately came as useless. Darryl Hannah is a wonderful actress and is largely ignored, and I liked the idea that she is the interest of love, but unfortunately you see very little of her (not to mention the assault Monster is likely to scare the kids out of them), also with Vallace Shavn some kind of government operative. Christopher Lloyd feels better, and I like Lloyd as an actor (he was in two of my favorite Clue films and framed by Roger Rabbit, and I love Back to the Future), but he was given a little work, and he had the tendency to It's too wild. All in all, as far as I wanted to love this movie, I was left with no impression. Instead of being fun, it's ridiculous, and it's a shame because it had a lot of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted on bad performance. 1/10 Bethani Cok
