So, you may be reading some of the comments posted on this movie, and you might think of yourself: "Huh. It was certain that the crowd of RAVE REVIEWS was published on December 30th." It's strange that most of these critic reviews sound like coming from the same person, or at best, small, coordinated group "Open House" group. True, my friends, this film is really unimportant. Just because "independent" does not mean it gets a free pass. If you want to make a musical, whether on a movie or on a scene, either on Broadway or in a community playroom, you should make sure that (a.) Your actors can sing, (b.) Your actors can dance (c. ) you have decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well-written result, and (e.) you have texts that are funny and charming. Even Anthony Rapp can not save this. This is one of those unfortunate film experiences in which I really felt confused for everyone involved.
