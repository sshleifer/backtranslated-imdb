Oh God, I had to see this when I was only 11 or 12 years old, (do not ask how). Maybe I was young, but I was not stupid. Everyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, rude, unheard and very stupid. I saw more impressive effects in Disneyland, I saw better performances in school play, and I saw more convincing crocodiles in the zoo, where they do nothing else but sit in the water, ignoring kids tapping on the glass. The story is set in northern Australia. A row of ambitious young people try out a new sport on the water, surfing in waters filled with sharks. Soon it becomes obvious that water is somewhat more dangerous. After finding out what, they get the help of grizzly middle-aged fishermen who want to kill an animal to avenge the food of his family. I think I've seen every crocodile film made in the past. fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worst of which is its continuation. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst crocodile I think, with the Champion and Crocodile standing behind. Australian potato seafood is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, which results in more than a hundred. annually. Movies like Blood Surf ruffle not only the wild picture of such a creature, but also the good watch and the life of the viewer. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
