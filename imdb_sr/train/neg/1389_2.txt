I was very disappointed in this film. Plates were bad at the border with nonsense: Souls that can affect reality in the way they do it? A mission that is obviously critical for soul hunters, entrusted to one of their younger members? And the whole B-story with "Holobrotel" and the lawsuit against the station was so terrible that I went to television at one point, "Why are you wasting my time with this?" Thematic, "River of Souls" actually did not come into question the soul at any depth than the original episode "Soul Hunter" did. We see that soul hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not feel their culture. (Is there any female hunter on the soul?) The act was fine, given the material with which they had to work, and the special effects - especially the planets in the first act - were very impressive. But all in all, I would say that you miss this.
