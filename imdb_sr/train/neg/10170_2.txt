The game of the championship is only a couple of days away, but things in Nev Orleans are not what they should be. From players with marital problems to overdoses of the drug to the gambling problem, life becomes an obstacle to what should be unforgettable, beautiful weather. Can things get back in line and the killer stopped before the big game was destroyed? In spite of what you might think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a planning and thinking device. Instead, Superdome is another of those poor soap operas - the 70s made for Hollywood-hosted TV programs and those who will never be. Nice dreams go through the thing, and nobody looks good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role, looking generally lost because of why he is there. The action is boring, uninteresting, and incredible. Donna Mills as hit "man"? Yeah, right! It's about as convincing as an affair with alcohol soaked by David Jansen. The film also has no tempo. Trying to get all four or five stories into the movie is all that Superdome could have. Without drama or uncertainty in sight, Superdome ends up as a very bad example of the 70's made for a TV movie. The lonely culmination for me was the voice of the late Charlie Jones - the athlete I miss. An eloquent way of exaggerating the intrigue and overstepping atmosphere in Nev Orleans is pure cheese at its best. This can be one of the KTMA public access episodes, but this is one of the best examples of early start of the show. And even though I was just ratinging Superdome 2/10, I will give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K scale.
