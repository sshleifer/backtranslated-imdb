Thanks to this movie, I can now answer the question: "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" Bad movies. Absolutely nothing works in this movie. List one element of each horror movie and this movie fails. Frankly, I've seen it better on YouTube. Here are some typical dialogues: "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, is that you?" "Steve, I'm not kidding" "Steve, this is not funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "ARggh !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
