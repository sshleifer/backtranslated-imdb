I've been waiting for almost 25 years to see this movie, thinking that this could be underestimated, it was no longer the one it once was from the animation period. She acted as one of the best movie villains of all time, was based on a beloved series of children's books and was the production of Disney's Studio. What could be wrong? As it turned out, almost everything. Well, not all. Vincent Price as Rattigan and Henri Mancini's Svanki score two rescue films. The price is dangerous, and Mancini is more professional than the material deserves. They enter a class into a project that normally belongs in the dark. In the meantime, the rest of the film, though full of inadequate adult situations, still suffers from a completely annoying scenario, mild generic voice work, horrible songs, and lazy animation that would not be in place in any of Disney's TV shows in the mid-eighties. This was a complete disappointment for me. It's amazing that this film was almost contemporary with the Secret of NIMH. Something independent of this, an independent studio has produced something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD has in its infinite time. .
