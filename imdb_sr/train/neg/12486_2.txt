Rich Ditzy Joan Vinfield (brazenly distorted Bette Davis) is engaged to marry stupid egoist Allen Brice (Jack Carson looks lost). Her father (Eugene Palette) is determined to stop her marriage and she is abducted by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagnei. Seriously). They break down the land into the desert and hate each other, but (sighs) begin to fall in love. It seems that this gets a high rating from reviewers just because Cagnei and Davis are in it. Both were great actors, but they were famous for drama NOT A comedy and this film shows why! The scenario is just terrible - there is no real laugh in the whole movie. The joke in the run is Cagnei and Davis first fell into the cactus (this is done THREE ROAD!). Only their significant talents save them from total humiliation. Since they both work best with bad material. Cagnei is trying the best he can, and Davis screams every line with full force, but does not work. Carson has this "devil" look at his face throughout the movie (probably because his characteristic emotions change in seconds). Only Palette, with her recognizable voice and at the top of the reading, struggles to cause a few smiles. But, all in all, this was boring and funny - it's a real job to sit. This gets two stars only for Cagnei and Davis, and some great cinema, but really - it's not worth a look. Cagnei and Davis hated this film in later years and you can see why.
