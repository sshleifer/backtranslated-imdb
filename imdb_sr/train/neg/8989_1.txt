There are some good things about the movie. Music and cinema are great. Alec Wilson is hot and gives excellent performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot. The production was very happy that he threw them because they really give a production value to the movie. Johnny Winsent (Sean) and many guys in the movie who do not speak are sweet. Why is the actress who plays Ami not listed in points? Brandon Alekander gives a great comic performance like Clitarissa Pink. The worst thing in the movie is probably the star, James Tovnsend. It can not work. He's also very skinny, not very nice. His hands are like spaghetti. That's disgusting. They do not have muscles at all. No wonder he has to shoot his movie and throw himself into it. No one else would put him in anything. James Townsend is not convincing as someone who would even have a girlfriend because she's acting like that. They should have someone else to lead, if they want what's best for a movie. Then again, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a means to start a career in soft-core pornography, it's definitely not a real act because it would take some lessons from the acting. In addition, anyone working pornography is on the blacklist in Hollivood. Sonja Fisher does not look like an actress at all. All in all, this movie is soft porn and it's nothing better than what you could see on Skinemak. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing in this movie, is shameful about it and does not want to be connected to it. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else on the list, so Alec Wilson is probably a one-time name. In addition, I once encountered him in West Hollywood and when I mentioned this film, he just turned around and left. I understand. If I had worked on this movie, it would be unpleasant for me and I would not want to be connected to it.
