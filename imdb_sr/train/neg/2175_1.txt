Carlos Mencia constantly, violent, hate screams "B ** ch!" In women it's like screaming "N ** ger!" in black people, except that it's worse. Remember, the word B, unlike N, is the only pejorative term that is still daily associated with violence. "B ** ch!" is the last thing women are hearing before they are raped, beaten, or killed. This type maintains hate violence using the language of violence. It sounds like a gay guy trying to conceal women, so it sounds like a hetero. And so that all Nazi white guys in his audience give fascist greetings while their stupid little bimbo white women are crying tee hee hee on their side, apparently horrified to protest against this tidal wave of hatred. Tee hee hee. Make sure Mencia does not trust or support freedom of speech for them! Come on, Carlos? do you want women to have free speech for you to strike you as loud and violent, as do you, or do you think "free speech" is only for men to shake with women ???
