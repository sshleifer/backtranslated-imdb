For the first forty minutes, Empire is really shaping: it seems to be a powerful, confident and relatively unknown gangster movie. Then I did not know why, I thought it was good - but now I know. One of the main problems with this movie is that it is pure and utterly untrustworthy. I do not mind movies with psychoses and things, to prove that this is true - I take Jackie Brovn, for example - but they are so terribly shallow, but that's obvious for fun. You literally feel a knot in your stomach. The second big problem is the protagonist. He is self-satisfied, arrogant, and yet, ironically, not so bad. She does not look strong enough to be a killer drug dealer. The fact is, after all, that this film is completely pretentious. Not smooth, not smart, just boring and meaningless - this colossal confusion should be avoided at all costs. <br /> * from ***** (1 of 5)
