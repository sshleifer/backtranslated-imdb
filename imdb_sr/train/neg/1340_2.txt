96 minutes of this is cruel .. and I love old Munster. Yes, the plot is a thing; that the lines are loose; but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan. So much is the "intrigue" (and I use that word with a big break) to wonder if it's the old Star & Hutch episode. I lost counting how many times I noticed that makeup missed a place near the necklace. Refusing to admit that any time has passed since the mid-60s (funny), producers simply replace Marilyn & Eddie with young actors. Why do not you let them grow old too? Adding a meal in the style of the Addam family does not contribute to the taste of Halloween party. Grandfather and Herman fly to Transylvania and back for a few hours (meaningless). the most incredible figure (including the bad robots), because it blurs an impure combination of nonsense and Yiddish, but claims to be an ancient Arab ruler. And yes, the trail of laughter seems to be missing. In fact, there are several places where dead air is, as if the trail of laughter would later be inserted. The actors seem to be waiting for a false audience. Not funny; that's sad. Oh, and the best part! Ivonne DeCarlo has a line that just shows that writers and producers are out of touch. Marilyn says something like, "Where could Uncle Herman and Grandpa have been? They could have been in an accident. They could have been hit by a car or a train!" Lily says she replies: "You're uncle Herman will be here if he has to get out of the lane." What is strange about this is: husband Ivona Dekarlo was a stuntman in the early sixties and lost her leg and was almost killed in a train. He never recovered and financially destroyed her family. (see a fantastic overview of the biography of her life and career). This line could easily be changed to make it more sensitive to her. This mess. This illustrates how to leave some things in peace. Even with (almost) original actors, this is almost as bad as an attempt to remake a show a few years ago.
