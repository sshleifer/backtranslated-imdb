Imagine that a real Hitler, who was the master of propaganda and speech, would have been such a mummy dumbbell as Carlile had portrayed in this film. This is just a Hollywood propaganda card, disguised as a "true history". I'm sorry for anyone who really believed in something from this show. Carlile and the producers did not get anything right with that. Why did Hitler manage to conquer so many people, the whole county for his ideas that we are such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? Presenting it as such a loser, they make their film absolutely incredible. This film is a mixture of the old World War II propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill where the director portrays him as a drunk for only 90 minutes. This film is embarrassing and I wonder how to talk to an actor like Carlile in this madness.
