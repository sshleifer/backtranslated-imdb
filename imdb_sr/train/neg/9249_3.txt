While I was watching the movie, I'm not sure what kind of direction it took. There is a reason why a writer should not direct his work, and even if it works in it, you can not do it all. I felt that the story really suffered in this film because the director was wearing so much hat. Ms. McTeer is a movie. To add to her incredible talents, her portrayal of this woman was the reason I was engaged. There's a British actress who can do everything. In my opinion, the conflict is what makes a drama and a great story. I felt that this film does not exist. It was all easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles that would prevent teachers from getting what they wanted. Look at the movie for sweetness, but mostly for the brilliant performance of Mrs. McTeer.
