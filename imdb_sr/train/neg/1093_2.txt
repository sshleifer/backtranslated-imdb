Cat Natividad, the film fame of Russ Meier, starring Chastiti Knott, a woman who discovered that she has breast cancer, and goes to South America to take some special fruits (Crockazilla?) Which should have healing powers. After going to these fruits (which looks like plastic bananas on stems), Joy is endowed with some mystical magical forces that make up the super-hero, more precisely, Double D Avenger. Keep in mind that she also wears a pair of panties like a mask. In writing, it all sounds pretty good. In execution, well, it leaves more than a little desired. It seems that Chastiti owns a pub, and the local comic is upset because it takes away their work, so some strippers (including Haji, also Russ Maier film fame) go after her to ruin. Of course, Honesty returns under the guise of the Double Avenger. Look at how Vonder Voman works to change into her clothes and to lose balance because of the excessive centrifugal force. Poor jokes and poor doubles fly like it was not tomorrow. With an unplanned, repeated theme theme song, it's like a children's live-action show from the 70s with adult content, although while unrated, it's likely to get out of PG-13 in the worst case. And it's probably a blessing that faded stars are well covered. This makes Doris Vishman's Chesti Morgan films a positive look in comparison. Special appearance of the forest J. Akerman, but then what? Very stupid, and I will never buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 of 10
