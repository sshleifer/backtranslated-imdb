Tovnies is the deadliest film I've ever seen, and I've seen a movie about witches Blair (the first and second part). It looks confused in what it wants to be. It's not funny enough for a comedy, it's not tragic enough for a drama, it's not enough for horror and it's not good enough to watch. There are scenes of a man working "slapstick / bloody" karate, so I think this film will be in the spirit of Tokic Avenger and Street Trash. Then, without warning, she jumps into a drama about a missing girl, a retarded (mentally handicapped) woman and a trusted mother. Then she hits alone in a very good part of the movie that seems to be set up like a sit-down without a trace of laughter. The part I'm talking about is a lonely one that is so lonely to find comfort in a rotten corpse. It was the only part of the movie that gave me any sense. The rest was the waist of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Vaine has a kind of DOCUMENTARY at the end of Vaine's film (director), ridiculing Toby (star) in public. I was sick. Although Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other Vaine's films) are not the best, at least they are thought enough to be able to have fun until the end of the loan. I even loved Killer Nerd, I had great lines that I still use today. they rested, you will not like TOVNIES! 1/2 (from ****) <br /> <br />
