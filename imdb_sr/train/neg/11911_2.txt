I was sitting glued to the screen, pinned, yawning, and still keeping a careful eye. I waited for the next terrible effect, or the next ridiculously clichéed item to show myself full of power, so I could learn how to not make a movie. the movie, the team watched every other action / science-fantastic / shoot-em-up / good movie against evil ever made, and saw cool things and said "Hey, we can do it." For example, the only car parked within a mile of what appears to be a one-time road with a shoulder not provided for parking, is the car to which the protagonist is an attractive brunette born from the throat, thrown. The car hits the pieces before it descends on it. The special effects were obviously my biggest beef with this film. But what really was in my bad books was, it was incredible and a lack of reason for so many elements! For example, an antagonist, a flying demon with the possibility of causing damage in a bizarre manner, takes place on a lone military truck transporting an important VIP. Unnamed security men with guns come out of the truck, you know they are already dead. Then the guy who protects the VIP says: "Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" He went out to find the beast that killed his three comrades, and he was almost comical cliché. Then without obvious reason, defying the logic, convention and common sense, the stupid Ass VIP gets the truck! Much of what happened during the film did not make sense. Transparent acting has distracted me from film, as well as bad work on the camera, and things that just make you go: "Vov, it's incredibly cheesy." Shiri Applebi preserved a film of 1 because she gave the movie an element that always sees the audience in experience, sexual attraction.
