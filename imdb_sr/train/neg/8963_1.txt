Murders in this movie are not so bad, but it's certainly a movie. That's even worse than that. It's not even worth the cost that can be caused by pushing it into a DVD player. Even the spending that causes it on your shoulders brings it from DVD, not to mention money and time spent renting and watching. Terrible. It's not understandable how anyone can say something positive about this movie. It was just my naked Masochistic tendency that led me to stop watching, to add that the group pressure of my followers. I hope you do not see this as a broken fun, I'd rather watch it as a fair warning: Do not waste your time watching this trash!
