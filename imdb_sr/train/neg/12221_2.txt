With the exception of sound, none of the above is not a criticism for this kind of budget, (indeed) an independent horror movie. Make up effects and top are very good and the main actor was effective, the main actress, although attractive, needs a bit of training because she was particularly bad. The main problem with Frightvorld is its length, at 108 minutes a half hour to be effective as a slasher movie, relevant only for about ten minutes from the first fifty. In places it is visually appealing and sometimes the lack of lighting in movies is grace. However, when this is combined with a bad sound like the majority of movies, large parts are difficult to watch. It would certainly be fun if a non-serial "serial killer from the dead" film with some prudent and ruthless editing plays in its current form as an incomplete rough cut.
