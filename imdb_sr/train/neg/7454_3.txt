I love acting casts, but the story is quite slow. Danny Glover is doing a good job and wondering if he's a bad guy. In the meantime, other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Kuaid did not have as much room in the story as he could. I thought that the first scene was a little exaggerated compared to how the story was going on. Still, I would look at him again. I rated him with 5 (I want to score 5.5)
