Why oh, why movie hits just do not keep their sales points? Everyone in the movie, young and old, was there to see how the animals were speaking, and while they did it, we were all happy ... And then, like Lost In Space, there were two killings - a plot and a sentiment. Who really worried about what happened to a tiger or did Eddie Murphy invented his daughter? Not me, that's for sure.
