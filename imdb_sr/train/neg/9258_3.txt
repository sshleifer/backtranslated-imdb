Unfortunately, someone decided to turn to the best horror movie of all time in my book. This bad copy steals a lot of materials from the first three films, even copying how people die and what will happen in the future with key characters and it essentially tries to put three films into one and collapse. It can not even create a good atmosphere for one (except with the exception of exceptions where impressive choral music returns memories to old movies). The only thing we can be grateful for is that there was not Omen V.
