I loved the first movie "Azumi". I saw Ms. Ueto in various of her TV shows and I saw a large number of samurai and ninjas. I must say that this film was much weaker than I expected. Given the movie role and setting in "Azumi", they should have been able to do much better work with this movie. but instead it was slow, full of parts and sprinkled with a very bad, unpredictable and woody acting. and weak. In Azumi, the title character is the best of a group of superior killers. In "Azumi 2" it seems somewhat diminished and less impressive. This does not mean that it was a complete loss. There were several decent fighting scenes and some top-notch characters. Unfortunately, the film generally suffers from the fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Ioshiaki Kavajiri are not Riuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriiama. The latter two really grasped the "manga" feeling in their script, while the first one never "got it."
