THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This movie boasts a fairly good introductory loan (a narrator that warns that film sponsors will be offered a free burial if they die of fear watching this movie, a scary clip of a skull that appears from a peaceful pool movie and an ubiquitous scary music), but, unfortunately, the film is downhill. The widow takes her new bride into her secret house ... warning her servants and friends that the new lady has a very fragile disposition for the tragedy of her past. Well, at no time she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband is convinced that all this is only in her mind and ... well, you can probably see where this is happening. You realized what was happening much before our unhappy heroine ... because you probably saw the same design in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and better than that). To add a lot of offense in the movie, most of the cuts of this movie (on many cheap DVD compilations) seem to lack several key scenes. You see the heroine walking slowly toward the window ... she goes to open it ... you know she will see something terrifying ... and then ... suddenly her scene stops her from being in the hands of her husband. So what did she see? I guess we'll never find out.
