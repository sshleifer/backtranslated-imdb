The second film in the boxet. Originally named Bloodsuckers, this film was quite average. It's kind of bored in some areas, but there are some good effects up there, but they're not great at all. The film takes place in the year 2210. Vampires were mostly taken over by the whole world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) team, which also has its own spaceship and is run by Churchill, captured by vampires, receives a message from Earth and a team formed by Kuintana (played by Natassia Malthe). ), newcomer Damian and Rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman played Aaron Pearl from the Vrongfulli Accused.) V-SAN later met with the leader of the Muco Vampire, played by Michael Ironside of Total Recall. He has no plans to live peacefully with people because he is prone to world domination. Although this film was not a waste of time, I doubt that I will soon return the DVD player.
