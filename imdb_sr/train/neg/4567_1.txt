What is the bad picture of professional policemen shown on television in watching this alleged Realty show. It can only be hoped that a real reasonable doubt leading to the probable cause leads to the totality of the circumstances involved in order to create a "standpoint", then "lowering" the outer garment, and then to articulate why the policeman went to someone's pocket and pulled out the smuggled goods, he was cut out of the scene, because if not, the arrest in most places would be thrown, if even the supervisor goes. The radio report on the radio does not represent a real existence of an order, unless the person sending the information has an original order in hand. If the dispatcher reads from a computer printout, it's good enough to arrest, but that does not mean that the account is still valid. Since I did not see a Dis-Prosecutor from CBS (maybe I missed him), CBS could be in trouble.
