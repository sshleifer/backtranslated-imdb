This does not really make blues justice. It starts bad with photos from a voidager probe and Blind Villie McTell (or Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone is blind), apparently narrating from space (?) And talking life stories of various blues musicians. As such, this could be the visually most interesting part of this documentary. After that, the only thing that can be seen is that actors are incapable of pronouncing classical melodies recorded in fake black and white interactions with characters such as Beck and Shemeki Copeland, who then raped the same songs. This is a good device that shows us why the old Blues giants were really so great, but that does not mean you'll watch them. There is hardly anything here that could justify doing it with a movie, not a radio game. No one should be forced to see these poorly implemented reconstructions. It's a shame for Venders, Scorsese and especially Blues. Avoid at all costs.
