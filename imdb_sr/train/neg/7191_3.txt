I saw yesterday night at the Midnight Slam Film Festival in Monreale. What a disappointment. This film is obviously above the rating of IMDb fans. The acting was just a regular one. The director did not bring anything new or interesting. The action does not have much: the film is all about these colleges and the game they play for a joke call (7events 5ive). In addition, you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like jokes and slasher calls with an ax that allow you to jump only once or twice during the entire movie, you may like it. If not, this film does not pay off.
