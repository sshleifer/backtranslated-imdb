The first few minutes of "Bodyguards" have a charming charm: it opens with creeping texts from the Bible (a part that Samuel Jackson recounts to his future victims in "Pulp Fiction"), continues with two karate schools teachers in New York discuss the eternal question of humanity (who is better Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), And then Chiba appears, playing herself; immediately stops the hijacking of the airplane and bites the bottle into two with a bare hand. Unfortunately, any fun value, whether intentional or unintentional, will soon be suppressed by an unrelated story, a lack of action over long periods of time and the poor quality of any current action. To make it simple, here's why "Bodiguard" is an unbearable movie to watch: 1) You do not know what's going on. 2) Barely there are quarrels. 3) The fights that are here are short and terribly recorded. Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Li is beautiful, her face is magnificent. I just give them "The Bodiguard" the second star of 10. This movie makes 87 minutes a feeling like 5 hours.
