I mean, I thought I heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and unreasonable that I can not really believe it. I laughed so much in what was to be the worst writing and acting in human history, I seriously worried that I might have a heart attack and die right there in the theater. the scene I'm talking about, the "hero" just watched his brother fall down and his brother's car exploded there just a few steps away from him (the hero). The "hero" caused the expected "fit" when he saw something so tragic and people tried to keep him from running into a burning car. emotional breakdown says, "I'm so sad," he said? Am I crazy?
