It certainly is happening in the west, but the title seems to look like a conventional western one. Instead, it's a woman's sheriff film. Do not make a mistake, even though this is a bad film about the woman's sheriff. She becomes a sheriff when her husband is killed; She's just a little upset about that. Her main goal is to go to a bad woman who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. That's how it happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Totally stupid, like anyone who was killed in this movie, has a new sheriff. She had more than a few opportunities to kill the murdered behind bars, but I suppose she does not like her. The killer is also the mayor of the city for personal reasons who are also quite stupid. This movie is very boring and not worth watching ... it's not one of the better episodes MST3000 they've made. I can not imagine anyone would see this without them, because it would have been much painful. Corman is the director of the budget, but even he should know better than people going to one place and coming out of the other.
