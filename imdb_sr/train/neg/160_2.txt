I really wanted to like this Westerner, to be a fan of the genre and a fan of Buffalo Bill, Vild Bill Hickok and Calamiti Jane. Add to the mix of Gary Cooper as the main actor, and it sounded great. The problem was ..... not. I found myself watching my watch in only 40 minutes, getting bored of death. Jean Arthur's character was a bit boring, and James Ellison did not look like he was acting like a "Buffalo Bill". Neither Cooper was at his best. It was a few years before he hit the actor. In short, his shotguns. Start with the pass and see more oater because most of them were much better than this.
