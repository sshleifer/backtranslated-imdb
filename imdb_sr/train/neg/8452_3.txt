This is the first time I commented on a movie because I felt that if the right person reads it, it might wake up and do something about it. In the past few months, the ABC family has begun to broadcast a new movie format. I saw the last three and I enjoyed them. They hired and did a trick. My wife loves these movies. I looked forward to seeing "See Jane Date". Trailers looked and sounded great. Unfortunately, this is a film in which the book must be light years ahead of efforts that writers and musicians have included in this project. Year 2003, the source (all bad), the result was as interesting as driving an elevator in a department store. He was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all. It was against that. I work in film and television. I enjoy being entertained. This is one of the situations in which I was constantly thinking if it could be worse. The script had lines of another decade and I know that these women can act, but you do not know it from this movie. To add to my overall experience, it left me to shake my head. Advice to managers Disnei, ABC, ABC Families and producers: Under any circumstances, please do not hire a composer or music supervisor for any of your future films. They have lost touch and must understand what the word "contemporary", "today" and "actual" means when describing a romantic comedy. The world is passing by you. All in all, a great disappointment from the people of Von Zerneck-Sertner and the ABC family.
