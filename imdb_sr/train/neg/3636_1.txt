I am very open to foreign movies and I like to think that I understand what they are trying to achieve, although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this film were boring. I often thought about how it would be interesting to make a movie that only shows a typical day or period of time that really does not make sense. Now that I've seen such a movie, I will not think about it anymore. There are tones of society, racism and some desire ... but South Park has it. And when I watch South Park, it actually drives me to feel the emotion. The closest thing I felt in the emotions during this film was the whim I experienced after the first five minutes. I estimate a typical movie of seven or more, because I love every single film most. I gave this movie one time.
