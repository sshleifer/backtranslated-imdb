This film is written as a comedy and mystery. In both cases it fails. The only mystery is why anyone would make such a badly built movie. The only comedy is the laughter I got when I saw how many readers here ran high. Can I have two movies with the same name? The film I watched was a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that was not there. <br /> <br />
