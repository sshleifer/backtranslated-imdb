How can Barry Levinson assemble the white comedies Ben Stiller and Jack Black, the beautiful Rachel Veisz, the old professional Christopher Valken and still deliver such a stinky stinker? Stiller and Black are friends until the latter invents the spray so that the dog's mess disappears and becomes a conspicuous consumer multimillionaire. The room is slim, but good enough in the right hands to be a springboard for a big beast between the two stars, but worryingly surpassing every hand, every chance they can. Stiller and Black are simply not too funny for too long, Veisz looks sensational as always, but is criminally unused and, with the exception of Valken as a whistle calling Styler's character to retaliate, it's a tense move to the end of this strained farce.
