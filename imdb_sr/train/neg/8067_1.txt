First, let me tell you this must be at the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I think nothing in this movie is not exciting. Most are very confusing and progressing, you just want to finish it !! Some people want a movie that makes them "thinking" through the whole thing, which I say ... "More power for you" !! I, on the other hand, just want to have fun. What brings me to this stinker, the party is not. This film is a stupid and complete waste of time. It looks like the majority here agrees. Most of this did not make any sense, and while you think you have one scene, you've discovered another easy scene and ... so I guess you see where this is happening. Avoid this, this is bullshit .... bad !!
