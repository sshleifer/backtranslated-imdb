Well, because I'm a musician, I thought, maybe I'll check this movie on TMC, nothing else is worth it. One of the worst mistakes in my life so far, and that's only half. I seriously thought it was one of those films with a soft core with a shy complication and stupid acting, shy shooting and shit effects. But no, I can not even get pleasure. Even "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping for some laugh, but I was not sure if they were trying to insert a liner or not. But now I have to sit here and watch the rest until Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now I sit here and write until I get 10 rows
