It seems to be the only movie John Sikon ever directed and that he had a good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera. This film is a dog, from beginning to end, and boring and woody, with nothing going. The war hero of Vietnam takes over the job as a mafia boss, becomes too friendly with his wife, and then the woman kills the boss himself, and the war hero is embracing and sent to prison, specifically, the death penalty. This jail experimented with prisoners and tested a formula that would turn people into the ultimate killer machine (zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then all these infected people are trapped in prison, some of which turn into zombies, and others who suddenly just do not want to be there. This only continues and continues, but it can not show or say anything in particular, and I stopped it before the end, which seemed to come in several times, but no, it's obvious that it just started to move on different and Equally boring road. If someone looked at the end, they could themselves become zombies, so do not risk it. 2 of 10
