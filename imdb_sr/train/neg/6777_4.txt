While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review, I really did not like this movie even though it had so many similarities. Both were made only a few years ago, both played by Cari Grant, both of which were comedies from the Second World War. However, the overall tone and style of the films was quite different. Overall, KISS HER FOR ME, it just looked like a cheaper movie - with bad writing, little energy and a bit of VERY wide performance - even compared to the OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think it's at least a big part of the blame for Jaine Mansfield. The combination of her abundant talents and limited acting abilities led to this A-budget film as if it had come from a third degree study. In addition, there was not much chemistry or energy in her pairing with Cari Grant - an actor who is mostly loved for her grace and class. It's like matching Sir Lavrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
