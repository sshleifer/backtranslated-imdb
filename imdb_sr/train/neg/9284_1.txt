Man, even Plan 9 from the universe is better than this movie. This film does not have enough complications in half an hour, but they managed to extend it for eternity for more than an hour. Jet Li and Corei Iuen are pretty good, especially in those exaggerated combat scenes, but things like the Legend of Fong Sai Iuk are much better than this sad thing that would have been better left uninformed.
