I recently saw a documentary "The revolution will not be televised," also known as "Chavez: Inside the shock." At first I thought that it shows the true view of the events during venecuanskog coup in April 2002. What disturbed me was the fact that the tone of narration and accompanying music suggestive, and that at no time there was criticism about Hugo Chavez. This is weird, because if a documentary gives an impartial report about what happened, it took some of that. After all, Chavez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, as the documentary a few years old, the Internet is now available a lot of additional information, and it was not hard to find, for example, "an urgent investigation of Chavez - a coup 5 European TV corporations who financed the film which presents obvious lies about Venezuela . "It lists many mistakes and deliberate or unintentional falsifications in a documentary film. (Just use the title as a search string on Google, you will find it). Another interesting document was a video presentation of the findings of many mistakes in this documentary, "X-ray of a lie." It seems to me that this is a good counterweight to "Chavez: within the impact". It's available on video.google. We strongly advise you that after watching "Chavez in a coup," look at "X-ray of lies" and then form your own opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartle and Donnacha O'Brian (consciously or not) participate in the Chavez-propaganda.
