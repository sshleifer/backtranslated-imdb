I was looking forward to watching this film and then realized that any hope in a coherent dialogue between actors is flooded with unnecessary curses. Now I am not in any way embarrassed, but shouting rude to each other does not make a good movie. Evan Bremner is undoubtedly one of the worst actors in the world at this time (testifying to his performance in the terrible life of Things) and his "Cockney" accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many more "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures" we need to suffer before filmmakers realize that f-vord, c-vord, etc. It does not replace the proper dialogue.
