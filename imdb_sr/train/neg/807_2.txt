I did not expect much from this TV movie. You need to set it at least lower than what you would do for limb limbo for any TBS movie starring Antonio Sabato Jr. Nevertheless, he succeeded in disappointing, failing to even be a good-bad movie. Every scene was memorable, as if someone had cut and paste scenes from dozens of films and television shows that were dealing with the big business's plot in the script, leaned over and said: "My job is over". All this is clich√©s, all foreseeable, and, worse, actors are forced to look like they take it seriously, (even when development plans are ridiculous). Do yourself a favor. Watch "The Ks-Files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They are better worn. Also, let someone know that sitting through the "Fatal Error" is exactly that.
