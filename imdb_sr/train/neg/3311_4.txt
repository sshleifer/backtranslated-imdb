Saving Grace is certainly one of the leading contenders for the "How to Kill an Appropriate Film in the Finals for a few minutes" award. Of course, if you mix a strange Cornish village - mostly inhabited by retired women from giving - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of nonsense arises. However, the last seven minutes of the film goes down completely ridiculous and not even redeemed because it is particularly funny. This is a shame because this comedy has the potential to be as good as the 1998 Vaking Ned Devine, which also featured a picturesque little village and its strange inhabitants trying to get out of a difficult situation. <br /> <br> The protagonist of the Saving Grace is a middle-aged, recently widow of Grace Trevethin, whose husband inherited the inheritance of bad debts forced an unconventional way of earning money. Helping her gardener, Matthev, turns her horticultural expertise into a lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads to confrontation with the local police, the creditors of her husband and French drugs. . . . . . . . . . which appear simultaneously in her greenhouse. The relationship and relationship between Grace and Matthews is well illustrated, and Brenda Blethin emotionally involves the viewer with her sympathetic character - you can really feel what she is going through. The role of smaller stakes is excellent, even if some of them are rather oddly eccentric. However, the transformation of Jackues into a drug in Grace's romantic interest is very incredible and does not even fit into the tone of the film. And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis? Unfortunately, the film changes the mild humor for the slapstick and ends up as a forgery as a marijuana plant.
