It's sad that you can not go down from a star. Before watching Vicker Man, I thought that aliens 3 was the only movie to earn negative stars. All in all, The Vicker Man does not diminish the enjoyment of an earlier film, but the fact remains that my cumulative enjoyment of the film is reduced by looking at it. It is often used in Hollywood when producers are too embarrassed to hire good writers or are too hurt to allow them to bring the plot to a satisfying conclusion: the slap in a shocking ending and the hope that the public will misunderstand it meaningfully . It's a gambit that rarely thrives and in this case it only succeeds in spraying the shame of a fine actor and ridicule at the producers. Even more than the fact that the "carefully made" (or whatever they put it) the conclusion was not logically followed by complication (which, of course, can not be elaborated without the introduction of a spoiler), and instead denies the merits of the plot until that moment. It is a movie that could logically be liked by psychopaths, pedophiles, and perhaps even stubborn fans of Nicholas Cage, but only to a few mainstream audiences. If you really want something in that direction, I cordially recommend you to the village M. Night Shiamalan in the village. In the absence of some memory-erasing pills, I guess I have to look at something better to force it out of my mind, say, Attack of Killer Tomatoes or Pee-vee's Big Adventure?
