The movie is totally shitty. We have two good actors who are silly and stupid actor Salman Khan only to attract a female audience. The story is bullshit. The characters are poorly sketched. There is no story. There's no editing about which I would speak. Ajai Devgan as Rock Star .. it's a dream in itself. The film is pulled to the point of decadence. The whole array of how Arjun brought his Mano to London, let him touch his girlfriend and let him not play at Wembley (Vimbleys in the synchronization process) is absurd. Salman Khan acted or acted too painfully to watch. I remember seeing some good films from this producer Vipula Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems that all good directors are becoming a prey to the courier office ... created by Mumbai Media Morons. This is another shitty movie "Vanted" with an idiotic actor like Salman Khan who does not have a place in the Good Hindi cinema. He was good at the Indian cinema, while Titanic was on winter business. On a positive note - I love Asin's character who dances Bharatnatiam when he changes to a Western dance when the teacher does not look.
