This is one of the worst movies made by Clark Gable. Only PARNELL was obviously worse. It's just such a painful cliché and the dialogue is so bad it's something that neither Gable nor Jean Harlow should have been proud of what they did. slammer (like a gangster speech?). She hopes to do the right thing, but he just leaves there - unknown to any of them, God, that is "in a family way." In the end, the devil returns to do the right thing and in a way connects it to a happy ending! They seem to have forgotten Gable's need to take a tail and spend a few years in pigeons. Leonard Maltin says: "The stars are the best here." What standard? Best in the production of unintended laughter? Give me a break! PS - after I said this, my wife thinks Leonard Maltin will find me and hit my ass. Hmmm. However, despite my comment, I think that Mr. Maltin is the best reviewer and human being on the planet (I hope it calmed him down). UPDATE - 2/2/08. Since I did not love this film for the first time (especially a funny ending), I decided to look at it again. After all, sometimes when I watch the movie again, I like it a lot and I realize that I'm a bit too tired. Although it was with several films in recent months, this film still did not like me - even the second time. Most of this was not due to the first half of the film. In the first half, Harlow's character was incredibly stupid, but at least that was convincing. But when they were sent to prison, all of them were clichés until the final funny scene of marriage emerged. The ultimate conclusion is that this line is awkwardly stupid - it simply does not make sense and is similar to converting a movie into a freaky fairytale instead of a love story of two counterparts. I stand beside my original review (despite all the "NOT HELPFULS") and I think that apart from PARNELL and possibly POLLI on CIRCUS, it can only be the worst Gable movie.
