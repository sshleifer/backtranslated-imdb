I saw this movie on the so-called. This afternoon, and I do not see how anyone can sit through this piece of garbage. It's not funny at all, and you need to get IC. in several places. I know this film is intended for children, but that does not mean that writers should take their intelligence for granted. I bet the writers were sitting around a big wooden table and thought that a) The word "kaka" is equal to a big laugh. b) A four-meter boy can knock on a basketball net of ten feet. c) Children always have to fight with the hijackers with weapons because the hijackers will fall for anything and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to break through the so-called "ninjas" with swords. One good thing I can say about this movie is that it contains the weakest suburban "gang" in the world that no one could scare. Maybe the guys from MST3K could use this movie for a good laugh. Do not bother with this poor movie pretext.
