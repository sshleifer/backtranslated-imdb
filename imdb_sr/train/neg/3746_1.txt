However hard it is for me to believe, with all that terrible to realize shooves over the past few years, this must take the first place for the worst. I'm still wondering if it was actually just a flaw made by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, I would be sure he was behind this. Can the rock band lean lower than INKSS so shameful as this? The space is simple and moronic. The karaoke crowd's audition refuses to become the new INXS singer, to take the place of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years later, and without hits, the band committed itself to the ultimate act of pathetic by auditioning for a bunch of talented vannabes to be the new lead singer of the band that has passed 20 years. So, all those horrible singers (I think American Idol has a part of the doozy) that make horrible performances of almost every classical (and predictable) rock song that can be imagined. And then they cut into the INKS band members seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates. You could see a better (and more original) rock performer in any nightclub in any city in the world. It has all the usual non-creative elements of every other reality shov. Bad participants in reality, lame interviews, lame hosts / jokes, lame "ratings" of performances and lame lifting of one participant at the end of each show. Can these performances be more predictable? Obviously this is a publicity that is part of the band; The last sigh of hope is to revive the lost star before they are finally buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had any dignity when he was alive, he must get overturned in his grave. Not that INKS has ever been a great band, but I had no idea that it was pathetic. If INKSS is representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the ultimate proof that the rock and roll once and for all are dead.
