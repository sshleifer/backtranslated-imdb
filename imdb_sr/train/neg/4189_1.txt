I had a terrible misfortune that I met this year's two worst films since 2004: first, the unconnected void of the Chronicles of Riddick in the CGI, and then, the shameless vanity project known as Greendale. One costs multimillion, while others cost coins, but they're both bad. Really, really bad. In front of me, I should say that I am not the greatest world fan of Neil Ioung, but he contributed with his classic melodies: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were Young Compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest and Mirror Ball, a man wrote some truly great songs. Unfortunately, Greendale does not have great songs, and a few good songs, and the film they are about to build is really a fragile and simplified political slogan. Totally without merit as art and immersive as controversy, Greendale is best left to be forgotten. Buy a book if you feel that you are forced to contribute to the Uruguay bank account.
