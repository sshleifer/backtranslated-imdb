In the early 1990s he brought many "weird" and "off-beat" independent films, whose special sub-genre is a semi-spiritual film about the crime. Other notes include "Vild at Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn" and to some extent "Natural Born Killers". Good films like those that have garbage like "Highvai 666", "Destiny Turns on the Radio" and this unusually surreal anti-masterpiece "Under the Hula Moon". It is a comedy that strives for a certain emotional tone, it achieves it, but continues to go to the point of irritation. While the search for the spirit of the world of the desert and the casting of Chris Penn is a good idea, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good film about crime, and it is not focused enough to laugh in order to be a comedy. I will not blow the end, but let's say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of genital cancer. These are the remains of indie-mania.
