If you look at this without the indication of the idea being discussed, then you are quite surprised. Even then, the synopsis painted a picture of a fairly reasonable story, but the real movie is everything except ... As the synopsis went, it talks about an obsessed mountaineer, whom you will see as a prelude before introductory credits and text crawling, which tells you about the presence of Chronopolis, the imaginary city that exists in the dreamer's manuscripts of the mind (note that it is a spell of troubles with flickering lights), where its inhabitants are immortal to an ever-changing change in their omnipresence. They can see our world, and the perception of all the people of this hiker, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet a man. What has been translated is a repetitive animation that a five-year-old kid could produce. Create outlines, even if the loan goes in the style of a stop motion, and put it through a mental loop. And repeat until the eyes begin to close, then go to the next scene. If anything, Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their rods and balls, they are constantly playing in invoking this magic sphere, and have a field day playing with her before they let him into the "other" world. It does not get even better when a person interacts with the sphere in another hypnotically boring and inductive sleep sequence. Thanks to God, of course, the working time is shorter than what is being advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) against the above 70. Although firmly dated, its annoying colors, a non-existent story, a screaming soundtrack and a repetitive image will win without fans. Do not waste your time.
