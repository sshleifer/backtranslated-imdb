Another American movie film is pushed down our throat and this is the worst of all. It does not deserve American Pie. They should have been on "The Vedding". This movie feels like just stupid porn that sniffed the title of American Pie. When I looked at this, I felt like I was watching different series. It does not fall like American Pie at all. She has different humor and is much more rude and has a lot more sexual scenes than other American films. I do not recommend this ever. In fact, I do not recommend any of the American Pie Presents movies. Just stick to the beautiful original trilogy. 2/10
