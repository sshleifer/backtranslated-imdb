I'm glad that some people like this, but I hated this movie. She had a very good idea for the story, but she ended up there. It was badly written, badly behaved and badly made. They had some interesting plots, but they were skipped too fast, the writers had to understand what they should keep and extend to these parts as if they were lying about why they were kidnapped and throwing slag. Instead, it was "what's going on?", 5 seconds later they tell you. This film had no uncertainty, and I was bored from start to finish. I just wanted to finish it. Go and hire a misfortune, or the best set plans, if you want uncertainty or turns that keep you from speculating.
