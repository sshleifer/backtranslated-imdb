It's a ghost story. It's a story of cannibalism. It's a revenge story. It's a very bad movie with lots of violence. I suppose it's cheap in line with every movie you've ever seen. It has a commonly isolated place, wacky campers, which move into the wilderness. Of course, there are some pretty intense scenes. It's so boring. Bad editing and whole works. There are ghosts that sound like they're talking to a trash can. I'm not really sure which spirits and psychos are playing with the seed. It also has a rough scene in which a person eats a piece of meat that is actually what is left of his wife. One of my friends once asked me why it was necessary to show this kind of free, sick violence. I'm afraid this is just another step in our desensitized evolution. The three are not smart here, there's no language in the face, only a sad waste of time. A lot of blood; little plot.
