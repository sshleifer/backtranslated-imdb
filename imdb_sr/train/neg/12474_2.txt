I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and so much I liked the movie - even "immaculate" - that I decided to watch the whole series of "Deathstalker" films. I bought I and II and calmed down. Nothing about "Deathstalker I" was funny on any level and when the credits collapsed, it was a shame and regret I bought! Too ugliness and nudity. I suppose that either "DS 3" was much cleaner production or MST3K really edited a lot because I expected something similar, i.e. Stupid and carefree and simple. I was wrong. Even $ 6.99 seemed to be a waste of money. I did not even open the "DS 2" because I will return it tomorrow. Now I'll probably just throw this DVD because I can not get it back and nobody wants it - including me! Well, do not be bothered with this. Even nudity (much, BTW) is unkind and slick.
