Of course, it is very nice to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, however, I would expect something more creative than Togan Gokbakar. starting with the script, which I believe was not wisely written as some people think. especially the dialing of the dialogue, which put the audience in a position that, as if it was not smart enough to understand the situations that make most of the film unbearable. it also has an obvious end; You can easily hit the killer from the beginning. the weakest part of the scenario is that the inability of severely mentally ill patients to behave like normal people, such as professionals immediately ... have they ever sought the possibility that patients who are on difficult medicines behave as professionals and use all medical expressions that are not even normal people can not use, also in the scene where the staff were looking for the most dangerous patients, without any weapons to protect, there was another strange point in the film. and this scene was so suitable for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! These are not the only weak parts of the film. there were many special features in the film. displaying the most dangerous patient was the exact copy of Hannibal, and the appearance of Togan at the very end was clearly the worst mistake he could have made in his first film! a gamble about the size of the film and interviews that the actor gave just to make people curious and force them to see it. Gen is a total disappointment. I would wonder if Sahan was not so familiar, would Togan be able to make this film with this large number of budgets? I hope that Togan will realize that it is not modern to play the role of director, as he said in the interview. Hitchcock did this wisely, and Night Shiamalan continued it successfully! he should be aware of the fact that he is not Hitchcock nor Shiamalan !!!! hoping to be more careful and creative next time in this great industry!
