One is the highest rating I could give to this film, since zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Silence, meaningless confusion in the film with many lost actors from the list who did a better job, was written and directed by a guy with a mentality of twelve-year-olds who calmed down and giggled with stupid play games, and jokes for kake and farts. . For example, Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat from All in the Famili) character that tells Marilyn Henner's character to sexually "rocking both times" was a cheap attempt at humor that points to the general lameness of the movie ... Do you want a good, cheeky humor? Animal House, American Pie (only one part), Old school or office space.
