First, I have no idea how this movie came to the big screen. Not even a movie with low-budget SCI-Fi channels. Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. We went to see this film, expecting this film to me Transformers with dragons, a foolish party. All we got was a foolish hour and a half. The CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot was as horrible as the acting, he was compensating. Its basically a Chinese dragonfly foot that returns every 500 years ... Sounds like a good remake of the Rain of Fire? No, the shop tries to be deeper than it should leave not only plan holes, but also magic, and a very small real war between dragons (pretty big snakes) that gets ridiculous. The director tried to add a little humor to a film that collapsed. Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing (along with all 5 audiences), and I can not believe we spent money on it. A short trailer on TV compensates for most of the actions while shit makes up the rest. I've seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say that if you want an uninterrupted laugh at an hour, watch this. Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Actor: 3/10 <br /> <br /> <i> I do not drink ... but you would help me watch this movie
