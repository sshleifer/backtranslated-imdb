I love films about morally corrupted characters, but this was too much. The acting was not great, but that was not the real problem. The problem was the feeling of sinking that I got into the belly about 20 minutes of film. These characters were hollow. They did not have almost any depth, and the few that they had devoted to the cruelty they showed to each other in the form of friendship. Investigating the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give these characters the real personality, or are just cardboard cutouts. These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.
