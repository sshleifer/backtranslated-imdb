Maaan, where to start with this horrible movie. Bad bad bad stories. I do not know what the director was thinking when he was filming this movie. Namaste London was a pretty fun movie to be honest. But in this ... my good ... for a movie that should be music ... the songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman was supposed to be a music director. Given the two great actors, a much better job should have been done by the director. Although the first half is bullshit, the last 30 minutes of the movie is OK. The performances of Salman and Ajay keep the film out of total disaster. The last good Bollywood movie I've been watching (and watching them watch) is Dev D and Vake Up Sid.
