For some reason, various young couples walking through the Italian Alps have broken out to see who can get to their destination first. Gregory Lee Kenion enters the cave, finds the skeleton of the ancient demonic gladiator and becomes obsessed with the spirit of "Tirana" when he puts a helmet belonging to the corpse. Then he spent the rest of the film running around in the woods, hunting for his friends and hacking their limbs to add a little paprika to revive the deadly "Demonicus". This full month's release is stupid, meaningless, has a terrible acting and sound, and the National Forest (Los) Angeles is a bad substitute for Italy. However, it is quite high on the unintended scaling scale thanks to the predominantly performed performance. Regardless of whether it is a buggy about a cheap armor that waves the sword or pours out neurotic Latin nonsense about demons and resurrection, Kenion's funny facial expressions and unpleasant delivery lines must be seen to be believed. Well, at least not as boring as most other actors.
