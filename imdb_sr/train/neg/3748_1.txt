... but this just does not work and I'm surprised to see how many people consider it good. Based on what? There are some loose indications here and there, but the whole material is self-confident and unconvincing. Lynch's films are mostly intriguing because they create a sense of confusion, and yet they are very playful when they do it. There is some visual meaning, there are some backgrounds, characters, ideas, etc. But this is boring and yes, meaningless. For all that exists to be explored is either "small", or too stressed, or simply put it in a superior way. It's just Linch who is researching DV, nothing more than that should be treated like this. 1/10
