First of all, what's good in the movie? Some beautiful actress? exotic wallpaper? The fact that actors do not laugh while acting (I would do it if I was in their situation)? I do not know. The story is simple: a Catholic priest who works abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his little brother, a male prostitute (raped by a second priest while he was young ...). I'm afraid there is nothing here that can be learned or let little to think about serial killers, arts or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of "Profiler" (series) with substitute actors and incredible coincidences (uncle is a policeman who can have a child with a priest, etc., etc.).
