Let's get to the point: this movie is a softcore pornography that is being sold for masses under the name that the studio shakes every last penny from the American sucker. Period. The whole action (which should not mean that there is much to go around) serves as a vehicle for displaying more sucks and sexual scenes to the audience. If you are a Tveen guy, and you are too nasty to buy real pornography, then this is a movie for you. Otherwise, the film does not have much to offer. The act is a sub-pair, the character's development is practically nonexistent, and the story is a meaningless nudity, a drunkard and a joke (none of it is remembered). Go buy real pornography if that's what you want to see, and if not, watch a good movie. An animal house, children, or even original American pie are great cinematographic works, all of which contain heavy use of alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not as much as you use it"
