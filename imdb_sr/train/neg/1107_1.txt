I read the back of the box and talked about Marie Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Biron. I thought, "Wonderful! This will be great!" I was so wrong. The story was messed up. In fact, I still do not understand. It only seems to me that all the characters drank, smoked (opium?) And had sex. Not that they are not good movie quality, but please! Where's the story? I made myself to finish the movie, and yes, it was picked up at the end, but then the movie was almost over. Rent it if you really want. Just do not trust the back of the box.
