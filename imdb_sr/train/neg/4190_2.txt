I saw this movie a few months ago in a city that appeared as Greendale in the film, which is the only reason I went to see him. Another villager who was there just forwarded me an e-mail notification of a repeated display because he sold the first and people were rejected. His editorial comment in his progress is a good summary: <BR> <BR> "Auk." Unless you are fan Neil Ioung or you live in / near "Greendale" (if you later know the real name), skip this movie. It's mostly an ego journey for a filmmaker. There is no noticeable entanglement, music is just fine, and too many texts are incomprehensible, which prevents the tracking of what can be a bit of action. I do not need a spoiler warning because there is no surprise to surrender. I would give this 1.5 / 10, but it's just because of the fun value of watching the movie in the movie. It was not worth $ 6. I could rent a video camera and ride around "Greendale" and make a better movie. If you want to see a good movie about environmental protection-messages without complication, go to rent Koiaaniskatsi.
