the lowest possible result is one star? a pity. Actually, I'll lobby the IMDb for the "zero star" option. To give this film even one star too gives way. Am I the only one who noticed the microphone hanging over the head of the reservoir at the station? and the acting, or to say the lack of it? Obviously talent was not a factor when the director came to town. showing the talents of my little sister's primary school provides a greater range and depth of emotion. and those fake Irish accents were like nails on a chalk board. the only thing that could hurt this movie would be ... Oh, wait, no, no, it's already as bad as it can.
