The first lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) must know - only 'style' does not sell. I suppose that Tashan in the translation will mean a style. Secondly, if you are hellish in selling a style, it does not save you from a decent story. But it's not smooth. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshai - are narrators at different points of the story. But this setting is not used in the right way. There could have been a better combination and coincidence of their narratives. Action sequences were from the seventies. Cheoreographie film is terrible. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just slept through this movie. Vishal-Shekhar gave a good result but does not belong to this film. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not on Anil Kapoor when he is the one who is English crazy? Akshai Kumar is a film saving. But he is in his own stereotypical self. You will not mind this movie.
