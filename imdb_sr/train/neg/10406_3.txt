Warning: This review contains less spoilers. Well, the writers of the first Tremors are officially out of the idea. I am a big fan of the first movie, and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video. Tremors 4: Legends Begins is a very boring movie. Where are the hell Graboids? Due to the relative lack of Grabowi during the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry is in the series "Character Study". Unfortunately, there are no interesting characters in the film except the character of Billy Draga, which has too many lines, too little to do and at the end of too little time on the screen. What saved the 2nd and 3rd films was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. Whenever there was no action on the screen, you could be sure that Burt Gummer would be interesting to listen and / or watch. However, in this film Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute. On the plus side, when the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) on the screen look good, but it's just as good as it gets. I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed for 101 minutes. Pretty good for direct video. But after watching, I'm sure this movie is about 15 minutes long. For a long time, a dialogue that is boring and no longer goes on. Was there a rush to make this movie? I do not think it takes more time to spend on the script. I thought I hit the gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 that was packaged for sale with .... Earthquakes !!! How lucky I thought you pay for # 4 for free # 1. So after watching Tremors 4 I like to think that I paid for the original and got this mess free, I can not imagine paying a single dime for Tremors 4. For fans of the series it's best to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even exists. Quakes 4: Legend starts with 3 of 10 points.
