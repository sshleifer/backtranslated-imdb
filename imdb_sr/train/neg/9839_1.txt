The beginning of this film was good. It started to become really stupid after telling people that he wanted to kill himself. I think that if I came from a small town, I was offended when I saw this movie. Many of these people looked stupid and crazy. How could these people have so little to follow him all day long? Many times, these people told him how to kill himself as if they were being invited to do so. How many people can have little respect for other people? I also think they could have done a much better end for this movie. There were also good parts of this movie. Some people would like it, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
