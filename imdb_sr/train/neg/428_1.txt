Vov, a film about New York politics that was apparently written by someone who has never traveled to New York. You know there is a problem when at one point you expect that the credits will turn and the film will continue for another half an hour. The characters are boring, John Cousac's accent is ridiculous, and the plot coincides with the boring and ridiculous. Horror movie.
