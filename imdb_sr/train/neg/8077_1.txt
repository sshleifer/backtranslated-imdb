I've seen this movie a long time ago ... luckily it was free. I have to be one of perhaps twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I do not remember the whole crowd, but I remember it was incredibly bored, the action did not make any sense, and when I left the theater, the only thing I could say was, at least now I know what the worst movie ever saw. I was just incredibly disturbed by one thing: if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun enough low enough for people to survive, why can not they turn into a pleasant temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty? How much do we think we are stupid?
