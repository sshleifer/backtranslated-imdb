"Happi Go Lovely" has only two things to do with it. And these two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is the British (Ekcelsior Films) version of the M-G-M music complete with the second-order stars. I suppose Vera-Ellen took over this role, thinking that she could ultimately lead to the status of the main music star. But, I'm sorry to say, Mrs. Ellen's chance did not pay off. Opening with a terrible Scottish number and stumbling through a horrible dialogue to the next boring melody, this film looks very difficult to mess. The predictable wrong identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is far above the top in the role of producer) and Bobbi Hovez (who is completely lost in nothing), the rest of the cast is completely forgotten. Choreography is boring, but Ms. Ellen gives her everything. She has never been as famous as most other music stars (and should not be because she could not sing and even had a "dance stand" in several of her paintings.) But when she was dancing she was just terrible. It's a shame that her movie that could make her a star did not give her the tools needed for the brilliance. 4 of 10
