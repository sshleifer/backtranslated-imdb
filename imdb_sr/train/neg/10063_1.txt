Now I've never seen a bad movie in all my years, but what about the songs in a movie that has a physiological meaning. VOV has appeared some demon pokemon and they multiply and can get an attack from this. Animie it's meaningless that the producers are meaningless his big marketing plan looks just down to the songs and they will get a good rating and I think this movie would be fine if they posted a message that you have to see all of Pokemon's eyeballs understand what's going on and it's not Movie. It's just an animation that should be on the video. Ps: I will give 1 because I got 5 bucks and I could not give half because there are no halves.
