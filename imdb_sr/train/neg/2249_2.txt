This is a terrible catastrophe of the film. From beginning to end, it is filled with bad acting, and even worse direction and editing. The only redeeming parts of the film are several Streisand numbers, because Kristofferson's parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem of this film is that we have never seen Kristofferson's character at its peak or Streisand's character struggles. The first one should be in decline, and the other one should rise. The final Streisand number could have been one of the biggest finals in the film, if properly directed and edited. A single image of her face during the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. If the band, the audience and the broad footage of the stage were shown, this number could be dynamic and interesting. This film has to be directed and edited by a zero student film. Only worse can be a poor scenario. The final music number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even that it has completely failed due to wrong technical decisions.
