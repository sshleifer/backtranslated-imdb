15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the plays that captured the nation, especially the young. When I was a three year old kid living in the Philippines, I would watch this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 there). When the film came out in 1995, I was shocked and scared when I watched him with his dad and two uncle. My grandparents even sent me a "Balikbaian" box full of Powers Rangers stuff (including easy-to-use Megazord figures and stuffed toy Rangers). I even played video games and I loved only one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was really sad. In any case, it was a play that laid the foundation for my interest in a series of robots (especially anime mech series like "Gundam"). Now that I am 18, I would like to think that this show is pretty thin for me now. To prove this, I started on a journey through memory by purchasing a two-way DVD collection with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Pover Rangers Movie" and watched them both. I was like, "Uh, how terrible. Just another garbage in the attic for me." For all of you people of my generation, this is NOT a show that you would like to constantly watch. I'm not saying leaving him for the rest of his life, but sometimes it's not a bad thing, is it? Instead of Pover Rangers, I would recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam", "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja Robots), or even ORIGINAL Sentai shows that were the basis of the "Power Rangers".
