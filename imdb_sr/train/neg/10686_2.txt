Please, help the economy - spend money elsewhere! The film's synopsis: The first lady killed her husband because she cheated her. That's it. Not detected by anyone except Cuba and Angie, she designs and implements a huge conspiracy to murder, which no one knows ... and is completely free. President, Cuba rejects the shotgun ... which then enters the back of the president's head. Cuba and Angie watch a movie from the camera for news, and see ... a trail. They are trying hard to protect the film, believing that they are the only people who have a copy of this very public film. Cuba talks to a member of the presidential staff. PSM comments that there was no conspiracy. Cuba claims that there were more than one person. PSM then said the conspiracy involved FBI, CIA and NSA. God, I wonder if PSM is on. Ms. Archer, the first lady, is a craptacular artist. Cuba can not make a picture, and she says: "You're too close ... move away ... look from a different perspective, look from my perspective." Can someone miss this track?
