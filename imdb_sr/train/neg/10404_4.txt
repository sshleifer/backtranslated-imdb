This deadly rink from the Tremors series, which is transmitted directly to the video, contains sixty inspired seconds (a saw: you will know it when you see it) and more boredom and filler than you can shake a stick. Tremors 4 was clearly hit by a low budget. That means they only had enough special effects for three to four minutes of precious worms on human violence, peaks. Blistering, clich√©s and hacked writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of Tremors 4 experience is felt for at least fifteen thousand years. Only the hardcore fans of Tremors will be able to sit, and even less enjoy this movie. If you are not among them - do not be tormented.
