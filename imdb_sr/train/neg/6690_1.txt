I wanted to watch this movie with friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not low enough. Frankly, I could not say how this film was from watching, and if it was a comedy, humor was completely missed. The action did not exist and the acting was terrible. My friends and I have managed to look around 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and we immediately asked the video store to return it. I do not recommend this film to anyone unless you deliberately try to watch the worst movies of all time. Frankly, I do not know how this film lasted more than one day in theaters, and yet I do not understand why anyone would like to watch it, given not only an insatiable title, but also a lack of famous actors / actors in the film. This review is not a joke and I honestly think it could be the worst movie ever made. It's certainly the worst movie I've ever had to sit.
