My friends can usually handle many hopeless movies, but this one was too poor to even see it all the way. It was so boring and unoriginal. Even the "hot" girls who played in this movie could not watch me. Everything was just predictable and boring. The act was sometimes good ... but a lot of times bad. The most adorable character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die must be the main character of your best friend. The more I watched it, the more I wanted to break my screen. (you know what kind of fat ugly child I'm talking about) The action is made many times before I think that other film companies should sue them. All right, that's a good idea, but that's all this movie. All in all, this movie can be viewed only if I am, in order to save the abuse from your friends. Or, if you do not have absolutely nothing better.
