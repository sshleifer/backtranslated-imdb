My 10-year-old daughter, Alekandra, writes: I thought it was very boring, and I thought it was just repeating things from "101 Dalmatians". I could not wait for the end of the movie. The best part was loans at the beginning - they were cute and well done. The rest of the movie is not worth watching. Thank you.
