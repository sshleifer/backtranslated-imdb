This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the worst American slag; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in the US race par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and producer took huge amounts of recreational pharmaceutical products, and when they talked about the plot, they actually thought it was a good idea. it's not. It is a meaningless garbage from the very womb of Satan himself (who probably could have written a better script that he did it). Robert Jones as Ekce Producer, spending the money of our taxpayer (lottery) on this nonsense, should be responsible. Who on earth thought it would be good to make Deathline again? I'm asking you - a camp as a Christmas tree, a death line ... 'Mind the doors' is a classic of a really bad British film, we really do not need a reminder. And of course we do not need a poor, secondary, poorly scripted, poorly developed and bad piece of garbage like this one. All of this from a UK funding agency that brought us sex lives from potatoes ... I'm going to take my case away. It's absolute and ultimate shit - the only savings for manufacturers is to have a huge cash deposit ... our money ... to make it. He should shame his heads. I'm despised for the low, low standard of this movie. That's why our national film support authority actually thought it was worth the support. There is no hope for the British film industry while idiots are running the show. Harvei Vienstein where are you? Come back, we forgive you !!!
