Instead, the long dance sequences and the big plans of the characters that made the film withdrawn - the movie would be better served by explaining the story and motivation of the characters. The marginalization of Minister Nuba, Aunt, Mother - and dumbing down in the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between Hatsumo and Mameh and Hatsumo and Sauri made the film a lack of any real depth. If you had not read the book, you would not understand why Saiuri liked the president and why Mameha became her mentor at all. The visual film was stunning - and the actors did everything best with the C quick script they got, but that's all that was good in this movie.
