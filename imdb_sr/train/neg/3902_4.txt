This is truly God's adaptation of the novel Jane Austin. Compared to the American version of Guinneth Paltrow, the script is written so that it resembles the book most. But the acting was terrible. Except Kate Beckinsale, which I believe was the real Emma's picture in the book, all the other actors have tried too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" who was supposed to be. He was often rude and insulting, had no feelings, and during the whole movie you could not see his love "growing" for Emma in general. This has had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seems to be trying to "make up" her leading role, as well as her partner. Moreover, there was no chemistry between the whole composition. Hariett Smith, starring Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rovan. So she did not seem to have broken hearts as she was shown in the book. Movie settings are too bad. The costumes are even more. I would imagine Emma Voodhouse dressing in the more modern and elegant way she works here. The ending is too long. It's good that it's similar to the end of the book, but it's the killer that ends up for the movie. And again, I do not see any sense of happiness in Mr. Knightley's face. To conclude, I believed that this adaptation was a loyal book, but with the poor actors. It seemed that the film was made without any budget. I'd like to see the "easier" version with Paltrow and Northam, even if it's clear that it was made to be a "blockbuster", but to watch these actors (other than good Olivia Villiams and better Kate Beckinsale) to destroy the whole script .
