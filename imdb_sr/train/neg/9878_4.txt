There was a lot of love that was put into "Fantastic Mr Fock" by Vesa Anderson, unfortunately all love is for itself. However, there have been plenty of time and effort invested in creating this self-aware strange universe, but only the same time and efforts have been invested in the script to try to make it funny. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and it's best that Ves Anderson could come up with. Animation is good in large animal plans, but when the camera is still getting really sharply on the eyes and be perfectly honest looks like a mess. There was nothing special about acting, when Ves decided to choose his friends and great names through several specialized actors who could make the movie better. I'm pretty sure that the story of the actress George Cloonei consists of two performances in South Park, one of them playing a dog. The film is too complacent and difficult to be smart and it's different and usual, despite the fact that the movie is set up in England, all good animals are typical Americans who play baseball, while the bad guys are stereotypical English with the most offensive English accents. I can not emphasize how much it's a waste of time. I did not laugh once.
