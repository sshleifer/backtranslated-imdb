Someone could probably make a big documentary about Jerry Springer Shov, but this fiction version only succeeds in exhausting everything that is authentic and interesting from the trash-TV phenomenon. There are dozens of well-known bad films (eg "Manos: The Destiny of Destiny") that show more creativity and spirit than this gloomy, mindless film loss. Seriously, why not a documentary about Jerry Springer Shov, who would start answering some real questions: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show? How's mayor Cincinnati found himself here? One good line: During the "orientation" for the guests: "People, I can not emphasize this enough: WE HAVE NO SURFACE!"
