Will you know the secret? This movie is bullshit. Actually, I do not know, because if you allow yourself to indulge in plagiarized versions of original movies, you may find this film staggering (this film is a plagiarized copy I know what you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the film are based on a typical story setting; a bunch of so-called cool teenagers who enjoy a holiday in Florida and behave themselves as if they were minors. The only insight we get at this moment is the degree to which the director has managed to illustrate the pretentious feeling of adolescent decadence in characters. The second half hour of the film gets a little momentum and begins to illustrate the start of unprecedented murders unprecedented. The third half hour of the film will definitely remain a mystery because I turned it off before I could further blame myself for thinking that the movie might have something else interesting and originally left to show up. As for the story, it can be easily explained in several lines. A bunch of teenagers leave for Florida on vacation. As they get busy, they slowly (and I mean, slowly) start to die because they know some kind of silly secret. The only thread of killing is that all victims were the matrices of a common high school. One thing that fascinated me about this movie, however, was how much Betty (I'm not sure about her blonde) looks like Reese vitherspoon. Another thing that stunned me about the movie was that it made me several times to jump from the seat. Is it an artwork? absolutely not because my twelve-year-old niece forced me to drop a glass of orange juice because she "popped me" when I just wanted to go through the door of the dining room .. ???? Want to know the secret? I'm not sure about you, but I do not know.
