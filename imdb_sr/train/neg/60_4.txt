I love Goldie Havn and I wanted another one of her movie, so when I saw the $ 5.50 protocol in Valmart I bought it. Although slightly fun, the film never hit. Some scenes, such as a fun scene in the bar, take too long and do not really have a purpose. Then, of course, there is a scene at the end of the movie, which gives the whole story a movie bad bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I do not think this scene has been added to the movie at all. I do not like a stupid comedy trying to teach me a lesson written by some '60s, especially burnt out! ' I'm sure it's really worth the money I paid for it!
