I will be honest. The only reason I watched this on TV was that it was at the bottom of the 100th. And right now, I wonder if an hour and a half of my life really was worth another "check" on the same list. > Van Damme was Luc Deverauk, who was in great combat with Universal Soldiers after the main computer pulled out the "HAL" to defend himself. And that, after all the required explosions, shootings and seizures, he is the last to stand. Combined with a horrible act and a somewhat boring setting, she is sure that this place is only on the sham list. Just for idiots like me who want to watch this list. 2/10.
