I love Dracula, but this film was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula films since I was younger, and I thought it was great, but this movie was really bad. I do not know if my youth deceived me to believe that Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with style, appearance, attraction and evil below it. Or maybe this movie disappointed me. But can you imagine Dracula with a snobbish English accent and the language of the body that will follow him? Do you like when the shop contains unrealistic choices by characters and is boring and lacks any tension ..? Then this is a movie for you! Otherwise - you can not see! I gave her only 2 because I somehow managed to stay awake during the whole movie. I'm sorry, but if you liked this movie, then you had to be without a dream and home alone in a dark room with a lot of unfinished space behind you. Maybe I'm in the house of your parents or strangers. Because even the characters in this film were not scared, and I think it sums up the whole thing. Or do you like this movie because of his place in the cinema of the history of Dracula, perhaps fascinated by how the Dracula Story evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. For as the film is not so attractive, it does not pull you into a guiding mystery that makes my Vampire myth so fascinating. Moreover, there are so many that they feel about it. The landscape looks like a cheap theater. And I'm not saying that it was the rejection of everything that was made in the 70's. Because I can love the old movie as well as the new one.
