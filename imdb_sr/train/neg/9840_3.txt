Unusual, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater - all these are the raves that made me expect an hour to "discover" the jewel of the film. Man, I was disappointed. Julian Po never crosses over. The film is mercilessly self-conscious. I'm incapable of stopping for a moment the disbelief. Excessive, obviously theater sets, over-dramatic, obviously theater performance, excessive, obviously theater directing - well, you realized. Algorithms do not have to be delivered with sleds. And it's hard to feel something for Julian Poe because we never know much about him. A funny girl, boring locals, an idiot priest, brotherly children - why would anyone, especially anyone with a life-long ambition to reach the sea (Slater's character), decide to stay in such a sad place?
