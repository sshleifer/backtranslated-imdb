I'm sick and tired of all these little things about how this movie "rocking". It's a pure CG, a super-CRAP! Do not send the killer, it's far more prudent to smuggle hundreds of bright, aggressive, poisonous snakes on the plane! The only reason people prefer this movie is because they feel they have to. It's not "so bad that it's good," it's so bad that I'd rather be pushed with a sharp stick and then again subjected to this. I honestly thought that there would be COMEDI as AIRPLANE! A spoof! Did I make a mistake? That's the whole "Shit, understand!" Or Samuel A. Jackson shouts: "Snake on the planet! Well, I'm sorry, I do not understand. It looks like a bunch of vimps gave the film industry more money to make more movies like Triple Ks and Die Hard. If you have what you spend money to watch a movie in a company the same people who bought the CD Villiama Hunga, you still live in your mother's basement, and stink on a plastic sweat chair from day on your computer playing online games and watching pornography, hurry to the theater and ask for one (because I doubt you have a girlfriend) a ticket to Snake on a stupid plane. Damn it with the movies such as Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. The real decline in the Western civilization, calling it a cult film, is an insult to real classical cults such as the Repo man, or even Orgazmo.
