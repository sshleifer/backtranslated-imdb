With this ABC family attempt to hit the blockbuster hit "cheaper by a dozen" comes an unfavorable amount of tattered dialogue, shallow drawing lines and cheesy returns. With about two good actors among many desires, this film was a great disappointment. That's Hollivood-vannabe's ditto already badly complicated. Then, because they needed a lot of actors, it meant they would probably be milder. So the acting was not five stars. The action took place quite quickly, and the contours were bad and had a terrible timing. The combination of characters and "extreme relationships" for me were also too gigantic and clich√©. Respect yourself and rent something better.
