By the number of video productions I have not seen before, this small pile of garbage appeared on my list "rent" when I saw it available. The space includes a fashion model or something that was kidnapped and taken to the jungle to keep him ransom for the gravel crew of idiots. Some other stupid person is hired to return and receive a money bag that will be used as a hit, but if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He brought a helicopter and a pilot with him, and that pilot is one of the worst actors of EVERYTHING! Of course, they are all terrible and dubbing will make you cry blood. After theft in the jungle, we find out that near is the cult of a human body whose deity of a bogus country walks through the forests like the human king of the Congo in search of women who want to devour and devour. This guy is just naked guy with some of the worst lipstick ever, ping-pong balls and it's pretty much. His horns and grips are an ubiquitous feature on the soundtrack, and I found out that I humiliated many of these scenes. Oh, am I forgetting to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason why this film is forbidden, although there is one specific scene, about one second long, where God attacks an girl and pulls out her guts, but this is not a factor of redemption for lovers of the mountains. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows long, long plans for female genitalia, and, unfortunately, a man. So, if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation, you got it. I can not recommend anyone this garbage to anyone. It's not even a good bad movie. It's just a cruelly lit garbage that only the Video Nasti viewer will probably look at, and even then, if you break through the list, leave this for the rest. If you look at it first, you can understand that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
