I am among the millions that are considered to be Cara Grant fans, but I can not recall any reason to recommend this film. I do not understand throwing Betsi Drake and it seems that no one else is, if we want to Judge for a small number of films in which she later acted. Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was great in hunting and catching Cari Grant in Bringing Up Babi. The idea, or unsuccessfully read it. I read the comments on how Drake was "creepy", but I thought it was a too mild description. Franchot Tone went through this like it was a bait. The catastrophe is one thing. This film is a total disaster. This does not deserve 10 rows of comments and I do not know that this is preserved when so many valuable films were lying in vaults. Unless you want to torture someone, give him a broad bond.
