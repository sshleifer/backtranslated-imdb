The words I can not describe how this film is extremely unpleasant. It's a series of random, awkward clips of everything, from the stupid Batman pods to the guys who deal with the old dead lady (REALLY disturbing). The only fun thing about the movie of the underground comedy is watching Joei Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. Also, NC-17 is rated, rejecting the only people who can tolerate it.
