First, there are some good things about this movie, but it's all cliches slasher things in combination with a teen movie. In advertising this film, which I saw, the big accent was on the fact that Denise Richards is in this, but she is a poor actress, and not so good as people are trying to get out of it (not that has anything to do with the movie ). And what about that view that gives it to everyone? Maybe it's part of the character, but as I said, acting ... Still, writing is fine. You know who it is all during the film, and you can almost anticipate what will happen, but not in an irritating manner. I think the book on which it's based is probably good, judging by the line of complications, but next time I will read the book to find out, not to watch this.
