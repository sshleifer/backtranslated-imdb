SCHIZOPHRENIAC: VHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you collect a bunch of non-talented people to make an "extreme" horror movie. Any acting, production, story, FKS, etc. ... come out of the window in an attempt to create a "shock-value". Do not misunderstand me - I consider myself a "shocker" movie connoisseur, and sleazier / gorier / nastier the better - but it is still nice to see some kind of talent of SOMEONE involved in the film. SCHIZOPHRENIAC records the life of Harry Russoa - a drug-dependent freak who takes orders to kill himself from his doll, Rubberneck. He goes on a few walks by killing whores and other random people, and screaming how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (these are "whores" for those of you who do not say New York ...) and how he wants to rape them in his ass. There are several bad scenes of necrophilia, very little blood and some nudity to mix things up - but nothing you did not see in a better movie ... The only thing that redeems can be found in this retarded movie often (unintentionally ?) Hilarious shouts from our main man, Harry. He continues and continues to want to kill everyone and make them in his ass, and it really becomes quite comical after a while. In fact, I am almost tempted to believe that there should be some homo-erotic sub-theme about this film, with all the stories about the ass and Harry's constant shots running around with his hanging dong. To be honest, this joker is somewhat more in this movie than a few chickens showing some T-and-A (and some full frontal, for a good measure). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is slightly fun as one hour, but I really can only recommend it to those who want to say that they watched a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE VHORE MANGLER. To be honest - the title, far - is the best thing about this garbage ... Generous 3.5 / 10
