Not only is this film "a new lesson in bad taste", but a lesson in a "real bad movie". Do not misunderstand me, I appreciated the concept of 'Zombie '90: Ectreme Pestilence', but at the same time you have to understand when the movie is horrible. In case you missed the story, the Zombie 90 plot is about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that so happen to crash into the wild, causing the spill of chemicals, turning the local population into zombies that look terrible. The next thing you know, zombies are everywhere in a city that eats people, while the doctor and government agent are trying to understand the disease that people eat each other - hence the name "Extreme Plague". Since then, all we see are zombies that have a day in the field at every local in the sight - nothing but extreme and disgusting cleavages and dismemberments followed by infinite bowels of womb and blood. Since this is a German film, the film had to be synchronized to English and when you are not allowed to feed the frenzied zombies, the voices are quite funny and fun. As UnratedKs user mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the film that crosses the boundary between what is acceptable and unacceptable, therefore the scene in which a woman carrying a newborn is transported around in her wheelchair from some The types and hordes of zombies come from nothing and attack them. A zombie catches a baby and takes it to pieces, eating its organs while you hear the baby crying. Wow, this is a new lesson in REALLLLLLLLLI. Bad taste. I'm terribly telling you, horrible.
