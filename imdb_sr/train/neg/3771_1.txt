This must be one of the worst movies of the nineties. When my friends and I watched this movie (as the target audience to which it was directed), we just sat and watched the first half hour, while our jaws touched the floor as it was really bad. The rest of the time, all the others in the theater began to talk to each other, leaving or generally crying in their popcorn that they really paid the money they had previously worked to watch this bad excuse for the movie. She must have looked like a great idea on paper, but in the film it seems that no one in the movie has any idea what's happening. Nonsense, nonsense. I can not figure out how embarrassing this is to watch. Save yourself an hour and a bit of your life .........
