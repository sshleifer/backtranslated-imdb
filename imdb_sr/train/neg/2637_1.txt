Seriously, I do not know where to start. It was as if someone gave a $ 1 billion autistic third grade budget and said, "Make me a secret service movie." The arrangement was ridiculous, the cinema was at best casual, every style of dialogue was completely retarded and directed ... well, was there a director? Everything was so absurd, crazy and meaningless ... and by accident ... and lame. Here is the SPOILER; this movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see. However, if you liked this piece, you will also enjoy; Resistance, dark blue and partial lobotomy.
