That's not my fault. My girlfriend made me look at him. There is nothing positive to say about this movie. For many years now, there is an idea that Madonna can act, but she can not. For years, there was the idea that Gui Ritchie was an excellent director, but he's only central. Every shame. <br /> <br />
