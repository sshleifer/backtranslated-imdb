Um ... Okay, I guess I got the whole shooting technique, but unfortunately I think Gorilla could make a better movie ... This thing was just a total mess from the beginning. Poor acting, bad directing, bad story and horrible cinema. As this piece of garbage is released I will never find out, but unfortunately I was watching. Filmed at a Tennessee location by the director of Greg Swinson and Ryan Tiensen (Harry and Lloyd), "Five Across The Eies", I suppose it should look like a Blair Vitch, but it's short ... Ok that nose dives with cliffs. In fact, I was embarrassed by these young women, for whom I am sure they were promised Hollywood stars, but they ended up in this crowd. The dialogue is ridiculous and actually makes you worse while listening. How it should be a horror movie is another mystery, because there is nothing terrible, except for the fact that I watched it ... Try this for size: There are 5 you and 1, doing math and beating ... "End". Unfortunately, it took another 95 minutes of nonsense ... I saw it for free, and I wanted to return my money.
