This movie was interesting ... I had to watch it at the university about India, but the synopsis tells you that this movie is one thing when it does not contain much cold, hard information about these details. It's not true for the synopsis down to the very end, where they are strenuously trying to bind all the elements together. However, the factor above is excellent. Even at the very beginning, you want to distract the view, because the blood is quite intense. Watch this movie only if you want to see some cool ones, because the plot is slim and will make you sad that you will lose time listening to it. I've seen rumors on other sites that this movie is based on true events, but you can not find any information about it online ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.
