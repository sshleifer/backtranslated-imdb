I was a big fan of Linn Peterson since her breakthrough role in 1988's "Far North", and although I loved her in her second film "Slov" (2004) where she plays "Francis," this is by far the biggest role. Linn, as I'm sure everyone knows (or needs), plays the key role of "drivers". Unfortunately, the second of Linn's incredible performance, I'm afraid that this movie really does not have much to do with it. . Remarkable lines like: "You, son-pistol!", "Ti-witches!", "Shoot!", And "Well, Forget!" O.K. Hello. P.S.: Does anyone know where I can get another poster Linn Peterson?
