I just did not get this movie ... Was it a musical? No ... but there were choreographies of songs and dances ... Was it a serious drama ... not the acting was good enough for it. Is Vhoopi Goldberg a quality serious actor .. Definitely not. I had the difficulty to stay awake through this unrelated movie. The message of apartheid and "honor" to students who died during student harassment is known. But, as a party, it was very bad, and as a documentary-style movie it was even worse. Make sure for yourself, but I honestly hated it
