He had all cliche movies of this type and no content. The action did not go anywhere, and at the end of the film I felt like a watch for watching. Production was good; however, the script and acting were B-film quality. Casting was poor, because good actors mixed with stupid actors. The good actors did not hold or raised others. This film is not worth the word, but I will say more to meet the minimum ten-line requirement. James Wood and Cuba Gudding, the younger ones play themselves in other films. If you are looking for a foolish party, I would still not recommend this movie.
