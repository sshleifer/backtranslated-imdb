romance without feeling, drama of questions without point (or drama) ... This film should be all this and does not work on every account, as if it were not trying. Or as if the director / editor / script team is not trying. Actors are capable - they need better support. One of the elements that does not collapse is the result of George Delarue. It's beautiful and moving. What kind of damage is related to this movie. In a good movie, words and movements of actors and music synchronize and amplify the influence. This editor rocked music regardless of dialogue and movement. The love scene is particularly fierce in this regard: insulting the talents of leading actors. There is another element in the film that works: photo location. Especially one moment at the Grand Central Station. I figured in advance what would happen; but how it was captured in that environment took a breath. Some commentators in this committee have pointed out that the American assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists really happened during these years frightened MacCarthy. As soon as the film begins to look seriously in American society, it turns into a conventional romance; before any human feelings can move us, it is distant at the (foreseeable) 'thriller' of the escapade. take it. You are warned.
