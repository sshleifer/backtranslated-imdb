This film is self-satisfied. Watch this movie if you just want to hear a spoken gaelic or enjoy a pleasant sound background. Look for some other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be charming, but not - just irritating. It's hard for the artists to worry and the acting is bad. The stories in the film are also charming and evil. I expected my family film to warm up, but it did not affect my fourteen-year-old daughter. Rarely when I can not see the movie until its conclusion, but this one got better than both of us. Although the movie set at the present time has the look and feel of a cheap East European film shot during the Cold War. There is not even enough ways to redeem the beautiful Scottish landscape and cinema. It's a real shame, because the film is a shame for Scotland.
