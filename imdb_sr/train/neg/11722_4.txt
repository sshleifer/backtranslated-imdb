Problem with CONTRACTER is summarized in the introductory scene. The CIA wants a dead international terrorist and contact the black killer James Dial. Terrorists appear in the Old Bailey yard in London, which raises the question of why they want to reject a terrorist if they spend the rest of their lives in prison? It will be out of circulation anyway. Does not the CIA have a chance before being arrested? If he accidentally gets a non-guilty verdict, then kill him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who will spend life in jail with maximum security. As the room sets the story, the audience can choose to ignore the hole on the land, but the task is to pour fuel Fire. The pickup agent is killing a police bullet and a taxi ride in a crash, but Dial is able to escape. So, the police was close enough to kill somebody, but too far to catch someone from a collision? A film about this type of plot. Later, Dial found a police inspector who pointed his gun at him saying, "This airport is surrounded by armed policemen," but Dial manages to escape easily without explanation. The whole film is cheating on its audience, relying on things that are never explained. This includes an important support character called Emili Dai. Why does Dial help, although he is a wanted refugee? Your assumption is as good as mine. This is a pretty bad thriller and do not accept it as a "great-name" actor. Veslei Snipes qualified for the film star, but he killed his career in acting in an increasing number of incoherent films. Charles Dance also appeared in major Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3, but again he is best known for having appeared on DVD on these days, and he essentially plays the role of humor. Lena Headei likes to become a great player in the cinema, but she certainly will not be able to put CONTRACTER on her resume
