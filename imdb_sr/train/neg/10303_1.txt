*** Comments were contained by spoilers *** I was barely holding these shows as a TV set when they started boring music under EVERY SCENE, when Don Epps averaged almost a shot on the case when apparently pregnant Diane Farr was pregnant (but we did not notice ) and when Colby was an af ***** g TRIPLE agent. But now, in the evening episode, David is captured by a paranoid, crazy business that is an OBIENT amateur with a gun, in the elevator, and ... CAN NOT DISCUGE IT. A trained, experienced field agent who has been through the door for the first time many times and has experience in hand-to-hand combat, CAN NOT MAKE NUT JOB. No, when that fiery business flashes, it turns its eyes, throws its head, closes its eyes; even when looking into the optical wire around the ceiling rolling around the ceiling as a stripper for 20 seconds. Then came the scene that told me how much I like to learn from Chubbi, frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy assistant / love interest Amita, my Friday night will be better spent differently engaged. Don gives David a "trouble" that the code for "S ** t is ready to drop"; David is ready, kills the lights, puts up an elevator, scares the job and ...... David CAN NOT DISCARD / MAKE / WIN THE JOB JOB. The bad guy ends up with both pistols, David ends the SHOT. I am finished. I hope NUMB3RS is fun.
