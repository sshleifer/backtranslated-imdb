This film talks about a family trying to reconcile with the death of a mother / woman moving to Genoa, Italy. focus. The film consists of a collection of scenes that show the everyday life of the family, such as swimming, piano lessons, or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are superfluous and tired, totally unsuccessfully emotionally attracting viewers. The end is very disappointing because it is not spectacular, mobile or emotional. I can say with certainty that I am disappointed and boring by "Genoa". The only thing good in the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of the Genoa. "Genoa" can serve as an extended tourist advertisement for the city, but not as a movie to be enjoyed.
