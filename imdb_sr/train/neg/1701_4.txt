The rough and coarse drawing of David Linch at South Park presents us a nightmare of worrying cliches about middle-class families in suburban settlements. The father is a disgusting monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular hole from which the most terrible throaty sounds are pronounced, the son and mother are constantly horrified, incoherent creatures that are terrorized by a way of life. Numerous equally absurd characters are presented through the series. Linch is not famous for his comedies (ie in the air, the aspects of the Wild in the heart), and I do not like comedy in general. . However, there were several scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh at me. There are several clever parts of animated cinema - where Linch transmits a wide range of reactions in his characters through a syntactic schedule of images, as opposed to facial expressions (which never differ in Dumbland). I believe that Lynch was really trying to give his audience a real, but disturbing, animated comedy. Interestingly, he chose to follow the footsteps of the recent wave of an ultra-low-headed (ie, most of Villar Farrell's films), adding elements of vicious social critique and classical cartoon violence and gross humor. Although the mix does not work very well here, it's nothing if Linchian is not. Worth to see Linch fans.
