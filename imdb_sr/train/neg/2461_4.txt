Probably there are more people who fear dentists than, say, small monsters or puppets that look scary. Which makes him the perfect subject for a horror movie, really. Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years, but when he seizes his wife as he cheats him with a pajash, he brings his anger and frustration to his job. Well, give a crazy dentist a drill and mouth, and you probably can guess what will happen again ... As I said, a great idea, but it's not delivered as needed. In particular, the ending is a huge descent. Last note: watch Mark Ruffalo (You can count on me, the Eternal Sun ...) in this. 5/10.
