This movie is so bad that it vomited me. Poorly produced, complete free zone. Why would you put on a film in God's name a film that is to some degree a falsehood (and that's ridiculous)? The sets are ridiculous, the effects are so bad that they are not even funny, and the acting Farce. It's completely a mystery why you would even consider watching this garbage group. The National Lampoon was once made by the Animal House, which people still consider completely and utterly funny. They are now being pushed to make TV films like this cube ****. Call your explosives, and could be used exactly to describe this movie.
