During the Civil War there were many cases of loyalty divided; Obviously, many appeared "in the border states," where North met southern with the coincidence of geography. From the border, young Owen Moore's father goes to join the Union of the Union. Soon, the Confederate soldier Henry B. Valthall, separated from his regime, wanders on enemy property, desperate for water; he finds supplies in which the young daughter of Unionista Gladis Egan sits. When the Yankees find him, Mala Gladis innocently helps the Confederation hide. Later, when he returns to kill his father, the kindness of a little girl is remembered. Cute, little story by the director D.V. Griffith. Location snapshots and humanity are shown with love. **** In the border countries (6/13/10) D.V. Griffith ~ Henri B. Valthall, Owen Moore, Gladis Egan
