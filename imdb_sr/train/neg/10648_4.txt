Completion of Veissmuller Tarzan films is rather weak. There are several things that disturb this movie. First, Tarzan spends most of the film in sandals. In my opinion, any footwear on Tarzan, whether it be sandals or boots, as it is sometimes displayed, takes away the character that should be anti-civilization and pro-jungle. Secondly, the character Benji, as mentioned in the previous post, completely turns film from film as a comic film. For me, his character is unnecessary for the action of the movie. Also, while Veissmuller continues to dismiss a commanding officer like Tarzan, it is obvious that he was not in the best shape. Although in his later films from Jungle Jim, his body has improved somewhat in this film. his physical peak. Likewise, the battle, which lasts only 30 seconds, would be much more exciting if it was pulled out for 90 seconds to 2 minutes as the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and his Mate. Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Kristijan as Mara are very pleased with the eye, does not manage to save this latest Veissmuller film - disappointing the ending of a great character.
