This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi movies. I'm used to see gray CGI stains and amateur special effects like large false blood plans, which makes it obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other variant of syrup. However, I thought I saw all the possible falls that the Sci-Fi channel could hit. Then I saw this movie. Imagine a hand in a rubber syringe syringe? These are the main alien vampires in this movie. You can clearly see your fingers in rubber socks. The story comes out of the womb of the victims, and a Vampire who is on a vampire hunting team can talk with these rubber socks in Transylvania. How did the alien vampires learn Transylvania? And is not Transylvania in Romania? Should not they speak Romanian? Why should a town have its own language? If you can stop the reflecting reflex and pass alongside the rubber sockets they speak, the fingers move clearly in the alien heads; then you have to deal with other alien vampires. There are "Leatherfaces" that like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are only ugly ugly ones, all of which seem to have many scars on their face. Then there are boring Dolina girls and their guys who are human traitors and spin in space colonies, so they can sabotage defense systems so that these space vampires can attack. Finally, if you think the above is funny and worth laughing, you have to deal with the third rating of the TV Rejection Network that make up this team of stereotyped angry heroes who are constantly fighting each other. Why should almost every movie from the Sci-Fi channel have to use the main characters that are boring, abrasive, rough or simply totally impolite? I found myself hoping to beat rubber socks.
