Well, I hated a knock, I despised a 40-year-old virgin, and this little gem is a worthless piece of garbage. Do yourself a favor, and skip. I admit, I do not like the actors in this movie, and after my 18-year-old son showed me the DVD cover, I was like, "I would not love this movie," but on his insistence, I decided to try, unfortunately. About two minutes in the film I turned it off, I was so insulted. It's just disgusting. any decent person would be offended by the dirt in this movie. Call me old-fashioned, but pushing your kitten with your juicy hand in the face of your friend so that he knows you've got something is above the line of authority, in my opinion. Yeah, so this ugly little movie starts, and I can only imagine getting worse from there. another real winner for Mr. Rudd. I bet he is proud of the blow. Imagine that you can only get useless roles like him, would you stay in movies? despite paying, I would not. I should know better; next time.
