Wow! This movie is really terrible. I can not imagine how anyone could read this badly written script and give it a green light. Actors are equally second-rate with some really terrible performances from almost all actors. The story is fragmented, fragmented and unconnected. Story, lead and predictability. No wit, no charm, no humor. Not the least sexy. The characters remain flat as a pancake. There is also a strong current of misogyny that has become increasingly severe for the stomach as the film continues. When your footprint (Carrell) is immortal and unattractive, it's uphill. In spite of a falsified turn that ends up where love overcomes lust, I have a sickening feeling in my stomach. If that's what goes for humor and social comment then we are definitely doomed to failure.
