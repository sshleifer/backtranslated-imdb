My wife and I rented this movie because some people pulled parallels between it and Office Space. Blockbuster and IMDB even had the "recommended" option if you liked "Office Space". Like it. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witty, funny and with characters that remind me of the people I've been working with for years. "Haiku tunnel" is similar to "office space" in both films. There is a similarity here. We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of HT, giving him the benefit of suspicion, hoping not, * praying that it would be better. It's not. We could no longer take it and stop the tape. Thank God it was a free hire. I would be p *** ed, that we really paid for it. We should be compensated for having to sit. Now, since we have not seen the end, it may be miraculously collected and redeemed. I doubt. Haiku tunnel is so bad that it's hard to believe it's ever produced. The film is so inconvenient that he's sick. Just send a friggin letter already !!! The premise is dark. Jokes are terrible. We came to the scene "The printer does not work" and had to stop. We can not stand it anymore. This film is IMPROVED for Josh Kornblut. If you are a lover of office space ...... do not waste time with this shit. 0/10
