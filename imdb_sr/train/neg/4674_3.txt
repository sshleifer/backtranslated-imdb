I do not know who is to blame, Miss Leigh or her director, but her performance as Catherine is almost impossible to watch. Ben Caplin, on the other hand, does the supreme work - as far as I'm concerned. His character is completely charming and attractive. but certainly not shown as sufficiently greedy to deal with the stupidity of Leo's character. Chaplin seems confused by what can not be understood as Leigh's shyness and lack of grace, but her orthopedic insecurity. There must be some element of conviction in his interest, but he is incomprehensible. Performances do not match. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, beautiful despite all the efforts to get them. The carrier is also a pleasure to watch. Damage, too, does not work together because production is nice to look at.
