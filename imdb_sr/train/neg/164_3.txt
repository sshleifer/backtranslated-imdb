I'm not a big fan of Star Trek, but I was happy about it. I was intrigued by Pre-Hyipe's description of Enterprise, its cramped-submarine style and rough technology compared to the Treks we were accustomed to. I have not seen anything interesting in this pilot. I think the plot was intricate and confusing. I admit that I liked some of the characters - descriptions of people as 'adolescent' types ready to grow their british were fun. And this Vulcan baby had an incredible stand. But I do not think I'll be hooking up for this series. br /> 3/10
