I bought this film on blu-ray because it promised great pictures and music. I was also a big fan of a similar film ... Barrack. The film was largely shaped after Barake, wide angles, very similar recordings with cameras set to record a long time in every recording. Even some scenes were identical (traffic street). While Baraka had told a great story, opposing the nature, the human environment, the spirituality, and the horror of the world in a fascinating fashion and great music, this film just jumped from a shot into the shot without a comprehensive story, the central music party, and then. ... POO, it's over! I thought there must be some mistake! History of the world? Half the film is Egypt and landscape (it looks like Arizona, but I did not try to check it out). Seriously people, this is terrible, rent it if you need it, but do not buy it. Film makers should be ashamed of what they have said.
