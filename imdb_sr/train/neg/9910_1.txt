One of the worst movies ever. It's not funny, bad TV cinema, bad acting. It's sad to see so many famous old actors who can barely walk, let alone act. The main female Nancy Ioung can not act. Awesome direction. Compliant with bad TV movies. Casual bad jokes are falling. Even the basic premise of the film makes no sense. Somehow they had to stop the wedding, but there was no logic behind their actions. Slow speed forced my wife to stop looking, but I suffered it. Elders should behave as if they were young and aggressive, but it turns out to be pathetic, not funny. How did they get the money to do this?
