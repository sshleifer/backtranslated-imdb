this film had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck did not seriously try to act in any way, in shape or form. He was sucking. Nothing about the movie was convincing. The first problems were in the introduction to which a man gives everything that is worthy of Santa Claus from the Salvation Army, but that does not show why. And then Grandma keeps her head in the oven - she's really pretty, and she has absolutely nothing to do with the movie - even in the same tone as the movie. There was no explanation for the motivation that Ben Affleck would choose the house he chose; there were no convincing reactions of the family he chose; and people are there and there fussed for no reason to swing them (For example, the characters Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck go down the slope down the steep slope - this is an incident that suddenly fell in love with him. Riiiight ...) Anyway, he was one funny moment or two, but they were rare in the movie. Another rewriting is seriously needed (or 4). I hope you enjoy!
