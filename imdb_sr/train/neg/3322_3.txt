Unfortunately for me, the first movie of Busby Berkeley I've ever seen was "42nd Street". Then I expected all of his things to be so good. I learned that this is not necessarily the case, even here, with my favorite actor of the classical age, James Cagney. The story is like many others and quite tedious. It seems to always involve screaming, unfortunate producers. In this film, Cagnei is the one who screams so often that after a while he gives a headache, and his character is slim ... quick! 42. streets, classes, songs that you can do for years - decades, I should say. The songs in this movie are not unforgettable. No, this is one of the few early Cagnean movies - and Berkeley movies - I do not really like it and I was very disappointed as I watched.
