I know I'm in a minority, but ... Uwe Boll is talented as a frog. Not even a frog; just a frog. He resembles hundreds of other hackers without talent who throw away one useless shit after another. This film? It's a shit-fest. Slater's talent is minimally exploited, which leads him to believe that he has other things (such as his unsuccessful attitude) in mind. Reid performs as though she had forgotten her acting classes, was severely hit in the head and made to forget her lessons from acting, or has one of the worst directors in the history of the film. I vote for the third choice, yes, although the other two are always possible. Uve Boll has never done any single thing that I've pulled out and least satisfaction. Frankly, I am pleased that this stinker was made. I was worried that Bloodraine compete with Undervorld: Evolution for ticket sales. Now I'm sure that Len Viseman has nothing, and I think NICE, to take care of it. This is a rating of 1.0 / 10 for this messy, tricky shit, from ... / / The Fiend :.
