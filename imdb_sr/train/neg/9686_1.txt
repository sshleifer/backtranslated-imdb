Writer / director Peter Greenavai quotes his title as the High Master of the Artistic House of the Search with his latest exercise in the disgusting self-giving, 8½ Women. The film follows the rich Englishman and his son on their joint quest for sexual pleasure, as they attract and blacken women (guess how many of them) to join their own personal collection of concubines. this premise might be insulting, and the chances are that Greenavai will do it. Female characters are a bit more than a fetish catalog for which two protagonists participated. There are Cabo-obsessed Mio, all pregnant Giaconda and Beril, who have something for farm animals. Giulietta has no legs and uses a trolley, she's "half of women," you understand? Greenavai falsely denies any accusations for misogyny, but if it is not, then what is it? -vrstan (but less sexist) 1996 film, Pillowcase. But where the Book of Cushions was erotic and graceful, 8½ women just excited and exploited. Greenavai's work is rude and arrogant in his fetishism, and the only person who will likely enjoy watching is the author himself.
