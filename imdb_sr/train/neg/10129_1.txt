I can hardly find words to express this horrible horror. They sold me on the promise of action, with Segal and the aircraft, which usually make a fun action movie. I can honestly say that I would rather get my eyes with a cocktail stick than to look at this movie again. The acting was so terrible that it was almost funny. The story was crazy, with cavities that were so widespread that you could go through F117. The scenario was so poor that I found out that the 10-year-old wrote that I would not be even surprised. Direction and production are so amateur, that I would not even hire those people to shoot at my worst enemies. Utter Utter. Those who are responsible for filming this film make art difficult and should be ashamed. Steven Segal should never again show his face to the public, I can not imagine what led him to agree to star in this worst movie I've ever seen in my life.
