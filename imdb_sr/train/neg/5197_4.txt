A downgrade to the Bulldog Drummond series, in the role of John Howard. A usual funny joke and foolishness, but not much complication. Barrimore gets something like an inspector, replacing himself disguising himself to accompany Drummond, Algie, and Tenni for hunting wild goose (mostly in circles, perhaps the budget was stricter than usual) in order to save the poor Phillis, who are held captive by people I wanted to I'm luring Drummond to his ruin. For those who have a result, in this, Drummond plans to ask Phillis to marry him, and Algi is worried about the disappearance of the baby's baptism. It's fun to see Algia and Tennie dressed as fishermen to fit into Angler's Rest, but little of it rises above nonsense.
