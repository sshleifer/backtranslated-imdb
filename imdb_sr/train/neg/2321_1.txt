I can not believe that this show is still rated at 9 out of 10. I could see if those voices were in the first 2 seasons, but what would anyone else still have a high score after that? I was a big fan of the first season. I was hooked-all mysterious, uncertain, unexplained events. You never knew what was going to happen next. By the second season, I continued to look at myself faithfully, but I was a bit frustrated with some basic things yet to be explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it looked like more questions. I love uncertainty, but you have to throw bones every few years to watch them. Now I can not even remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in season 2, I'm enough. I am not a big fan of watching appointments - and you can obviously not miss an episode to stay on what's happening. So it was no longer worth the effort for me. It's a shame that they could not be a little smarter and more attentive than loyal fans. I agree with some posters that it seems ABC has just become greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show. They do not realize they will eventually lose more fans than they could get.
