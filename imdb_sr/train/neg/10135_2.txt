I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through a few things that I thought could have been improved; acting, writing, directing, special effects, cameramen, sound and lighting. It also seemed that the writers had no idea what to do with the film. Apparently as early as 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could have bought a super-advanced bomber that could have been totally invisible for $ 75 million. Today, these things cost about $ 3 billion and can not be invisible. Obviously, you can fly from the United States to the Middle East in an hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which did not bother me, but it seemed to me to be a lousy attempt to see more people. The camera would randomly zoom in on the actors and switch to random scenes. Oh ieah, from his Steven Segal movie, his predictability as hell. All in all, I ranked him here with Snakes on a plane.
