I watched this movie based on Amber Benson's wall and Nick Stahl is pretty cool - I thought that any movie with two actors I like and respect can not be bad. And in that sense, I was right - in view of the dialogue that aroused the awe, both of them worked quite well. It's not enough to stop the movie from the sucking, you understand, but it's good enough that I managed to pass through 75 minutes of the film (which is the main sign of a terrible film: when, in 40 minutes, you already pray that it will end. < It's hard to know where to start with the problems in "Taboo." Dialogue, as mentioned, is terrible, wooden and completely unnatural.The act of John Jones is incredibly bad, and since it is the character we spend most of time to accompany the house, this is an unforgivable flaw. The action manages to be so intricate that it makes no sense while it's clickable at the same time to be completely predictable (literally, none of the main "knit" in this movie would surprise anyone except a young child.) A few interesting shots to the side, the director is too hard to work with too little success, accidental shots and nervous work of the camera that disturb what a little element of the story. Three stars of this film were rewarded for the fact that it contained Amber Benson, and the last one was thrown on the grounds that one of the jokes got a little messed up. I would not recommend this film to anyone, never, under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
