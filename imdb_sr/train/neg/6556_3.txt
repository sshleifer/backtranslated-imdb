I bought this on a DVD for my brother, a great fan Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to look at him earlier this week. It's a reasonably fun work that contains two completely separate stories. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was far more interesting. She plays a Hollywood actress in a rush that had many short uncomplicated connections. She literally encountered Brian Cervin (a regular married boy with children) after driving her car to his back. After being initially hostile, she offers to drive home because she no longer feels comfortable driving. The romance develops and ultimately leads to tragedy when his wife finds out. What is happening in the end was not ready for it, but the slow pace and routine TV direction takes every drama out of complication. The second part includes the old boss of the Studio by Darren McGavin. This section actually plays a better part with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. Everyone wants something from the studio boss, but in the end when we ask him to resign, they all realize that their careers will not go anywhere. It's time to go, but it's not very interesting and I'm glad that I did not buy it. I'm not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer, but she admits she is the only actor who is worth watching in this movie, and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. All in all, unless you are a fan, avoid this because it is very routine.
