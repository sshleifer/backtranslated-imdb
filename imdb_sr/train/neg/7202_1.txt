Since I loved the cartoon Inspektor Gadget in the '80s, I went to see this movie. I spent my money. The plot was very thin. Also, the movie could not keep me interested for long. I was glad that it was over. If you want to see Inspector Gadget, look for a cartoon instead. It was much better than the movie.
