A film that was so unsure that the creators might have hoped to invent the original movie classic title, "Farewell We Lovely," thinking that the lover believed that it would be a remake. The characters are so nasty and irresistible that they earned their cold reception when they were first released. Time just adds her absurdity. Without possessing any cunning, cinematography, desperation or the despair of a classic nightmare, she instead relied on a complicated and meaningless criminal conspiracy that would easily lead to several arrests in a matter of hours. As if it was not enough to throw into a completely empty attempt of eroticism in which at least one of the participants did not try to bathe in a few days. This has just made this mess even more painful. Find a good classic forty or fifty movie noir instead of spending two hours on this failure.
