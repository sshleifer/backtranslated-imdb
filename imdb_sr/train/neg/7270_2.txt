I gave this movie "2" because of the attractive actors and half of the sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read as a speed reader, NEVER will go through the subtitles that try to keep up with Spanish Speech speeds! And, what the hell is happening at the store if you can not read the subtitles. Endless eyes and eyes and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour. Have some good cinema, but let it be so dark that you think your screen was burning. How did this get something I would never understand. It's difficult to talk about "ACTIVITIES", because the main actors just look and watch with love when they are not pushed. Character Geraldo is so appealing that it's hard to believe that somebody pushed him. What about his mother? I simply did not know most of the time except that there were three guys who seemed to have had a history with each other ... but they never figured out who the "EKS" was.
