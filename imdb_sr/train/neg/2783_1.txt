I went to visit one of my relatives for some time, and we appeared at the theater, so we thought we would come in and give the movie a movie. What a mistake! This movie is terrible in every department. I've never heard of a movie before, and literally everyone is not yet. No wonder, this is like a ranking. It's a comedy, so it writes, so the only thing that's funny is the ability or lack of a director to make such a movie. When we approach Christmas, this should be called how to prepare a turkey for almost an hour and a half - or how long it was while I was leaving. At the end of the film, you will feel the food is poisoned by a sick turkey, and you regret that you have lost time on such a guiding. Who knows why such things are made. Some people left the theater before the film was over, and I blame myself for not coming out before. It really makes me annoyed that you pay good money to see something decent, and everything that comes out and you see is a bad TV movie that should be shown at 2 am, in fact, it's such a bad TV day. it should not be displayed. What else can I say ... probably not enough bad words can do it by justice.
