The only reason I saw 101 Dalmatians were nominations for the original song and costume design for Oscar. I must admit that I was less than impressed with this film. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil (how Glen Close is pulling this role very well) is released from the hospital because of her good behavior. She loves all kinds of animals and lock all her fur. From that moment, we're just waiting for her to start having a crisis. Soon she does it and tries to make the best envelope of the fashion world, of course for itself and a fine Dalmatian fur. Except Glen, I found that everyone was thrown pretty stupid, but from the child's eye funny. This is quite enough because the target market, I suppose, is children under 12 years of age. Good entertainment for children and families, but it did not do much for me. * from the *****
