The fact that there are positive comments about Real Life Day at IMD just made me realize that their staff for enjoying the job is hard to try to get people to watch this extremely horrible movie. I have no say, I have no idea where to begin to describe the really horrible movie I spent last night - Day in real life. Steve's characters from the previous films told me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialogue, but like the other cries, I felt uneasy and confused about the actors. The dialogue was so fictitious, the family was this cake of Valton's family and the movie was so many times before that I was shocked that someone thought it was an original idea. Make yourself a service and take a passport on this terrifying bad movie and I do not believe everything you read on the IMDb because the first comments were clearly written by people sitting in another theater and watching a good movie.
