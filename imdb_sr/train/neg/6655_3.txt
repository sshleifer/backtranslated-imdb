The only redeeming quality of this longstanding melodrama is the idea of ​​southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the song. Stephanie Povers is wrong and betrayed by a false accent. As already pointed out, she is too old to be 18 years old and looks too young as a grandmother with her granddaughter in college? Lee Remick is good even though she is in her later years. Talented Joan Lumley is underutilized and is able to forever watch young people when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries Stephanie Povers. Continuous arrogance Stacey Keach makes you wonder what these women saw in him. You do not know how any viewer could relate to his exaggerated display? The most prominent performance is Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the actors as amateurs on the ranking list. It burdens the gullibility that the handsome male juniors in this epic will remain unique while patiently waiting for their tendency to finally agree to accept them. Can anyone believe that the handsome Robert Urich will remain unique for decades and wait for Stephanie Povers to finally accept his endless proposals for marriage? Engagement between the Second World War and Marquis is ridiculous. To begin with, the Germans did not occupy part of the Provence in France until the end of the war, controlled by the French puppet government of Visi. We see that the French resistance blew up the daily raid on Mistral's villa to steal the sheets, after which they all sat under the bridge and waited for the stoning of Nazi troops to surprise and destroy them? If you want to see a well-played mini-series in a foreign country, do not look at Mistral's daughter. Thorn Birds would be a much better alternative.
