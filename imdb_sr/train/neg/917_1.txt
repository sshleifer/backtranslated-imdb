This film was made in a very bad taste. The scenario was very bad. I feel very sad for the late Gregory Peck who took over the title role of this B-film adaptation of one of the greatest generals in history. The film was politically incorrect and insensitive to others who fought the Japanese in World War II. It was a scene in which I almost vomited, showed Macarthur in a bunker on Corregidor Island and talked with troops as an experienced politician when a wounded, one-night Filipino soldier came in. A soldier bleeding and dying manages to stand up when he sees the general and says: "There is no dad, there is no mother, no one is uncle" and Macarthur do not give a small speech that the Americans will never leave the Philippines. The scene ends when a soldier is revived by Macarthur's words and gives him a smart greeting. I mean, if there was a scene that was listed in the United States, as a great white saver of the world, please tell me because this one takes a cake. It turned out that the Filipino girls in trouble were incapable of honor and rely on great Americans solely for redemption. This was obviously and deliberately overshadowed by the contribution of members of the USAFFE (the Armed Forces of the Far East, USA), these are Philippine volunteers who were integrated into the US military during the Second World War, who died side by side with Americans who fought against the Japanese, walked side by side with Americans in the march of Bataan's death and defended the Corregidor island by launching a guerrilla offensive after Macarthur went to Australia with his famous speech "I Will Return". My late grandfather, a World War II veteran and a USAFFE soldier, was one of many who fought the Japanese with respect and love for their homeland. I do not think this film honors them and the thousands of others Macarthur has relied on for preparations for intelligence work for his famous return to Bay Leite.
