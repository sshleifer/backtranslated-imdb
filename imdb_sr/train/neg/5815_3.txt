I really liked this movie based on the review and pressed it, but after I looked at it, I was terribly disappointed. Slums are a totally infertile film blended with the kind of disturbing family reality of Todd Solondance, without Todd's humor. The story turns away and every scene is worse than last. Maybe I missed the point, but if this film is an example of the experience of growing up every girl, I'm glad I'm a man.
