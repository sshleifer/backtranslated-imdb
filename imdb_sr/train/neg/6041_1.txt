This story of three women is a very sensitive study of: the youngest, Charlotte Van Den Einde, Lauri (Els Dottermans), who is about 37 years old and Marty (Frieda Pittors), the eldest mother of Muriel. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. Vitalna Laura wants a child. Muriel comes from the village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Marta dreams of her youth when she was a young girl. In fact, nothing is happening in this movie, so you wait for something - for coincidence - which could dramatize this story. As time passes, you discover that Dorothea Van Den Berghe's director wants only to develop a psychological portrait of three women and nothing more. This film is disappointing because you expect women to learn from their experiences, which is not the case, leaving a sense of emptiness.
