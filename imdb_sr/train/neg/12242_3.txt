I expected a bad movie and got a bad movie. But I could not imagine in the worst fantasy how bad this movie was. I do not even want to try to explain what this is about. It's not about surfing the blood, it's about a big crocodile. They complain of a false shark in the jaw, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark to the end. Here the crocodile is shown many times, and it's the worst fake crocodile I've ever seen, and they're not trying to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile, watch Lake Placid. The director had the opportunity to make a decent movie for surfing / shark, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the opportunity to make an original surfing film, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So, you realize how bad this movie is, does it have some good parts? Not exactly, he got a nudity, and a sex scene that was taken from the film of a movie. The act is not half bad, and Kate Fischer looks good. It's a shame that it does not take its top. And the main actors are not bad. They had some potential. The location was beautiful and the movie started well with some nice surfing scenes. It is a crime for a non-talented writer and director. The dialogue is the worst thing I've ever seen, and the script is really poorly written, and the director did not have talent as it ever was, and not a bit of fantasy. Do not look at it. Even if you want to watch beautiful Kate Fischer. It's not worth it. Look at the Sirens to watch Kate offering and watch Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile action. 3/10 because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked, and Kate looks good (but she's a bad actress), and Dec Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi have done a good job with a piece of which they had to do.
