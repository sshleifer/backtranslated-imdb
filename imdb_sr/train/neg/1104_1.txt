This is one of the worst written films I've ever had to live with. The story is nothing new - but it's a cartoon, so who cares, as long as it's nice and fun? I will not go as deep as the characteristics, or I will be here all day (except to say that there are no, characters change personality whenever it is convenient for the action), but whoever wrote the script and the visual direction , access to pens and paper should be prohibited.
