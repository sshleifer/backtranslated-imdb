This is one of the worst movies I've ever encountered, but I want to say that some of the criticisms I've heard turned out to be unwarranted. As for the techniques of making a clean film, this director is in charge . The limited budget and VHS camera are retained, but actual installation, camera angles, camera movements and scene scenes are pretty professional. I've seen a lot of films in which the "director" was a lot worse. At least the scene runs in a way that is not confusing and has a few smart shots here and there. Also, the forest scene contained a decent atmosphere. There is only so much that you can do with a VHS camera, and it does a good job as far as technical details are concerned. As for artistic merits, there is no. The scene in which the camera descends so that we can watch the type that wet in the woods for 15 seconds somehow comes down to the artistic style of the entire film. This is clean trash ... Totally garbage. Gore is responsible for the film in this budget range. , it's obviously fake, but there are many things, and it's very weird .. I saw an American version with deliberate camping. It was a good idea (and this is the only thing that has allowed me to go through the movie) ... Unfortunately, this is excessive, especially at the end. It's a really horrible movie, but I recommend it for the value of the campsite. It's hard to find a movie that's worse than this and puts it in a unique category.
