This is the worst thing I've seen for years. I believe that it should be removed from T.V. because of retardation. It's so stupid that I could just pass out when I look at it. (although I never see it because SOOOOO is poor) Goofs: When a mac says it can eat sugar, it eats sugar in the second episode. Almost everything in the world has sugar in it !!! In the Eddie Monster episode, when Eddie screams at Terrance, he hits the chest twice and the other time when he falls, does not fall, he falls aside. What nonsense. I can not even say the word Fosters Home. I even recorded with my band a song about how this show was retarded. Biiiiiiiieeeee
