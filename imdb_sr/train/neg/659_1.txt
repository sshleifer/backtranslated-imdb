This film is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people are paid to this piece of garbage show that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in a fun business. The idea that the audience pays to see this movie (and as the idiot I rented a movie) also discourages. An obsessed teacher (3 years earlier) is killing a teenage family because she wants it. Without a reason, he kills his mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see bad behavior and direction. Years later, the obsessed teacher leaves the prison. HMM - commonly bad writing - no one in the city that has terrorized knows until the last moment. The obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a seal stamp and can sneak around, sniff people, and a knife is a great killer. Sure !!! Now the obsessed teacher for no reason kills the hotel maid, entertainment knives and starts hunting teenage friends. Now there is a perfect way to get a girl to love you. An embarrassed teacher, sparks from the hotel --- is once again stupid, whenever a police officer met his face - but he is walking right beside them. Now she kills two policemen outside the house of a teenager and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend. There is not one positive thing about this piece of garbage. If any other profession extinguishes the work of this poor quality, they would be fired. However, these idiots make hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and managing this waste.
