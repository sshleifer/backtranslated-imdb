I intended to watch this movie in the theater. It's actually sold out. Instead, I went to see Solaris, which was actually the worst movie to be released in 2002. Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough, street "street pharmacist", freaks out when he sees a boy being killed, so he decides to go clean and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). It seems that things are going pretty well while Jack does not skip the city with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). It happened very late in the film, so they did not find it in the review, it might have been an interesting turn. But they are, so it is not. In fact, there is not any interesting thing about this movie; Everything is given in the review. If you've seen even one review, you've seen the whole movie, so you might want to think that it's difficult to fill in the gaps. Go to your website, download the review, save yourself $ 3.99. There is not any surprise or twist in the whole movie, except for the terrible sound background. I hope that whoever was in charge of writing a soundtrack fired. Twice. Most of the music would be that the only songs allowed to play were duets Ricki Martin and Gloria Estefan, and (I can break the fabric of the spatio-temporal continuum with a concept such as mind-interference). He had less talent and musical abilities. The act is at best poor, the scenario is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 67% styrofoam and 33% zipper bag. You know that things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in Pests!) He overheard the rest of the actors with his acting abilities.
