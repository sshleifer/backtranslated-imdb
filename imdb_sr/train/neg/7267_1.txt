This film is simply too long, too repetitive, with a male nudity and a sexual being (as it is said as a gay with my adult titles collection) is too unnecessary and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could be reduced to ten minutes and was equally effective without the patience (and endurance) of the audience. I saw this film early on Saturday afternoon with the audience of the film festival; a type of audience that tends to be more adventurous, interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as a movie without much dialogue, short films, foreign films. Soon, a crowd in the 275-seat theater theater began to run through the first half of the film, and while the vast majority remained a "payoff" (which has never arrived), I have never, in around 14 years, been attending an unlimited number of film festivals, experimental , gay, and in other ways, watching so many people go out of the movie. This film could easily be reduced by more than half and was as effective as it was. The same could be done in different directions, still with shorter working hours, and it was far more efficient. As it currently exists, this is not something that can be easily recommended or what I would like to see again.
