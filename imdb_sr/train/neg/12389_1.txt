The model Chris McCormack (Margauk Hemingvai) was brutally raped by the teacher (Chris Sarandon) by his sister Kathi (Mariel Hemingvai). He is brought to court, but he is completely free. Then rape Kathy! Incomplete and sick film about rape. This film is advertised as an important drama dealing with rape. It's a badly written and (mostly) bad drama. He claims he is sympathetic to the victim of rape, but he stuns the scene in the face. To be completely honest, Hemingway's acting is so bad in that line that he loses any real influence. The trial scenes were boring and predictable. And the film went too far when a 15-year-old Mariel was raped (fortunately not shown). I admit, however, that this led to a great ending when Margauk grabbed a gun and killed Sarandon dead. But seriously - that a young girl was raped is just disgusting. The act does not help. For example, Margauk was not an actress. She certainly was a beautiful woman (and I believe that this is the right model), but her behavior left a lot of desire to wish. It reduces the film. Mariel was fine, but this was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as a rapist. It was not bad, but the terrible script worked against him. I recall that I heard that in the projection of this 1976 some women got up and cheered when Sarandon was killed and maybe it works for some people. I found this bored, simplified and really sick. 1 to the end.
