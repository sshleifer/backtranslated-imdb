It's one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. Not if they did not try. There was decent writing with some elements of the structure, good acting, some good acting. I'm not sure where he went wrong, but he went terribly wrong. Some elements may have been a bad structure and no substantive story, much exaggerations by the leading (which is probably much better when it's restrained), some poor directing and editing. I've had enough for about an hour, tearing my hair about an hour and a half, and very upset about an hour and fifty minutes. There was also dishonesty in all this, because I went with someone who was addicted to heroin. He was upset that he glamorized something that did not have anything good for him. It was supported by a pretty 17-year-old girl who was in love with a 30-year-old drug addict. The fuzzy nature of the lead was large enough. There were awkward plots that were an attempt to build, but the end result was volatile and endless (with uneven timelines). The characters were colorful, but without end, for which I felt bad about the quality actors that you did not see enough. Skipping. I assumed that this was the first time a director who was in love with his own shit, but he already did it. I am confused that this and many other bad ideas find someone who will really give them money.
