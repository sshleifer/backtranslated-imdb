In what could otherwise be a mill, a middle-aged film about the unbelief of the sixties (the subtle period of "free love"), the creators of this movie crowd on a ridiculous scenario after a ridiculous script, turning a little cherry on top, happy ever after finishing. I've never felt sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Pakuin in their problematic life in the middle class, nor did I feel like a weakened Liev Shrieber. The story line slowly passes by its predictable, pathetic conclusion, and the only thing that's interesting and visible in this film is the stunning Diane Lane in Toples. Here's a hint, it's about 30 minutes in the movie. Fast forward to that part and skip the rest.
