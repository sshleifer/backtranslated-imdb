Director Spike Lee is known for filming films that point to racism. In many films, like "Do the Right Thing", most white people are all brutal racists. In this film, interracial marriage is a topic, and racism is again the whole issue. What Lee, however, once again demonstrates is his intolerance against Christianity. The double standards that exist in the world of film are incredible. If Li or anyone else ever produced such a kind of bias against another group, he would have been attacked, but Christians? Hey, it's "open season" on them. Ossie Davis, Reverend in this movie, captures her son and then puts a smoking gun on top of the Bible. They zoom in on another big plan, only if you missed it. Hey, folks, here's another reader of the Bible and see how he is! Lee does such a thing in almost every movie he makes. He shows the same hatred when dealing with racial relationships. Who could call racism as an evil thing? However, Lee keeps him in this film as he did in other films. His apparent bitterness towards the whites does not help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. Hey, Spike: start "doing the right thing" and leave prejudice in the wardrobe. Better yet, "get over". This is too bad because the theme could be for a film that causes thinking if it is done with objectivity and intelligence.
