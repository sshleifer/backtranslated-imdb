Once upon a time, he was the author of a science fiction named H. Beam Piper, who wrote a classic book called Little Fuzzi, which referred to a man who discovers a race of strange little blurred humanoids on the other planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollivood and many of today's authors who began to rob his grave before his body cooled down. This is the book from where they got the idea for the Evokes. Skullduggeri is so obviously firing "Little Fuzzi". I can wonder why I'm the only one who ever noticed? But do not tell me about it. Here's a link to the Guntenberg Project where you can download a copy of Little Fuzzy for free: http: //vvv.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
