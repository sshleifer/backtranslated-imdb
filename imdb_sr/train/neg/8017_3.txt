I did not actually finish the movie. You can say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially negative. But I do it, just because I stopped it because I could not watch it anymore ... I stopped halfway, and I arrived just by placing myself something good around the corner. This film is so boring, so skinny I was actually offended. I have not read many other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teenagers who have suffered through it, but I'm gay, and I've gone through "similar" discoveries, daily dreams, problems, and so on. There may have been two moments in which I really felt that this film could go somewhere, where I felt that it could have some sense or relativity, but these hopes were interrupted at the moment when the next set of clichés narratives followed. I mean, just look at quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you are not able to hear the creaking reproduction, nor the echo and disappear if you only read the quotes, because they are simply too painful / ridiculous / stupid to miss them. I gave the film three stars, and all three stars go to a filmmaker who has done a fantastic job trying to transform Archer's tired "concepts" into something that can be viewed. I do not think he decided to include all the long recordings of TV circuits ... another unnecessary cliche that has already been completed in films such as Corine Gummo ... I think it's extremely convenient for this film to be premiere at Sundance (just because it's Archer had links to the festival through the volunteer work he did, by the way ...) because Sundance looks like a festival on which clichés like this are still accepted as "arthouse". No, it's not an art house, I'm afraid it's just an ordinary t-house. Do not look.
