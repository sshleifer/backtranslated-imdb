What a horrible piece of garbage !!! Who are all these people who are concerned about how this is good? Yes, it is "arti"; And yes, it's "foreign", but ... that's not enough. The action is boring and unconnected, like realizing shov, but not so smoothly. People are essentially uninteresting; but as characters do not have enough depth to feel empathy toward them. If they are based on real people, then I feel very, very sorry for them. As if the producer had a vision that Kuenton was Tarantino. Not even I think of him. And yes yes: if I had such a neighbor, I would move!
