In the '70s, when I first saw this, I was in high school. Then it was cool. Now, as an adult, I look at it and tell myself. What was so funny? There are moments, but few are. It's so dated that jokes are no longer standing. Show it to the younger audience and they will be completely lost. If you love this kind of humor, you may want to stick to Kentucky Fried movie or Amazon Women from the Moon. The Vision Tunnel as well as the Groove tube are too outdated for today's viewing.
