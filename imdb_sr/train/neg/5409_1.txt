Christmas secret was promoted as a wonderful movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS and a DVD copy of the movie when it finished, which leads me to the conclusion that the producers are really proud of this project. As an actor on the stage, I felt that most performances were called, although Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I was Richard Thomas, I would not put this movie on my otherwise nice resume. It was a shame. I've been a fan since Valton's day, but I felt inexperienced to watch any of his work, so poor I was on offer. and completely amateur. I hope this is not considered an evil review and negative assumptions about my qualifications as a critic. I turned the movie because it played a good role and I was ready to enjoy the film. However, I would challenge anyone to watch this movie and I do not want to get the money back, even though it was at T.V.
