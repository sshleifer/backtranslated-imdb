After you have left the first, think that the Vaans brothers can make some new jokes. Although I guess not. If the first one was not bad enough, this one is so bad it's a pain to watch. With all the actors they have in this movie, you think you could think of something smarter. Although they could not, they had to take all the same rude, non-funny jokes from the first and somehow put it into this movie thinking that people would laugh again. Although I did not smile for the first time. They tried to make these films parody, even though they failed at all levels. Most of the time, they are just randomly inserted jokes, which are so disgusting and indecent that it's hard to watch and enjoy it. Then when they try to do scenes that are film parodies, they end up with 20 minutes of recreation of the scene with perhaps a scarf in the whole scene. Likewise, for people who say that it is not for an old and real young audience, I fit well in the range of years that it should have been ridiculous. While people say that different people have different ideas about what is funny or not, if this is funny to you, then you're probably not one of the more mature or more intelligent people. It does not take much skill to write such a script, although if you want a smarter and funny movie to go to Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that's really good and well done and it did not have to use hideous and indecent jokes to make it funny.
