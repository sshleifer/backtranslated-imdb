"Suzanne's Second Coming" is another of those Surrealist films that try to come up with extremely sophisticated films, but all this makes the viewer sleep. Like other films of this type, there is a limited dialogue. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetics of the staff. However, cinema stinks so there is nothing that will keep your attention. In the video box it is said that this film "is one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on the movie". Of course. There is the right to watch such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a kilometer. 1/10
