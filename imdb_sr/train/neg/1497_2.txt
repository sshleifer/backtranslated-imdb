I understand that I'm reviewing the movie I've seen. I realized that almost all nudity and the above were carved out of this film, and thus completely castrated it. When I saw names such as Ginger Linn and Jenna Jameson, I knew that I would not get a classic of horror, but at least I expected free tits and bloodshed. But no, this must be the most up-to-date modern horror movie, I think it's easy to say that there are many more scenes to certain scenes, but they suddenly got separated, or the scene ends properly. How do you kiss the cannibals and porn stars? I think that this is a winning formula, it seems to me to wonder if the director slept with a woman of some executive power or something, because it's literally incredible how much he got out of this. Reading about it a few years ago in Fangorii, I was excited, it looked like a fun movie, but unfortunately, the real movie is locked somewhere in the vault, and we have to withstand this piece of devious Evil Breed. I hope that a one-time cut will be announced, because I think there is a good movie in this mess, but by then, you should capture the twelve pillars of the Buddha, since this is the only way you will succeed through this film.
