I could not say if "The Screaming Skull" was trying to be Hitchcock's cleavage or modernized Edgar Allen Poe's day. These days, someone would cut it a bit and present it as one of those episodes of TV anthology from the old "Tales from the Dark Side" ... but only after extensive rewriting. It's a sad thing, there seems to be a beautiful, nasty little story that tries to get out of the ruins of this movie, and the actors obviously do the best they can with their talent and the material they work with. But the director simply did not know how to stage or tempo dramatic scenes; special effects simply did not work; the scenario telegraphed his tattered points so clearly that the shells could see them coming; and the soundtrack continued to play German music "oompah band" when it was supposed to scare the audience. They tried; They worked hard. But this is interesting only as a period. I suppose that someone very young, who did not see much uncertainty or horror, could sue "The Screaming Skull", but someone who is young would probably not get most of the motive or motive. ("Mom, why is this nice man trying to scare the frightened lady with a frightened cat?")
