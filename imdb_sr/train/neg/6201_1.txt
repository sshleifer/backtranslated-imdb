I saw that. It is not "good", but interesting in an insufficient way. The boys in it are pretty natural, but ................ the graphic / free final scene of the gang rape is disgusting and -oh da-the random insertion of World War II footage is an offensive way in which it tries to compare the real horror with this misogynistic power. The real beast is real - this film is just horrible. However, the movie has a look that can attract you. But it seems to me to be a "new imperial suit", but in fact the other way round. The movie looks good, but the direction, story, content and the final feeling that you take away from this movie is empty. If the feeling can be empty - that's it.
