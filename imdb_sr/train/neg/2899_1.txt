seriously what the hell was this movie about "simply stupid", I would give him 0, but "1" "horrible" is the least you can say, seriously this movie is not worth watching, wasting time, I do not know what's wrong with you guys who vote for this movie 7 out of 10, I can seriously make a better movie than this, I hire some other unemployed people, I do not promise to make a movie better than this, this movie was so bad that I will never watch a movie with Steve Carrell in the main role, the bottom score does not waste time being downloaded from the network or renting it, nominov the film would this mean for the worst, the worst is something that you have to give, but after that this is the second
