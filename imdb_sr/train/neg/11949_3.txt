This stupid comedy really works well with comical talent. In particular, Dan Aikroid and Hovard Hesseman are being misused here. Perhaps I laughed once or twice during this film, but in general, it's a boring film, with a bit of stupidity drawn to a great extent. The premise, although routine, was still not bad, but when the action was set, the film did not go anywhere. Do not waste time with this skipping.
