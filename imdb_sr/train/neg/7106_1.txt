I'm not a big fan of horror films, and I've seen only a few of them (and none of the "Halloween" or "Fridai the Trinaeste") - but I can appreciate the terrifying horror movie not because of the up. I'm pretty sure this is not scary. What is so horrible about the small plastic skull that appears everywhere? In all his performances there are distant recordings, so in this film there is no real surprise. (Not only is the skull itself so terrible, but ...) The action relates to the third relative of Claus Von Boulder (John Hudson), who marries Donnu Reed (Peggei Webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) begins to see the skull and hear the mysterious cries of a group of peacocks on the property of her husband. Did I mention that her husband lost the first woman in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH !!!! I wonder who did it !!!! It's the same old story about a rich boy who is trying to kill and / or ridicule his wife. If you want to see a well-made version of these things, try the "Reversal of Fortune". And BTV, Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson. MSTing was fine, but nothing special; paired with "Buttons" briefly, however, it makes it good to watch. Two stars for "The Screaming Skull"; 8 stars for MST3K version. Now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Booleau: "How bad is this film?" "You have no idea!"
