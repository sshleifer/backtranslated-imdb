When I left and saw this film, I had great expectations. But I was wrong. This film was just like any other horror movie. It's a virus, zombies, etc. Just like Resident Evil and many, many other films. But the difference with these and other films is that the story is very weekly. Poor actors and boring music. The photo is fine, but the rest is totally shitty. You do not see this "horror" movie, go and see Ring 2 or any other movie that's more than one story. I hope they will stop making horror movies that have a virus and the virus spreads and make people zombies. We saw a lot of things. The only good thing in the movie is when they stand on the roof and record famous, infected celebrities.
