Unfortunately, that's true. The "Legionnaire" with absolute clarity exposes the parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure. As already mentioned, the author has lost the ability to unify his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form. Manically concerned by the mechanical trick of selecting random newspaper subjects and linking them without any legitimacy, it merely gathers the messy pile of events, unable to track the most intricate attachments. The level of the scenario is similar to the amateur performance of "Cantarea Romaniei" about the magnificent moves of socialist realism - just turned upside down: while the communist line dictated a deep concern only with positivism and sweet festivals, Daneliuc is now obsessively obsessed with negativism and disgusting scathology. The content of the idea is zero, and the "message", infantile and didactic, at the kindergarten level. Unfortunately, he has forgotten the most basic professional settings. He is no longer able to organize a dramatic situation, to arrange on a proper film scene, to edit it and to arrange it according to the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His level of storytelling on film images is similar to the phrase of something like: "A man with a sacred paper is not right" and all people are asses! "What a huge distance from the impressive 1976-1984 artist, who created unique works such as" Cursa "," Proba de microfon "," Vanatoarea de vulpi "- and even" Croaziera "and" Glissando "... Sic transit gloria mundi ...
