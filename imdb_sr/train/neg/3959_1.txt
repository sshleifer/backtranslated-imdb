This is NOT one of those films that is one of the biggest pieces of trips I've ever had the scene, working with cameras trying to be silent, but that really only shit the whole thing looks like red shoes, but without sex, the only reason I'm I bought this one that I wanted to try out a DVD and this was the cheapest one I could find, perhaps the worst cup in my life, and I could put you off forever, the soundtrack is really nice and most of the movie is made up of endless repetitions of the first two films, why anyone would want to make a movie as awesome as it is outside of me, if they really tried to make an original movie and failed, I would be more beautiful in this review, but did not they just get the right to reproduce things from the first two, and then edit them and repeat them in this movie with maybe about three thirds of the original record, which is up to the standard of film school students, DO NOT buy this movie. The only entertainment that this DVD can offer is to put it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER incredible GARBAGE! 0/10 if this would only be enabled by the voting system.
