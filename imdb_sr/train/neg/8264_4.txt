This is a film in which all actors are fine, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a movie in which each of the three pairs encounters a situation in which the verrrrr is forced to be either cute or to start the story. In other words, it seems like they are fictitious movie scenes, not like in real life. Even if women who work in peep parallels ever come out with some of their clients, it just does not look realistic in general as it is written in this movie. Also, when one of the characters encounters an overwhelming woman in a movie, he feels as artificial, the way they watch one second after the quarrel. Again, the actors are all good, and the moments of this film are good, but altogether another indie who could use some rewriting before the production began to sell.
