This may or may not be the worst film ever made by Steve Martin, but it's certainly far from his best. He obviously did this shit to check. Such an accident certainly does not contribute to his reputation as a ridiculous man. What he does not seem to realize is that when people go to see Steve Martin's movie, they expect to be entertained, not to be bored. It's sad that he dragged Aikroud and Phil Hartman with him. I do not understand why talented people can not understand the fact that people do not want to see them in bad films. If you want to call the film a comedy, then it should be fun. This was not. It is a shame to the American army, which allowed it to be connected with this pub. Full Metal Jacket had more laughter from this poor excuse for "comedy for services". Surely, Phil Silvers turns into a grave.
