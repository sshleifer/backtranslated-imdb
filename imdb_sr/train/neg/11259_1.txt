I gave a movie. I can not understand how Ettore Scola, one of the greatest directors of the Italian film, made such a film, so dumb and funny! All the stories of people involved in the film are unfounded, boring and not interesting. Too long, boring. The only things I'm keeping in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope that Scola will radically change the themes and styles in her next film.
