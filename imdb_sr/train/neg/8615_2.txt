This film was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had difficult moments to watch it all the way. I saw this Rodney at Natural Born Killers and I thought he was ridiculous in hell, but this movie is bullshit. "Jokes" were not funny, the actors were not ridiculous, nothing about it was even funny. Do not waste time for this! Only positive things about this were beautiful women :) and Molly Shannon, which I'm sure he tried, but the script was too horrible. That's why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
