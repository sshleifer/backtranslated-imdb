Why watch this? There is only one reason, and it is for the size of John Sakon. I love his acting. My favorite performances are Nightmare On Elm Street 1.3, and 7 as Nensin's father's policeman, Black Christmas as a policeman, and From Dusk Till Dawn again as a policeman. When I searched my video at the local shopping center I came across the movie Zombie Death House and I quickly rejected it, but before I started, I noticed that John Sakon was not just an actor in this movie, but for the first time I ever had heard of the director. That intrigued me (and cheaper price of $ 9.00) and I and I had to have it. Upon arriving home, I realized that this film does not fulfill other works of Saxon, even his acting, which may have been confused by the extra pressure of directing. But they were not just other actors. It seemed like they were all pulled out of a recent porn picture and told the guys that you really need to act. The film looks even from pornography of the '80s. I can not in good faith recommend this film to casual viewers, but if you are obsessed with an eighteenth-century fan who missed the culture that came from that era by being born late, or by a fan of shit, than for. Also, if you're digging John Saxon like me.
