Not only are the characters wrong, not only are the voices of bullshit, not only the writers must seriously get girls, not only are the drawings really rough, but it seems that it was mostly created for years 1-6. The only episode I've ever seen on this show that kept me was "A Matter Of Famili", because I liked Robin's character. And sometimes I think it's just a general copy of Batman's animated series. Example: In BTAS, Bruce is a friend of Harvey Dent, yes? During the two episodes of the story, he turns into an unusual villain, TvoFace. In "Shov" Bruce is a Friend with this Ethan guy, and through a story from two episodes, he transforms himself into the unusual criminal of ClaiFace. It was a small example (it may not even be true), but in short, this is THE BEST APPROACH of the Batman series. And it says something.
