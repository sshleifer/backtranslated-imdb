Last night I watched this movie and I'm already struggling to remember it very much. The story is about a group of criminals fleeing from a spatial penal colony. They go to the Moon in a space-old old garbage carrier; When there, they terrorize the garbage bins that work on the Moon's base. It seems that the rubbish of low-budget sci-fi films often involves either desert planets or, like this film, criminals fleeing the penal colonies. . Why is this no idea? But I can say with certainty that such films are always devilish. This is no exception. It starts relatively well with a decent line of credit and a soundtrack halfway. It then degenerates into a boring science-fantasy thriller. So little in this film happens that I literally struggle to write a useful review, so if you read this, I apologize that I could not enlighten you about the subtlies and nuances of the film. To be aware, I recall the boring crowds of bad people, the boring crowds of good things, some nuclear heads, and the naked woman's hologram. Besides, I'm fighting. If you think you might be interested in people's activities on the moon's garbage cans, then I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I recommend it to those who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
