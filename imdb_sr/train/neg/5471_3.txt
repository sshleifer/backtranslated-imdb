Typical Troma-trash, this silly 80s movie is considered one of the "peaks" of Lloyd Kaufman's notorious production studio, along with "The Tokic Avenger" published a year ago. "Toxic Avenger" is far superior to me if you ask me, but this crazy man is still durable; Just be careful to leave your full brain on the door. Events take place in Tromaville, a small town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world, and they certainly are not lying. Safety precautions at the local nuclear power plant are below standard, at least (even Homer Simpson has never been carefree), and toxic waste penetrates to a nearby high school. The first opiate victim is a stereotyped dumbfound, who starts to throw out green things from all of his body cavities, but his death is believed to have been an accident because he had at least two microwave ovens in his house! Oh, man! Shortly thereafter, however, nuclear leakage also affects plantation of weeds at school and the thing starts to become messy. After smoking at a party, the youngest couple in the school produce a huge monster worm that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scarves. "Nuke 'em High is the most recent movie of horror films, with dialogues that are so stupid to hurt your ears and makeup effects that give a whole new meaning to the word without taste. If you enjoy watching faces that break apart, break up or split into half, this is definitely unavoidable! Unlike the aforementioned "The Tokic Avenger," this film suffers from several really boring and long-lasting moments in which nothing really happens, such as when Chrissy and Varren are trying to figure out what's wrong with their hormones. Rough humor is not as effective as in "Tokic Avenger", while acting shows are unforgivable amateur. Continue only if you are a passionate fanatic of Troma.
