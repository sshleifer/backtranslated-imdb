A really disgusting, disgusting movie with only a small amount of real humor. The character of the father is particularly vulgar in extremes (intentionally so, obviously), and portrayed in the most pathetic, My wife and I found this film terribly disturbing, without any redemption options. Honestly, I wish I had never seen him. I consider this British effort to be a sick and gross embarrassment. Those who enjoyed this movie have the capacity that is completely lacking. : joy in the depiction of deep depravity and misery. Manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves.
