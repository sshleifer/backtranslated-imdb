This film was a confusing piece of garbage. You never knew what was going on. The characters were poorly written and mostly were completely unsuccessful except Gus (masterfully played by George Eads). I hate this movie, but in comparison with others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) I should have received an Academy Award. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a shameful and sticky movie. You lifetime lifetime drowned in a brand new one. Someone has to make sure that this director never works in movies anymore. It also should have been a horror movie because it was much funnier than scary. For Shame Lifetime, For Shame.
