I am surprised by the many female voters who even give a better stamp to this film. My thoughts on this film was that the target audience was grown up and male. Hitched and tortured women, relentless revenge and high number of bodies are typical ingredients, which introduced spaghetti into film history. Opening and manual breaking are DJANGO rip-off. However, SHOOTER is missing a style, for example. DJANGO. Score, acting and cinema are at best central, but if you are looking for the ingredients listed above, you are in the right place. And actors do not have an Italian accent. 4/10.
