We are not in the fairy tale of the Emperor. We can admit the truth about what we see, and without being stupid, admit that this performance is in many respects just incomprehensible and it is clear that much of it is created from pure intuition without the right concept. Well, obviously many people love such things. I do not. I prefer well-designed and planned performances. And I also admit that the performance is very serious for my taste and boring ... those stories and stories about drugs ... There are so many exciting soaps with a lot of uncertainty (Dallas eg), But Twin Peaks can not catch my attention. I do not care about these people, except for Cooper and Gordon Cole.
