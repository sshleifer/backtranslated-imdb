I watched this movie because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd give my sister a try, Rain Phoenik. I'm sorry to check that out. It was a shame and the film had this strange plot, if that's what you want to call it. Sissi was just strange and Jellibean was just sitting on a toilet that both slept with this old man in the mountains, what's going on? I've never been so unhappy in my life. It was total nonsense. I can not believe that the actors have agreed to do such a loss of film, money, time and space. Let Sissy be 'pretty' to me. I thought everything was different. These thumbs were just stupid and why we care if it can stop? WHAT IS IT? 0 out of 10, the damage that the poll does not have 0, does not deserve even 1. I hope the rain is better in other films, I forgive her for this show, I think I would not be much better with that movie.
