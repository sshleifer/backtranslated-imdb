I really have problems with rating this movie. It's brilliant, obviously there's a lot of money in it. Gere and Danes are intense (although her personality on the screen could be defined and spiced up a bit more), montage and cinema are excellent. On the other hand, it is one of those really sick films in which one can not but wonder if the director likes to make scenic scenes, and, yes, it can not be asked how much a copy of such a film will inspire. /> In pure artistic sense, it's 9, but I really have to wonder who these people give their money for the production of such a movie.
