I saw this film at the London premiere, and I have to say - I did not expect much, but I was expecting something that was at least mildly fun. The original "Basic Instinct" was not a great movie and it's still a "classical class," but it was fun. I can remember the countless times I browse channels on TV late Friday or Saturday night when I came across a movie and came to actually start paying attention to it. there is nothing delayed. Is Sharon Stone still beautiful? Well, let's say this - for the 47-year-old, she's pretty hot. Is it as beautiful as the original? She obviously had a plastic surgery on her face, and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unpleasant. It does not look so soft or sincere or innocent as in the original - what is the purpose of being an evil jealousy, and what else. The rest of the show is moving from bad to terrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (typically a safe director - one who does not always always do a great job, but manages to make valuable films) officially delivered his first true turkey; a film so bad people who laughed at certain moments that were supposed to be serious. I heard that the movie went through several editing sessions, and this is very clear from the very beginning. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and an end - oh my! We are talking about stupid and incredible. (Still, foreseeable.) I saw "Gigli", I saw "Son Masks" - and although I do not want to "mumble" this movie, I can say it with my own authority (which I do not have to agree with all of that, they both prefer both films in relation to this disastrous failure screen during a particularly unheard-of and offensive scene in an Orgy Orgy Night Club. "Basic Instinct 2" - in fact, also stinks.
