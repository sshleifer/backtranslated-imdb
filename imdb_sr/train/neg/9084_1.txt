This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Molly (molly hall) could not act at all! she had no emotion that all the blah blah blah as she read from the boring book. A smart kid and a kid who likes food (names are not worth remembering there) were so unpleasant that she was cursing me. Molly Dad did not show enough emotion when his daughter disappeared. The policeman and Mollys father said the same thing as four times. It was terrible. Everything was repeated a lot. Beatrice needed something bad to happen to her, so she was so mean. I just spent a moment in my life watching this movie!
