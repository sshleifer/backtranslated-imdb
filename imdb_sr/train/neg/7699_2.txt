I was expecting a comedy like Big Mama. Instead, the film was a bizarre blend of comedy, drama, and love story. The other involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who abuses her. The third includes the relationship between a single mother with two children and one father. In the film is actually very little comedy. The film also has a lot of twisted messages. For example, Madea battles an adopted child with a belt (comic), in order to convince the child to correct. In fact, the kid turns. Apparently it's worth it to beat the kids. There are plots dealing with rape of children (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with older men who talk about young girls who are related to them. (The adverb takes place at a family gathering.) The movie jumps from plot to plot, so you're always out of balance. Is it a comedy, a love story or a drama? In fact, it's nothing ... except for the loss of time and money.
