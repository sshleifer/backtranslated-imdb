This is the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's fairly overlooked and pretty fun. I think those who did the movie did not want it to be your typical Hollywood movie quality. It's just a dumb movie about a serial killer that is soaked in a toxic waste that causes a reaction to it and snow (as if it's in the middle of winter). Then he turns into a murderous snowman who is enough to laugh. This movie is really stupid, but funny. The murders are hilarious. I would not advise you to go and buy it (as I did - the lid looked good!), But if it happens to be on a TV one evening and laugh then put it.
