I can not stand the majority of reality shows, and this is the worst of those with Paris Hilton, and I'm sure it's his company. But, "how much you are now fired" or "you are hired"? After watching the show, I would not want to work for a guy with his ego and everything, and I think that watching the dye has more entertainment valves. Say "Donald I gave up and took some money and bought a decent hairstyle." I see that he even tries to buy glory in VVE. I hope he will be hurt, so I no longer have to see his pathetic face. It must be sad that you want fame so bad and you do not have the talent and try to buy it. I would give this impression a negative stamp if I could, but I got 1 and it does not deserve it.
