Packing implies that Varren Beatty and Goldie Havn are pulling a big bank robbery, but that's not what I pulled out of it! I did not get anything! In the first half there is a new character (without introduction) in every other scene. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, there is only one long, boring, underlined scene of a chase. There is always an irritating sound in the background, whether it's a loud clatter of clocks, a sharp siren, a whistle on the train, or even a terrible result of Kuinci Jones. There are many parts that are also ridiculously bad. Like, poor guys Jure Beattie on thin ice with CAR! Or, the police come to the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
