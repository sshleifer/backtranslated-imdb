This film describes the experiences of several killers (one of them Burt Reinolds), prostitutes and two kueens in a space of several hours a night in Miami. Convergent stories eventually bring all people to one place and time. The film was slightly fun, but the big problem was that everything was going on at night and that many scenes were not sufficiently exposed to the extent that it was impossible to see what was happening. In several scenes you can see where they tried to "grow" the development process to save the images. Someone did not know how to manage the camera. It's unbelievable that this movie has even been released!
