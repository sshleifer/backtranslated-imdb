It was made in 2007, and CG was bad for a film made in 1998. In one part of the movie, there is a record of stopping a dinosaur that looks good, but it just makes an extremely amateur work on the things of the CG up. Writing, acting, acting and everything else in this movie is simply terrible. This is bad, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure shit! Again, as with other films, the only terrible thing about this movie is that it's really made and now it's broadcast on the sci-fi channel. I still can not understand how they somehow indicate people who have some acting skills to act in these films and then somehow make them behave terribly like everyone else in the movie. For those of you who are not sure, the second poster is obviously sarcastic in your review ... or is one of the people who worked on this movie.
