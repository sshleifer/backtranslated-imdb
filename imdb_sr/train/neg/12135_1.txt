Although it's been two years ago, I still remember the complete waste that consists of the entire action of the film. Unfortunately, I came across this movie after my friends and I chose it while we were reviewing new releases on the Blockbuster. We decided to choose a movie because it was the only one we did not see and it sounded like it could be comfortable. Although it's been a long time since I watched a movie, I still remember the lack of action (seriously, there is no real plot), and the total waste of time spent watching the movie. If you are in the video and this movie catches your eyes, go on and find a better movie. If you've finished watching this movie, I understand your pain :)
