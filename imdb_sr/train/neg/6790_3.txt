Ohhh brutality, ohhhhh dying breeds, ohhhh feeling loss, ohhhh prejudice! Jesus, when will all of you, boring revisionists stop analyzing Verners for loud crying? S ** t happens. If it offends your socially-sensible sensibility, return to the comfort of your Meril Steep collection. Boring, boring and very tedious waste from celluloid - especially in the light of the presence of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen. Nothing interesting or intriguing here, unless you are obsessed with the desert dentistry of the 19th century. Maybe it was a little better without the constant redirection of a Mexican guy with a bad tooth. Monument to the stupid ultra left-handed sensitivity 60/70. It's almost impossible to sit through the whole movie. I think I'd rather open my eyes for the whole Luckie Luke / Trinity series. 4 Horses / 10-all deader'n hell.
