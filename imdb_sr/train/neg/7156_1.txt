Dooohhh! My Bvainn Hurrrts! Well, that's certainly true after this film's endurance test. As I managed to continue without pressing the rewind button, only the Lord knows. Maybe I am! Maybe I do not get the premise of the movie ... or maybe I do not appreciate it as an alleged mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, the movie has so much mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds. In addition, all the characters were horrible and has more character development in the Tom & Jerry cartoon. Iaarrrghhh! Why am I doing this? Why do I look at such a bag? It's enough to escape and join a monastery or a Legion of Aliens !! IAARGH !! An absolutely horrible movie in every way. Besides, it's not bad.
