I was endowed with this film because it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women who fell in love with one in love with a younger man. Intriguing. NO! I hurry to add. All these women are drawn into an extreme caricature, they do not support each other and make a conspiracy and try to lower each other. but they were given a sad scenario here and were told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which does not work too well when all women are famous professionals in a very small town. And for intelligent women spend a whole lot of time and patronize the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I felt that much more could be done from him due to a decent script and more tension. - fuck the baby, give me a cigarette! That's right. As I said, the shame of waste. 4 of 10
