One star for the "plot". One star for acting. One star for synchronization in America. Five stars for Monika Broeke and Inge Maria Granzz, with their tendency to take off all their clothes. And ten out of ten for the divine Emmanuelle Beart, two years before making "Manon des sources." Beart is a couple of times pulling, but even completely dressed, enough to make this movie visible. Watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about three "first time" for a girlfriend. It's rough, but much more erotic than the rather funny choreographed "love scenes" with Brooke, Granz and Patrick Bauchau. By the way, cinema is not big; Final show photos are a better indicator of what David Hamilton is capable of.
