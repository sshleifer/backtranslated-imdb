I like Chris Rock, but I feel lost in this movie. The idea of ​​reorganizing Heaven Can Vait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the action of this party too close. When Eddie Murphi reworked Dr. Doolittle and The Nutti professor, he completely reiterated them - so they became Murphy's films / vehicles, and not just the tiny remake. That's why they were successful. If Chris did the same, this could be a much better movie. A few laughs when she makes her standup routine - so she could do a concert movie. It would be much more fun to be a white man whose body he is being driven by a truck driver or a hillman. So why Hollivood continues to make such trash? Because people go to see him - because they love Chris Rock. Give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Do not record movies that were not so good!
