Anyone who is a nineteenth-century jester, a dress from the 1920s, Charleston and an ultra-shocking yacht (eg Ja, by all counts) will want to like this movie. But the sad fact is that it's all there is. The action is banal and obvious, the acting is mostly or terrible or is played on the fascist side of the event, and when the whole thing is there, there is not much else but the impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a beautifully made bad movie.
