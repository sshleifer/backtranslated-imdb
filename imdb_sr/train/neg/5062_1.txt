This film is bizarre. Better to say, it's "weird wonder". I could give you a brief overview, or some analysis, but I think it's a waste of time. All they need to know about this movie are two young sisters, an incestuous relationship, a murder, a murder after death, and one really disturbing fall in love. At the end of the film, you feel like you have to dry out and wash away the dirt from yourself, but not in a good way, like after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It's like being a teenager (or a high school girl I'm still a teenager) and I just did something that you: wished you did not, and B: hope the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never find out. And nobody likes it. My advice is that instead of desecrating your mind and watching a piece of ruthless cinematic dirt, you just waste your time to something less terrible and watch "Kazaam" (yes, I'd rather watch "Kazaam" than "Murderous Maids," read what you want.
