After I was just watching FIVE THROUGH EYES, I have to be honest ... I just did not like it. I read so many good reviews about this movie, but I just did not get where those reviews came from. I have a lot of time for newcomers to film a movie, and I am sure that the directors will be good for themselves, but the main problem was that they had the budget they had, that in the whole movie were used two cameras (which it was ok), but they looked like really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, all these girls scream and scream at the same time, they all talk about each other - it's just impossible to hear what they say. It had a good idea to go for it, in short, they hit a parked car, and then drove out, soon afterwards they were chased by collapsing cars, driven by crazy women who were killing them, and there are many шансы. to do it! ... and on the other hand girls have a lot of chance to escape, but do not! Very frustrating ... I've only damaged this!
