Vov. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I watched the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, a popular girl with a hot guy in sports and stumps her friends who are determined to be the queen of arriving. She needs to save the world as a warrior, and Shin help her to help her martial arts. Shin teaches the skills of a snake, a tiger, and so on. And he must learn some techniques for saving the world. This film is great for children who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture. but acting and casting were terrible. Brenda Song is a comic actress and I do not see that she plays a serious role. It was ridiculously loud, funny, watching her cry over the Tire. Shin could not work at all, and everything was totally incredible. I watched this movie and tried to come up with something similar, and the thing I thought was Pover Rangers. This film is so fake and acrobats were so powerful Ranger-esquire that it was just fucking and stupid. The characters were not nice and I just could not stand watching them. Disney really needs time to make decent movies. High School Musical is the only film that deserves to be on Disney Channel, along with other films such as Jumping Ship, Friendship Color, Go Figures, Read It and Veep, and Stuck in Suburbs. If you love action adventure and wacky jokes, this movie will appeal to you.
