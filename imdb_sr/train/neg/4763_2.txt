The main reason for writing this review is that I found this "revision" of a great drama and decent film from 1972, a terrible film experience. If I can save somebody from watching, I would do something good. This "new" version is full of talent, and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh is a good ugly, sterile set. He continues to film a movie from every possible artistic, disturbing, lonely point. We see reflections of stainless steel actors, security monitors, footage of their heads 200 feet above, close eyes, chin, and so on. The scenario, which is the winner of the Nobel Prize, introduces a long unfavorable homosexual joke, which they mutually lie, .... I mean? Considering the character of the "knitting" to know? The characters themselves, so richly drawn in the original, are rude and impolite. The driving time is shortened in an hour, which is either a real problem or the nicest thing the director has done for us. Actors effectively perform their lines, but nothing they say or do do mean convincingly. Jude Leo is on top of Caine, but as a meritorious Producer, he must have had Branag's blessing. . Why is it even made? The paid public spent less than $ 4 million worldwide to see it! A piece that is emptied at every step.
