I liked it, but I think I was ironing at the same time. This processing of Cirano de Bergerac / Rokanne is extremely undemanding, a formic romcom saved from direct to video-embarrassment about his release with a sharp turn of Janeana Garofalo. Playing Frasier of Pets, she finds himself caught in a love trap when uncertainty leads to the passing of her best friend (Uma Thurman) as herself when the caller comes to court. This is an interesting movie in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin. The average British actor gave a Hollywood movie tape record with this film. He is inconceivable and his anonymity in studio productions is not surprising on this basis, although he appeared in significant films in later films by Terence Malick. Uma Thurman creates an autopilot, and Michael Lehmann pays them all competently. Icki phone sex though. 4/10
