Somewhere, buried deep in this film, half a time is a decent movie that tries to get out. The only traces are several early scenes in Los Angeles (in the bar and cemetery), and thereafter a few pieces of production design. As I said, deeply buried. One of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving supernatural is how characters react faithfully in incredible situations. Annie Mcenroe's reaction to her being told that her sister (probably Dee Vallace from the first movie) was (bio?) Vukodlak, if I remember, by model; "Oh really?" Not one of the better answers to this challenge. Their sequences continue as the story moves to Transylvania in search of Stirb (supposedly self-appointed) "The Queen of the Werewolf". Like Stirba, Sibil Danning has two best things in the movie. Yes, even better than vocal group sex, Reba Brovna and actresses. Final credits have got a legendary status and are available in their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on Ioutube. Make sure to see why and remember, the whole movie makes the same amount of sense. If you accidentally capture this on US television, the credits are changed again to replace the endlessly repetitive Danning clip that has rolled off the top with another endlessly repeated shot of her coat opening only this time she has some kind of top below. It's some kind of absurd, a cherry blossom on top that defies satire.
