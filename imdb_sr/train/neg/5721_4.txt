I was not really a fan of the 2005 hostel, and most of these crazed nokaut-offs are just as bad or worse-yet Live Feed has somewhat entertained me for the first 30 minutes. I started with a lot of sex and squeezed the settings, followed by some good death scenes that included a Chinese organized crime unit and 7-foot meat bars, leather apron ... What kicked me out of the movie was a strong 'hero' with Weapons and daytime saving energy ... I would call this film central, at best, since my space, which mainly includes sneering young people who are slaughtered in a bad porn theater, doubled as a hideout for a mafia, an attractive menu. If only torture was sufficiently prolonged to be completely effective, then my rating would differ significantly. Unfortunately, most of the horrors are gathered in one scene, leaving the rest of the film to be concluded as a revenge-type scenario. So, basically, it's just a low-budget "hostel" that goes off with the use of free sex, almost constant during the first half of the movie ... All in all, I would say that you do not bother with this.
