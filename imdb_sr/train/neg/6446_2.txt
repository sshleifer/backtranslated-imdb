The West Society was given the idea that India is a poor country. Films like these just reinforce those beliefs. Such illustrations make it difficult for Indians to be accepted overseas. It was agreed that the poor and homeless are in India, but why there is no representation of educated people, if not successful. I totally hated the idea that the film shows Patrick Swayze as another Mother Teresa. In my opinion, this film showed India in a very bad light, giving the wrong ideas. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. That's exactly why people ask me: "When we go to India, can we rent an elephant in front of the airport, so we do not have to walk on roads that are so full of dirt and snakes?" Those who want another opinion about the contemporary Indian society should watch "Monsoon Vedding".
