The case is the best part of the film, but it is not worth the purchase price by itself. I was expecting a movie "based on a true story" just to find a video clip of poor recordings associated with the pathetic acting and unrelated scenes of a slaughterhouse. Video scenes have had numerous rewinding situations that were probably used to extend the character length, not the effects. I started this review before I was halfway through the film and waited for it to end only in case there was a better end, but, low and hard, it only worsened. If I could mark it down, it would be a negative ten. Learn from my mistakes and save money and time with this.
