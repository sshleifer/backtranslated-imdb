Interestingly, the novel is a complicated basis for two films. While The Heiress was a good, if not quite precise, adaptation, the Washington Square was a heavy hand and behaved badly, apart from Dr Sloper's work, a movie that could have been much better. The director was trying to make a 'beautiful' scene so obvious that I really screwed up. It has no unimpaired and simple beauty that a complicated film can have, such as Onegin. I agree with other comments on Leigh's view of Catherine as an idiot, instead of naive and shy; She made me despair and I did not feel it. Katherine's transition from childhood confidence in adult cynicism, the whole thing of the story, was internalized, just as she was in a novel. But we do not benefit from the narrative voice to tell us that in the movie! I think someone has skipped the adaptation classes at the film school. I appreciate the director's attempts to make a moving and beautiful heavy-text movie, but it just did not work.
