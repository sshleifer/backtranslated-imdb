Bobbi is a stupid kid who is too funny and wants sex. So he buys a van to help with this quest. The acting is poor, the comedy is pathetic, and the script is nothing but a loosely dashed chain of clichés and cheap excitement. Film producers obviously wanted to capture some of the craziness of other films of that time, but they fell far. They even resort to bobbing to slip on the skin of the banana, as it will allegedly add comedy value. I'm fighting to find the feature of the movie. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito kind of role - but he is just a minor actor and there is for clichés.
