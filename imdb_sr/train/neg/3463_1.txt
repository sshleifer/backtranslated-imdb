I saw this film some evening and I must honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is fair, but the plot is totally ridiculous. The killer was born because of the "energy used to shoot a movie" and if the movie burns the killer will die? How incredible is that? The characters were the weakest developed to say ... for example, suddenly a person mentions "Do not you try to finish the film because your mother could not?" So, we should agree with this? We had no idea that this was her daughter to half the film. The film did not show anyone any attention, we did not know anything about the main people who survived except for Ringwald's character who was a violent actress. . I do not really want to know who they are. It seemed that things rushed to get to the killings. The whole shop was completely weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed. Anyone who enjoyed this shipment should obviously learn something about the film. I can not believe that anyone agrees to act or even work on this picture. It was not funny, it was not scary and there was a clich√© through the whole movie. I discovered that I had predicted what would happen before each scene, which believed that it was not hard for me to work at all. It's a shame and deeply sorry that I spent an hour and a half watching the mess. 1/10.
