I gave this show (I only saw seven episodes) of four stars because it seems that most of her jokes / sets fail. Some are not funny, but some are fun - in some ways a 12-year-old. It reminds me of a New York painter who throws paint on a canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws what he has, including a kitchen sink, while she prays that a few things hold the wall in her endeavor to be ridiculous, but different. enough, as if she was missing the kind of good comedy that she was following, she should succeed. The whole enterprise is like potatoes.
