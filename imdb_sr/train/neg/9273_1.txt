The first question that comes to mind after watching this garbage is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the name Omen on this movie? It's a shameful, shameful, pathetic attempt to continue Omen franchise. When the movie starts, the music for playing sounds like it was raised directly from the Bugs Bunny Cartoon and since then the movie has got worse! I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet he got E - because they took him back to show his teacher! After a while, it is difficult to say whether it is a comedy, because what is happening is so funny and not so faithful to the original Omen, it prophesies the belief. The acting is funny, especially from the leading ladies Faie Grant. is she constantly dragging nonsense or is she laughing hard? It's hard to say. The worst continuation I ever had was an accident to testify. 1 of 10
