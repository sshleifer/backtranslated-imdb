The initial shot was the best thing in this movie, because it gave you the hope that you will watch a passionate, well-built independent movie. Damn that opening is for me. As the "movie" progressed slowly, boring, my thoughts differed from this "movie": Was there too much popcorn in popcorn? Did the actors have to pay for the director to be in this "movie"? Did I get my ticket confirmed at the box office? Yes, dear readers. I saw this movie in the theater! It would be the only exception when I would watch a movie at home via cinema, because it can be turned off at home. Were there any redemption values? Peter Lemongelli, as a standard "nerd" at college, had his moments, especially in the dog necklace. In addition, this "film" went from attempts to be a comedy, to a family drama of spiritual excitement. He failed on either of these fronts. Oh, and the girl was totally bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
