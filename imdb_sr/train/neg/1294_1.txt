It seems that the central theme in this film is confusion, because relations, environment, acting and social context lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be outside his element and he misses his usual impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. To make things worse, the name of his character is 'Che', and we are just told (directly from the narrator) well in the film that he is not 'that' Che, just a man named Che. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and when they are defined, the family is divided - the younger generation goes to America. It's clickable. Other reviews reveal how the film shows the impact of the revolution on the boy's family; However, the political position of the director is at best unusual, and we are never sure who is responsible for what is bloodshed. So they lost the property (acquired gambling profit) - so what? Refusing to take a political stance, when making a film about the Cuban Revolution, is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention the film is in English! Why all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they did not get permission to shoot in Cuba. And if family life is the most important thing to look at here, it would be great if we could figure out who we were "presented" at the beginning - a cheap way to make the relationships clear through the film! The play was mostly shallow, woody and incredible, time was everywhere. 'Special' visual effects were confusing and confusing. Referring to American films - and black characters like the Greek choir - are strictly free, intellectually intelligible and consistently unreasonable. I watched the whole movie just because I waited for clarity, or I pointed to something. Never happened.
