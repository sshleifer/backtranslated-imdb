If someone wants to understand Hitler, read the history of World War I, not the history of World War II. Find out what happened during the war, how soldiers had to live around dead bodies all the time. Since so many soldiers went crazy, from what they saw during the First World War, at the time they called it "shocked" now they call it a post-traumatic stress disorder. If you find out the real horrors of World War I, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand that a human being can become insensitive to death, not because of their evil, but simply because it was the only way that they too face the horrors around them. many others do it. Read some books on this topic and you should watch the movie "The Roads of Glory", the only good movie ever recorded. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in this film, the feeling of helplessness and a complete devaluation of human life, nothing more than a bullet catcher. point to the understanding of Germany. The lost war, in which millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, without the real reason. Then the final economic collapse comes after the war. These are factors that create extremism. The loss of family members and mass poverty will always lead to extremism. Unfortunately, this film ignored these factors, and it has just become another piece of shit that is thrown into the pile. With really no real value, there are fictional movies based on fictional characters that can give you a better idea of ​​Hitler than he does. They just dropped Hitler's name on this, to sell more.
