Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a lively, hot, powerful Hollywood couple, recorded this (almost) scene for the remake action scene of Steve McKueen-Ali MacGrav, an action fighter on a fugitive. He almost worked for the first time because McKueen was such a vital presence on the screen - even a rocky and tired one, you could feel his watch ticking, his cagey magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McKueen's league but has his charms and is probably a versatile actor - if so, it's not a showcase for his attributes. Basinger works well and certainly looks good, but James Voods is artificially stunned in the stupid role of mob-magnet. The sub-store that included a second pair captured by Baldwin's former partner was unbearable in the 1972 movie. And he's playing even worse. As for the action scenes, they are a pretty old hat, causing them to wonder: why even process the original? ** from the ****
