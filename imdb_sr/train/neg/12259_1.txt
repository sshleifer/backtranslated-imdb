A movie about a bunch of some filmmakers who want to make a documentary about a new type of surfing in the sea. As an absolute admirer of films, including some kind of evil animals or monsters, I thought this could be my kind of movie ... there was no !!! This should be more guidelines for not doing so! It has a lot of random humor, and the evil beast is an incredible joke, in the final scene it goes after the main characters * roll *, legs obviously waving in the air! Looks funny! Good for laughter. Whether it was just because of the lack of talent between actors, unpleasant stupid dialogues and hilarious stupid crocodiles, at least it would be worth laughing, but worsening: I suppose, the people who led this film noticed how bad it was, so they thought of the old idea about "sexual sales" ... Totally, I think completely without reason, one of the main actresses shows her breasts of beast. And somewhere in the beginning there is some kind of meaningless "invention". This is the last ingredient that makes the film absolute waste. It's amazing how people actually spend time on the production of such garbage! If you are looking for a real time loss: watch this movie !!!
