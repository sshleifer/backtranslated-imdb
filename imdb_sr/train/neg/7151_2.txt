I am proud to say that I have seen all three films Fast and Furious. And I'm happy to see the fourth. Do you want to know what the difference is between the triple and the redline? All three were made by highly competent directors, all filming films in the other direction, equally exciting. Redline looks like a producer selected by a dozen women with whom he slept on a casting sofa, made them additions, and then picked up his guides from the Hollywood line for unemployment. And the script. One. The mysterious science theater 3000 is bad. This was in the 70s made for a TV movie bad. , but you really can not see that many in action, and the action is directed so badly that you can not get excited about the pottery, If cars do not delight you, why go into this kind of movie? I'm in the crowd with a crowd of teenagers, and I can not stop laughing loudly. This was just a debacle. Rent F & F Movies. Go to the Nascar Race. Enter the kart track and race.
