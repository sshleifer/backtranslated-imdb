The space was sucked in, but it was clear about 30 seconds in the fact that this was David Linch or something seriously terrible. It is interesting to look only through a list of fundamentalist rubbish. I can be a pillow for an exciting spiritual piece (Romero comes to my mind), but there was nothing spiritual about this. It seems that the message is that we all have to pretend that we have a score of 80 (or just get a lobotomy - Jennifer what happened to you?) And follow the Bible blindly without any self-examination or we'll run the others coming. Such is the attitude that makes people fly a jumbo nozzle in 110 buildings (I work behind the angle of the former VTC). I like to think that God is a little bigger than that.
