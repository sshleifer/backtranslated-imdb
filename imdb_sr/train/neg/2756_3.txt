{rant start} At first, I did not want to trust them, but I guess that's what people talk about when they say that the South Korean cinema has reached the peak and can even go downhill. After a surprisingly entertaining and moving monster movie "Gvoemul" (called "The Host") in 2006 - who actually managed to make sharp satirics from the genre of B-film - successive Korean blockbusters became more and more generic, although their Budgets (mostly spent on special effects) have become more fantastic. Do South Korean filmmakers really want to spend all the audience and good will of investors, which their industry built from Shiri / Sviri in 1999, making a series of large budgetary core films such as China? {rant end} The only "reason" I can imagine for filming this movie is that investors invest in financing the most detailed and finest digital dragon animation in the Korean / East Asian style I have seen so far, for final scene. Now, if they introduced this dragon at the beginning and gave him more personalities and purposes than in "Dragonheart" in 1996, the movie might have several more qualities that can be used apart from having many digitally animated dragons. You remember "Dungeons & Dragons" 2000? Has not anyone found out that the trick is not how many special effects you use, but how do you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use because they have just killed a great international interest in Korean legends about the dragon's way of capturing this one. In short, I agree with all the negative reviews that preceded and wonder how Koreans thought their folk anthem "Arirang" was playing at the very end. As a creature, I would give it at least 5 stars out of 10 if special effects or action sequences were worth it, but I've seen a lot of video games with better work and scripts (just few dragons).
