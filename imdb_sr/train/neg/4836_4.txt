Let's start with simple lines. From the side of the audience, there are a couple of good "details of the director", some points of view on the movie scenes that are beautiful. Special effects are good enough, and good acting / good scene. But the story is too simple. This shows how the elite unit of the bombing army lives, acts and sometimes dies. It shows the drama of life in the war. In my film experience as a serious action movie "Addicted" guy, I missed that click that my eyes and my mind were on the screen. One of the things that should be present in a movie to be considered a good ability is to get the viewer into a movie reality and time. It did not happen to me. I stayed "conscious" for the whole movie. Honestly speaking, I think this film has gained its place in glory based on the "subconscious" attraction of American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not an adequate use as a movie starter. More than a film about war, its popularity grows on that basis. Simple thought: if this was the second world war or film, we just change the time, and everything is the same, would this be rewarded? Surely not. Why? Because there are great ones who raise the way to the heights. Compared to my rivals in the Oscars, I do not think that all the rewards that they have won are accurately rewarded.
