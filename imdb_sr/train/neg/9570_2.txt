For the first time in years, I felt the need to apply today to IMDb to get rid of this movie by writing a review, because it was just such a way to look. The action sounded great when I read it, I expected a minimal mysterious thriller, claustrophobic phantom hunting. Unfortunately, everything is so sweaty by the mundane, fatigued love story, and too many hidden and dumb-looking stupid "non-say-things-like-this-except-bad-film" -dialogs that it's only agony. Here's the quick shortening of the worst offense of this movie: - The script relies so much on the coincidence and inexplicable and unlovable nonsense of the main characters that it's just funny. No, actually, it's angry. And lazy. - About it: Cheap excitement. A long procession of "just" moments. <br /> - Main characters. All right, it seems that the scriptwriter never experienced real human beings in real life, but he got all his knowledge from bad films. So his characters are boring, lifeless clich√©s of the second generation. They are mere planning devices, carriers of the place without the least qualities. They are "a man and a woman who are still in love". I've never seen it before, except in 100,000 movies and it does not become more realistic or more comfortable. Think of the most beautiful two-dimensional Hollywood card and you have it. There is no character in this film that is even fresh, charming or interesting. - A strained, vague resolution that swings greatly and needs only one push to crash, although the word "resolution" may not be appropriate here, because the movie is a wet mess that does not go anywhere anyway. By the time you finish, you no longer care. The last third of the movie I just forwarded, because it was so unbearable to watch. Okay, that's it. Whatever these films are, everything will be buried under incompetence. Do not look at this shit.
