Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular is only affecting the mind. This show is not funny, it's not smart, it's not genuine, it's just a bunch of shit bulls. To start with the characters. The characters are one-dimensional morons with loud, excessive voices that sound only like nails on the board. The voice could have been better. Then there is animation. My God, it hurts my eyes only by watching him. It's all too flat, too spicy, too light, and coated with sweets. Then there is humor, or lack of it. It's totally idiotic! They just take these jokes of B-class that are not so funny at all and then repeat them to death. They also insert some senseless humor that bother me. And finally, the last and the least, music. It's just embarrassing. It sounds like it's composed on a child's computer and does not create emotions at all. I wish the result was less than 1, indeed. This show should be seriously canceled. It's a show I'm trying to avoid as a plague. Whenever I hear a song about the subject, I switch off the TV immediately. If you've never watched this show then do not. Watch quality programs like Simpsons or Futurama.
