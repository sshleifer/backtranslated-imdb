The basic premise of this film is a political cartoon. I suppose that for those who do not know anything about the reality of the army, this is probably a film that feels good about gender equality. Indeed, the recent commentator said: "It allows women to know that they can do everything they want." Vhat claptrap! No one, a man or a woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore "refuses" SEAL Hell Sunday in the early 27 weeks of the BUDS sessions for several sessions at the local gym and herself to her wish for the SEAL to simply fail. There is about 80% of the school dropout rate in what is undoubtedly the harshest military training program - those who voluntarily give up, can not compete at the physical level, suffer a frequent physical injury during training or can not cope with psychological harassment. I never overcame the superficiality of the fictional, alleged message of this film. In the real world, Demi would not endure the first 24 hours in this sharper and sustainable physical training. The desire alone will not do it. Skip this movie as a desirable reflection, and better spend your time reading "The Varrior Elite" Dicka Coucha (Crovn, Nev Iork 2001) for the best description of what really happens in this training. Bell, Demi! <br /> <br />
