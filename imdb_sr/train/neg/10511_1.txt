Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is when you realize that you just lost 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless that it's offensive. > The premise sounded a little promising: it was not. It's just an excuse to use the same lame pieces from other low-budget films that were not good. The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if it turned out that the film was terrible: it was not. That's not the case. Amateur cinema ensures that "fallen angels" are sexy as well as an average homeless person. and the action of a smaller budget. When I think about it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and has since been praying at concerts of horror. But, let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to be made. Movie. Everything else is negative. Obviously, the writer is allergic to originality. The scenario is terrible. That's all that is given after the first 10 minutes. But a sinless pacing; the way the director treats the "plot" and "characterization" as an obstacle he thinks nobody cares; and exciting long and boring rides, walking and natural arrays (no doubt added to prolong the time for the film to qualify for distribution) show a complete lack of ability to film and talk stories in general. This is another good example of how you can check if the movie will be bad: If it was written and directed by the same person, expect the garbage.
