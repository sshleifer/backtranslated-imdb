How sadly there is no possibility to place a mark lower than 1. I was watching this piece of nonsense and I could barely believe what I was looking at. Every part of the movie was terrible. Music, acting, direction, story, everything, just everything. In fact, I found myself laughing loudly at various places in the movie. I was especially glad that our hero slowly goes through the hospital in a soft focus, and throws a clipboard from the nurse's hands, because ............. well. Just because. Product placement space? Crucifix? Everywhere. If you are a Christian believer and you are very pleased, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to get out.
