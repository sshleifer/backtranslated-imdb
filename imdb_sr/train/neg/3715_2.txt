The blacksmith becomes a rich whiteness, and it seems that the rich whiteman accepts hip-hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments of this film are played out of this. The problem I have is that it does not work and it almost never works. OK, so nobody would expect Lance to grab such a body and suddenly start to act like Charles Wellington. That would be too much. I'll give it. But at the same time, it goes too far in the other direction. Should I imagine a rich whore singing rap and totally returning things, playing like a bastion of hip-hop culture, and people just accept it? And what about Sontea, who falls in love with him as a rich white man, although he does not care about his money or power? This is so incredible that it's not even funny. I just could not stop the unbelief and I could not finish the movie. I added another star because it made me laugh a few times, even hard. But I just could not cross the whole "hip-hop hip hop" that has never been well-made in any movie I've ever seen to try it. This was no exception.
