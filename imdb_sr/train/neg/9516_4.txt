Frank Sinatra plays the former soldier and frustrated writer, who is hard and opiates, who returns to his hometown of the Midwest and reunites with his alienated brother (Arthur Kennedy), now a city that was a great drunk with an unmarried woman and stubborn daughter. Frank intertwines with gamblers Dean Martin, an uneducated shoe of Shirley MacLaine, and has some trouble with the law, but what he really wants is to write and calm down with a good wife. An overly-simplistic drama that comes down to the soap opera, and MacLaine is in the role of "colorful" and embarrassingly sentimental (her pawn strap on "After Iou Gone" is still the culmination of the film, and is professionally engaged in it). Director Vincent Minnelli oversees him in the right way, but he is in surprisingly dark moods and most of the big scenes are straight or thick. The picture looks incredibly nice in the wide screen, with a nice eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the remains. ** from the ****
