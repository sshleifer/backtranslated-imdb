A well-entrenched entry into the genre of a serial killer who, unfortunately, gets bogged down in his pretentiousness to be truly satisfying. Villem Dafoe is remarkable as a detective in New York trying to find what appears to be an imitator using the same renaissance killing techniques used in a series of killings he had solved years earlier. Scott Speedman is a younger Dafoe partner and they have pretty good chemistry (at least for some time). Other characters appear to link two cases together. Clea Duval is a friend of a former victim and Peter Stormare is some sort of artistic broker / mentor for Dafoe ... it's a little harder to take, although Stormare, of course, is never boring. The end of the film is particularly disappointing. Take a quick look at Deborah Harry, like Dafoe's less than a future neighbor.
