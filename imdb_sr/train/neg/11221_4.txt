Lolita is an insurgent and she will share some small sexual stories between our sci-fi and fantasy ... Well, this production of Surrender Cinema is not very good: very bad acting, horrible music and a story without any story and any line . But sex scenes are pretty well made, many lesbian scenes, and Jackwelline Lovell, as beautiful as The Ekotic House of Wak, offers us a very good final and very hot strip shov. Only Lovel's fans.
