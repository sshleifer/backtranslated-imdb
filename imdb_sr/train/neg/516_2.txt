Have you ever noticed how in his later films the laughter of Burt Reinolds sounds like brakes? Must have been too much with Hal Needham. Ace ", too. Can you believe it's based on a book? I could not, but it was. And probably not a bestseller, I bet. Burt is still one good old man in the NASCAR circle that connects with Beatti as a baking chicken with a design in his team. Anderson has an interest in love, and Nabors makes his many Gomer Pile impressions as a loyal mechanic / best friend of Lugs. friends of Burt's or Hal's friend, others had to work. Even the real NASCAR drivers are entering into action and seeing they have more talent than those with SAG cards, as for laughter, Bubba Smith (pre-"Police Academy") gets them as a Beattie driver, and Petersen, in the full Elvira mode, gets a lot of complimentary letters as a lady who wants to meet Lugs well. REAL VELL. It's a pity that Burt threw so much time and effort into a movie like Stroker Ace, where it did not matter if he was trying or not. They did not try to write him a character, Why are you tormenting yourself? Two stars. Mostly for Petersen, and for leaving at the end. Now they're funny.
