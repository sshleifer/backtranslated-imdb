I was also deceived by packing. And I fell in love with the bloody packaging and DVD case that claims to be "mourned fans because each copy is withdrawn from the shelf." Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it was not all that was worth - there was no fear, and very limited bloodyness. The finish was very cheesy and did not deliver the blow he needed to have. I really do not know how it became "Video Nasti" with how much it is very pitiful. The story turns away, the characters are obvious actors amateurs ... does not fulfill the promise. The DVD feature ("interview") is very strange because the director seems very inconsistent, not everything there. The main actress talks as if she appeared in Shakespeare's production. It's a big laugh.
