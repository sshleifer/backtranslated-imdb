It's one of those drama that's so bad to get hit hard when it's very funny, the script is absolutely terrible, dire, horrible, illuminates a clean armature, the only thing that leaves it out of the truth so bad is the good feeling that the sound is design just pretty bad; He does not give any uncertainty to the story, although he tries, but does not destroy at least any kind of talk. There are problems with the continuity of the door shooting season. Last but not least, the acting is terrible. For a professional production, he has a great deal of the feeling of a university media project, you have to pity for the sorrow for anyone who has to designate this.
