Complete drivel. An unhappy manifestation of hypocrisy, toxic culture ten years ago. In this film, a pedestrian regret for bondage goes hand in hand with colonial subtexts (boring redhead that feeds rice Shake?). Forget the historical reality. Did not most western slaves come from West Africa? The American slave easily seizes Shaku with a handful of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not have been more disgusting. Can you just imagine how he would pass in the miniseries? (Quickly inserted). The minisery was great, and it was sad that DH needed to grasp something unique, and make it modest. (I am inclined to think that he had a hand in creating this fiasco).
