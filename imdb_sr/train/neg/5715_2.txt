'Say Yes' is one of those movements that you hope will be better, but it never does. It's a kind of "psychopath with no motive" that decides to endanger the innocent perfume, loved by filmmakers. The dialogue is sloppy and in some places it is badly translated. The acting is equally poor, especially from the villain in a piece played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think he does not blink and trying to speak in a deep voice, makes his character look threatening, when everything he does really makes him a little simple. The plot deserves special attention. , because it is idiotic above all beliefs. 'Heroes' do not think it's too weird that their carriers are threatening to kill them. The "heroine" twice fails to see the criminal when he is only a few steps away from her. Zlikovac is passing by a police checkpoint (carrying blood covered with blood and a bloody twisted head) showing the corpses lit on the passenger seat of the car driving the policemen. The Zlikovac was hit by a shovel, stabbed with a shovel and rolled through the villas, but it seemed that they were never disturbed by these rather serious injuries. And do not even start with this terrible 'twisted' ending. The only plus in this movie, for me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very beautiful, but really nothing more than a central actress. All in all, this movie appears as a badly written, smooth and shocking-minded attempt to copy 'Hitcher' and 'Spoorloos', but it fails at every step because of the lack of talent for all involved.
