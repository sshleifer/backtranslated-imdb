fun: a trashy script that was typed on the road by nonintelligent people in front of typewriters .. a pathetic act that is shaken by a story ... set / location and a beautiful girl .. -rating 4/10 Social message: a movie There is no social message. I think he's free ... but if I pretend I have 10, and my IK 70. I feel the message: Do not be afraid of love? unpleasant things: nothing special, only a mild Jewish hedonistic and arrogant attitude presented by the writer / director. Generally speaking, well, nothing degenerate-8/10 <br /> <br /> overall rating is 4/10
