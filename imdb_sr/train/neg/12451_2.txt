This film is hilarious, not in a good way. The fighting is terribly badly done, and sometimes it will try to shock you by breaking the bones, and this happens only two or three times, definitely not enough to call it shock. Shooting means that a hero can enter the open field with 10 people shooting a tear, taking a pistol, starting to shoot and not hurt. The story is empty, the guy wakes up, he loses his memory, starts to fight, because that's what he's good at. Five years later, memories are coming back, taking revenge. It's not worth your dollar, it's not worth your time unless you're drunk and bored.
