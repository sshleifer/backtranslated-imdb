I saw this film at his premiere at Sundance 09. How is the American Beauti movie that has something to say, I had hopes for Tovelhead. Unfortunately, this was a disappointment. In fact, from the countless films I've seen on nearly a dozen Sundance festivals, Tovellhead is the only Sundance movie I ever wanted to leave early. The worst problem with Tovellhead is that it is so obviously derived from a collection of "provocative" concepts concerning cultural stereotypes, not organic human drama. The script comes from the novel Alicie Erian. I'm aware of the famous quote Edith Vharton: I never knew a novel that was good enough to be good despite being adapted to the author's political views. This observation is particularly disastrous to Tovelhead because his political views have soared and simplified. If there ever was a time when whites, Tovelhead's roses, coveted images of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it's a long past. any of the numerous expert reviews available on the Internet. Almost all critically evaluate this film and reveal the shallow and manipulative tissue on which it is based. On the other hand, reviewers amateurs look much easier. While reading reviews on these and similar pages, you will often come across superlative: "amazing," "amazing," "deep," "shocking" ... It confuses me to read them, but do not surprise me. Indeed, I have come across many people who seem to look at every book or film that deals with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues as deeply moving, provoking thoughts, full of insight. If you are such a person, surely rent a towel towel and start it. On the other hand, if you set your standards more, you can safely transfer this.
