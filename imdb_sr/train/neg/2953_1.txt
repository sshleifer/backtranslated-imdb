These reviews which claim that this film is so bad that the good ones are disappearing with it. This film has no mistake of satisfaction with Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli. These films were funny in their horror, but this crowd of dinosaurs is so bad that it's painful. I was not in this much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Babi Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start a review, I'll tell you a story. Theodore Rek is a bankrupt of $ 35 million, and Nev Line Cinema refused to put him in theaters. They reduced the losses and sent it directly to the video, which made it the most expensive film to be filmed in several decades. Vhoopi crashed to find himself in this disaster after a big salary. A wife of a policeman named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rek reluctantly joined forces to stop him after the death of a dinosaur friend. film all her mysteries. Then you have to face the fact that this movie is really horrible. Vhoopi looks anxious and tries to do it with his performance, but without success. Theodore Rek is boring, and his unruly behavior becomes thin after five minutes on the screen. Most of the jokes turn around him and threatens to bite people and hit people with their tail (accidentally and deliberately). I thought the breakthrough was bad, but in the back seat of Theodore Reek: the worst movie about Vhoopi's career. I did not see it when I was watching this movie. All I saw was a wreck of a train written by people who certainly had some adverse admiration for Howard The Duck. Humor is at that level and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's cousin. Totally ill from start to finish.
