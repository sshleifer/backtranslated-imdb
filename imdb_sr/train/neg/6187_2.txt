This is a briefly terrible disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was terribly awkward; I could not feel the feeling behind the words that were expressed by the characters. The lines were shipped too fast and they felt rather inadequate. They could also be quoted by statues. Chemistry between George C. Scott and Suzana York did not exist, and watching the American Rochester was strange. He could at least try to make a British accent. I love George C. Scott as an actor, but it just did not work. I felt like watching the most interesting events from Jane Eire, where the main parts of the story were randomly placed regardless of the course of the story. Nature and music were very nice, but I could not feel anything of the passion and love that should be between Jane and Rochester and the film left me completely indifferent. Good Version of Jane Eire I suggest you watch the BBC version in 1983 with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these two brilliant adaptations.
