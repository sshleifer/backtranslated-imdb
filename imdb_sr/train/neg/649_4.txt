OK, this movie is made for one reason and only for one reason FOR MAKING MONEY! Producers obviously did not care about killing a classic horror movie. I knew that this movie will suck as soon as it's pg-13 how good it turned out to be a good movie? It's like asking how much the woman was on the Moon? The answer is NO! Prom night in 1980 was not a masterpiece, but surely deserves to be recognized as a film that remains true to its genre and attempts to be something more than that. My problem with Prom Night 2008 is the way it handles the killer and I have 3 major problems with it ..................... <br /> <br /> /> 1) The way he escapes, he was imprisoned in the mental institution and escaped through air conditioning ventilation! WHAT THE HELL? Why would they have a ventilation fan in the patient room? Do they want to be comfortable during their stay or something? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain that the killer wants all the main families of victims and friends dead so that he could have it all to himself, says he loves but tries to kill her the next minute, so he wants to kill him. her, her, or just rape? 3) The killer is too good, how has he developed all his abilities? He used to be a teacher, so in this one scene where he killed the boy's main victims while he's basically on her sleep, and she does not notice, all the stupid 2 stars out of 10 terrible, stupid, stupid attempts a horror movie
