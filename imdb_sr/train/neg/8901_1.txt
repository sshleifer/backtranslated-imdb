I'll make this short and sweet .... this movie sucked !!!!!! I watched the first part earlier today and thought it was one of the biggest movies ever, it was given by 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought that maybe the second and third part would be good sequences, I made a mistake. This film bored me to death and was so different from the first that the plot went on and that's it. It was like a bad part of the first or second part. I love Voken, but I was sorry here. I was so happy that Glenn Danzig was in this movie, but do not blink. He was full of acting with stupid actors and people I do not like, such as Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, there was a gust of fresh air to see Ethan Embri, he is one of the funniest people on earth. This movie will make you look like the first one is a bit smaller, so do not look at it because you feel you owe it to yourself to be a fan of Part 1. I'll wait a few days before I look at Part 3 and I pray that it's better than this shit. Last scene film with lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on the movie. Fast forward or skip to this if you can not try the first part. 1 of 10 stars - it was awful!
