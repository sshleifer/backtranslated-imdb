When you get to the British movie, you expect some kind of quality. And when it comes to acting, working with the camera, lighting, etc.; this movie does business. This is done by highly qualified masters. Only this can bring you pleasure an hour and a half. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you do not find anything. In addition to feeling well and advocating a view of liberal medicines, there really is nothing there. The scenario is central, the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of Hollivood. In all of this is English taste, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty". Why did they film this movie? I have no idea, except that I make money naturally.
