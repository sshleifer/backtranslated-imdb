A very tired Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary who is struggling with his former employers for some gizmo that non-heroes plan to sell to "Iranians". The low-budget video of the producers of "Silk Stalkings" offer some decent action footage and a lot of incompetent "drama" ... a lack of logic and a really horrible dialogue are definite aspects, although the final outlines and loyalty of the move could be a good end for a better movie. Burt still has a presence, although that means you'll notice more when you're offensive sexually assembled "single-layer".
