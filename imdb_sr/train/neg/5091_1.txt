My comment is for the Russian version of the Space Race called Battle of the Cosmos (Battle for the Universe) shown on the First Russian Channel from April 10 to 13, 2006. The number of factual errors is such that it is impossible to enumerate them, especially in the first episode (development of the first projectiles). Even half of the film in the United States contains multiple errors and omissions. The audience is not familiar with the V-2 / A-4 launch from the United States. Apollo 1 should be launched on the Moon, etc. In the Russian half, every person is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of the NKVD, Glushko is a saboteur and a traitor, Mishin is an alcoholic, and so on. People as functions; without motivation, without life at all. Uniforms and decorations are terrible. Gagarin sings the frivolous song waiting for the launch (I think this is added especially for the Russian version).
