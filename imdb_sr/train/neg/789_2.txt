Five minutes after I watched this, I applied to IMDb to warn you not to bother with this movie ... genre: horror? there were moments of mild uncertainty and during the entire film I thought about myself: "Something Must Happen Soon" was not ... when the film was over, I felt so embarrassing for the writer / director that I was never the greatest admirer of patrick rea this guy easy he does not know how to make the movies and after watching this farewell pronunciation of horror flika, I went from not the biggest fan that I will not watch another one of his work. I took it in the summary of the action, please do not do the same error. I gave this movie 2 to actors .. they were not bad and there were no mistakes they got that way. bad direction ...
