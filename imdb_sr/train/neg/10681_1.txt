How sad, have so many of my "a" lists, and good "b" actors agree to work this movie, but they are, and that's what sucked me to watch it. I've never heard of this movie, but on the cover of the DVD was Cuba Gooding Jr., and James Voods in the background how bad is it? One word Very! This movie starts there are some turns, and then it just takes the egg. The ending was so weak as if the writer was called up and his four-year-old son sat down with a typist and put an end to it. How ironic for a movie called "The End of the Game" to be so poor. These are types of movies that can move "a" list of actors to "b" list in a hurry. I hope Cuba Gooding JR, and James Voods do not get used to this.
