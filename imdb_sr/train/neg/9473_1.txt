As a veteran of many, many pretentious French films, I thought I took the worst the industry could offer and that I could handle anything. But not this. Senseless, ruthless, violent, unpleasant, meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and random hate and aggression dressed as pretentious art. Avoid at all costs.
