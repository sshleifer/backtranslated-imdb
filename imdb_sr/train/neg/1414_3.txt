After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and read some reviews that they compared with Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I could immediately see the point of the reviewers. This film was a bad attempt on a similar topic. Interestingly, the film format is almost identical, but PACING is incredibly different. The "10 items" hit the viewer through the 1-day timeline of the movie, while the better-planned "Lost" appears to last for several days. I'm sure people will see this because Morgan Freeman, and will be disappointed. It seems that he now has better roles in supporting big blockbusters rather than leading roles in limited-release movies of $ 10 million and indie films.
