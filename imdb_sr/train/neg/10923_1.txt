A TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the United States in the 1920s during the recording of DeMille's first version of the 10th Commandment and which again woke up when DeMille's sets were found in the desert. movies I watched for a long time. The question is whether the filmmakers are serious or are they joking when they have shot this movie? If this is serious, it's a funny bad movie and a great movie that can be chosen because of its bad nature. If comedy is less good, but fun for all the wrong reasons. You will laugh long for this film, probably more than many other Hollywood "comedies".
