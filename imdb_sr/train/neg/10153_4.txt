SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> It's not really a good movie ... but I liked the idea behind it ... and the filmmakers have done it looks pretty good given the small budget had to work. The film is allegedly the "episode" of a live Japanese reality shov that sends several contestants into a sealed "dangerous zone" and then sends three costumed anger to kill them. The survivor, if he has it, conquers fame and fortune ... everyone else is just dead. The main disadvantage of this film is that the performance is pretty bad. None of the "real" people really does look real. Actors who play killers are fun ... because they show the syrus and superior cartoon of popular types of modern horror films ... and that's exactly how it would have been done that this is a real show. The movie turns out to be all in one move ... there is one cameraman who follows the competitors around the "dangerous zone" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights continue to flicker and exclude. constantly (to hide "cuts" from one to the other, I guess).
