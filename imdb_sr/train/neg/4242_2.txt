Men, do I love police movies filled with action, shooting, hunting, and so on. Boy, I was disappointed after watching this short and unsatisfactory movie. We've seen all of this before, hostages, banks, the environment ... However, 2 bad guys who are shooting down more officers and innocent people who simply stay on the line of fire - without being hit by some Kevlar. Br /> Not only a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Returning to the bank, where stupid hostages locked the safe or door when the bad guys came out. As the stupid actor said we would be. Okay, the shots between that fake documentary were good, but after I looked at the movie I got just the thought: why the police did not come? a decent shooting course? And why there are so many policemen there and was SVAT on a long break. Really bad.
