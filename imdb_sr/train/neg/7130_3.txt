This movie should be called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who did not play the Need For Speed ​​game, it's mostly hot cars and pretty women and almost without complication. This perfectly applies to Redline. The only thing about this movie that was A-Level are cars. The acting seemed forced and script, the premise was at best weak, and the plot almost did not exist. I was just watching this movie to see how bad it was and, although it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was fun. I wish they showed that Eddie Griffin had knocked down Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, do not pay for it, do not get lost on the way to see it, but if there is nothing else on Shovtime or HBO, it's a decent drawback.
