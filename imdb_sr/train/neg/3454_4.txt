Cut tries to be like most post-Scream slashers tried to be, a hoax in a horror genre that tried to be smart by referencing other well-known horror films. Now, I do not merge "Scream," as I think "Scream" is a very good horror movie that makes a big deal of joining horror and comedy. The cut is unsuccessful at most levels. It has its moments, but it does not work at all, even as "as bad as it is good" movie, just below the average. The first five minutes is fine and sets the story pretty well, except for the fact that Kilie Minogue can not really act, and ironically gets her tongue, go to the character. Go ahead for some time and a group of filmmakers wants to finish her film, which is obviously damned. And, as you have probably anticipated, one by one actors and team are slowly picked up by a masked madman. Non-genuine plot, bad acting and predictable end are some of the following elements. There are many references in the film, from Scream to The Tekas Chain Saved Massacre. Even this is not smart, it seems that the director wanted to feel clever and cold by mentioning other well-known horror flicks ala Scream. For slasher there is minimal mountain and no nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that does not have much to do with it. Indeed, I should support this film because I'm Australian and not so good when it comes to horror (but we have our own jewels), but Cut is definitely one of them. However, it kept me for 90 minutes or so, so that's at least something good. I would not recommend this to anyone other than hardcore slasher fans, who could appreciate what this film is trying to aim, but if you are looking for a good movie, go away. 2/5
