for all the subtle charms that this student film can contain, is anyone else boring until death, waiting for VENDINGO to show his paper-faced face? Anti-climax has pretty much ruined any momentum that had the speed to develop me. Do not misunderstand me, I'm all in the exploration of the dark dark underworld in America, but this is a bunch of nonsense that gets a glance only on the fact that it is p. Unfortunately, from a guy with wings. Best 2 minutes that movie can offer. I felt like I had discarded the DELIVERY, I could do better.
