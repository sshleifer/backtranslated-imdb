With a movie called "Gainiggers from Outer Space" how can you make a mistake? Just insert some of the great stereotypes for the characters, use Village People as the main soundtrack suppliers and throw tons of gai-gigs. The land is unimportant. Too bad, this film does not contain any of this and every joke misses the place. The characters are all similar to the German gainigger, one or two jokes work, the rest is not working. My expectation was obviously high.
