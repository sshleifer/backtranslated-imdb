The twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology about it - just like Star Trek. This is because there are many dedicated fans in the show, no matter what they think each episode is a winner. They are the ones who achieve each individual display 10 and can not objectively evaluate the performance. That's why I reviewed all of the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) because overall ratings and reviews were too positive. Now is the time to do the same for the twilight zone. While I achieved many episodes 10, this gets 3 simply because it was bad. Writing was actually annoyingly bad. Two people from the opposing sides in the Great War see themselves wandering through the whole episode. After a while, it is obvious that they are the only people who have remained on Earth - as you learned in a really dumb and totally unconvincing conclusion. Usually, screwing eventually makes the episode great - it's killed!
