Chesti gringo Telli Savalas (like Frank Cooper) is an American-Mexican "border police officer". He serves as a father for a young immigrant Danny De La Paz (like Benny Romero), who wants to be a gentleman. Savalas is the best man on the upcoming wedding. Savalas is tough, but boss Eddie Albert (as commander Moffat) may be tougher. It is difficult what is needed to stop the smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (as Chico Suarez). Associations can be in progress. If you find the opportunity to hear "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" speak the conversation to be defensive, you should stay away from the "Border". If not, you may not have a stomach for the "real" cow slaughter scene. Although it does not do much, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (like Leina) steal the show. ** The Border (1979) Toni Richardson ~ Telli Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
