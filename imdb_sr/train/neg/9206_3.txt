The subject is quite dated today. Customized for TV from Rone Jaffe; We travel and storm through the fantasy existence. Four students are deeply involved in the live version of Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deeply. His co-players have to help him save him and save him from damage. Support for actors include veterans such as Murrai Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. But the peak of seeing is Tom Hanks's view between the day of the Bosom Buddies salad and his big influx into SPLASH on a silver screen. The youngest viewer will get the most enjoyment.
