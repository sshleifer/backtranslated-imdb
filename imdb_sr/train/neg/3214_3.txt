First of all, I want to tell you that I am in comics, anime, animation and similar things. It's true that everyone has their preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I'll be objective. For starters, that's fine. We follow the story line of comic books as I've met them. But the animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and central. It would be much better not to try to imitate the anime style and to stick to the original comic book drawings. If we pretend not to see a few unhealthy effects like fire and lightning, you could say that the film was made 10 years ago and even more. It looks a bit like the original vampire hunter D from 1985. See Heavi Metal FAKK 2000 for example - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks much better! In addition, voice talents do nothing special, music is nothing special. All in all - the atmosphere is lacking. I looked at him, but I can not say I really enjoyed it. It just does not catch you. It has a lot of blood and violence, but it does not impress me at all. Perhaps it will be shocking for someone who has never watched mature-oriented animations, and for the first time sees animated blood (is there someone nearby?), But I do not think this is an audience for this movie. So they could add a little nudity and spice it. Chickens around Lucifer were pretty tasty, and hell, we have Ladi Death! She has some sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brovna's music, I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavi metal soundtrack. All in all - the film is not so bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavi Metal, Heavi Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi Fire and Ice or the Wizards maybe. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
