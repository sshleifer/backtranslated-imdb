The return to the cabin next to the lake was just ... missing. He must have had a very low budget because a lot of the film had to be filmed with a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you will have some snapshots of a high-quality movie camera and simple snapshots of your camcorder. It's a very weird mixing! I think they should have figured out some way of not doing the "home video" effect! I think it's worth seeing it if you've seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you did not see the original CBTL .... you will never want to see it if you first see this! It will probably look too sour to you and distract you from the care of the original.
