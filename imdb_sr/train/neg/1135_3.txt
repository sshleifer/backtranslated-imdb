I did not read the biography of Lincoln, so maybe this was a precise view ... Maybe it's because I'm used to an equally alienating and unrealistic worship of portraits that were unnatural. Lincoln is a brilliant, honorable and savior of our country ... But why would you make a movie that represents Lincoln as a madman? While Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln, his portrait of him as "av shucks, I'm just a plain guy" looked a little insulting. It was allowed, it was Bushie Jr. campaigns, to make us think that it is "just an ordinary guy", so we would not care that he is a rich and privileged moron - but that's quite another story.) Not only that a film shot shows that Lincoln is a kind of simple (almost simple) type, the film says that Lincoln just somehow fell right into the right by accident, and that he was not so interested in law - only with a false simplified idea of ​​law on rights and injustices. In the film he is not a very good defense attorney (lying on his feet on the table and ridiculing witnesses), and the outcome is mostly determined by coincidence / happiness. Moreover, partly because it was financed by the Republicans (as a reaction to a game sponsored by the democrats that emerged), and partly because it was only a sense of time, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative. Do not waste time on this movie!
