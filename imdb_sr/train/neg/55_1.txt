There are only two films I would give 1/10, this stinker and "The Man Who Fell to Earth". I remember seeing a protocol in a theater in the early eighties when I was in high school. The script is offensive to anyone (including high school students). He completely lost me with the "hilarial" momentum somebody shot at the ass. Goldie Havn should be charming, but encounters nonsense and stupidity. Then there are offensive stereotypes about the Arabs, after which Goldie wins over everyone, leaving the populist dribbling. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Havn. I could not stand to see another movie she was in, until the IMO got off in "Everybody says I love you". This is a movie you make if you do not want to make the effort to write a script. The worst.
