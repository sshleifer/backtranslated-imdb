Given that I wanted to pick up a new Jet Li movie to see some other, but not meaningless hand-to-hand combat, I captured this title. Unfortunately, this film contains more battles with a gun (al Chov Iun Fat but nowhere near), than Jet Li and the company's acrobatic fight. That's how it was descending. Fighting the faucet was interesting and even funny, given that it was something unexpected in the Jet Li film for me, more on the line, say, Jackie Chan. > Unfortunately I would recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master, or even Enforcer over this disappointment. Rating 4 for martial arts Score 3 for overall movie rating
