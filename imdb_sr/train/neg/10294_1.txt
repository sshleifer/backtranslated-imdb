Nothing happens. Then the characters without personalities are not developing. Then the end never comes because there is no beginning nor the middle. There are beautiful shots that are not made beautiful because they are not allowed to be, because this film is NOT CHAK. There is no "yes" in this movie because there are no complications or characters or topics or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialogue or points. There is nothing! There is a good thing: it has a good soundtrack. But, editing sound is such and the movie is such that viewing is not worth your time, so if you're really interested, I suggest you buy a soundtrack or something like that. You will get everything you can from this movie without fatigue, headache and impatience. <br /> <br /> - PolarDiB
