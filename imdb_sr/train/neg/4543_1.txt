I read the book and the book was fascinating. This film, direction, script and acting were totally unbearable. I ignored the lack of scenarios that could not be followed by a novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity and courage to illustrate the courage of a great possible story. why this film was not published to the general public in most cities. I would never recommend this movie to anyone I know. Simple, one of the worst adaptations I've seen has flowed into the action of lesser exploration of paradise on earth. But, in order for it to collapse when you shoot in a beautiful country like Peru. For future viewers, do not waste time and energy on this flop.
