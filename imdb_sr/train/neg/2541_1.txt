I've never seen the original movie in the series ... I just hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel of the 1980s, as if it was not that these two horrible sequels were justified. This film had a good track when it was advertised and displayed on one of those old independent stations that are now in the past. In any case, it seemed to be a pretty terrifying film. It was, however, a film that would make some films from Walt Disney a dark one. Really, this film was just a bunch of light smoke with almost no creature of the rich stream. The only real sight is at the end when you see his shape during very heavy rains, except that there are practically no signs of a creature that was really disappointing as a child. The story is essentially that the old evil hunters must kill everything they see and after the goddess is a creature of the stream and the children go out to help her, or just some random hairy guy in the woods who likes to pull the random boats through the water. It's not worth watching, but I'd like to see an original, awarded to a producer who would make a bad goddess creature of the 80s, but he also made a very good movie in the 70's "The Tovn Dreaded Sundown".
