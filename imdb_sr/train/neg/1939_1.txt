Come on! Finish with guys from Pakistan. Bollivood can not only make brilliant movies - it can seriously affect the generation of viewers. Sequences - everything. I'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border reject propaganda, and there are also movies like Main Hoon which they did great not just because they earned it. because of the quality of his Bollivood massage - but also because he is trying to say: give peace a chance and show that there are madmen on both sides that do not represent the masses.
