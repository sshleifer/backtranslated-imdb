I was completely amped to see this movie. I waited a year to settle in New Zealand. I did not have to build that much, because it was so disappointing and undoubtedly Clark's worst movie. First, let the acting be great, especially Nick Stahl like 'The Bully', and a girl with curly brown hair (I can not think of her name), but most were so rude and incredibly incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of Clark's films now and was so brilliant at Kids, but in Bully he's investing his lines with such seriousness to virtually turn his scenes into parody. The script felt like it was written by a student of the first year of the film. I'm not sorry, high school ... one who has never seen a movie before. And I could not understand Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaningless existence of these children? He certainly did not prevent him from entering the damn good pervert. I'm not rude, but I did not have to see teenagers' breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still think Clark's best film is 'Second Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I do not think it'll ever surpass it.
