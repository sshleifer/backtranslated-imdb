James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to the "mental health institution" for a medical residency task with dr. McCort (Bruce Paines). There, he realizes that many internists kill 'The Ripper', which leads their souls to the devil, in a cult promoting Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and imbecile that it's impossible to write an abstract. Dialogues are so funny, especially when Helen, a blonde believer of James Bishop, arrives in asylum, it's almost unbelievable that the writer had the courage to include them in the script. And what about the return of James to the hospital to bring files of dead patients? And actors, made up of actors and actresses? Frankly, I do not know what or who is the worst in this movie: a script, a director or an actor. The correct answer is certainly all of them. I saw this movie on cable television and am amazed that the manufacturer can spend money in such garbage. This horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurdity of the action. My voice is three. Title (Brazil): 'Demonio' ​​('Devil')
