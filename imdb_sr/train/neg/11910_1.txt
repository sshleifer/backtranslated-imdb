What is interesting is that acting; It was not bad, it just was not enough. It was pretty lame, special effects and lines were not the only culprit for this failure. Standing alone, they were not terribly bad, but together they were a tragic move. The show seemed long and slow with special effects that were obviously designed to speed up the film, but that did not work out. they were cold. Appleby was not the best choice for this venture. Although it may have been all they had to choose with little fan recognition. An experienced actress would bring something in the role, as Appleby never did. Scfi puts some really good original movies, a shame that it's drastically gone.
