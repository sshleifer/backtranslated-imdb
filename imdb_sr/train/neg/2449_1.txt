Bashki should be congratulated for trying to turn one of the great pieces of English fiction into a movie, and then he scoffed at this attempt. The animation was bad, the characters looked funny, the music was mostly blink, and the film was a smelly flash through the first book and half of Tolkien's masterpiece. I still remember my pure disappointment and contempt for the movie when I first saw him. Now I realize that every attempt to turn the book into a movie must collapse in many ways, simply because of the media, but this film, regardless of the source of the story, is simply obvious. Basque is capable of much more.
