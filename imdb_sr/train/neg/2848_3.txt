... so I thought I would say a few words about Villiam McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend a few hours if you want to see it in his taut things - it's obvious that he pumped for this role and looks pretty good in them - or less. There is a wider sequence in the cave where it has to be removed to the lower body. There is a beautiful thing in which Eleniak must run into a shirt, and her hands are covered over the hips. Villiam McNamara is naturally small on the skinny side, but has a nice, generous hand of prey. Also, there is a moment when you get out of the bed so that if you stop the action at the right moment you can see the entire enchilade. If you are inclined to do it, and come, half of the people who decide to watch the movie about the navy on a "trip" are. I would like to thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity. Will Villam McNamara work? Damn, if I know.
