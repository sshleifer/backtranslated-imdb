I must admit that through her dead body was not really as bad as I expected, my mom wanted to see him, so I rented him. I just thought to see horror in front of my eyes, but in fact it was not bad. I just expected this horrible movie, but it seems the writers did not want to harm, but it seems that the casting of Eve Longoria (Parker, sorry) is a bit distanced for the film. I think I may have found it a little better without it, only that it irritates me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had decent chemistry that made the film a little more sympathetic. But you have to admit that it was not the purpose to watch this movie, it was one of those fast pay for the acting type of things. The movie might be more entertaining if someone really paid attention to it and had a better bet. . But when his sister takes him to the psychic, Ashleigh, Henry falls on her, but Kate is chasing her from the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry moving so fast and she will make sure that Ashley does not catch him by torturing her day and night with her disorder, believe me, with Kate's voice, that's terrible. Through her dead body is a fine movie, it's not sure if it's worth the money, but I'd let you rent it if you want to see it or you're curious. Eva Longoria simply does not have enough strength to make a movie, without offending her fans, she just belongs to a small screen over the silver screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, she does not seem to be too cute about everything she's pulling, or her "gay" friend, Dana, again, is not very sympathetic. Only with some rewriting and proper attention, this film could have been better, but instead we get an average predictable romantic comedy that will leave an empty feeling. 4/10
