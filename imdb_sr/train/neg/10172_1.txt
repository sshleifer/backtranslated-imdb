When I noticed that Noah Vile and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like a result! I admit, I was eager to watch a movie. And I have to say, the first fifteen minutes in a way. Then everything went downhill. I did not expect that this would be an obstacle to politically correct civil rights. They took every possible controversial topic and threw it into a stupid story. I was amazed that Noah was involved in something similar, especially in his role. No one with a fully functional brain would have accepted all that shit about the Vietnam War. If someone wants to know how communism is, sit and read a book about it. And not the one who praises it or is against it, only cold solid facts. . Everything else about this movie has irritated me.
