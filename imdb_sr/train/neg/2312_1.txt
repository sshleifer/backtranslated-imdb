This is one of those films where I liked that I just stayed at the bar. The film is quite boring. What a story is very weak, and you are guessing. The film is left with pretentious camera techniques that seem intended to cause migraines and make it look like a student film. Did I say it's already boring? If all the characters suddenly died at the end of the film, I would not care less because I had no emotional attachment to any of them. In this film there are about 4 good minutes, but there was about it. This is the first time I ever thought about going out of the cinema during the show, but I kept thinking that it must be better. I was wrong. The kind of movie that you could endanger the innocent children.
