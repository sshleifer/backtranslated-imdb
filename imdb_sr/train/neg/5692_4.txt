A disappointing action movie with an interesting assumption: a young mafia killer (Chandler) must show the boss that he is a good man for the service and then goes to California to attend lessons with a famous professional killer Beluschi). The first and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee) which is completely strange to all of them. But is it an easy target? The film continues and is based on this main idea, but the result is only a bad routine; even a strange craft eventually does not keep the movie. Good performance by Chandler. I give this 4 (four).
