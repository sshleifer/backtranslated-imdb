I wanted to love this movie, but many elements destroyed it. The use of fisheye lenses as a whole and turbulent editing did not give me the feeling that I was the world's forehead head, but it made me think that I was watching MTV for a few moments. The film never seemed to go anywhere and the acting was a really great example of over-acting. I love movies that give us insight into the congested underground world, but this film could not decide whether it was a bad horor movie or even a more serious commentary on the horrors of addiction.
