Before this started for a TV movie, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was made after the last episode of the series was broadcast and many of the originals in the series were gone. There are no Presidents of Sheridan, Delenna, Lennier, Londa, Vira, Gkar or Lite. If you remember, in the second to last episode of the series, all regular ones, except for Zack, Vir and Captain Locklee, left the B-5 permanently. Now Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 film) returned to this film to join Zack, and the captain and doctor gave a short and unimportant look. But since so much has disappeared from old chemistry, this film is already seriously handicapped. The film is about a soul hunter (Martin Sheen) who was brought to Babylon 5 in search of a globally filled soul that the archaeologist steals from a hidden repository (Ian McShane). A lot of spooky mumbo-jumbo things are happening, but honestly, everything was pretty stupid and meaningless. Yes, yes, the station almost exploded, but it was saved and everything, but honestly, I felt like it was the case - and it did much better in the past. Secondary plot, provided more for comic relief, was much more interesting because the entrepreneur installed the holo-brothel, and those who commanded were not sure what to do and when they tried to force them to They were slaughtered with a lawsuit. This was hairy, but that made a few laughs - something that was certainly missing from other suspicious complications. eyes and bizarre delivery. However, on several occasions during the episode, he turned out to be a character. This should have been spotted and corrected. So, the final judgment is only for the totally harsh B-5 nuts (like me). Others see that this series could be sucked-what a big injustice is. This is a great example of the performance not knowing when to give up.
