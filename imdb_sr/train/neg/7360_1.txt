This is one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is especially due to factual incredibility (as is an obvious agent who presents himself as a bank loan officer, and it is obvious that he is talking to someone through a wire or place where scientists assume it is safe to enter the room in which the Virus was released although it 'did not find sustainable host "does not mean that they will never find it), cheap sets (the bank looks like it's badly designed to resemble the dungeon), and bad acting. It's a story of an organized criminal group that successfully stole the deadly virus capsule. However, the boss who decides to remove him from the bank account, does so at the same time when the bank's looting falls, with FBI agents being notified of it, and at the same time a terrible earthquake arose. . Needless to say, the consequence of the earthquake is disorderly in many ways. However, the results do not represent a daring action movie, but one that has obviously been Z-grade since the beginning of the film. (Perhaps this is why some of the screen shots on the packaging look like computer graphics, not real screenshots from different movie sequences). What is Ron Perlman doing in this, I have no idea. I wonder if it was embarrassing for him to be in him as I did.
