A really terrible film shot by cameraman and director Ted Tetzlaff. A fairly decent movie, but for a time bomb movie, it's totally devoid of any tension. Ford, as somebody put it here, sleeps, although this with its characteristic smile. There are some details that were thrown - the Canadian former army or RAF, destroyed the bombs in the war, his wife is leaving him - but none of these stories are added. The bomber himself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? In this regard, what time period are we talking about? VVII or fast? I have assumed that this is another thing that makes the bomber's motif even more visible. Generally, however, it's just a horrible movie. There are many good weather bombs to skip this. Take a look at any episode of "Danger of UKSB" for even more exciting times, at about the same time.
