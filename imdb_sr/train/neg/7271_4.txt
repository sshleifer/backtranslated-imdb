This could have been a gay couple Gone Vith The Vind who got his epic length, but instead he was content with having been a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing happens. The characters are uni-dimensional and have no other development in the story (actually there are no stories) than looking for each other and kissing. It is a shame that an interesting aesthetic assumption, like almost no dialogue, is completely lost in the film, rather than trying to examine the psychology of its characters with some dignity, and to achieve a true emotional resonance. Moreover, it turns out to be an "artistic" film using the worst naive clich√©s of film snobbery. In any case, if one can identify with his heavy banality, I suppose that's okay.
