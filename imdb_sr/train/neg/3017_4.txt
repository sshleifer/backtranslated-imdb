Now I had the best intentions when I looked at this. I love some works by Tony Scott, and my friend told me it was a great movie, although I otherwise heard from other people. But it was simply hopeless. In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was too busy. It was all too much. Let me explain. Miss Knightley has outsmarted, and not in a good way. The people who performed well were Mickei Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Valken, but their time on the screen could not save the movie. There were several scenes that jumped out in their originality, but somehow it seemed that they were written by someone else, not by the main writer. A certain melody was used about 4 times, which really started to sin after another time. I firmly believe that I do not use the same melody several times. Also, the editing has really expired, because the cutting speed is quite high. Oh, and the repeated echoing of some of Keir's lines simply sounded syrusly after they heard it the second, third, fourth time, and so on. Basically, my opinion is that if you want to look at the action that is fun and "a bit" ridiculous, and you do not worry about everything I mentioned above, you may like it. (On the note page: I'm not a fan of Keire Knightley.)
