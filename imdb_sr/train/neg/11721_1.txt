This film was terrible. The scenario is completely unrealistic, but it is written that it is happening in the real world, editing and light effects are worse than most of the first projects in the film school. This film I do not recommend to anyone: A) knows every detail about the world of police or secret operations. B) knows every detail about filming or appreciation. I recommend this film to an average or below-average mind, I think it would be nice to be dumb. If you need to watch this full-length movie, I strongly recommend some sort of drunkard. It's a complete waste of what has little production value.
