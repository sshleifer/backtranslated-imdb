The badly-made criminal drama "exploitation" was directed at the black urban market in the early 1970s. Pam Grier plays in the lead role, a sister who becomes an avenger for a woman after drug addicts make Coffi a young nurse addict. Violent nonsense persists, with energy and excitement; only Grier's flame temperament gives the narrative an earthquake (it's not exactly an actress here, but it connects with the audience in the primary way). He did not differ much from what Charles Bronson was doing at the moment, the film was sold and advertised as useless exploitation, but he managed to find the audience inside the city. Today, however, it is just a footnote in the film history of the seventies, and lacks a wide array of other films in this genre. * 1/2 of ****
