UPA's films are surprisingly well rated on the IMDb, despite the fact that the quality of the animation of light years behind those Loonei Toons, Disnei and MGM is at its peak. Unfortunately, UPA style (which debuted around 1950) began to dominate in the late 1950s and 1960s due to the growing cost of producing beautiful cartoons with high frames and beautiful backgrounds. After all, the films were cheap to produce and won several Oscars to "prove" that cartoons are now mainstream. As a result, poor animation has become a norm and this trend has not changed until the 1980s. This UPA film is one of the first. The characters are very simply drawn (any simpler and they would use clips), and the background was ugly - simple drawings with colors added in a very spy mode (often with a sponge and a rare full filling of objects). As for the story, it's a story with a strong jazz style. Some will love this, others will find it very, very loud. It's a traditional story "Frankie and Johnny," and because of shooting and all this, it's probably not a good movie for kids. Hell, for animation and jazz, for me it's not a particularly good movie! Some will read my review and without a doubt I think I'm a cake (as I am, to a certain degree). However, I love animated films and a bit of this minimalistic UPA style goes very, very long and you can not seriously consider them as great artwork. Ignore Oscar and try to watch some classic cartoons or something!
