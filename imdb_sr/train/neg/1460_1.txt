If another Hitler appears, it will be thanks to partly absurdity such as this film, which propagates the absurd idea that from the beginning it was a visibly disturbed lunatic. Far from being followed by such a person and choosing him to the highest position in the country, healthy people would cross the street to escape him, and he would die in a ditch, anonymous and unknown. Anyone reading Hitler's close companions - for example, the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge - will be affected by the fact that people find him a kind, intelligent, generous man. He was also a brilliant speaker, and the fact that his speeches seem exaggerated and portrayed by modern ears neglects the time in which they occurred, when political speech was commonplace. Likewise, overemphasized anti-Semitism, which was not even the central plate of the early Nazis - who were primarily anti-communist - were neither unusual nor unusual for those times. The film seems to look like Hitler's only ambition from the very beginning was the Holocaust. If you want to identify the next person that will cause the death of tens of millions, you can ignore the flea-lips of the raving life shown here. Instead, look at a charming, charismatic man whose impressive speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country. I'm afraid his personality will be much more like Barack Obama than Fred Phelps. I was hoping for a lot here, and I only got a caricature. The fools who did this act committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of 'Reefer Madness'.
