the loss of my life, ... the director should be confused. Why people feel they need to make junk films will never make sense to me. When she died at the end, I laughed. I had to change the channel many times during the entire film because I was confused watching such a bad acting. I hope the guy who played Heath never works anymore. In addition, I hope that the director will never record another film, and that he will pay back his salary. {.02 of 10}
