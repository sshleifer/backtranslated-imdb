Working comedy has I.R.S. agent Toni Randall explores an eccentric family farm in Mariland that has never paid its taxes; Debbie Reinolds is a daughter of a peasant farmer who puts pressure on not so disinterested taxpayers.

Bates, with a bad sound mix that all actors sound like they're stuck in the echo chamber. ** from the ****
