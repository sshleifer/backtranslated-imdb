I think they really allow the quality of DVD production to escape from them. I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores, and the second time I finally got it on the third DVD player I tried. Anyone else has this problem? It's very difficult to give the movie an impartial review after you go through such a hassle to play it. First, I never saw a Finnish horror movie, so I was kind of confused about the film in English. Also, since it was never clear what was wrong with Sarah, she just came out as retarded, and that's why I really hoped to shoot someone in the face and make all terrible events disappear.
