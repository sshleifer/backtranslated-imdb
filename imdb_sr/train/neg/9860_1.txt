I usually enjoy these films. Documentary style was shot, but acting and writing are just terrible. The acting is wooden and stiff, and writing is so cliché, but not in a good way. As far as typing is concerned, I'm surprised at 5.2 / 10 on the IMDb. I am sure that most of these votes came from relatives of people in the film. I guess, if that's the case, you can laugh, because it's always funny to watch cousins ​​/ friends movies. Well, in a way, I suppose this gives hope to all writers, directors, actors, etc., because if they can, you can do it. Although, maybe it should not.
