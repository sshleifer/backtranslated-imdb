* SPOILERS * I'm sure that, when this was published in 1958, it was much more convenient for its time. Then the movies were slower to enable the audience to follow and analyze the story. Here, the man moves into the house of his latest wife who mysteriously died with her new wife. Vrtlar Mickei (played by Alec Nicol, who directed the film) is really an underrated character. He gets the skull to indirectly warn Jennies that he is in trouble because he knew that the first wife had a violation. She can not directly tell Jenni what happened, so she's trying to scare her with a skull. Jenni, we also found out, saw her parents die, which caused a lifelong mental pain that led to institutionalization. Like many audiences today, I discovered that pacing is a bit slow for my tastes. But if you love slower horror without much worse, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
