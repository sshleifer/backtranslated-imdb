I'm usually inclined to love low-budget gonzo movies, but Darkman III is so amazing that I do not feel anything but contempt for it. It looks and feels like TV shows, and especially bad. one on it. The sets are rare, lighting, the result and the effects are fragmented, and the work on the camera is the film school 101. There is no complication to speak, the characters are one-dimensional, and the actors are in the moonlight. Most actors seem to be doing soft pornography ..... In fact, the only reward I got from this mess is the notion of a stunning mess with Rokann Biggs-Davson (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voiager) without any clinging nonsense on head. Her skin tone is about two shades lighter than in Voiager; or is bleached due to this role, or is obscured by Voiager. Very weird.
