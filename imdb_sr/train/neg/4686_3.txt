There were good performances by Robin Villiams and others, but the film was boring and very disappointing in relation to positive reviews. I thought you could become a serial killer that bites people to death: an unhappy guy in ugly clothes is following the victims around the food courts, citing Oprah and reciting his medical history until he is asked to shoot them. I expect most retailers want a break from customers.
