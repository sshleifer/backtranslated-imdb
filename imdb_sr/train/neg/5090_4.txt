Whether an indictment was intentional must be taken into account. If in 2000 there was still a breakdown between Caucasian and African Americans in Georgia, as shown in this film, it is obvious that there is still a somewhat disadvantaged mentality among many people who are there. It is hypocritical, at least if everyone is admired by Halle Berry, Vhoopie Goldberg, Beionce, Noemi Campbell, Denzel Washington, Vill Smith and others. al., while there are still obvious racial divisions in the back. The white grandmother suddenly pulled a black grandchild at her, just to meet a black grandfather in a very white social hinterland. The story is cute, there are no traces of tragedy, but most predictable as in most of these kind of TV films, although you have hit the last scene ............ will it? Gene Rovlands in its typical style offers sincere rendering, and Louis Gossett is a good choice for her; Little Penny Bae happily does not steal the show. "Nice" way of relaxing after a Sunday lunch, without having to force your mind too much, although you may find yourself relaxing in the middle of it.
