When your childhood memory tells you this was a terrifying film; It's a touch and it's going to look at it again. In any case, I remembered the scary scene where the homeless and cool villain played by Jeff Coober took part. The "First Force" is not a very good movie, it's sad to say. It's a lot of those police clich√©s and a very bad script with holes through which the truck could pass (along with countless hands-on "turns" that help the story). Lou Diamond Phillips is an overly secure police officer who sends the badby serial killer Cobra to the gas chamber only to find out that he is a single solitary confidant and now has the power of resurrection together with the power of possession of every weak person he encounters. Through a mixture, a very poorly understood psychic that helps in the case. Ahhh, this is garbage. But comfortable as such, especially if you have memories of it. She scared me like a child and this scene with the homeless is still pretty good. Regarding any logic here; Forget about it, almost every script is cast for a good measure and you end up with a cross between the Action film Steven Segala and the demonic mirror of the 70s. And who on earth thought that it was a good idea for Lou Diamond Phillips to surrender here? Needless to say that he is not convinced at all, but he is trying his best and I never had a problem with the type so many reviewers here. As far as Tracy Griffith is concerned as a psychic, the less is better. But Kober is pretty good as a killer; He always liked that actor. The "First Force" can be exactly what the doctor ordered after a busy working day and it is necessary to "switch off the brain". Beer will most likely improve the viewing experience and I will definitely have a lot more time next time when I turn this movie around. All in all; not a good move, but somewhat responsible for enjoying nostalgic fans who were terrified of children. "See you, buddy!"
