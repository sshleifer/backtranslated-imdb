The problem with this movie is that it was shot at the worst possible camera and the movie is muddy and grainy. Perhaps it is just a fact that the one who held the camera could not stand it because it had an attack or something like that. And in this movie there is too much exhaustion and vomiting. Someone vows every twenty minutes and it seems to me that this is done by some bulimies or something else. It was disgusting. Then there is an embarrassing scream that continues and continues, but does not stop until the credits appear. I also did not like when all of her friends were shot (or I do not know) and she goes to the van and puts bands on the accessories. It was really really stupid to have that in the movie at all. How much gas can a person siphon to pick up a van? It must be a lot because they do not remain without gas for the rest of the film. It was a horrible movie and I would suggest that you will never see it throughout your life.
