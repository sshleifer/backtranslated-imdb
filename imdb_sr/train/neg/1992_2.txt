Do not let this movie deceive you, In reality, Jake Speed ​​is probably the lazy action hero ever known in the movie. When Jake Speed ​​does not save innocent girls from evil lunatics, which often is not, seriously relaxing. Perhaps this additionally contributes to his charm, but in my opinion, the action hero should not "cool" whenever he gets a chance. Moreover, unlike other brave heros who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has none, unless of course you call the sleeping talent. In any case, this film is essentially worthless, writing is supportive, and the action, when it is there, is very chromatic. (The machine guns on the jeep were not bad, but that's all) So, if you're willing to watch a movie that's a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - there's a hero who not only sleeps, but his audience.
