With interest, I read Rice's novel and became enchanted with her characters and a heartbreaking story based on historical truths. However, I simply LOGIN this catastrophic adaptation. Casting was based solely on the physical appearance, not on the actor's talent (with the apparent exception of Peter Galager, who was neither blond nor capable of getting out of the wet paper bag). The awkwardly clumsy and inconsistent attempts of actors to influence the French accent were ridiculous, but not funny. I found myself breaking through this confused and melodramatic burst, and I was surprised that I got to the end. Warning for fans of the novel - go away from this.
