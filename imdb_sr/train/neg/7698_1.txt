Can I give this a minus rating? Not? Well, let me tell you this is the most cruel film I have ever tried to watch. It was painful. Boringus Makimus. Plot (?) Is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. I rented this film with a friend and, after thirty minutes of hope that it would be better, we decided to "rewind" a bit to see if things would improve. It never repairs itself. This movie about some guys who took these two girls sounds interesting, but in reality it's just boredom. Nothing interesting ever happens. If you ever get the chance to look at this, do yourself a favor, instead try to "PLANNATE A NINE FROM A OUTER SPACE".
