I suppose this would be a great movie for a true believer in an organized Christian dogma, but for anyone who has an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, separation of Church and State and GOOD science fiction, this is a terrible joke! There are some well-known actors who either have a need for work or have had the need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of our wicked ones. In the same way I was entertained by "Reefer Madness". This film attempted to teach drug education through intimidation tactics in the same way that this film attempts to teach "Christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who do not share their interpretations of our world. It brushed me with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people really believe that our society should return to the good old days of the 19th century!
