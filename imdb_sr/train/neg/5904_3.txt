With the success of "God's army," every mormon with the camera is now trying to make a movie. In the case of the recent "Other Side of the Sky," it was not at all bad. This film, although not good, was pretty good. "The Singles Vard", however, is not. Speaking of the story of a young, divorced Mormon type who returns to life, the style of writing and recording The Singles Vard is, in many ways, very similar to the comedy of the 80's "Ferris Bueller's Dai Off ". However, similarities end there. While "Ferris Bueller" was ridiculous, original and well-behaved (as for stupid comedies), "The Singles Vard" is completely opposite. Trying to be funny. However, 90% of the drops or drops are clich√©s and jokes that you probably heard a million times before. The remaining 10% seem to be thrown to fill the time. And acting, although not terrible, is at best amateurish. Besides, if you are not even the Mormons themselves, or very, very familiar to Mormon culture, you will not get anything. at all. While the "God's army" and "The Other Side of the Sky" were appealing to a wide audience, both inside and outside the Mormon Church, this movie is definitely one big inner joke, and even if you get it, it's just not so funny.
